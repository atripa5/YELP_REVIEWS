The fish tacos were  slightly stinky. I do know Mahi can&#39;t be slightly stinky, but I don&#39;t like when it&#39;s so stinky. I know it is a smelly fish but when it&#39;s  a little too strong, you know it might be sitting for a minute.  
I had my roommate and my daughter taste it and they decided it was just as yucky as I did.  Another option that I love is my Vegan Americano coffee. So delicious!  If you order wine; understand that it&#39;s carbonated and comes from the tap.  

Side order of chipotle hash potatoes are amazing and go very well with the V burger.  

All in all, the restaurant is exciting to me and I hope their ratings get better and improve and get rid of the fish stinky tacos. I would love it there were more restaurants like this and closer to my home. What I mean is  more  health-conscious restaurants."

We&#39;ve come here monthly since they opened, and 90% of the time they either screw up our orders (badly), or it&#39;s an awful delay. Tonight we arrived at 1820mst, and received our food at 1920mst. Waiting an hour at a &#34;healthy fast food&#34; restaurant is unacceptable. 100% unacceptable.

Casein Free- Yes, dish specific

So freaking glad to find a LYFE franchise in the Park Meadows area

Why I&#39;m a fan of this franchise:

+ A healthier option when traveling. Calories are listed next to each item.

+ Quick service. Take out or dine in

+ Menu notes which items are  Gluten Free (GF), Vegan (V), and/or Contains Nuts (N)

+ Expenses/budget friendly. Although, it is quite easy to rack up a high bill depending upon how many items you start adding


Tip:

** This location is located in the the mall."

Everything on the menu is flavorful and tasty. I love how you know exactly what is in your food. The ingredients are always fresh. My only complaint is that they stopped breakfast on weekdays and don&#39;t open as early. The breakfast burrito is so delicious I would eat it every single day if I could! My favorite items are the salmon, brussels and squash, unfried chicken, patty melt (not the most healthy menu item), kale Caesar, and the chocolate budino! Last but not least, the item I order almost once a week is the quinoa crunch bowl!! It is SUCH a good way to get a lot of vegetables in. I absolutely love it. I sometimes add the garlic lime tofu (which is the best tofu I&#39;ve ever had). I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place."

I read some other reviews and wasn&#39;t fully sure why people gave this place any less than a 5 star.

Although it can be pricey, you pay for what you get. Good quality ingredients that will be nutritious for your body.

I got the unfried buffalo chicken salad. Sooooo good!

I loved the food very healthy and lots of accommodating choices for gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, and just healthy. All the calories are listed as well as sodium.  But today we went for breakfast when they opened at 10 and were told that they didn&#39;t serve breakfast during the week days, breakfast was on weekends only. I told the lady their website did NOT inform me on that since it just said breakfast. First problem is why does it not say weekends only, second problem call it brunch if it&#39;s not till 10 on weekends, and third problem why do they open at 10 and cannot serve 5 choice of breakfast items ?? The breakfast menu is not even large to start out with and all the items on the menu can be made in less than 10 minutes. This is honestly just ridiculous to me because we come somewhere expecting breakfast and were told it&#39;s only served on weekends at that location but some locations serve it on week days. This was a huge disappointment. 

The last time I was there I did enjoy the veggie burger and chipotle sauce as well as the chipotle potato hash. I look forward to trying more next time, even though this was a ridiculous experience."

Service is fantastic. If you like vegetarian and you&#39;re gluten free you have several options here. They have the all green, earthy kinda look. Usually people assume that means all organic and non-gmo. But it&#39;s not necessary the case. I searched their website and wasn&#39;t able to find any information. I asked and was told they try to do all organic. That can mean 40% or 80% so who knows. I&#39;m all about healthy, fresh and organic food.

This specific location has fresh herbs growing not too far from the front counter and all the food is made fresh. You order as you walk in, grab napkins and silverware on your way to a table, and the food is delivered straight to you once its done. The restaurant itself has a very spacious feel with a welcoming atmosphere! 

Everything I ordered (the chicken kale soup and fish tacos) were flavorful and I was impressed with how all of the dishes were seasoned well without extra salt. The food is also decently priced for a hearty serving, since I was happily full for a couple of hours afterwards. It did take some time for my order to make it out to my table but the employee that delivered it was courteous and wished me a good meal.

The food was delicious.  Every dish tasted like it was created with careful consideration of ingredients and flavor.  The Chicken Penne was excellent and served at a perfect temperature.

I have been looking for a natural / organic restaurant that offers both meat lovers and vegetarian options.  My daughter and I ate here tonight, and it was horrible.  Customer service - the person at the front register couldn&#39;t tell me the ingredients on the veggie burger (soy? pure vegetables?  rice?) - she kept telling me to look at the menu to see the ingredients.  I did, and it doesn&#39;t have the ingredients.  She finally found out from someone in the kitchen, but I felt like I was asking for the world.  I ordered a very well done cheeseburger for my daughter - asked three times that it be very well done.  As sides, we ordered the sweet potato fries and the broccoli &amp; snap peas.

On a side note, I don&#39;t really get their serving philosophy.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s more efficient for the customer to place the order, sit down and wait.  But, I saw a ton of employees just sitting around and gossiping.  Being here with a toddler (or anywhere) can be tough, and I&#39;d rather that there are people walking around offering water, checking in to see if things are ok, etc.  They bring your food and then you never see anyone ever again.

Onto the food:

veggie burger (which is bean and rice based, btw) - burned to a crisp.  It was definitely crunchy, but had that burnt taste.  The onions on it were almost overripe / wilted / moldy?, and it was all put together like a picasso painting.

sweet potato fries - soggy when bite into, then raw!  Yes, raw!  They came out in a limp pile.  When I bit into one, it tasted like I ate a sweet potato like an apple.  Gross.

Farmhouse cheeseburger - it was raw in the middle when I asked for well done three times.  And, the patty appeared to be premade and frozen.  This wasn&#39;t a freshly made burger.  Like the veggie burger, the assembly of it was pretty awful.  

Broccoli &amp; snap peas - raw.  Now, this may have been intentional, so I can&#39;t knock them too much.  But after you&#39;ve eaten the above, and you bit into raw broccoli (which is oddly warm, which makes me believe it was undercooked), you throw your hands up in the air and ask to speak to someone...buehler?????

Someone finally came to our table.  I told her about the fries and the burger.  To her credit, she asked if we wanted more fries, and I said no.  But when I told her about everything else, she tilted her head, winked and me and said sorry.  Sorry?  I&#39;m not one to complain at restaurants unless it&#39;s absolutely awful.  This was horrific.  No credit offered, no substitutions?  I spent $25 here for dinner, and then I had to go home and make dinner for my toddler.  What a disappointment."

I love the water dispensers and the ambiance, they are beautiful.

The big menu on the wall doesn&#39;t have descriptions of dishes and we hadn&#39;t been here before, so having the cashier offer a menu (which I saw after we had already ordered) I feel would have greatly improved our experience.  They do have still, chilled, and sparkling water available at a self service station, which was nice.

I only have 2 small nits  first is the sweet potatoe fries were not hot, this is a common issue with sweet potatoe fries.  I am not sure why but would guess that it is the moisture content that causes sweet potatoes to cool quicker than regular fries?

The register people are slow, and know barely anything about the menu. Sometimes the food comes out cold, and the most annoying thing is the different portion sizes every time I come.

Great ambiance for fun or business, with the choice of bar or restaurant seating. We opted for a leisurely bar-side lunch and had an all-round excellent experience. Highly professional (and intelligent) staff was helpful in steering us towards house specialties and items that were good for sharing. We tried an assortment of items, at least one selection from each of the appetizer, salad and entree lists and everything was presented beautifully, cooked perfectly and very flavorful.

First they were very short staffed and one girl had been there since 7:30am without a break. (We arrived at 5:30pm) Secondly they were out of about one third of the things we ordered. Are they closing?? If so they should have already done so.

The food at LYFE Kitchen wasn&#39;t just organic and fresh etc., it was quite tasty. 

Wanting to try it all, we had the fish tacos, margherita flat bread, the edamame hummus and their garden burger. Fish tacos were great (though a little small), the margherita flat bread was awesome, the hummus was probably the best out of the bunch, and the Garden burger was kind of dry and unimpressive. For drinks we had the hibiscus beet water and a mocha for me. The hibiscus beet water was kind of weird because, well, it had beets -- but for having beets, it wasn&#39;t that bad (we do not like beets). Mocha was great. 

Kind of costly, but for fresh, organic food, I am willing to pay more. 

I will definitely be back when I am in the area, and you should go, too!"

I can&#39;t remember the last time I left a restaurant feeling as satisfied as I did after eating here. Everything about my visit --staff, service, atmosphere, food-- was all incredible. 

They have separate menus for people who are gluten free, vegan/vegetarian, and omnivore. And, unlike some other places, each menu has a great selection of different types of food. We ordered from the vegetarian menu and were able to find a different starter, entree, and smoothie for each of us. 

The starters were small, but delicious. I especially like the spicey chick&#39;n unfried tenders (seriously they were SO good). The chunky guacamole is delicious as well. 

The entrees were the perfection portion to leave satisfied without having to roll yourself out of the restaurant. I had the garden burger and it was BY FAR my favorite vegetarian burger I have had anywhere in Denver. 

The smoothies were also delicious. There were only two options, but they were both unique and very good. You will be hard-pressed to find their flavors elsewhere. I highly recommend ordering one to accommodate your meal. 

The staff, specifically Chanel and Dylann, were incredible. They were so helpful and had my mom and I cracking up. One of the waiters also informed us that they have a great brunch, with live music on Sundays. Needless to say, we will obviously be going back for more.

(They are also opening another location in Boulder in a couple of months. I am SO excited. I would LOVE to see more of these opening everywhere.)"

Fresh ingredients, happy staff, perfect location.  You can&#39;t get into Park Meadows mall without see the huge Lyfe Kitchen sign from the County Line exit.  Inside the mall but visible from the outside, plenty of parking and an outside patio.

Go there for the Tal&#39;s Grain Bowl alone - the four of us raved about it.  Also, Art&#39;s fried chicken - what? Delicious.  Roasted Brussels Sprouts - come on...to die for.  Had the sweet corn chowder - just a touch of fire - again I&#39;d go there just for that.  Topped it off with Chocolate (can&#39;t go wrong here) Budine - pomegranate chia, cha cha cha chia seeds with toasted almonds.  

Catch my drift - healthy And delicious.  Seriously.  Get in there before you need to know the owners to get a seat."

Fresh: All of the ingredients are fresh and healthy. The meals are portion and calorie controlled so you don&#39;t have to worry about how much you eat. Each dish I&#39;ve tried is refreshing and filling. Oh, and the orange ginger chia tea is outstanding!

Fast: Order at the counter and take your seat. The food comes to you. On your way, grab silverware and choose from the water offerings (cold, warm or sparkling, if I remember correctly). 

Friendly: There is always staff available to check on you, bring you what you need and send you off with a smile.

See letter below:

I haven&#39;t been out to eat for quite some time due to Learning about my food allergies and I was told that this would be a great place for me to go.  I was so excited!  I ordered your farmers salad with salmon and avocado and had to exclude some other items and a glass of wine.  Your staff was great about making the changes I needed. 

I received my red wine but it was refrigerated and cold.  The waiter refunded my money and apologized. I then received my salad that was drenched in vinaigrette dressing and had red lettuce in a salad that was suppose to be only arugula.  I was very disappointed, I was going to send it back but it was clear that your restaurant was way too busy.  So I picked through and ate what I could.  My lunch was $30, which I was willing to pay but I left hungry and very disappointed.  I would request that you refund my money."

We were able to see how they were &#39;everyday&#39;. This place is incredibly clean and efficient with the same great healthy food and top notch service. 

Their multiple menus are excellent: eat everything, gluten-free, vegan or wine &amp; beer. Four different menus catered to your own special food restrictions or choices.

I am a huge water drinker and I love that they have such a fabulous water &#39;station&#39;. You can get chilled, ambient (room temp) or sparkling water...all on tap! What a *great* idea. I want one for my home!

The glasses are heavy duty just like their silverware...very nice feel and weight.

The lighting is pleasant where it is not too bright and the place is full of great energy. The music is at just the right volume and the place has an all around light and airy atmosphere.

We will definitely  be back...maybe for their brunch on Sundays, where they have live music on the patio from 10-1."

I have eaten at some of the best organic, natural, and vegan restaurants in the world and I assure you, Lyfe is not on that list. 

For starters, I called ahead to order take out and asked if I they had BBQ sauce. She said &#34;yes&#34;. Then I asked if I  could get BBQ sauce on the burger. She stated &#34;let me see if I can make alterations to that&#34; then came back and stated she could not put BBQ sauce on my burger. Okay, now I&#39;m confused. I asked &#34;you can&#39;t modify your food?&#34; She replied &#34;we can but we can&#39;t put BBQ sauce because we don&#39;t have BBQ sauce&#34;. Ummm? Anyone else think this is already too weird? So I said, &#34;you just said that you do have BBQ sauce&#34; she said, &#34;we don&#39;t, we have djon and romaine.&#34; My response, &#34;romaine is a type of lettuce, not a sauce.&#34; So finally I get my order in and she says it will take 20 minutes. 

40 MINTUES later my husband is still waiting inside for our food. He comes out angry and frustrated and says that a lot of other customers were also pretty upset about the restaurant and the lack of service and options available on the menu. 

Now we open the food and...
1. The order is wrong. 
2. The food is cold. 
3. My son&#39;s kid&#39;s fish taco meal is a small piece of fish on a tortilla with no cabbage or anything else that usually accompanies a fish taco.
4. The burger was terrible, no sauce, no cheese, and none of the &#34;modifications&#34; from the insane conversation I first had with the lady. 
5. The wrap was bland 
6. They only have sweet potato fries which were &#34;blackened&#34; which is a fancy way of saying &#34;burned&#34;
7. They don&#39;t have soda, so we got sparkling water. They put ice in the sparkling water which kills the bubbles and makes flat gross water. 

They don&#39;t have bacon, they don&#39;t have BBQ sauce, they don&#39;t have soda, and as one customer said while my husband was in the restaurant &#34;you don&#39;t have anything to eat here!&#34;

This place is seriously the most pretentious and ridiculous restaurant and we both agreed that our $35 dollar lunch was one of the worst meals we&#39;ve ever had. This is the kind of place where people go to feel like they are eating healthy and smile through the meal, only to leave and get real food after they finish. I wouldn&#39;t eat here again, not for any amount of money. In fact, I would rather skip &#34;Lyfe Kitchen&#34; and have real food, like a bowl of &#34;Life&#34; cereal."

We also had the Art&#39;s Unfried Chicken for $12.99 which came with butternut squash and brussel sprouts.  everything was very good.

We were told by the manager that LYFE&#39;s Executive Chef, Art Smith, used to be Oprah&#39;s personal chef, who was dedicated to creating healthy flavorful dishes.  Even he lost 100lbs by changing his own diet.  Now that I looked up his bio and recognized his face, you may remember him from Top Chef Masters.  Another interesting fact: Executive Chef Jeremy Bringardner, who was at the Pre-Opening Event, won Chopped on Food Network.

This &#34;Eat Good, Feel Good&#34; concept shined through with every dish.  Each ingredient seemed to be perfectly selected for flavor or health, not just to add fancy words to the menu (as many restaurants seem to do now days).

Sweet Corn Chowder  - Delicious and had a slight kick.  I was shocked to realize it was also vegan, using a cashew cream instead of dairy.  

Edamame Hummus with Flax Seed Crisps &amp; Fresh Veggies  - I love hummus and this dish was wonderful and light

Farmer&#39;s Market Salad - Gorgeous.  The balsamic vinaigrette didn&#39;t overpower the salad like many vinaigrette&#39;s can do.  The salad was perfectly balanced on flavor and the pickled onions, spiced pecans, chevre, and of course the blackberries made this one of the best salads I have ever had.  I could eat this every day!

Tal&#39;s Grain Bowl - Amazing!  This was everyone&#39;s favorite dish at our table, and seemed to be the consensus around the restaurant.  You would never have known that the &#34;beef tips&#34; were actually meatless.  They were bursting with flavor and meshed well with the spicy and sweet chile-ginger sauce.  Holy Yum!  

Art&#39;s Unfried Chicken - Wow!  It is hard to believe that this juicy chicken was not fried!  Plus under 600 calories?!  No guilt comfort food!  Juicy and tender on the inside and super crispy on the outside.  Served with the best brussels sprouts to have ever touched my lips, butternut squash, dried cranberries, cashew cream and Dijon vinaigrette. 

Fresh Baked Chocolate Chip Cookie - Nothing negative, but nothing special.  I prefer to have my cookie on the softer side, as a suggestion to the Chef.

Chocolate Budino - No guilt dessert, too?!?  Chocolate pudding made with coconut sugar (if I remember correctly) atop a pomegranate gelee  with chia seeds.  A healthy play on raspberry jam, it seemed.  It was so tasty and the balance was perfect and not to sweet.

I can&#39;t wait to bring my husband when LYFE Kitchen opens on June 6, 2014!  Also eager to try their healthy breakfast/brunch items!

Decided to stop in while I was in the Park Meadows area and pick up some lunch to go. Love the menu selections! I am a fan of any place that has gluten free offerings.

I ordered Art&#39;s Unfried Chicken - comes with Brussel sprouts, butternut squash, dried cranberries and a cashew cream vinaigrette. I modified by ordering extra Brussel sprouts instead of the butternut squash. Wow, super tasty and healthy! I don&#39;t know about y&#39;all, I love a good Brussel sprout and these were cooked perfectly. A little crunchy, not too crunchy. 

One caveat, I didn&#39;t know they were using breadcrumbs on the grilled chicken as it doesn&#39;t mention that in the menu description. I would have preferred the gluten free option because I don&#39;t like to have gluten in my diet. I did offer them that feedback and they were receptive.

For dinner I ordered the Chicken and Kale Soup, the farmers market salad, Art&#39;s unfried chicken, and the hibiscus beet lyfe water. 

The the chicken and kale soup was delicious though a little salty, it also contained potato, tomato, carrot, celery, garlic, onion, cumin, cilantro, lime, and made for a hearty start to my meal. 

Next I had the Farmers salad, which was also nice, though next time I would ask for the dressing on the side.  It had arugula, blackberries, pickled onions, spiced pecans, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette.  The flavor combination worked well with the peppery arugula working with the pickled onions, which complimented the sweet blackberries and tangy goat cheese well. 

Art&#39;s unfried chicken was probably my favorite course of the evening.  It was a breaded grilled chicken breast with roasted brussels sprouts, butternut squash, dried cranberries, cashew cream, dijon vinaigrette.  Truly delicious, similar quality food would be served for twice the price in a normal sit down restaurant. 

Lastly I had the hibiscus beet lyfe water, which was okay but for me not worth the calories.  (a little too sweet)

In the end, I really like Lyfe Kitchen, they are taking real food preparing it to be tasty and healthy.  The have calorie and sodium information posted right on their menu, and the quality of food you receive for the price can&#39;t be beat.  Keep up the good work guys!

PS I ordered way too much food, Lyfe&#39;s portions are sizable, two of the three food items would have been more than enough :)"

I ordered the Art&#39;s unfried chicken.  I LOVED the brussel sprouts and squash.  I could have eaten a whole plate of just that.  I also enjoyed the chicken and thought it was tender and the mustard sauce was delicious.  I did think it was a bit pricey for fast casual food.  The atmosphere was nice and I would definitely come back and bring friends.  I also like the free water choices and getting to have a glass versus a paper cup.  The service was fast.  I got my meal in about 5 minutes.  I am glad to see healthier options for quick dining.

We got to sample the whole menu in Chicago, but here when it was on my own dime did things become to reality that it was quite expensive. 
We split Arts un-fried Chicken, and it has been good every time I have had it, nice and moist and the sauce is really good. We also got the Chocolate budino (pudding), and that is always great. Less impressive was the price for the add-ons like spa water etc. I will say I am excited for it to open in Boulder so it is a little closer to home for me."

Great service - I had four different encounters with employees, all of which being very pleasant. From the young guy who took my order to what appeared to be two managers checking in on things, everyone was very polite and friendly.

The food - I&#39;m a sucker for In N Out. I was not expecting this type of delicious factor from a &#34;healthy&#34; burger. I&#39;m still pretty shocked at how delicious I found it to be.

The portions - I almost took away one star because I felt the portions could have been more generous. But that&#39;s really just the glutton in me talking. The portion was perfect for lunch serving. If I had it my way I would eat until I was in pain, so I actuslly appreciate the not so overwhelming serving sizes.

The beet juice - I don&#39;t even know what inspired me to order this, but it was refreshing as hell and I found myself wanting to order another to go."

A group of us were lucky enough to be able to attend a pre-opening VIP meal and were blown away. The clean fresh taste of all the quality ingredients was so refreshing and trying vegan and vegetarian items that you never would have tried on your own was very educational. The flatbreads were all fantastic, the hummus with veggies but the big news for me was... My hubby the meat eater even liked the &#34;no meat&#34; meat dish.. 

I have hated, loathed, detested brussel sprouts my entire life.. until LYFE that is... (pun intended) These little green grilled nuggets were spectacular. After speaking to one of the very well trained staff brussel spouts are a sustainable crop, easy to grow and fast growing so it is their signature side dish with all of the main courses. You might just have your LYFE changed and learn to love them too!!

The chocolate Grenache with pomegranate chia seeds was spectacular .. particularly with a glass of their house red wine. The Vegan chocolate chip cookies...... a YUM!!! 

I returned for breakfast and had some kiddo&#39;s at the table.. at first they weren&#39;t too excited to drink something green.. like a kale banana apple smoothie.. but once they tried it.. they were hooked! How great to have a place in the mall where you can eat affordable healthy food and be able to teach the next generation great eating habits. 

We will be back.. often!"

Tasty healthy food at a non-inflated price.  It is a win win!

The staff is really friendly here and while in line they were passing out samples of what they called their Beet Water which I believe had Hibiscus tea and maybe some ginger and mint.  It was sooooo refreshing after coming from the parking lot called I25. I ordered a glass with my meal and the flavors were wonderful and were so refreshing/hydrating on a beautiful Summer evening sitting out on the patio. 

I ordered their fish tacos an a side of their roasted brussels and squash.  The brussel and squash were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the carmelization with the balsamic they used.  The fish tacos had a snafu as I ordered &#34;fish&#34; tacos but somehow got someone elses vegan version with tofu...It was still very tasty and it took me two bites to figure it out, but I did send it back and got the correct ones with the grilled mahi mahi.  The flavor on these tacos were really good and I loved the salsa that was served with it (it also comes with a nice side salad with a citus/lemony tasting dressing.

I loved their water and servingware station as it gave you options of regular cold water, cold sparkling water, as well as ambient water.  I love my sparkling water.

The one thing that was annoying (and maybe it was a technical glitch this evening) is that you were given a number transponder that maybe was supposed to vibrate when your order was ready or maybe the number on them was to help the server find you when they brought your order, but their system didn&#39;t work and the waitstaff was on the patio roaming around trying to find the people matching the orders....maybe that is why I got my inital vegan taco with tofu.

I absolutely love this place and I wish they would put one closer to where I live but I will definitely go out of my way to come back.  I have a friend that is hooked and said she has been there 30 times already....I may be next on that bandwagon!"

All food is made fresh when you order.  You order as you walk in and they deliver the food right to your table.  Stop and get your silverware and a water on the way to the table.  

I tried the fish tacos today which were tasty and my friend (as she put it) inhaled the chicken sandwich.  She loved it!

We were both interested in trying this place out! I went with the Antipasto salad with grilled salmon. Amazing! The grilled peppers and eggplant were a lovely change. I was a bit disappointed at the amount of salmon pieces they give you, but they tasted fresh and seasoned just right! I also ordered the Hibiscus Beet juice. Surprisingly, it tasted very good and had just the right amount of sweetness.

One reason this place doesn&#39;t get 5 stars from me is because the wait for our food took about 20 min. I don&#39;t believe any casual restaurant should take that long. Although, we did go at noon."

&#39;Would I starve for the night?&#39;
&#34;Would it be pretentious and full of food I had to force down?&#39;

I am happy to say that was a RESOUNDing NO.
It was amazing. We had the Sweet corn chowder- no cream in it so it wasn&#39;t mushy. Hummus- delightful. I enjoy Hummus but this had a great flavour. Unfried chicken was so good! 

It is a great meetup place with lots of friends because everyone can get what they like. The meat eaters can have a burger and local beer, the vegans have a whole menu just for them.

Try it out, you won&#39;t go home starving! I promise.

I stopped by for a weekday lunch and ordered the orange ginger chia water, chunky guacamole, and fish tacos.  All of it was delicious.  Bonus: the serving of guacamole was more than generous, so I used the extra guacamole on my fish tacos.  Delish!

I was meeting a group here for a party, and there was a little miscommunication about the facility. Basically, it is a cross between a café and restaurant. You order at the counter, and they bring you your food. Not the sit down type of place I was expecting.

The food seems like the typical fad food you see all over the food network for chic contemporary artistic type of fare. I don&#39;t typically go in for that because it seems to usually be overpriced. This was the case. I had the Tai Curry bowl, which uses wheat berries as the base, and although the flavor was good, the texture just seemed a little off, and was a bit pricey.

The flavored waters were very good, and the others in our party seemed to enjoy the food, but it wasn&#39;t quite what I was used too. Next time, I will try the burger. Not sure you can go wrong with a burger."

The environment is great, cool and fresh. Make me want an herb garden in my kitchen! Pefectly located  inside the mall. Think of it as half way between food court and the restuarants out on the Vista. Well, more than half toward the upper class but still relaxing and fast.

The interior is fresh and bright and modern.  And I love their concept.  Healthy fast food in a casual environment.  It&#39;s a good place to go if you are trying to maintain your gluten-free, veg or vegan diet.  Everything has less than 600 calories.  Also, the restaurants are LEED-certified.  

We were eating light.  Seems to be a theme on this vacation.  I got the Sweet Corn Chowder.  Loved it.  It is made with sweet corn, peppers, potatoes and cashew cream.  This little bowl of creamy Heaven was only 191 calories.  The boyfriend got the Kale Caesar Salad which was 360 calories.  It consisted of kale, romaine, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, broccoli, parmesan, whole wheat breadcrumbs, and eggless caesar dressing.  It was delicious.  I can&#39;t wait to visit LYFE Kitchen.

I  went back a few weeks ago with my friend for dinner.  I was pretty hungry.  I had a special and it was a black bean bowl with chicken.   My friend had the unfried chicken with brussel sprouts.  She really liked hers especially the yummy brussel sprouts.   I enjoyed mine even though it was a bit spicy.  I had a glass of white wine which seemed expensive for this kinda place.  The strawberry water with ginger and chia seeds was very refreshing or so my friend said.  Great service but lots of newbies and they did not know many answers to the questions we had but they did find answers.

We went shopping and wanted coffee and something sweet.  It was getting late and we stopped in a few places for dessert but nothing looked good.  We ended up back here for the chocolate grenache  with chia seed and coffee.  We wanted decaf and it was brought out cold.  They made a fresh pot just for us.  The dessert was good.  

I left hungry.  I probably should have had a salad or soup with my bowl.  It does not seem expensvive but once you start ordering more food because your hungry it can get pricey.

I sent my manager and her husband and 2 friends last weekend.  They said they would never go back.  The food was not good and they were unimpressed.  I hope this is not a bad sign.  I would like to see it laste."

If eaten at LYFE Kitchen twice and had the same overall impression both times:

 - Easy ordering, friendly service, pleasant/comfortable atmosphere - nice outdoor patio for the warmer months.
 - Food is okay but nothing special. On my first visit I had the garden burger which was a bit dry and over priced. Also, I know that the food is supposed to be healthy but the bun for the burger had little or no flavor. On my second visit I had the garden salad which I like better than the burger.

This is a small place and definite hole in the wall. I wanted to order shredded pork with fermented radish noodle soup but she suggested something else in Cantonese that I couldn&#39;t understand so I said yes. He ordered seafood tofu soup. I ordered a half pound of BBQ and roast pork. 

We waited a while and I guess she misunderstood me because she ended up bringing a seafood hot pot dish for him. Another wait to correct the mistake but she brought over the roast and BBQ pork which were great. A little too fatty for me but good flavor. She brought his soup which was meh. She brought me roast duck with fermented faddish noodle soup which ended up working in my favor because I wanted to try that as well. The noodles were a bit over cooked because they broke apart easily. The portion sizes and cost were great.

Nevertheless, we managed to talk to the Server who at that hour, was running around preparing and taking orders.  I told her is there a HAINANESE CHICKEN RICE Dish?  She pointed to the one inside the Menu.  Hong Kong BBQ tends to be VERY BUSY with other patrons alike.

My friend like it, though I think they can do better.  This dish reminds her of Comfort Food, and food she grew up with.  MAN, YES Hainanese Chicken Rice DO TAKE ALOT OF TIME TO Prepare..  For this lunch, the Rice is NOT Up to Par on what I am used to having.  In terms of Portion is doable.  It comes with grated ginger in a small side plate.  But they do not offer any kind of Chicken Broth and other condiments that comes with the ORIGINAL Hainanese Chicken Rice.  The Chicken came COLD, aka NOT to my liking.  *SUPER SIGH*  Furthermore, it took awhile for them to get our food ready since they are SWAMPED during LUNCH Hours.

- Small place: our group of 14 took up about half the restaurant and we had to wait a bit to get tables pushed together to accommodate.

- Lengthy menu and they may run out of certain items; for instance I really wanted to roast pork but they were out at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
- We ordered about 14-15 dishes and a few appetizers. What stood out? 1) salt and pepper fried squid 2) bbq pork 3) the abalone dish 4) XO green beans 5) salt and pepper fried shrimp. We had so many dishes and nothing stood out as subpar, although &#34;pear&#34; does not mean pear, it means bitter melon and one of the meat dishes came out lukewarm which was not appetizing in any way!
- Inexpensive. Our group of 14 split the bill and it worked out to roughly $13 per person.
- One star off for the seriously yucky bathrooms.
- We ran into some regulars of the restaurant (friend of a friend) who dines here regularly and recommends any of the seafood hot pots/clay pots so we will try that next time.

I will definitely come back! But with a more manageable group size."

As another yelper mentioned, they thought they just ordered wrong - I think that is something that could happen in this restaurant really easily. The specials were written in Chinese characters. There were 10 of them. We asked the waitress to tell us what they were and she just said &#34;oh, pork stomach and some whole fish and some other stuff...&#34;... So we realized we were going to have to order off the menu. We gave it a good shot!

I ordered the duck in tangerine peel and it was pretty tasty! Big chunks of duck, celery, mushrooms, and chopped up duck fat - pretty flavorful and enjoyable surprisingly. As a side, we ordered the water spinach and garlic sauce and that was a big giant hit! More restaurants should serve giant plates of yummy greens on the side! The greens alone were worth coming here for!

The boyfriend ordered the minced pork in Szechuan sauce. The waitress did not hear the word minced, and he got basically a pork stirfry. I tasted it and I wondered if the meet had gone a bit rancid. It was not very good.

I feel like if you know what you were going to order here or perhaps spoke and read Chinese, or were just super knowledgeable about Chinese food, you would be very pleased with this restaurant.

As it goes for me, this was like a little visit to the Third World country where you don&#39;t speak the language well and the servers can&#39;t understand you. The ambience was three red baked dead ducks hanging in the corner and one of the most atrocious smells to hit you in the face when we walked in that I have ever encountered. So I guess I&#39;ve talked myself into three stars! Sad - I really wanted to like this place a lot more.

But, by all means go for the greens!"

If you get it to go, they sell it by the pound.  You tell them how much you want and she chops it up right in front of your face!  My favorite is the roasted pork.  Crispy skin and tender meat.  Probably my favorite place for it here in Denver.  So delicious!  You can order a huge box of white rice, then you can have dinner for like 3 days.

If you decide to dine in, that have a special where you can order 3 dishes for about $22.  An excellent deal."

A group of 14 of us decided to take a chance and give it a try. With such a large group, we were able to sample a lot of things.

Our server recommended we order 10 items to share. We got excited and ordered close to 20. We all went home with leftovers for days. Yet still, with 20 menu items ordered, the cost was just $13.08 per person after tax (before tip). WHAAATT?! A delicious meal at a great price.

Green beans were a highlight, as was a Chinese vegetable the name of which I can&#39;t remember (hollow stalks with greens). We also tried mustard greens with abalone mushroom, fried squid, sesame chicken, steamed chicken (a favorite), roast duck (very good--flavorful but not too greasy), barbecue pork (so good), clay hot pot with pork belly, salt/pepper shrimp, a couple of noodle dishes, Buddha&#39;s delight, and more. It&#39;s all a blur of delicious food memories right now.

The place is small (our group took up much of the dining room) and very casual.

I will be back for more."

Did not like how the 1/4 order of duck didn&#39;t include a leg.  But it tasted pretty meaty.

The above food order was huge!!!!  Enough for dinner and lunch the next as leftovers.  The Juk was pretty good and the wontons did the job as did the chow mein.  Seemed like there might have been msg in the food but that&#39;s probably from fish sauce which I use on my food anyway.  Although this part of Denver&#39;s a bit run down, it has a parking lot.

Service was slow for chinese, but the quality and portions were worth the wait.  Would come here again."

Their specialty is HK BBQ and it was the worst plate of BBQ I have ever eaten.  We asked for their trio of Duck, Roast Pork and BBQ.  Everything was cold. There was no &#39;roast&#39; flavor at all. Just soggy and greasy meat...ugh

The second dish is their Yushan Eggplant.  This was also highly reviewed and recommended.  But a total disappointment to me. It also came out lukewarm,. What is the kitchen doing??  

The only dish that was acceptable was their fried rice."

Surprisingly, this place never came up until yesterday when I was searching for authentic Chinese food. 

I had to check it out, and being that today is Chinese New Year, I decided to make the drive out to get some roast duck and char siu! We got a whole roast duck for about $19, and two pounds of char siu for $13. Everything tastes amazing and authentic! I&#39;m excited to try what else they have to offer on their menu!"

The idea of roasted duck and BBQ&#39;d pork made my mouth water so we headed down Federal to Hong Kong BBQ.

Expectations were high given the name of this restaurant and we made sure to order a slew of dishes to test their mettle: a sampler of roasted duck and roasted pork, Peking duck (a whole bird because that&#39;s how we roll), crab and fish maw soup, snow pea leaves fried in garlic and salted fish fried rice. All the BBQ items were oozing with grease, salty and crispy in all the right places. The soup and fried rice were also very good.

I liked the Hong Kong restaurant feel to it, made me appreciate the authenticity.  Our party of four was seated.  

My dad opted for a side of roast duck, an order of pan-fried noodles, and the popular 3 for $23.95 dish that comes with soup.

The soup that was given to us is a traditional Hong Kong thing,  it&#39;s not supposed to be a flavorful soup like an your American Egg Drop soup. It&#39;s a cooling cleanser, that is eaten concurrently with your meal. Don&#39;t expect a high level of sodium or MSG, this is a natural broth.

The portions are very generous,  it beats my predecessor Heaven Dragon. The dishes do not require me to accompany each bite with a gulp of water. Many Westerners will probably opt with the addition of soy sauce that sits as the Asian condiment. 

I am proud of this family-owned mom and pop shop, it shows their tenacity.  My Chinese parents live that it&#39;s not spiked in sodium and MSG, but it also has a variety to choose from. Lastly, did I mention the prices are reasonable???"

Heavenly BBQ pork you can buy by the pound!  
I don&#39;t speak Chinese but still felt welcome. 
This NOT your typical Americanized Chinese place. There&#39;s no pink sauce, hot and sour, no such thing as General Tso&#39;s. (I did miss the Chinese hot mustard though).  White pepper on the table.   Nothing is drowning in sickly sweet syrup. 
Picture menu for those of us who don&#39;t know the language. We got crispy duck, shrimp dumplings, BBQ pork and the most AMAZING string beans I&#39;ve ever had. Get them, seriously. 
Great prices. Lunch for two plus two pounds of BBQ pork to go was $40.

This is my go to traditional Chinese place conveniently located not too far from where I live. I visit this place almost two to four times a month with my boyfriend. We get these crazy Chinese food cravings for duck and wonton noodle soup and let me tell ya, this place freaking hits the spot for those on top of the many discoveries I have come upon. I

I was raised around this block growing up and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve met the owner (owner&#39;s wife) who is always there chopping away at the duck. I&#39;m older now so no one in the Chinese community recognizes me much buttttt it&#39;s better that way, because when my Cantonese is barely understandable some days, I can just revert to English and pretend I&#39;m Korean. ;) Haha except they are starting to recognize me from how often I go!!

Some days they start you off with some Daikon, Carrot, and Pork soup that makes me want to cry when I drink it because it tastes like my grandmas.

I tried some new stuff with my friend on the last visit for her bday. She was looking for some good Hainanese Chicken in Colorado and I had told her this is the place! After the disappointment at Jaya, I was lucky enough to see it on the menu here, give it a try and find my new place for Hainanese Chicekn Rice cravings! The Yushan Eggplant is cooked to perfection and perfect with rice. The Walnut shrimp was fantastic. I was hoping for a huge dish but that&#39;s just the fat kid in me talking. The Beef Chow Fun was great but that&#39;s pretty hard to mess up at a traditional Chinese place since it&#39;s such a standard dish.

Other things I&#39;ve tried, the Curry Fishballs. This was the only really mediocre dish I&#39;ve had there. Different kinds of stir fried greens with garlic. I could eat veggies fried with garlic and rice for dayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyysssssssss. Can&#39;t escape what you grew up with and this place feels like home most days. They also have a hard to find dish here in colorado and it&#39;s the clay pot rice pots! Takes about 45 minutes to prepare so if you are itching to try it, call ahead and let them know but man it&#39;s delicious. The rice burns a little at the bottom and gets crispy if you let it and that&#39;s the best part!! I want to try all of the clay pot rice dishes!

Service...well it&#39;s a Chinese place. I say it&#39;s pretty decent for a Chinese place and the server recognizes you if you frequent often. It&#39;s small so you get your food quickly most of the time. You just never know with service at a Chinese place...haha. She only messed up my order once and said I didn&#39;t order it, which I&#39;ve heard her say to other tables before so I&#39;d be careful on that but other than that it&#39;s fantastic!"

Just it wasn&#39;t busy when we came in which was good. This place gets packed sometimes and food can same a bit to come out. I ordered the 3.95 bowl of Congress to start, and a fried flour stuck ( yow-tsa-gwai). A HUGE bowl came out and I shared it with the hubby. 

We also ordered the chicken double pan fried noodles and the cashew chicken. Both dishes were amazing. The thing I like about this place, is that they offer more traditional and authentuc Chinese food. It&#39;s not loaded with sugar, they use real Chinese vegetables,etc. The menu also offers a huge selection, I had a hard time deciding! It&#39;s cleacn, prices are good, and the food was amazing!"

It&#39;s slim pickings in Denver, but thank goodness Hong Kong BBQ exists.  Expect the typical but well-done cantonese menu, a non-existent decor, and very reasonable prices for good sized portions.  While nothing compared to some of the places in the SF Bay Area and Houston, HK BBQ delivers every time I go (and I go often).

Food/Beverages: They have menus appropriate for authentic and non-authentic interests.  There is a good variety of foods, although I wish they had more congee options.  Portions sizes are excellent and the taste is always delicious.  Items I especially like are the salty fish and chicken fried rice and any of the congees.  I think China Jade does a better job with snow pea leaves, but any of their leafy vegetables with garlic tastes of home.   Also, can never go wrong with the duck.

Ambiance: If you&#39;re expecting fancy decor, don&#39;t come here.  It&#39;s bare bones and the focus is on the food (which is fine by me).

Service: Can be slow, but well worth the wait.

Pricing: All plates are decently priced, but if you want the most bang for your buck, go for the Dine-In evening special with three dishes only for $23.95.

Hours: Open late on same days, which is great.

Tip: If you can read Chinese, order off the menu on the wall. Or, if you&#39;re illiterate like me, you can ask someone to read it to you (yes, they were nice enough to do that for me)."

Tucked away in a decrepit shopping plaza, bars on the windows, I was definitely hesitant. Seated and proceeded to go buck at this place. Roast duck, Hainan chicken and rice, eggplant, Chinese broccoli, walnut shrimp, you&#39;re not doing Chinese food dining right if you don&#39;t have an overwhelming amount of leftovers at the end. All were incredibly tasty, my favorites were the walnut shrimp and Hainan chicken. I&#39;m biased towards Hainan chicken and rice, similar to pizza, even the shitty versions are tasty. This was an exceptional version, expertly butchered, room temperature, resting on a bed of bokchoy. No rice for me but the reactions from my friends were telling and encouraging. I could&#39;ve easily put away a plate of walnut shrimp myself, generous handfuls of candied walnuts tossed in, crispy shrimp smothered in a sweet mayo (I swear it works), it&#39;s impossible to restrict yourself to just one bite. 

This place nourishes my soul with its expansive and authentic menu. Highly recommended!"

When I walked in, I was transported to the holes-in-the-wall that you find everywhere in Taipei, Taiwan. Walk up to the counter to order. If you don&#39;t speak or read Chinese/Vietnamese, you might get a little lost, but there IS English on the menu. I came here because I was feeling under the weather and wanted some chicken congee. I ordered my congee, a fried dough stick (you tiao) and a hot plate dish for later (braised beef and eggplant). 

As I sat and waited, two ladies from the back wheeled out a whole roasted pig. When I say WHOLE, I mean head to tail. They were wrapping it up in aluminum foil for transportation, though I&#39;m not really sure how that ended up because I had to get up to pay for my order. What I do know is that roasted pig skin looked super crisp. SUPER CRISP. I saw other people ordering roast pig by the pound, too...

The roasted duck was fatty and served in slices, many of which were largely gristle and bone.   The house sauce was salty and flavorless.  My daughter ordered the pan-fried noodle chicken, which contained a mountain of noodles that were tasteless, with very few vegetable or pieces of chicken.  The noodle dish came with a (chicken?) soup, which we found inedible.  The food was not salvaged by the ambience, of which there was none.

After we sat down and ordered hot tea, we found that the tea cup was nasty. It was dirty and had sticky stuff on it. And when we asked for a new tea cup, the server just threw it on the table. Literally. Then It took forever for the food to come out. Once they were out, they were just bland. No taste at all. In the middle of finishing up our meal, several of their employees came out of the kitchen and ate next to us. It was so uncomfortable. At last, nobody refilled our drinks. Definitely wont come back."

Although I am really enjoying this vibrant city, the only downside of this move is that I no longer live close to my parents - which means I can no longer order delicious Chinese &#34;takeouts&#34; from my mom.  Fortunately, I discovered the Hong Kong Barbecue. This little eatery has become the &#34;One&#34; place for me to stop by for some authentic Cantonese style home cooking. 

Other than the deliciousness factor, the price here is so reasonable, and the portion of each dish is so very generous.  If you stopped by during the weekend, there is a high chance that you will run into a person, me that is, whom looks happy, satisfied, and with at least 4 to-go boxes of food in hand. 

Happy good eating!"

The daughter at the counter totally flipped out on us and called us &#34;stupid&#34; and &#34;assholes&#34; multiple times &#34;go somewhere else if you can&#39;t wait&#34;.... seriously, what kind of family restaurant disrespects their paying customers? She tossed the sauces into the bag and slapped the change onto the counter. The other lady that was on the phone earlier already started chopping the duck (with the same gloves used while on the phone).

Lo and behold, the place was open that early.  I did have to wait, since I wanted the roast duck lunch and the duck was still roasting.  It was done by 11:00 am, though.  While I was there, I figured I would get two orders of duck noodle soup to go.  Boy am I glad I got that soup.  It was sooooo good.  Two orders fed 4 of us.  Plus, it was nice to have the duck at home because I could pick the meat off and toss it in the soup stock which comes separate from the meat and noodles.  The duck is cut in such a way that there is a lot of bone intermingled with the meat.  When I was at the restaurant, I had to figure out how to eat it with just chopsticks, but I managed.  I ended up using my fingers and teeth some of the time though.  I cannot wait to get the soup to go again, and maybe grab a roast duck or a half duck as well, since it was so good!

We ordered the wonton soup really really good only thing that made us a little square mesh was the pork intestines in there

We&#39;ve been ordered the combination duck and barbecued pork both were tasty but very fatty and greasy but again tasty.

The staff was very nice and attentive.

I would suggest this place to anyone in real authentic Chinese food.

The reason I did not give this five stars was because it was just a little too authentic for me and the person I was with. Also because after we ordered they moved us to another table right up against the carts of all the dirty dishes because a bigger party came in and the only way they can arrange to see them was the move us rather than move tables across the restaurant"

I want to be fluent in their menu, along with the white-board specials, written only in Chinese.

The duck we ordered had no flavor, and the noodles, no matter how much saucey stuff I added, just could not muster any flavor whatsoever. The most intense flavor vacuum my mouth has ever experienced. I was kinda bummed. To be continued."

The Chinese scribbling on the white board, the smell, old people eating and drinking tea and reading the newspaper, the hanging pig and ducks, and the servers were reminiscent of places I&#39;d accompanied my mom to on weekends in Chinatown. The only thing that was missing was a long line to get in to eat and loud chattering in Cantonese and Mandarin.

My mom would be thrilled that I found this place &#34;on my own&#34; (obviously with some help from yelp). Upon moving to Colorado, a list of asian food places was sent to my mom as proof that it existed here and accordingly, I&#39;d be OK. So I&#39;m excited to report that I&#39;m finally checking off eateries from this list that I could actually take her to when she visits. Some of the dim sum places I&#39;ve tried she probably wouldn&#39;t approve of...but I digress.

I hate when I get the excited look &#34;do you speak Chinese?&#34; Because I really wish that I could and I hate to disappoint! I ordered in English and now that I think about it, it probably comes out the same as when my mom orders. There&#39;s the standard &#34;describe this..&#34; &#34;is it this style?&#34; &#34;can I do this instead?&#34; That&#39;s all universal. My mother would definitely say this is not the best HK/Canton style food, but really, when would she ever admit that she&#39;s found it? However, she would definitely agree that I&#39;ve stumbled upon a decent substitute. 

I wanted the wonton soup and the jook (oh god, they even had the white pepper for it!!), but it was too hot that day. I ended up ordering the salt and pepper pork chops and &#34;HK&#34; style noodles with chicken (translation: pan fried/crispy noodles with stuff on top). The food came with a standard bucket of rice (well cooked white rice!) and a pot of tea (yay!). The portions are standard of a Chinese place - so a couple days later and I still had leftovers. I also ordered some char siu to go (for some homemade fried rice action). 

All this for $20 bucks. Believe it. You gotta love those Chinese prices! 5-stars because I had lost faith on my search for Chinese and now I&#39;ve found a spot where I&#39;m comfortable with becoming a regular."

HK BBQ is the best in Denver. Hands down. I&#39;ve been here numerous of times and I&#39;m NEVER disappointed. Annie (who typically runs the front) is beyond friendly and always remembers me when I walk in. Try the Singapore Noodles because they&#39;re seriously done right with the exact amount of curry.

The restaurant&#39;s specialty is barbecued meat. And the meat... oh my god, the meat! We started with an &#34;appetizer&#34; of three meats of our choice -- I use quotes around the word appetizer because our waitress came over with a heaping plate of meat that was enough to feed a party of four at the very least. 

We went with roast pork, BBQ pork, and roast duck. And all three were incredible. I tried the BBQ first and then declared it my favorite. But next came a bite of the roast duck -- I quickly reneged my earlier claim and stated that the duck was my favorite. Last came a bite of roasted pork  -- oh, lord! I have no idea what they do, but it was DELICIOUS. The meat was tender, fresh, with a crackled skin that was almost like candy. Meat candy! Definitely my favorite. My boyfriend and I spent the rest of the meal arguing which meat was the best -- needless to say, we were unable to come to a conclusion. 

Other thoughts? Don&#39;t let the dingy, nondescript atmosphere fool you. The staff is incredibly friendly and the restaurant, despite its shabbyness, is clean. Also, vegetarians beware! We ordered a plate of eggplant to make ourselves feel better about our meat-party, but even the eggplant came with a generous portion of minced pork."

I was very not impressed with the food that we had gotten or the service we received. Because of this, I don&#39;t think that I will be returning.

I came here on Valentine&#39;s Day with my boyfriend in hopes of getting a nice hotpot dinner. But, we were very disappointed with the outcome. First off, I noticed that there was no one else eating here for Valentine&#39;s Day. That&#39;s gives you a clue that maybe this place isn&#39;t very good. When we ordered the hotpot, some of the proteins and vegetables were unavailable for our use. For example, they didn&#39;t have any lamb. Lamb is definitely a common protein that should have been in stock. Sometimes, restaurants with employees that don&#39;t speak English can be very accommodating and pleasant experiences. But, it seemed like the employees here didn&#39;t really care about you if you couldn&#39;t speak Chinese. It was definitely hard to get their attention and their help. The service definitely soured our experience a little. The hotpot experience itself was very lack luster and I would not come back here again because of the lacking food and the poor service. If you are looking for all-you-can-eat hotpot, I would recommend going to Kingsland for a much better experience."

Their roasted/bbq meats are the attraction and have an amazing taste.  The other entrees are fantastic too: I especially recommend the sea food clay pot and the various flavors of greens or broccoli.  The prices are very reasonable.   What a difference from Star Kitchen around the corner, where the food is uniformly lackluster.

However, the last time I went, my experience was not as good.  The steamed chicken was ice cold and tasteless, and the roast pork was mostly tasteless.   Everything else (including the duck and other entrees we ordered) was as tasty as usual.   This was a big disappointment because before that my 5-7 prior visits were all 5-star.   It&#39;s a great letdown when the quality of an amazing restaurant starts to fluctuate.   

There isn&#39;t really much of an alternative in Denver: this is the only chinese restaurant I&#39;ve eaten in that comes close to the excellent chinese I got used to when I lived in San Francisco.

Communication was, honestly, difficult  to say the least.  I was in a good mood and very patient. The waitress didn&#39;t  speak any English and she asked another for assistance.  I pointed to what I wanted and sat back checking some business emails. The soup arrived and it was a clear broth with a piece of carrot and two chunks of chicken. The soup was very bland and salty.  I took a few spoonfuls and passed on the rest of the soup. The duck arrived with the rice. Very generous quantities.  There was a side of dipping sauce that was salty and unlike any other sauce I&#39;ve tasted. The duck was chopped into pieces and was very greasy, lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting  and was salty. I was disappointed in the lunch. Yes, I didn&#39;t sample any other dishes.

Also got the fried bread app and the bbq pork noodle soup.  The bread came out nice and warm.  Great by itself.  Very decadent with the sweet, sweet dipping sauce.

The soup was really good.  Good pork and broth.  I thought the noodles were fine.  I wasn&#39;t amazed by the dish.  Would be happy to get again.

The people there were very nice."

I envision the typical chow mein or fried cream cheese thing. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re missing. HK BBQ is fantastic. Authentic Chinese food that I remember growing up with!

Authentic clay pot dishes and congee. The nice couple from Hong Kong speaks english well so it won&#39;t be awkward ordering in English.

A CLEAN &#34;hole-in-a-wall&#34; Chinese restaurant?  Are you serious?!?!  It&#39;s a diamond in the rough!  

Like most Chinese places, there&#39;s not much decor at this restaurant.  They have a TV with Chinese shows on.  I was always afraid to go in there since they always have their blinds down and you can never see what they have.  (Makes me think of the song &#34;I Will Survive&#34; - First I was afraid, I was petrified....)  Which is a detriment, as you can tell with the mere 5 reviews ahead of mine.  The reason I decided to go in is that even though they only had 5 reviews, 3 of them have 5 stars and is averaging over 4 stars.  However, this place kicked some A-S-S!  I&#39;m hoping by reviewing this place there will be more people to get to try it. 

You know a Chinese place is good when you go in and all their customers are Asian of some sort.  Again, the bf was the only white boy and he loved every sip of his soup and porridge.  

So they have a very extensive menu.  They are known for their noodle bowls and porridges.  You have quite a few different choices.  Let&#39;s start with the choose 3 menu.  

Choose 3 menu has probably about 50 different dishes on there that you can choose from.  3 entrees will cost you $21.95.  Anything additional would be about another $8 per entree.  You also get rice and soup with it.  We didn&#39;t get 3 things because we heard about their authentic Hong Kong style noodle soups.  We did order the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops though, and it&#39;s the first time I had it with the bone-in and they were fantastic!  The bone-in made it a bit more tender and it was great heated up too when we ate it later than night.  Had plenty of leftovers from the 3 things we ordered.  

We then ordered a bowl of duck with preserved cabbage noodle soup.  This thing is huge, it can feed 2 people if that&#39;s the ONLY thing you ordered.  The noodles are so airy and light, it&#39;s like a rice vermicelli, even thinner than your typical pho noodles.  The broth was soooo delicious!  The owner makes his own broth, all I know is that it is simmered with seafood and poultry to get that extra flavor.  All the waitress mentioned was the shrimp but I swear I could taste scallops in there too.  If you drink all the soup they&#39;d be gladly to refill the broth for you with no additional charge.  Man, with extra soup I think this noodle can feed 3 or 4.  The duck is tender and flavorful.  They roast their ducks and BBQs in house.  The noodle bowl also has red bell pepper and green bell pepper for added taste.  Of course, it also has bean sprouts and ginger with a little onions.  The price of this was around $8.  

When the server showed us how big the bowls looked before we ordered, we really thought the bowls were smaller so we also ordered a bowl of congee/rice porridge.  We got the one with preserved egg and salted egg with pork.  I love that their porridge was thick and not running like some dim sum places around.  You can taste the authenticity, it&#39;s practically pouring out of everything we tried there.  The porridge would be lovely if I was sick or when the winter gets here.  It is around $6. 

They also have all you can eat hot pots!  It&#39;s basically Chinese fondu.    There is different types of broth you can get and it&#39;s about $20 per person with drinks (soda only, not alcoholic bevs.)  They do not have a liquor license so don&#39;t try to bring alcohol either.  You can get your own individual pot if you don&#39;t want the same flavor as your company.  I can&#39;t wait until the weather gets cooler and come back to try their hot pot.  This place gets A+ in my book.  Great food at great prices.  Please don&#39;t be fooled by their exterior.  Sometimes I feel sketchy going into a place without seeing the inside first.  Boy, was I wrong about this place.  :)  So glad I found you HK BBQ!"

The restaurant is clean and our waitress was so nice and helpful. We started off with half a duck which was nice and juicy. I shared the wonton soup with my mom and the wontons were nice and tasty as well as the broth, it was the type of soup that I crave when I&#39;m sick. So my family ordered the Singapore noodles, twice cooked pork, house pan fried noodles and the sweet and sour pork ribs (which the sauce was so good it was like a sticky caramel.)It was all so delicious that I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

I don&#39;t make the rules, I just play by them. So when my roommates and I were spending the day out in Denver, I figured I&#39;d show them what growing up Asian is all about. The location is pretty un-assuming, located in an Asian strip mall, and the interior is not going to win any design awards, but let&#39;s be realistic...I&#39;m eating the food, not the décor. We ordered off the &#34;3 dishes for 23.95&#34; menu, and got the salt and pepper squid, BBQ pork (Char Sui), and roasted duck. They start you out with some delicious soup, and then the dishes start coming out to your table one by one. I was in heaven. 3 dishes fed 4 grown men to satisfaction, and you can always add another dish to the deal for 8 dollars or so. The food was really good, and after tax and tip, we walked away for $30 well fed.

Bonus points if you can read Chinese and order the specials off the white boards on the walls. I bet that stuff is legit."

Well, stop your sobbing, Chrissie, because the new occupant is equally enticing.

As its name would suggest, Hong Kong Barbecue does indeed specialize in juicy, succulent roast meats, and thus a mouthwatering display of ducks, chickens and pork will greet you as you enter. The complimentary soup served with many meals is a showcase for the expertly-cooked poultry in particular. But don&#39;t get too carried away - your chosen menu item is still coming.

And what a menu it is, packed full of delights not commonly seen in Denver. Their featured vegetables include intriguing items like &#34;pea-pod greens&#34; (snowpea shoots), &#34;balsam pear&#34; (bitter melon) and &#34;bamboo fungus&#34;, a distinctive-looking mushroom harvested in great numbers in Sichuan province. This latter ingredient is sometimes also called &#34;stinkhorn&#34; but don&#39;t let that dissuade you from trying it - honest!

Or maybe you want a warm comforting bowl of Congee (rice porridge), or one of their claypot-cooked wonders (packed with beef and oysters, or perhaps chicken and taro root)? Or an XO-sauced dish, or some whole fish, or... well, if I list everything, this review will be more like a telephone directory. Suffice it to say that your options are substantial, and the mom-and-pop owners couldn&#39;t be more charming and welcoming.

So next time you&#39;re on South Federal, try to resist the gravitational pull of certain now-legendary restaurants, and drop by Hong Kong Barbecue instead. Now really, would I steer you wrong?"

Plus being a good Chinese son in law, when ever my Mother in law would travel with us , there was that constant challenge of finding that one good Chinese restaurant.  I 
 read the Yelp reviews and told my wife that we should try this place during our recent trip to Denver.  We usually want to try some of the local famous cuisines (ie Kansas City and its BBQ, or Santa Fe for its Mexican), but couldn&#39;t figure out what Denver is best known for (other than Coors).   Any way back to HK BBQ.. This place is a very authentic Cantonese style BBQ house.  I would love to come back here to try some of their other dishes.  I would not say it is the best Chinese food I have ever had....but if you want to a place where you want to bring your Chinese mother or mother in law, and not hear about it later, this is a good choice.
It is nothing like SF Chinatown Chinese food, but it is good geniniue Cantonese food
We went there for an mid morning lunch or late breakfast.  I ordered the Chinese porridge (Jook) with pork and &#34;pei-don&#34;  (1000 year old egg).  It was very good and the portion was huge.  I did not finish it and took half of it home.    Plus that also serve the &#34;Chinese donut&#34; that is usually eaten with the porridge.  You do not see always see that.
My wife had the Won Ton noodle soup with BBQ pork.  She loved the soup and noodles, but was so so on the &#34;cha-siu&#39; pork.  I,on the other hand, thought it was ok, and ate the rest of the pork.  
We wouild like to come back and try the other items on the menu, as it seem like it would be decent good food since the full restaurant while we were that were all Asian.  Asian always spread the name of a good restaurant by word of mouth.    
The decor is plain and nothing to impress...but the view of the BBQ display case with the hanging roasted duck and roasted pork looked so good.  There was also a long line waiting for take out as well.

Well I hope this help some ... I go to Denver two or three times a year and I will come back to this place.    BTW, the price is not super cheap, but the portions are good size and fresh."

There were times that I was in college, up at Ft Collins that I would come down to go buy his ducks and now I still love them and get them.   I also like the roasted pork, where there is the crispy skin, the fat, and the meat is all within one bit. 
The service is a little slow, but you don&#39;t go for the service, you go for the food.  The deals are great with great food. There are not a lot restaurants that have hot pots and the style and taste that they do here.  The hot pot deal is great for those who can pig out on Chinese fondue.   The busy times are after work hours where most people get of work and go in and mostly buy roast duck.  So, get there early or later."

And this is the only restaurant I know of that freshly wrap their wonton and shrimp dumplings (if you order &#34;soup&#34;, you get 10 for $6.50, versus only 5 if you order &#34;noodle&#34;) when you order (you&#39;ll just have to wait a lil longer for all that deliciousness).

I ordered a roasted duck which had some great crispy skin and definitely was infused with some spices.  I could taste the star anise.  I did point to the dinner special which I thought came with some sides, but alas it did not and was kind of hesitant to ask.  Oh well.  Sometimes I get a double whammy going into restaurants like this.  First I don&#39;t know the lay of the land, but second because I am Asian, people think I know the lay of the land.

Hong Kong (the territory) is an awesome food city.  From haughty taughty places like L&#39;atelier De Joel Robuchon and 131 in Sai Kung, to street food in Mong Kok, to Di Pai Dongs everywhere, the place is delicious.  I had a new mission.

My pal and I order of the &#34;three for $21 menu (ask for it), and got the following:

Singapore Noodles-super tasty.  Just like a shitty hole-in-the wall noodle restaurant in Hong Kong, but in the D.

Beef Ribs with some kind of mushroom- also very good and tasty.  Not greasy or sweet just good.

Beef with black bean sause-a knock out wonder party in your mouth.

We could have ordered from the many bargains on the special menu (three dishes for $21.95) but our tastebuds were set for other things -- the shrimp dumpling noodle soup, shredded duck with dried tangerine peel (actually orange peel, as we were informed), and house fried rice. The soup was delicious and a meal in itself,but we do like variety in our meal so one dish is never enough. The duck was spectacular, subtly flavored and featuring red and green peppers and shiitake mushrooms. The house fried rice is made with a coconut sauce, shrimp, and plenty of char siu pork -- no egg or veggies. The sauce was not at all sweet and was completely absorbed by the rice. This dish is an unexpected treasure. And plenty of leftovers, mmm.

We look forward to many more dining adventures at this little-known gem of a restaurant. I am eager to explore those menus much, much further.

Almost forgot: the roasted (aka barbecued) meats that can be ordered for take-out include whole roasted pigs, medium for $240 and large for $270. Woot!"

The guy on the phone asked which would we prefer, &#34;dining room or patio&#34;. I said which is better he said dining room. Flash forward to us getting there at 7:30 and we are placed up atop of the restaurant where it is the only non busy portion of the place. I was pretty annoyed considering I called ahead and he told me the dining room was better. Clearly the patio was a much better option!

Overall our server was very flustered but did the best she good especially as it died down around 830ish. Our tacos came out 25 minutes before out pizza which made for a long awkward break. 

This place has a lot of great qualities but I&#39;m still annoyed he convinced me to sit in the dining room when I called ahead and then got suck up in the rafters with barley any other tables.

It has taken the owners a good long time to get this place open but based on our first visit, it was worth the wait.

Atmosphere - the patio (just outside the giant garage doors, is on Tennyson and is large and comfortable). Love the table and seating, but they need to add some umbrellas as the afternoon sun will bake patrons in the afternoon during the summer months. I can&#39;t comment on the inside atmosphere except to say that it is large and includes a nice indoor/outdoor bar as well as a second level. I&#39;m assuming that this place will be very noisy when the garage doors are closed and the restaurant is full.

Service - again, we were there for the soft opening however we had zero complaints in terms of service. Or server, Abby, was very friendly and helpful. She did to hesitate to make menu suggestions and asked for lots of feedback on how they could improve - this is a very good sign and a testament to the fact that the owners know what they are doing.

Food - My hubby and I shared a small three-cheese pizza and three street tacos along with a couple delicious, ice-cold beers from Ratio and Call to Arms (next door). We started with the Arugula Salad which was stellar - lots of very fresh-spicy arugula dressed with just the right amount of vinaigrette, topped with a generous amount of shaved parmesan cheese and toasted sunflower seeds. We scarfed down the salad and commented that this, in itself could be a light and tasty meal. No complaints.

Tacos - we shared three street tacos, which could easily be a shared lunch for two. The barbacoa was tender and very flavorful, the carnitas was very smokey in flavor and delicious although I would prefer my carnitas to be a bit crispier. The fish taco consisted of a very mild white fish topped with a slightly-spicy-tangy sauce, shredded cabbage and radishes. All three were very different and equally delicious.

Pizza - Tennyson has is fair share of pizza places so it&#39;s really hard to stand out. I&#39;ve had the pizza from Kaos on Pearl Street and have always loved it. This is the same pie - very thin, with a light crust which is fully cooked by &#34;bends&#34; easily without being limp. It&#39;s very similar to pizza that I&#39;ve had in Italy. The sauce is tomatoey but not too sweet - you can taste the oregano without it being overwhelming. Lots of cheese - very tangy.

Minor nits - they use paper napkins, and I would prefer cloth and there was not any salt/pepper, crushed red-pepper on the table. Again, this is just a minor nit.

So, well done Mas Kaos. I&#39;m hoping that you continue to serve great food and offer excellent service after you are fully open to the public. Was Kaos isn&#39;t just another &#34;pizza place&#34; on Tennyson, it&#39;s a welcome addition to the neighborhood which deserves high praise."

Since we live so close, I really wanted to love this place and waited until now to review to let them work out the kinks but each experience leaves me short of a solid dining experience. I think they have a great space and the outdoor patio/bar is the perfect summer spot. What has brought me back is the location and ambiance, not the food or service. 

The food is not bad but nothing I have tried has wowed my taste buds to actually crave having it again. The pizza&#39;s are ok but there is so much competition on Tennyson that it wouldn&#39;t be my first or second choice on the street. We also tried a gluten free version and I could not recommend that to anyone. If you can&#39;t eat the normal crust, don&#39;t order the GF pizza - trust me! The tacos are better but they are pricey and they end up being so soggy and falling apart quickly. The shrimp and pork belly are the best in my opinion. The guacamole comes with boring tortilla chips from a bag - which for a place selling tacos doesn&#39;t make sense to me. A pasta dish we tried was incredibly heavy on the garlic and lacking flavor besides that. Tiramisu wasn&#39;t bad.  

The service could use improvement. We were quoted 30 minutes on opening night and it took 2 hrs - big difference but I give them a pass on opening night. Service has been hit or miss based on the server we&#39;ve gotten but something that has been consistent each time I&#39;ve gone is that the people bringing our tacos never know which tacos they are. I realize a lot of them look similar but they should find out what they are before bringing them over and just saying &#34;tacos?&#34; when the whole table ordered different tacos. Then they try to guess which is terrible. It doesn&#39;t make you excited to finally get your food after waiting when the server&#39;s can&#39;t even recognize what it is. I hope this place makes some changes and focuses on educating their servers and creating great flavors in their dishes."

I can&#39;t quite remember what pizza we had, but it was similar to a supreme pizza. The 14&#34; pizza is plenty for 2 people and it&#39;s also pretty good pizza. I didn&#39;t try anything else, so I can&#39;t speak to the tacos, etc., on the menu. I also had a couple of the cream ales from Station 26 - this is a pretty solid beer and I&#39;m glad they have it on tap.

The only downside is that they close their kitchen at 9, which is SO EARLY. I wish they would stay open later. They also have a great patio, which will be awesome in the summer."

Posole was delicious. Loaded with pork and a fragrant broth with lots of spice. A good deal for $6.
Excellent service, again.

12JUL2016

+ Lengua taco. Tender.
+ Guacamole and chips. Two huge scoops of guac and fresh chips. It is worth the $8 USD.

04JUN2016

-- Italian Grinder. Uh, no. No cheese. Seriously? Wrong roll (A bocadillo roll is not a grinder roll.). I grew up in the Northeast and know what a grinder is. This was not. $8 wasted. The meats are good.

15MAY2016

+ We tried the: order and have it delivered to Call to Arms Brewing.
Perfect execution and delicious food.
Happy.

I was effusively welcomed by Patrick Mangold-White this afternoon when we stepped into Mas Kaos.
They are open for pizzas--only for take out/delivery to Call to Arms Brewing.
Beer and pizza. Who would think these go together? Genius, I tell you.
A brand new very expensive wood-fired pizza oven to make delicious pies.

Tuesday lunch was delicious.
Arugula salad with lots of shaved Parmigiano.
4 cheese pizza with fresh-tasting tomato sauce and it is foldable.
Incredible tacos redolent with smokey aromas.
Excellent service.

+ Trendy Edison bulbs.

+ Patio (needs brollys - 2 days later there are brollys, yea)
+ Tortillas de maiz and not tortillas harina de trigo (México is tortillas de maiz)

- Paper napkins

It is going to be a huge success on Tennyson."

Located on Tennyson St near old Eliches probably the hottest restaurant scene in Denver. This place is slick..2 floors and a hot patio. Tacos are good..hipster kind. Pizza rock. RB had Pizza it was fantastic. I had the small but huge Cesar salad and spaghetti with two huge meatballs.  The balls were better then the pasta..should&#39;ve stuck with the pizza. Again huge portions. This place is hopping..very popular.

We have been to MK probably 6 times now since they opened and can say with all certainty that they have become one of our favorite destinations on Tenny. The quality of the food and service have steadily increased since opening, and the entire staff seem to have gotten into their groove. 

People are really friendly here, the food is varied and very tasty, and the location marked with indoor and outdoor seating is excellent. The vibe is definitely younger, a little more upscale clientele but family friendly."

Was here on a Saturday afternoon and sat inside, near the kitchen. The kitchen staff was blaring their 70&#39;s rock music and singing at the top of their lungs. The kitchen music was competing with the restaurant&#39;s music. The sounds and language coming out of the kitchen was extremely amateur and unprofessional, I felt like I was in a bar run by kids. Although the restaurant had only a handful of customers, I noticed new customers had to wait a few minutes before anyone would acknowledge and seat them. This is easy enough to correct, some of the staff needs to receive a little training and discipline.

Now, the food. I have a gluten intolerance and I appreciate Mas Kaos states on the menu that the food is prepped in the same area as other foods. I wasn&#39;t too concerned because a small amount of cross contamination usually does not bother me. I wanted to try both a taco and a pizza, so I ordered one carnitas taco and one cheese &amp; Italian sausage pizza. The pork on the carnitas taco had a nice smokey flavor and I was also a fan of the pizza&#39;s sauce and cheese. My husband loved his taco and his non-GF pizza.

Now, onto the bad. 30 minutes after eating I immediately knew I consumed something containing gluten. The more I think about it, it doesn&#39;t surprise me after sitting near the kitchen and hearing what was going on in there. I can imagine the kitchen staff did not take too much care in the prep of GF food. Too bad because I really liked this place, but if I become sick after eating there, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll return anytime soon."

I really liked the barbacoa taco. The pizza crust has a nice burn to it with enough soft dough to balance it. As with our first visit, the service was also great. One thing I took notice this time which I did not originally was the different options available on the menu. Items from sandwiches to pasta to kids meals.

Horrible service--- can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re understaffed or just not properly trained. My guess is the latter as we got here at happy hour when there were 2 tables, and still had to ask our server to order. Too many great eating spots in Denver to suffer through poor service with a clearly untrained staff. I&#39;d go to Dos Santos in uptown all day long for the best tacos around (and great service).the expediters drop food, and yet don&#39;t clear dirty plates.

When you ask to move don&#39;t have your hostess fling your menus on the next table and say &#34;is this okay&#34; and walk away. As a chef in RINo I would be embarrassed if this is how my front of house treated customers. No complaints about the food here but the service I&#39;d give zero stars. My mom lives a three minute walk away and was excited to come. She left very upset.

Despite a busy Friday night with a wait we were greeted warmly and grabbed some cocktails.  They got us seated quicker than expected and our server was very attentive and friendly.  I thoroughly enjoyed every taco we ordered. (Carnitas, Lengua, Queso and bean, Barbacoa, Pork Belly). I had to fight my wife for the last carnitas.  The salsa verde was consistently the bomb.

We were stoked to try this place out a few weeks after the &#34;kaos&#34; of a grand opening.  It seemed like forever before they opened their doors.  I&#39;m fairly familiar with their tacos as they parked the food truck in front of Call to Arms during construction of the restaurant.  Service was a little spotty for a half full restaurant (waited over 10 minutes to get a drink order in and another 10 to order food) but I give them some credit for being new.  I was also not too excited to see a $9 &#34;coin&#34; marg with house tequila.  Price goes up from there as you choose higher end booze.  They&#39;re $5 during happy hour. In comparison the specialty drinks at El Chingon are pricier but not something I can easily make at home and the awesome margs at Pinche are $7 outside of happy hour.  Our bill was over $50 for two margs, salsa and chips and 6 tacos. My opinion I guess.  Anyhow, their salsa verde is better than most places in the neighborhood.  I also loved their barbacoa.  They smoke everything on the patio in the morning.  Great flavor.  Other taco stand-outs were the lengua, pork belly, bean and queso and scallops.  The mushroom was way over salty.  The atmosphere was a little cold in comparison to other spots in the neighborhood.   First impressions though...We&#39;ll be back."

We walk in, 10 minute wait for table on the patio, we tell the host that&#39;s fine and are about to give him our name. My girlfriend points out a table and asks, &#34;is that one open?&#34; Another host walking by stops in her tracks and snaps, &#34;There&#39;s already 3 people in front of you!&#34; at my girlfriend, then keeps walking and muttering. You&#39;d think for a new restaurant they&#39;d be happy to have people coming in! We weren&#39;t even upset about the wait in the first place. 

Moseyed over to the bar and sat for 12 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged the 4 of us, rudely asked what we wanted, then interrupted us mid-order demanding IDs. Starts wiping down the dirty bar (finally) and runs the rag into my hand without a word! He then starts loudly gossiping about another employee to initial angry hostess girl across the bar. So awkward! We had to ask for menus, then had to carry them ourselves to the table when we finally got one. 

Food was edible but certainly nothing that I&#39;d go back for. Had to ask twice for a napkin mid-messy taco. Prices are reasonable and the decor and ambiance are great, but we felt like we were inconveniencing everyone working there just by existing.

The indoor/outdoor feel is great and I love that it&#39;s not packed with TVs. However, The first time I dined there I was underwhelmed. The vast options of food made me wary out of the gate. So many things to cook and prepare made me wonder if this place was a jack of all trades and master of none. Sadly, my hunch was confirmed. I tried several tacos, which I had high hopes for as the yummy smells from the smoker outside had ultimately lured me in. They were OK and expensive. The coin margaritas were also OK but on the sweet side and the service was also OK. Even the chips and salsa were only average and the serving sizes for the salsa were very small. Rating = OK.

I decided to give it a second chance a few weeks later, in honor of a fair shot. We ordered chips and salsa, clams with linguini, pepperoni pizza, multiple types of tacos, and salads. The server came back and said they sold the last clam and linguine which seemed odd so we switched to spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza was the only thing that came out hot. Everything else was lukewarm and the carnitas were mushy. We asked for extra pineapple for the al pastor and were charged $1 for a small ramekin. The salad was good. The spaghetti was a huge serving but flavorless. 

Unfortunately, there are too many great places in the neighborhood now than to spend a fair amount on average food. 

Mas Kaos, you let me down. Pick something you&#39;re excellent at and stick with it."

I dropped by last week for lunch while running some errands. I had been watching for the opening for some time and was glad to hear they finally got going. It was a beautiful day and they had all the doors open with a wonderful breeze blowing. The space is open and accommodating without feeling impersonal. Everything from the stone bar to the and light open feeling made me very comfortable.

On to the food. I was alone and my wife loves pizza so I decided to go with tacos. Pizza will have to wait for another visit. I decided on 3 tacos, the Sea of Cortez, a grilled shrimp and al pastor. They were delicious and huge. A great balance of heat, bright and savory. Did I mention they were huge? Normally I can work through 3 tacos pretty easily. I was completely satisfied afterwards. Of course my draft Pacifico day drinking helped that out.

for just being open I did not notice any real amount of early bumps in the road. I&#39;m sure with time this will become even better as they refine the operation. I&#39;ll definitely be making the trip back to try the pizza with my wife."

The atmosphere is wonderful, a large outdoor patio, an open and airy indoor space with soaring ceilings and a large bar, additional seating in an upstairs loft, and an open kitchen. 

The menu was a creative blend of Mexican street food and pizza, pasta, and wonderful appetizers.  We ordered the Charcuterie platter, which was one of the largest in town, with an excellent choice of cheeses and salumi.  We particularly enjoyed the triple cream brie and gorgonzola, with the toasted baguette. The pizzas had that tasty thin, crisp crust that Kaos does so well, with options for traditional, creative, and &#34;make your own&#34; toppings. As is the case at the original  Kaos location, the wine list is a carefully chosen selection of excellent price for value options. The service was friendly, informed and prompt. and the staff appeared to be enjoying one another and the guests! 

Although we do not live in the neighborhood, we will certainly make the effort to return, especially when the weather warms and we can enjoy the patio."

Went in last Friday and stood at the hosts stand for several minutes as the host seemed baffled on where to seat people. We got sat upstairs and enjoyed the design of the restaurant. Our server arrived and was quite socially awkward as he just looked at us and said he would bring is waters then walked away. We didn&#39;t see him for another 20 minutes. When he returned we placed our drink order and had to stop him from leaving to place an appetizer order. The garlic bread was dry, cold, burned on the ends and had whole uncooked pieces of garlic on it (not tasty at all and not roasted). The cheese sticks were simply a small pizza with cheese on it, the crust was torn several places, and the cheese was greasy. The ultimate kicker... The marinara is CANNED?! In this day and age, why would I pay this much for dinner to have canned marinara sauce and greasy cheese?? Our pizzas arrived next, the pepperoni were large but the top of the pizza had a layer of grease I used 4 napkins to soak it up. The crust was soggy and limp with very little flavor. While eating I watched the bartenders mix drinks and it is quite apparent that they did not know what they were doing. One routinely violated health codes by using a glass to scoop ice out of an ice bucket. He then used a shaker to mix drinks, when short he would use the shaker to scoop more ice to top off drinks. He then would make another drink without so much as a rinse of the shaker. My beer was poured from the tap and set on the outside bar counter in the sun to warm up while making drinks for the rest of our table. 

This restaurant needs some serious help overall or it will fail miserably. I will not be returning for a long time, if ever."

I&#39;m sticking with 4 stars because of the atmosphere and food has improved since our first time in about a month ago. I&#39;m happy to learn the chips aren&#39;t out of a bag, but rather made by locals and brought in every morning. I will say I prefer chips at others places better, but I&#39;m happy to know they are supporting local! Again, food the past two go arounds was much better. The salads are great! However, we were disappointed in the service. The bartenders weren&#39;t very pleasant to be around. One time, while sitting at the bar, a server brought back two margaritas and said to the bartender, &#34;I guess they didn&#39;t like the margs...&#34; The bartender&#39;s response while customers were within close proximity should have been apologetic in my opinion... However his response was crass and said, &#34;well you can&#39;t please everyone, whatever&#34; and then continued to complain about it to the customers sitting at the bar. Awkward! Then someone came in to place a pizza order to go... It was taking a bit longer than anticipated, and instead of the bartender kindly explaining there must be a longer wait or going to check on the mans pizzas, he openly bashed the kitchen staff! 

The next time we were in we overheard a different bartender go back into the kitchen requesting olives... Again was very rude and loud and acted annoyed that he had to go get olives. 

It&#39;s awkward to hear bartenders complain and act rudely about customers, and then go on and on, especially when they are in the service industry. 

I debated updating my review, but after reading other customers similar experiences a or customer service, I decided to update, in hope it will help the service approve across the board and really make this place reach the 5 stars it could easily obtain with a few tweaks!"

Timeline for the pizza to be done on a Friday night was 35 minutes which is average. The place itself is cool however, check your pizza before you leave the place for take out.  The regular pizza was burnt black both on the top and the bottom and the gluten free pizza was burnt a little on the edges and the bottom. What dumb ass thinks it&#39;s OK to give this type of product to a customer and think it&#39;s OK? WTFO!!!  What parts that weren&#39;t burnt didn&#39;t taste too bad, but it will be quite some time before I go back. YOU CAN GET BETTER PIZZA ELSEWHERE AND CLOSE!

Update. Well we&#39;ve given this place a few more tries over the last month. We dined in once the pizza was okay that time however the service was lacking. Had to ask a couple times for a few things from the server. It was busy but not that busy. And then a couple weeks ago we got the pizza and ate it at the pub behind the restaurant. And they really burnt the pizza that time. Enough  that it made the bottom of the plates as well as the pizza pan completely block the bottom of the pizza was entirely charred. And now tonight we ordered two pizzas for take out. They got one that was okay and the second one the bottom of the pizza was 50% covered in char. I told the gal that I was picking the pizza up from that I really was not happy and that I think I need to get my pizza somewhere else if this is all the better they can do. And she gave me the excuse that well it&#39;s a Wood-Fired oven and sometimes it&#39;s hard to gauge the pizza. Really! I told her by now you guys should have figured it out all you have to do is pull the pizza out a couple minutes sooner. We&#39;re done with this place we are no longer going to buy pizza from this place I have not tried any of the other food but we&#39;re going to get our pizza elsewhere. The pizza we had tonight reminded me of if I went out and licked the grates of my used Grill and then took a bite of pizza. If this is all the better they can do with pizza they need to get the pizza off their menu!!!"

Sure you could go to Qdoba or Chipotle, both of which are based here in Mile High, but IP&#39;s is so much better. 

Anyone who mixes up the meat + toppings before rolling up the burrito is a genius. And even though I prefer nachos to a burrito any day, the entire concept is just too good not to mention.

My order of choice is steak nachos with black beans and pico de gallo. It&#39;s probably the least authentic Mexican dish one could order but hey, I can barely pronounce &#34;gracias&#34; properly. Add a $5 margarita to the order and you&#39;ve got a very happy customer.

I came on a Thursday evening with my friend for dinner, and it was nice that the place wasn&#39;t that packed. We had to wait behind a few people-overall the line seemed to move pretty fast. I ordered a burrito. I liked that you could choose whole wheat vs white tortillas unlike chipotle/qdoba, and that that they mixed all of my contents at the end of the line vs just wrapping the burrito-it made all the ingredients evenly distributed vs me getting a giant bite of rice with no meat when I ate. There were also a few extra ingredients you won&#39;t find at chains (I got cilantro on mine). But honestly I felt the flavor was lacking. My burrito was good, but it certainly wasn&#39;t great. My steak tasted fine and was cooked properly, but it tasted like they&#39;d just slapped a steak on the grill without marinating or seasoning it. The rice was just rice-no cilantro lime or anything. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be comparing it to the bigger chains, but if that&#39;s who they&#39;re trying to compete against, I think they have some work to do."

They have this Colorado Green Chili thing down right.  Tastes like the rest, but not as spicy as I was hoping for. It was freakin&#39; amazing, and a lot leaner than I would expect from carnitas too! I should have asked for more cilantro.  I could have eaten it all if I had asked for more!  It was so big.  We don&#39;t have AC in the car, so this really helped get a good sweat going!   I wish it was hotter though.  Should have asked for the thai peppers they said was in the sauce!

The service I&#39;ve received has been decent-pretty good so my issue is with the flavors... there just aren&#39;t many. It always seems like seasoning was left out, leaving your meal bland and tasteless. For Mexican-inspired dishes that should be exploding with flavor, this is unacceptable.

I got chicken quesadillas, they were pretty good &amp; the guac was yummy. My friends had tacos and burritos. The burrito looked amazing and was huge. I was pretty impressed that they could get a trio of tacos all different meats too. Prices were pretty good &amp; staff were friendly."

Finally got to be honest every time I come in it is the worst customer service. They have no concept of customer service AT ALL!! 

A few times there s this girl that is about 5&#39;5 short brown hair and has a bad attitude EVERYDAY!!! Omg... I even think she could be a manager. Honestly TERRIBLE! 

This places location was for working people getting lunch! These people want customer service! Give it to your customers and dont SCOWL every day to your customers. 

Yikes looking for bad customer service and honestly average burritos or tacos this is you place. If not go somewhere else and pay half of what they have and 10 times better customer service!"

Regardless of the mediocre service i still over tipped because usually they are at least a little grateful. Fuck this shit. This place is losing its appeal and professionalism to millenial, unthankful, unengaging and unprofessional bartenders who can&#39;t thank someone who is a solid regular multiple times a week. I&#39;ve had it with this place. I&#39;m sick of this bullshit cocky attitude this place has developed towards their patrons. It used to be 100% of the time cool. But this new wave of whatever the fuck they are has lowered the bar to about 45%.....9/10 drinks are margaritas. Don&#39;t flaunt your shit that much. Even the people on the food line are not cool anymore. A few here and there are cool but pretty much I will not be returning here again. I live 3 blocks from here. This has been my staple neighborhood estsblishment for QUITE some time now. This is the final draw. Just lost a customer of 3-4 times a week. Faux paux hipster hair styles and ironic bicycle tattoos on your calf doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re cooler than everyone else.
Thank your patrons always. Especially when it&#39;s a cash tip. Especially when it is above and beyond what you shoud get in the first place."

1. free guac if you don&#39;t do dairy
2. addictively seasoned meats
3. they mix up your burrito&#39;s contents before wrapping so you have a little of everything every bite
4. if you&#39;re in a touring band, they will feed you and the crew for free
5. a full bar, should the booze be a priority for you
6. 9 times out of 10, great rock and roll playing
7. part-surly-part-charming staff that make you feel welcome and amused at the same time

There are of course things I don&#39;t love about the place. 

For one, even though its staff are certainly of a particular sub-culture, you get all kinds in here - I&#39;m not crazy about brosefs and business people and college kids. But I suppose if you&#39;re as perturbed by the average white schmo as I am, your business won&#39;t succeed. So good on them for knowing how to appeal to the masses?

For two, parking seriously sucks during busy hours and since this is a full bar, people treat it as such, staying HOURS. For those of us who are of the eat-and-run variety, battling for a place to park just for five minutes gets old fast. 

I&#39;m particularly into the carnitas/pork as well as the big fish burrito (tempura fish with a tasty slaw). 

For me, I want to avoid the noisy crowded peak night hours as much as humanly possible, getting my stuff TO GO. Otherwise definitely one of my favorite places to get a tasty burrito."

I ordered the chicken tacos. Everything looked fresh and hot! The biggest down side was that everything I wanted on my tacos was an extra charge. I would compare the flavor and quality to Chipotle right now the street. I might pick this place over Chipotle if I didn&#39;t have to pay extra for basic stuff. (Pepper&#39;s, sauce, ect.)

Same enjoyable food as the other locations (tasty queso, breakfast tacos, and burritos done right) and great happy hour, but it&#39;s the location and setup that make this place a favorite. I&#39;m feeling especially nerdy tonight, so let&#39;s do a numbered list of my reasons why:

1) They have a stage for live music, and the setup of the building facilitates it well. It&#39;s one of my favorite venues during UMS.
2) They have a HUGE patio with misters.
3) Large bar with a nice tap list.
4) It&#39;s on SoBo, so it&#39;s easy to roll over here on the way back to the Alameda light-rail station or take a break from the scene up north.
5) The staff seems to enjoy working at this location.
6) Spacious layout inside and out.

In short, this place just fits SoBo so well while providing some tasty eats and suds with your fun."

I feel like it&#39;s essentially a louder, drunker Chipotle with a bocce ball court. Clearly people do not come here for the food. It&#39;s a&#39;ight, but really nothing spectacular. Maybe the bar is a lot better?

The employees were ridiculously friendly, can&#39;t fault Pete&#39;s at all for that. The portions aren&#39;t huge, so that&#39;s another plus. I also really liked the non-smoking patio. My main complaint is with the &#34;cheese&#34; sauce they defiled the nachos with. Had it not been for that, I&#39;d give them another star. 

There is far worse food, but also so much better."

I just moved to Denver from the east coast, and one of the things I really missed is Moe&#39;s Mexican Grill.  Everyone has their favorite fast-casual Mexican place, and Moe&#39;s was mine.  The food at Illegal Pete&#39;s is like a slightly better version of that, in a way cooler atmosphere that is a much better place to hang out.  I love getting a huge salad topped with chicken, and then all of the veggies, salsas and other goodies along the way.  Super filling, healthy and fresh.  The only thing I wish they had was a salsa bar.

The shaded patio is awesome too.  And it seems like a spacious place.  The line was to the door on Friday around noon, but it moved quickly and I&#39;d expect there to be a line at lunchtime (if there wasn&#39;t it&#39;s probably not a good omen).

Prices seem reasonable too... $7 for a loaded salad with chicken (you can get all the usual burrito fillings on it, except guac is extra).  And speaking of paying extra for guac, I totally don&#39;t mind... avocados are like $2 at the store, so paying an extra $1.50 for a hearty scoop seems totally reasonable."

They serve from food warmers which means you are not going to get hot food by the time you have all the fixins added (they should micro it or offer too). 

The typical Mexican food made by Americans who have no clue on how real or close to real mexican food should taste. No flavor in my pork burrito, nothing that a little seasoning of mexican herbs and spices could&#39;t fix, but Mr. Pete doesn&#39;t seem to get it, yet the customer continue to pour in????? My first and last visit. 

Well the folks at the fix&#39;in table should wear a hat and beard net as there facial and head hair can easily fall into the food being made--yuk.

Bad news was my Bloody Mary wasn&#39;t all that great.  No garnishes (boo!) and the flavor was off in a way that I couldn&#39;t really put my finger on.

Illegal Pete&#39;s is a genuinely fun place to hang out.  The company&#39;s directive is, &#34;to make each Illegal Pete&#39;s location the kind of place where you can go to celebrate humanity with other humans.&#34;  In my opinion, that goal has been reached and surpassed.

Illegal Pete&#39;s has a very hip, chill vibe.  The crowd is largely made up of urban Millennials and Gen Xers.  Picture cool cats with tats and brightly-colored jeans and you just about got it.  There&#39;s also live music in the evenings.  Don&#39;t fret if you have a fanny pack and two left feet.  The food and drinks are worth the journey; and, everyone there is super nice. 

Speaking of food....there are a lot of wonderful food choices.  Illegal Pete&#39;s has burritos, taquitos, quesadillas, tacos, salads, and more!  All of their meat items are pure in that they are antibiotic- and hormone-free.  And, it&#39;s easy to stay on course if you are trying to eat healthy with options like preservative-free and whole wheat tortillas.  By the way, everything is made fresh.  Don&#39;t forget to hit up the bar for a margarita or beer!!

This is a wonderful place for groups to get together and hang out, although the space is tight.  That includes parking.  If you are planning on hanging out awhile, I suggest getting there early in the evening to get squared away.

Have a great time!!"

I recommend the pork or fish anything from tacos to burritos as they do fresh ingredients well...go with the hot salsa and hot sauces on the items here as they are a little bland without.

You can take families, a date, or just yourself here....which I like that type of place to go to.  More salt and seasoning would make your dishes completely off the chain."

Really? You can&#39;t melt real cheese on the nachos? Or heat up the chips to melt real cheese? There are so many ways to do melty cheese without resorting to colored lard. Come on guys.
Also, when my asked for a beer, the cashier said we had to go to the bar. Really? So I can pay a tip for popping a top. Come on ... either get me the damn beer or put a cooler behind you at the register. 
Other than that, the place is cool, stepping it up just like Chipotle does in proving that fast food doesn&#39;t have to mean crap food. If they change even one of those two in or complaints, five stars, easily.
I forgot to mention that this restaurant is Paleo friendly. Niman Ranch meats and options galore make it a simple meal that you configure yourself."

Pete&#39;s has, hands down, the BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO IN DENVER.

Two tips: 
1) You can substitute guacamole for dairy (though they don&#39;t usually mention it). If you can hold the cheese and sour cream--you&#39;ve got a one-way ticket to free guac!

2) Give the &#34;extra hot&#34; salsa a try. I&#39;m not sure why they call it that, since it&#39;s not so much hot as more of a &#34;smoky Thai&#34; and has a wonderful flavor over a pleasant heat."

I&#39;ve ordered a variety of items from IP and I&#39;ve been impressed with each and every single one! I&#39;ve had their burritos, quesadillas, tacos and more. My personal favorite is an order of the chips and queso for the whole table to share..it&#39;s the perfect appetizer. I also really enjoy the bar at IP&#39;s as well. They have a great selection and they&#39;re decently priced as well. I&#39;ll always want a Dos Equis with my burrito as long as its available. 
The staff members are very friendly and quick with a smile on their face. They have a bunch of great menu options as well as add-ons. I enjoy their selection of hot sauces and love trying a different one each time. The vibe inside is very warm and inviting and they usually have good music playing.

They have lots of local beers on tap (get the Funkworks Saison!) for good prices and a decent bottle offering, too. 

The lighting is divided to be brighter on one side and lower lighting on the other, depending on your mood and company.

For $4.25 you can get a massive burrito with all the fixins: eggs, potatoes, cheese, salsas etc. with an additional $0.65 for chorizo or $1 for bacon. I&#39;m a huge fan of their bacon breakfast burrito, but some of their workers (larger-built men with hats) consistently fail to provide a decent amount of food in my burritos and usually consists mostly of toppings like jalapeños, olives, and a ton of salsa. Comparatively, the other workers (petite women) consistently give a desirable portion of bacon, eggs, potatoes and toppings. 

I&#39;m not too sure about the regular portioning but there seems to be a huge difference in burrito size with whomever&#39;s on the other side of the counter in the mornings. Also, the same thing happens to my boyfriend with his chorizo breakfast burritos and regularly gets skimped when those guys are behind the counter. Mind you -- we are both not overweight and are of average build so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re requiring a ton of food to eat. 


I just don&#39;t enjoy taking majority bites of tortilla, jalapeños, olives and salsa first thing in the morning and would like a decent breakfast of at LEAST a good portion of eggs.. Like c&#39;mon, I know they don&#39;t skimp out on rice and beans during lunch!"

The rice and meats are also more seasoned at Chipotle than Illegal Pete&#39;s.  But nevertheless, I still enjoyed the food here.  

They were playing really loud rock music so it was a bit tough to have a conversation in there.  It wasn&#39;t a good time to get to know someone, that&#39;s for sure.  Illegal Pete&#39;s has great hours, I love how they are open late.  They also offer a happy hour and a full bar, how cool is that?

At Illegal Pete&#39;s they made the surprisingly simple discovery that a gargantuan burrito is best when they take a spoon and smear all the ingredients together. It&#39;s not complicated, but it does mean every bite contains every little bit of deliciousness. 

And those smeared concoctions can be different nearly every time you come in as Illegal Pete&#39;s had a much larger menu of options than its Chipotle competition. Personally, I really like the potato burrito with their thick and satisfying guacamole and hearty beans. So much food, you practically forget it&#39;s vegetarian.

Another thing Illegal Pete&#39;s has over Chipotle (and this one in particular), is that Pete&#39;s has always been more of a hang-out place. Chipotle you get your food and leave. Here you can grab some food, grab some beers, play some games, grab some more beer. Before you know it, the night is done. It&#39;s not just a burrito place. It&#39;s a burrito place with a full and well-stocked bar. And this one also has an expansive patio and a double-sided bar setup that keeps the drinks flowing. Great design overall.

Service is always done excellently by Denver&#39;s most qualified burrito and beer swilling hipsters.

They get points for rehabbing an old car lot eyesore - place is cute enough:  big patio (check), some parking (check), required roll-up garage doors in front (check), lots of big screen TVs (check), overall an upscale Chipotle environment (double check).

Also, points awarded for what looked to be a staff comprised of full-blown, inked out, furry faced, in need of a bath hipsters.  Can&#39;t judge a book by its cover.  Perhaps the nicest most welcoming staff I&#39;ve encountered in a fast/casual type place in a very long time - even to a couple of alter kockers like us.

Food and booze - meh.  If you like Chipotle - you&#39;ll love this place because they have a more extensive menu.  The queso, while a little runny, was flavorful and the chips were fresh ($5).  Hornitos margs $8.50 each - very tall, mostly sweet and sour.  Big selection of Colorado beers though if that&#39;s your thing.  Should have stopped there but we both ordered a burrito.  HUGE.  Smothered in green chili which I thought was oddly spiced - kind of &#34;floral&#34; and no heat (at least it was green though) - didn&#39;t care for it and they really poured it on.  We barely made a dent in all this carb overload and spent close to $50.

So, if you are a Chipotle, Qdoba, California style (rice and beans heavy) burrito lover this place may be your new hangout.  I suspect this place is going to go gangbusters because of the booze, cool space/patio, hipster party vibe, but not the food.  Just not the style Mexican food we prefer.  Might go back and experiment with getting a &#34;bowl&#34; without the soggy tortilla thing going on but not really in a hurry."

Yes, service is fast, yes they have an impressive patio, yes they have a more extensive menu than other burrito places (oh come on, we all know I&#39;m talking about Chipotle).  

My issue is the price and a touch with the service.  A burrito, salad, and two drinks came to about $22.  Granted we both got guac on our items (and they are generous with it) but that just kind of seemed steep.  The salad was filling and seemed fresh, and I&#39;m sure when I try the nachos (or anything with the queso) I&#39;ll be singing a different tune, but for what we ordered, we both felt it was a little steep. 

And while the line moved quickly, during the assembly of my salad someone asked if I wanted cheese and promptly turned around before I could answer.

Let me start with: I have never had such a humiliating experience at a restaurant, ever. 
It was my first time in an Illegal Pete&#39;s in about two years (I recently moved back to Denver). I went on a Sunday evening to celebrate my friend&#39;s birthday. 

It was a busy night, so when I got in line I had to wait maybe fifteen minutes to order my food. When I got up to the counter, I asked them if I could just order chips and salsa. It was early in the night and I was planning on getting that and maybe a margarita. The first guy at the counter told me to move down the line and place my order with the guy working the cold bar. So, I moved down. When I get to the next &#34;stop&#34; where you add salsa and other toppings, the employee was helping the man in front of me. I waited. After the employee finished with the man in front of me, rather than asking what I need, he grabs the order from the woman in line behind me and starts helping her. 

I am not really bothered by this. I decide I will order the chips and salsa at the end like you can at Chipotle. So, I get to the end of the line and a very similar thing happens. The employee at the cash register rings up the guy in front of me, and then picks up the woman&#39;s order behind me and starts ringing her up. He does not acknowledge I exist. He doesn&#39;t look at me, ask me what I ordered, or ask me if I need anything else. I guess he thought I was just standing there for no reason?? I just waited in line apparently not to order anything.

In that moment, I probably should have interrupted the guy ringing the woman up and reminded him that I still needed to be helped, but I didn&#39;t want to be that &#34;b**ch&#34; who was impatient and rude. I also realized that I didn&#39;t want to bring any attention to myself. I am not a person who likes to &#34;make a fuss,&#34; and honestly, at a restaurant where you should be receiving SERVICE you shouldn&#39;t have to. I ended up feeling humiliated by the whole situation, even though I hadn&#39;t done anything wrong, except act like a polite, patient, normal human being. 

So, I just walked away from the register, and, obviously, not one of the employees even noticed. My friends were confused when I arrived back at my table without food, but I didn&#39;t make it into a big deal because it was supposed to be a celebration.

I can&#39;t believe I can get better service at chain restaurants that pay their employees minimum wage. I feel angry even still when I think about this experience. I will NEVER try to order food from this restaurant. I am not even sure I would go to a different Illegal Pete&#39;s restaurant. I was warned that the employees could be pretentious here-- and clearly I should have listened."

It&#39;s English Pub meets The Regal Beagle.  EXTENSIVE and impressive liquor list (especially the 5 pages of Scotch), and their own beers are both complex and satisfying.  The food is substantially portioned and consistent, and if something is amiss the wait staff is friendly enough to make it right. If you&#39;re into wings theirs are fantastic -- none of those bullshit tiny ass midgety wings that have been rearing their ugly heads as of late on hipster menus. I&#39;m talking PROPER, meaty, wings.

Hidden away on a street where you would not expect to find a restaurant. It looks like an old cottage from 100&#39;s of years ago. However, their beer is modern and so is the food!

The portions are larger than life and delicious. Plenty of beers on tap and lots of space so you don&#39;t feel cramped. You&#39;ll definitely take food home with you. It&#39;s impossible to eat it all here. 

Our server wasn&#39;t great. Service was slow and she got several things wrong. Then we had to wait a while to get the correct things brought out. However, overall it was a great place, great experience and I&#39;ll definitely be back. Don&#39;t miss this place!"

Atmosphere:
The Bar and general eating area is TRULY authentic! To see the interior, is enough of a reason for one visit in and of itself. So, 5 stars on that! The bar itself is amazing and a truly fun place to hang out. There is an outdoor seating area or patio as well and I&#39;ve sat out there a couple of times. It&#39;s nothing special, but there are plenty of TV&#39;s and on Sunday&#39;s they pump the football games onto a screen as well! Overall,  I would say that Bull &amp; Bush is a great place to catch a game pretty much anytime of year.

Food:
The food is good, but is seriously nothing to write home about. It serves it&#39;s purpose and is &#34;great&#34; if you are a couple of pints or long islands into the afternoon or evening. I wouldn&#39;t come here for the food in and of itself. 

I will say that they do have daily specials though that are worth the visit if you are on a budget. So KUDO&#39;s to them for adding this level of service and marketing scheme! It&#39;s worth a visit depending on what the special of the day is, and what you are looking for.

Brunch...The Saturday and Sunday brunch is nothing special. There are drink specials, but no bottomless mimosas or anything like that if you are into that kind of thing. Most of the items for brunch are centered in the &#34;egg&#34; area as well. If you aren&#39;t into that, you will more than likely need to order something off of the main menu.

THERE ARE VERY FEW CHOICES IF YOU ARE VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN...so beware!

Drinks:
This is a TRUE Pub! YAY! If you are into beer and flights, this is a great place to go. Their selection is definitely ABOVE average for the area, and a great place to sample something you maybe haven&#39;t tried before. Their selection in and of itself is worth a visit...especially when tied to the atmosphere. 

As far as liquor or mixed drinks are concerned...after several visits, I&#39;m not impressed. I would not recommend going here if you are not looking for a type of beer. My most recent trip was on a Sunday for brunch and I ordered their &#34;double screwdriver&#34;. The drink was definitely double OJ...light on the vodka. I had one and then decided to up the ante...so I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea with a splash of diet cola. Once again, HEAVY on the diet cola and light on the liquor. I&#39;ve been here 3 times before, and it was the same previously as well, so I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve experienced their &#34;standard&#34; pour at this point. I CAN&#39;T RECOMMEND THEM FOR THEIR MIXED OR LIQUOR DRINKS.

Service:
I&#39;ve had a mixed bag of service experiences here. On a previous visit, we literally had a host get upset at us because we didn&#39;t want to sit in the middle of the room with traffic on both sides. When we were seated (on the patio) the host literally just chucked the menus on the table and said &#34;Whatever&#34; as he walked away. I was incensed, but didn&#39;t write my review that night. It was my FIRST visit. I do feel now, that it is important to note though. My other visits have what I would consider to be average or appropriate service and one gal who was very friendly and helpful. So, I would say it can be a crap shoot on what you receive when you go here. 3 stars on service.

Price:
The price you pay here at Bull &amp; Bush reflects what you expect to receive for the money spent. I wouldn&#39;t say it is a value or it is overpriced. Some items are expensive...ie the Fish and Chips at  $13! But the Ruben sandwich, is a good value and plenty tasty! As I said, the food is nothing special, but for the most part, I feel that you get what you pay for both in quality and quantity. 

Conclusion:
Bull &amp; Bush is a 3-4 star location. 

The highlights are the atmosphere, beer, and plenty of TV&#39;s. 

Lowlights...mixed drinks, quality of food, service, and alternative options for Vegan and Vegetarians."

Food sloooow. Burnt chips, very tasty queso, though. Super hard bread roll that came with my friend&#39;s dish, but awesome green chili, he said. Our meal, salad, and appetizer came within minutes of each other. Not much time to enjoy one before the other, and our table (and the one beside us) was VERY cluttered.

Tough steak; cooked properly, but must be old meat. The Bulls Pride sandwich wasn&#39;t impressive. Bread tasted stale, and the cheese toppings just weren&#39;t great. Cocktails HORRIBLE; tasted like cough syrup. Didn&#39;t have strawberry or raspberry vodka, so replaced with cherry without asking. Bad choice.

Had to ask for water and napkins repeatedly. No silverware with entree, had to use the one that came with the pre-dinner salad (and yes, it was still all there to use). Server not attentive on a VERY slow Saturday night. We were literally the only ones eating. Not impressed. Probably won&#39;t be back."

The waiters just vanish. We sat for almost 15 minutes before walking out (5pm on a Friday). Our waiter seated us and we ordered waters. He never came with the waters but did stand at the end of the bar and talk long enough for us to give up and leave. 

Or maybe they are just going for the English cold shoulder as part of the schtick. If so, it&#39;s the only thing they managed to get right."

Hesitantly tried the Reuben again.  It was perfect.  Bread was thick cut and great for a Reuben.  French onion soup is souper cheesy, souper oniony and great!  I love the onion strings on top.  Once again though, I think it would be nice if they charred the bread or something but the onion strings provided the little crunch I was looking for.  
Patio is really nice and kind of enclosed so they always keep it a comfortable temperature out there.  I have tried a bunch of their beers and they are pretty good... Want to try more hoping I find the one I want to bring home a growler of."

I was seated at the bar with my friend having some drinks and noticed no one was watching the TVs on at the bar, no local sports were on this day and I asked if anyone would mind if the channel was switched, everyone was fine so the bartender asked what channel, I said fox sports 1, and when he switched it he promptly turned it off and said they don&#39;t show MMA because it&#39;s too violent. 

Now normally I would say, ok, I understand it&#39;s not for everyone, different tastes and whatnot, but I couldn&#39;t be more surprised when I saw that they host movie nights and show full length flicks on certain nights. 

Now if these were kids movies or the like it would still be understandable, but almost every movie listed was R rated with graphic violence, to give you an idea Gangs of New York was the next one up. 

Now anyone who&#39;s seen that movie can attest that not only is it way more violent than any combat sport, it carries language and sexual content that no combat sport on broadcast television would. 

This blatant hypocrisy didn&#39;t sit right with me and I will not support an establishment that cherry picks what they will and will not allow so long as it suits them, it&#39;s their right as a business to do that but it&#39;s also my right not to give them my business as a result."

It has all the feels for a proper British pub but that is where it ends.
Both my friend and I thought our beers didn&#39;t taste right - almost like the taps needed cleaned.  We both had burgers, which were decent, but my side of mashed potatoes was lukewarm at best and the potatoes were obviously made from dehydrated potato mix.  It was inedible.  My friend&#39;s fries weren&#39;t very hot either.  Its strange that our food was cold because it was served to us very quickly.
Service was good and again, the decor and layout is pretty cool, it just ends there.  Also, the menu has some random things, like &#39;street tacos&#39;.  This is NOT a Mexican restaurant nor are we in San Diego, so having tacos here just doesn&#39;t make sense."

The patio area is great for large groups and the service was outstanding.  For example, my iced tea was refilled 3 times without having to ask.  The parking lot is nice with plenty of spots and the music at low volume is also a nice touch outside.  They also have free Wi-Fi.  

We ordered nachos, a queso plate, and the spicy shrimp tacos and they were all excellent, especially the shrimp tacos.  Another friend had the Bangers and Mash and said it was very good.

I refilled my 64 oz growler on the way out with the Happy Hop Pilsner for $10.80.  I wasn&#39;t sure if they would fill a growler I had picked up from another craft brewer but they didn&#39;t mind at all.  The bartender was especially expedient and friendly.  They have a refill 9, get one growler free card which is also cool.  The beer was tasty and I can&#39;t wait to try some of their other selections soon.  

All in all my first visit was to Bull and Bush was exceptional and I would recommend checking them out."

My friend and I shared the Gabe&#39;s Nachos and a burger. It was pretty good... but not the best nachos or burger I had...

By now I&#39;ve pretty much drank my way through all the B&amp;B beers, and my personal faves would include: Stonhenge Stout, Don&#39;t Mock Mai Bock, Allgood Amber, Farmhouse Ale, and the ESB. 

Of course no visit is complete without their green chili cheese fries. Seriously, pig out. You won&#39;t regret it.

It was actually quite reminiscent of a very English pub, but the green chili atop my meal was very Denver. The atmosphere this past Sunday evening was absolutely fantastic. The front of the pub had live music and jazz, while the back covered patio had SNF on. I also noticed had we stayed a little later, they also host Sunday night movies. There&#39;s so many good nightly specials every day of the week, but I just so happened to land on Sunday night supper, which was chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and garlic bread smothered with either country gravy or &#34;Colorado style,&#34; with green chili. When in Denver...

The food was both generous in portion and delicious. The chicken fried steak was stellar especially with the topped green chili sauce. This may sound strange, but I was blown away by how good the garlic bread was. It was very well toasted and had a ton of garlic butter flavor. Everything was washed down with a pint of the Stonehenge stout. That stout would have been amazing with some fish and chips, which just so happens to be the Friday night special as well as being all-you-can-eat. I love the reasonable prices, eclectic pub offerings, and delicious beer. And Bull &amp; Bush has a fun atmosphere to boot!"

The second time was for more delicious Man Beer. To my chagrin, they didn&#39;t have any on tap for a growler, but the staff kept me happy by suggesting I leave with some bottles to go. At the time they were $4 a bottle which is a littler bigger than a pint and I was very pleased.

I figured they must have pretty good food and beer with how crowded it was and I was right. I started off with their dunkel which was their beer of the day. It was tasty enough that I had a couple more, and with the daily discount it was only $4 which was a pretty good price.

I started off my food with the green chili which was one of the better ones that I&#39;ve had. It came with some tortillas that were good dippers as well. Then we ordered the beer cheese dip, and that was more than enough food for two of us and tasted pretty freaking good. The cheese was smooth and delicious. Unfortunately we also ordered nachos, which were good as well, but not as tasty as the dip. We also were so full from the dip that we didn&#39;t eat many nachos.

The ambiance of the restaurant is that of an old timey English bar, however it&#39;s a pretty expansive place, so it loses that feel as soon as you realize how big it is. The other thing is that their food and regular price beer is pretty pricey. So be prepared for $10 apps and $15+ meals."

The beer selection is impressive, and as a picky foodie, they have the best selection and flavor for healthy salads, and tacos we have had in a long time.  Yum &amp; 4 thumbs up!!"

They have an awesome covered patio, so every seat is a good one. I have come here for dinner and had good experiences. Our waitress was busy, but it was clear other workers were helping. You know you&#39;ve found a good restaurant when the staff acts as a team, it&#39;s a sign of good management. 

Also they offer a Sunday brunch which is to die for. Excellent drink deals, I believe a mimosa or bloody Mary will only set you back $4. We ordered a cowboy Benedict which had barbacoa on an English muffin and a delicious hollandaise sauce. Also we ordered a ham and cheese stuffed waffle which I will dream about forever. I will definitely return!!"

I was with my fiance doing some Christmas shopping, and once we were done we wanted to get some grub and catch some football. It actually came up when I searched for &#39;Sports Bar&#39;, and it truly is one. It&#39;s also a kick ass brewery, with great food and one of the best atmospheres I&#39;ve been to.

They have a huge menu, and it&#39;s pretty cool because they&#39;ve been open for like 50 years, so they mark all menu items that have been around since the beginning. We were there around noon, Katie went with lunch and I did brunch. She got the Cobb Salad which I have to say looked amazing, and it was huge! I got the Taos Breakfast which was also huge, and packed as much flavor as you possible could onto that plate. Do not pass on the green chili that it&#39;s smothered in. I didn&#39;t think I wanted it (didn&#39;t want something that heavy), but decided to just leave it on - best decision of the day. 

As I mentioned above, it&#39;s also a great sports bar. I came in looking for a specific game, the hostess asked me which game I wanted, referred to her seating chart which also had which games were on what TVs and where, and then sat me in perfect viewing of my game. 

I did a Beermosa with the pilsner and grapefruit juice, it was fantastic. Not sure about that? Trust me and order one, you will not disappointed."

I love how much history there is to this place, you can tell when you pull up, this place has been here forever and all of the area around it has developed over time.

The parking lot isn&#39;t huge but we managed to still find a spot when it was busy. We walked in and it was very dark, definitely a pub feel to it, a place where you can go drink day or night and not know or care what time it might be. Limited TV&#39;s make this place more appealing to the conversational dinner crowd over the sports fans.

The beers here are spectacular. We both had the hefiweizen and were very impressed. Service was decent. My tacos were awesome. The burger my guy ordered was way too overcooked but he was too nice to send it back. Great experience overall, we will definitely be back soon! Maybe just avoid the burgers if you plan to eat here."

I had no idea what to expect in terms of quality of food so this is coming from a pretty objective standpoint.

We started with the Green Chile Bangers and Mash.
If you like sausages and/or mashed potatoes, please do yourself a favor and order this.  I don&#39;t care if you like sausages and hate potatoes or vice versa.  The potatoes were mashed to creamy perfection but it still had a little solid texture (I know this might sound like a poor description but I don&#39;t know how else to put it.)  It was the kind of mashed potatoes you&#39;d find in a fancy steakhouse like Mortons.  That is all secondary to the amazing flavor that is somehow imparted through dark warlock magicks in the kitchen.  Buttery and herby, the flavor spreads around your tongue in a bum rush.

The sausages.. don&#39;t get me started.  Oh geez mon.  They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Flavor was top notch and every bite left me wanting more.  I think they make their own sausages in-house, that&#39;s like the only explanation.  Pretty simple.. great quality ingredients being handled by someone who knows what they&#39;re doing.

I actually can&#39;t recall what I had for my entree at the moment.. the bangers and mash have me in a trance.  I&#39;ll come back and finish this review when I find pictures from my trip."

You can tell the quality of the meat before it meets your gaze by the soup. 

French onion soup is everywhere in Denver I&#39;ve tried to find that masterpiece of greatness for 2 years now. 

I knew by the very first spoon filled bite that this soup was super. That got me excited to get my entree. 

The prime rib was as the soup. The best I&#39;ve had in the area but, still missing a few of my favorite extras. 

I will say they had medium rare prime rib at 8:30pm - so that was awesome! Fellow prime rib lovers that should get you happy if you arrive after dinner hours. 

See you soon Bull &amp; Bush"

They have really great specials and good beer. Keep in mind that the dollar off Bull and Bush beer does not apply to flights. They also have a super extensive whiskey and scotch collection. Be sure to ask for their beverage book if you are interested. 

I started off with The Man Beer which totes itself as Colorado&#39;s IPA. It was pretty good and had a nice hop forward flavor. I also sampled The Man Man, an imperial version of their IPA, and their grapefruit saison. Both were good but not quite what I wanted after my Man Beer. I think in the future I will start with the grapefruit saison.

For food, I was tempted to get their well-received Fish and Chips but decided to go for a snack instead. I ended up getting the Thai Chili Shrimp which consists of crispy shrimp tossed in a Thai Chili Garlic sauce. I appreciated that the bartender was ready with the sriracha before I even finished ordering. I guess I must exude spicy waves of something. My food came out pretty quickly. At first, I wondered if a lime wedge might be better than a lemon wedge, but the juiciness of the lemon really made for optimal squeezing over my dish. The shrimp was well-cooked and not greasy but waffled between being on the colder side and lukewarm. The Thai Chili sauce itself was a bit overly sweet and gluey, but the lemon and sriracha helped to cut that a bit. The generous squeeze of lemon I was able to wrestle out of the wedge actually created an impromptu slaw of the bed of cabbage which was quite tasty. 

Overall, I had a good experience. The beer was good, and the food was decent. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. I definitely look forward to coming back and trying some other things soon!"

Other than that experience has been uphill ever since. On Sundays they have drink specials for mimosas and Bloody Mary&#39;s. I highly recommend the Bloody Mary. It is made fresh and has just the right amount of spice. 
Today we fell in love with the green chili fries and the rueben sandwich, tender meat, creamy cheese and 1000 island. The fries are thin cut and crispy. The bangers taste like a combination of breakfast and bratt sausages. My only other ish - water refills, keep &#39;em comin if my water glass is empty please.

Since that time, I think I&#39;ve visited them at least once every time I&#39;ve came to Colorado.

Why? The beer isn&#39;t bad - it&#39;s not my favorite in a bloated craft beer scene of Denver, but the hop infusions are a wonderful touch! The food - has always been tasty, but sometimes I feel their green chili has been cut down.

Now, honestly, I feel the service is very hit and miss - that&#39;s what keeps it from a five star. The servers operate with blinders on, and if you need something and they walk by, I feel like you have to yell/tap them on the shoulder to get their attention.

Now, the patio is wonderful, but the dining room is fucking DARK - and lots of steps and bumps to trip over. Pick your feet up, boys!"

I ended up ordering two of Bull and Bush&#39;s beers, a stout and the Man Beer, both of which were tasty. We ordered their $5 nacho plate, and man do they give you a lot of food for that price! We planned to order more but were full, so we stopped there. I will definitely be back. We paid less than $30 for 4 great beers and the app, so I was happy about that, too!"

I wanted to like this place so bad, the decor is straight out of England and is a really cool step into the traditional pub life. The up side was a great beer selection including their own and many guest beers. I tried both and liked their beers which were a pretty decent price too! The staff was also friendly and helpful.

The downside- the food was alright at best. It took about 10 minutes to get my beer and about 1 minute to get my food (concerning right?). The food came out so quickly and was cold, maybe I ordered the same thing as an extra from another table that had been sitting. The fries were cold and hard (upside was the jalapeño dust which was good) and the ribs (daily special) were just ok. 

Overall with so many good places around to get good beer I don&#39;t know that the food allows Bull and Bush to compete for me. If you are going just to drink and want a really cool pub atmosphere check it out."

The place looks small but the inside has a ton of indoor/outdoor seating. Warning the parking lot is extremely small so you will probably end up walking a ways down the street.

I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the fact that I enjoyed coming here several years ago, but on my most recent visit I was all but pleased with the beer they brew.  Also, I have to give them credit for offering a decent guest tap list. 

I went here on a whim recently because it had been a long time since I stopped here and remember enjoying their beers.  I walk in on a sunny day and am immediately reminded of how dark and dank the inside is by being blinded until my eyes adjusted.    Not a fan of the dark and dim interior.  The bartender let me taste two of their IPA&#39;s and their grape fruit pale ale. I would&#39;ve opted for a guest IPA, but since the bartender let me try three beers I opted for the Man Beer IPA.

As I was drinking my beer and watching a European soccer game, I contemplated how far my palate has come in the past few years.  A few years ago I thought the Man Beer was a phenomenal IPA, but now I feel like it&#39;s kinda bland."

We tried a few of the beers but nothing really wowed us. The food on the other hand was very good. We had steak and a french dip. The prime rib on the french dip was delicious and the fries on the side were tasty and crispy (the way I like them).

Their green chili is awesome and is more of a medium heat level which is about how I like it so that was great!

I had the Reuben sandwich and it was by far the best Reuben I&#39;ve had in my entire life and I&#39;ve had a ton of them. The only negative were the sweet potato fries that I chose for my side. They were skinny like McDonalds fries only sweet potato. They did not seem to be homemade. There was no sea salt on them they were a disappointment for sure.  It&#39;s the only reason I didn&#39;t give the rating of 5. 

Michael had the Prince hamburger and thought it was great. He thought the beer was pretty epic! We will be back soon!"

1. First time I went in with a friend in the afternoon.  We ordered the mashed potatoes with green chili, and it was good.  Our server, however, disappeared after we received our food.  We were the only ones in there during our entire stay, and we had to wait over a half an hour for her to come out of the kitchen to give us our bill.  There was no one else around to ask where she was.

2. The next time, I went for lunch with a coworker.  The pesto chicken sandwich was delicious, the bartender didn&#39;t seem to care about serving us.  He exuded apathy.

3. Third times a charm, right?  This was by far the worse service I&#39;ve ever received.  Worse than 4 am waffle house next to a hooker hotel bad service.  We ordered waters off the bat because we hadn&#39;t looked at the beer menu yet (i think we had been seated at our table for 15 seconds).  Ten minutes later, our waitress returned, without waters, and took our beer order.  While we were ready to order our entrees at the same time, she only took the beer order and left.  Ten more minutes we get our beers and no waters, and she takes our food order.  Once the food came out, both entrees were wrong.  

There is never a manager on the floor, so the staff does as they please.  I&#39;ll buy overpriced food and beer elsewhere.  Give me some good ole corporate Old Chicago down the street please.  Again, the food is decent.  If it weren&#39;t for the service, I&#39;d probably give it 4 stars.  But the worst, the worst service ever."

We&#39;ve started going pretty regularly on Friday nights for the unlimited fish n&#39; chips deal. The fish is probably the best I&#39;ve had outside of the Pacific Northwest and the UK-- moist inside, crispy outside, and the breading doesn&#39;t fall off when you take a bite.  Other food options have been good as well, but this place is all about the fish n&#39; chips for me.

Plus, their beer is great.  The bitters and ESB are my favorites and remind me of my trip to England, but I haven&#39;t had a bad one yet.  Their dry-hopping is fun.

Service is good, even on busy Friday nights.  I love both the pub ambience inside and the patio with TV&#39;s outside.  And the price tag can&#39;t be beat.  We usually spend under $50 for fish for two, several beers and sometimes and appetizer, which is a steal all things considered.  Their growlers are a good deal, too. There&#39;s daily beer deals and happy hour specials as well.

You can find me here often!"

I have NEVER been disappointed with a single food item!

My go to beers are the Man Beer, Happy Hop and Grapefruit Pale Ale. Its awesome that they brew their own beers here :)

I was skeptical of this and found on their website that they began brewing in 1997.  I guess in the craft beer explosion, they were reasonably early for the US.  We stopped in for lunch and a beer on July 4th.  1971 is definitely believable, the décor certainly has not changed since then.  It is dark, dark, dark, s-o-o-o-o dark inside, even in the middle of a bright sunny day.  It is really not pleasant.

It was fairly hot, so I had a pilsner, that was fine and Ms T selected some version of their man beer, which she deemed was more for a little girl.  They were OK, not anything special.  Their burgers are self- declared &#34;world famous&#34; so we all ordered burgers.  I plan to check around as I travel the world and see if anyone mentions these.  It seems that you can&#39;t go in a restaurant anymore that is not world famous.  I upgraded mine to kobe.  Ms T went with standard cheeseburger and Bro T and TT split a bison version.  Our burgers were good, standard 8 oz pub burgers and are worth ordering again.  Probably 3-1/2 stars.  The buns look too big but were compressible enough to not interfere with eating and were not dry.  The patty itself was moist, but lacked grill flavor and needed seasoning.  Our server brought me a bottle of Cholula for my slaw and it was fine.  It also was used on my burger.

Bro J wanted the Burger of the month as shown on the website, but it had apparently changed on July 1 and the on-line website had not.  By the way, as of July 14, it still has not been updated.  B&amp;B was fine for lunch on this day.  It is not remarkable enough to put a pin in the map, but OK, if you find yourself in the neighborhood.  In the craft brewing world of Colorado, B&amp;B is somewhere in the middle of the pack."

Well for one thing, it&#39;s not as easy for me to get to as other pubs in town. But that doesn&#39;t deter me from visiting. I love the atmosphere, as the dark hardwood and dim lighting really makes for that warm pub feel. Try nabbing the couch seats by the fireplace in the back during the fall and winter, which makes your stay even cozier.

The beer is often very hit or a miss to me. Their double brown ale is amazing, and their dunkel is solid. Their Yule Fuel is also a nice winter warmer/spice beer. Not a huge fan of the regular brown or Ghoul Fuel though. They also host some pretty interesting beer tastings, like their annual Christmas tasting which typically has beers you never thought you&#39;d get, and often from years ago.

So the beer + atmosphere get it to three stars, and the food bumps it up to four. Their burgers are delicious and juicy, especially when Kobe-fied. And their chicken fried steak or chicken is spot on and a LOT of food. Not a huge fan of their fish and chips or French onion soup, but they&#39;re not too bad.

Put it all together, and I am indeed a fan. Plus their logo/name adds a few bonus points as well. For a classic pub and brewery experience, B&amp;B is the good place to be."

We came to drink but did munch on the Hummus plate. The balsamic reduction was delicious....plate lickable!

The food is solid-- I love the green chili and mashed potatoes, although I&#39;m always slightly disappointed in their french onion soup. I&#39;ve heard good things about the fish and chips too but I have yet to try them. The service can be kinda hit or miss, especially around dinner.
The beer is decent, but despite the length of the tap list, there&#39;s very few beers that I find memorable. My boyfriend really likes the Man Beer and while I love a good IPA, there&#39;s just nothing distinctive about it to me.

We sat on the patio, and enjoyed a bottle of wine and the burrata, and we each had a different pasta. The food was good as was the wine, the ambience was great but not anything that made me go &#39;OMG THIS IS AMAZING I NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW RIGHT NOW.&#34; However, our server, Angie, was wonderful and that is the reason for this. 

In my current job, I am constantly challenged to create positive and memorable experiences for guests based on cues I take from my interaction with them. Not many people can truly do that, but Angie did, and her service delivery ensured that we will be back to Cafe Mercato. She mentioned how it was her first week but we would have never known. Both of us that were dining are in the hospitality industry and can easily pick up on a new employee (or disengaged server, etc.), but that was not the case with Angie. The only reason we knew, was because just before she told us it was her first week, we were commenting to each other how nice it was to have someone with experience serving us. She was personable but not too personal - a too-chatty or too-fake server is just as annoying as someone that is disengaged - and we really appreciated the time she took to create a experience for friends who were just wanting to eat, drink, and catch up. Even after paid our bill and finished our wine, she was still checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed.

Well done, we will be back to Cafe Mercato because of her."

My expectations were high because my family chose this restaurant to celebrate my dads birthday. 

Quick description: Classic Italian cuisine. Contemporary, quiet, more upscale setting (I wouldn&#39;t take kids there). 

First impressions can make or break anything. Cafe Mercato&#39;s first impression was, how do you say , not good. Let me list a couple reasons why: 

-We had called way in advance for my dads birthday. You would think, knowing it&#39;s a special occasion, they would set us up with a nice table but instead, we got jammed into a table that was right next to the kitchen and the front door that just felt crammed. My family and I felt like a can of sardines. 

- Entrees just didn&#39;t do it for me. Lacked any real unique flavor. Every dish was generic and mediocre, as if I could have got the same thing from Olive Garden. If I&#39;m paying fine dining prices, I expect some real fine dining dishes. 

- The service was ehh. Although our server was nice he lacked on the &#34;serve&#34; part of his job title. My family had been seated for a good 30 minutes before everyone was asked what they wanted to drink. We also did not have all of our table settings set, even though we had a reservation with the amount of people set weeks before. I find that unacceptable, regardless of how nice the server was. 

- My last complaint, is for all my drinkers out there. The majority of fine dining restaurants I&#39;ve been too, have some sort of speciality cocktails, but to my surprise, they had none. Not a big deal, but a let down nonetheless. 

Our experience wasn&#39;t all that bad as we had some positive notes. Pizza was good, fresh, and had that perfect balance of doughiness and crispiness. The Molten lava cake for dessert, was an excellent dish that had my whole table battling over every bite. A couple positives but not enough to make up for all the negatives. 

Unfortunately, Cafe Mercato did not meet my personal criteria for giving it a second chance and I will not be dining there again. We sadly were left extremely disappointing."

I came here Saturday night as part of a large dinner party with reservations.  The person at the front asked us what party we were with and we responded with our party name, and that we were a group of 12.  She immediately responded &#34;no you aren&#39;t you&#39;re a party of 11.  Someone originally called and said 9 and then she changed it to 11&#34;.  Apparently it&#39;s a big production to add one more seat to a large table!   She begrudgingly added an extra seat, but based on her initial reaction to us I wanted to walk out and give someone else our business.  Later in the meal my husband asked to speak to the manager.  Wouldn&#39;t you know it was the woman that rudely greeted us when we walked in?!  Save your money and go to Olive Garden."

I ended up getting lasagna instead. Seriously heed the warning that the staff here has no personality. The lasagna was really good except for the burnt bottom. Once you pull off the bottom it&#39;s good. I will say that their Gelato is amazingly good. Our waiter Joel was okay just really quiet.

The above scenario may have happened to yours truly recently... But it turned out great. 

I saddled up to the bar and looking over the menu with a couple of recommendations I settled in the ricotta gnocchi. Side note:the bartender pronounced the word with the perfect Italian accent and that alone right there made me think &#34;This could be a good sign!&#34; 

Out of the kitchen in less than five minutes came my plate of gnocchi. I was skeptical it could be any good since it arrived so quickly but the bartender assured me that because I was dining alone and it was a slow night in the dining area the kitchen had been able to get to my order quickly. He was right. The gnocchi were lightly airy pillows of deliciousness and the mushroom sauce it was served in was just delicious. Creamy and seasoned so well.  Great portion size as well. I ate every bite and was full but didn&#39;t feel stuffed. 

Service was friendly and not overbearing and as noted food came out promptly. Will return, next time on purpose! :)"

Here at Cafe Mercato you have a chef who is not only Italian, but has established a loyal following on Colorado from his days up in Edwards near Aspen to Lowry. 

This chef single-handed my raised the benchmark for &#39;good food&#39; not only in this neighborhood (and Hilltop) but for much of Denver. 

This city is now a legit foodie city thanks to the visionary hard work of chefs who stay true to the right way of food preparation. And his wine list is second to none. True wine geeks will appreciate the stellar hand picked selections. 

Great work, chef!"

The quality just doesn&#39;t tend to be as high as it is in a city&#39;s center. That&#39;s what Mercato reminds me of. It&#39;s definitely not as bad as a generic cost cutting chain, but it was not at all what I was hoping for.

I came here for Sunday brunch because it&#39;s in walking distance and the weather was beautiful. We were really in the mood for a nice patio. Mercato has a patio, there just weren&#39;t any tables out. Thankfully, the large overhead door was open and we were able to sit right by it. The last customers before us must&#39;ve thought the same as the table hadn&#39;t actually been cleaned.

The coffee is delicious, and the sourdough bread was great as well although I could do without the balsamic in the olive oil. My crapes were decent but my husband&#39;s sausage dish was much better. 

The restaurant interior was nice. Although  the music was so random and distracting. All in all, better than the delectable egg but not somewhere I&#39;ll ever take anyone I want to impress. Hopefully their dinner service is better."

I went here with a large group and pretty much everyone really enjoyed it.  There&#39;s a great menu with plenty of interesting choices, and a decent wine list as well, though it is much more expansive for full bottles than by the glass.  Many people had trouble reading the menus, however, because of very small type and dim lighting - just a note for those who have this issue.  The food, while a bit pricey, is very high quality and comparable to what I&#39;ve had in the past at the other restaurant owned by the same chef.  Pasta was cooked just to my liking and I also sampled the swordfish dish, which was excellent.  They also do an interesting take on the basic Caesar salad, adding avocado and a lemony dressing.  The bread wasn&#39;t anything fantastic, but the salads and entrees were very well prepared.  Around our big table, I saw a variety of dishes and salads, including the daily special, and every one looked really good, so I&#39;ve got a lot to try in future visits.  Nobody got pizzas, but with the giant wood oven, I bet they&#39;ll be good too.  They get a bonus as well for accommodating a big party and doing separate checks for each guest without a hassle.  Glad this place is here, though I do worry that with it being so close to Locanda, it will just wind up splitting the business with itself instead of adding more new customers.  But either way, this is a great addition to the neighborhood."

Daniel, our service paid attention to all of the details. He balanced being attentive yet not at all intrusive.. The manager stopped by to chat and also was great and made sure we were having a good time.

That&#39;s not a good sign for a food-driven humanoid like myself. I recall ordering a mimosa ($8) that was mediocre. Plates for brunch run about $12-16.

It&#39;s a great space and really well decorated.  When we ordered we let our server know our time was limited as we had to get back to work, but that didn&#39;t really seem to matter even though the  restaurant wasn&#39;t busy.  The server was unfortunately the only person helping any of the 5 parties there at the time, one of which had 12 people in it.  It would have been nice to see all the other staff standing around help her out in some way.  

We ordered the meatballs, which had good flavor and the sauce they came in was delicious, but the meatballs were rubbery and tough.  We both ordered the fennel chicken sandwich as well.  The meatballs came out really quickly, but the sandwiches took a long time to come out.  We ended up asking our server to put them in to go boxes so we could eat them on the way back to work.  We had to ask multiple times for the sandwiches as they were just sitting in boxes at the bar while we sat and waited.  Once we got them the to go boxes were also covered in grease, which was kind of gross and mine wouldn&#39;t stay closed, which didn&#39;t really seem to matter to our server.  

The sandwiches were ok, but not worth $12, especially as they were small and don&#39;t come with a side except some overdressed arugula.  I had asked that the spinach on the sandwich be replaced with another type of greens, but it didn&#39;t have anything on it except a mushy tomato slice, which isn&#39;t included in the description.  There also wasn&#39;t any shaved fennel on the sandwich, which was the main reason I had ordered it.  All in all, it was not a meal that should have cost us each $22. 

I&#39;ll probably go back and try the pizza as there aren&#39;t too many places in Lowry to eat, but hopefully the food and service will be a lot better than the first visit."

The service was spot-on and the food was amazing! We ordered the brussel sprouts for sharing and a beet salad. The salad was so huge it could have been a full meal! The sprouts were less impressive, not quite cooked enough, but a slight transgression that&#39;s forgivable given the rest of the meal. I ordered the eggplant parmegianna. For me, this dish is a window into the kitchen. It arrived in a baking dish, piping hot and bubbly and cooked to perfection. Eggplant is tricky and a lot of places slice it too thin so that it become either rubbery or mushy. This was the right thickness of eggplant so that it was tender with a bit of &#34;tooth&#34; to the bite. Others at the table ordered the meat ravioli which was delicious, and the paella. Sit out on the patio and enjoy the lovely, Colorado evening air while you sip a glass of wine. A nice spot for a romantic dinner for two or to catch up with friends, as we did.

Way overpriced for the quality (at least for the dishes we tried).  The food gets 2 stars, everything else gets a 4, averaging out to a 3.

Well, i really wanted to like Cafe Mercato.  I love that Lowry has a few different options for good, local restaurants (Lowry Beer Garden, North County, etc.) and as a resident of Stapleton I am jealous.  So my wife and I went here in the hopes of getting some good Italian food close by.  

The good:  The location is nice, the restaurant itself is very nice, laid out well, good decor.  I love the open patio and indoor/outdoor seating.  The service was decent - our server was friendly although not overly attentive.  It was a Tuesday, so I&#39;ll cut her some slack.

The bad: I feel like this is a place that doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s identity.  The restaurant, menu and pricing make it seem like it&#39;s trying to be on par with somewhere like Il Posto or Luca, but the quality of the food is what I&#39;d get at an average neighborhood red-sauce place.  

For starters, the bread came out and it was just plain ol&#39; boring Italian white bread with some oil and balsamic.  Another reviewer mentioned that it tasted like vegetable oil; I can&#39;t say if it was, but it certainly wasn&#39;t very tasty olive oil.  And the bread was just so boring.  Just plain bread I&#39;d get at King Soopers. Now, if I was at my local Italian red-sauce place it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, but for the prices of the food I would expect a little better bread, is all i&#39;m saying.

My wife ordered the orecchiette.  It was good, definitely the best food we got.  Didn&#39;t blow our minds, but it was tasty.

There was quite a bit of fish on the menu, so I thought hey, they must know how to cook some seafood.  So I tried the halibut.  Boo.  The halibut was cooked very poorly - undercooked, almost mushy.  Only the edges had any firmness.  The sauce was super watery, to the point that it sort of disappeared as I ate.  And the vegetables, oh man, so boring.  Just a pile of vegetables that had been roasted for a touch and dusted with salt.  Just plain old vegetables.  I mean, for $26 they could have at least put forth a little effort.  Maybe my fault for ordering halibut at a neighborhood Italian place, but still.  If it sucks, why put it on the menu.

We also ordered the roasted brussel sprouts to split.  They came out hot, which was nice, and they looked to have a good crispy exterior.  But somehow they were chewy, almost tough.  My wife and I are obsessed with brussel sprouts, and we only ate about half because they just, well sucked.

So after a very unsatisfying meal we were at least going to get something sweet, but the waitress came by, took our plates and dropped off the check.  Like one fluid motion - plates then check.  So we didn&#39;t even have time to ask about dessert.  (Which wasn&#39;t all bad, we went to Spinelli&#39;s new coffee/ice-cream shop and got ice cream, which was awesome.  Speaking of which, in hind-sight we should have just gotten take-out from Spinelli&#39;s!)

Holy cow, long review.  I guess because I want this place to succeed, but they either need to hire a new chef and cooking staff and get their food to a place that matches the prices, or they need to scale the food back and focus on delivering some neighborhood Italian classics.  We&#39;ll give this place another shot for sure, hopefully we just caught it on an off night."

We went on New Years Eve, (which if you work in the industry is pretty much the most hated night) and although they were slammed all of the food came out on time and was good.

Burrata - tasty, fresh, good toast
Caserecci - that goat cheese flavor with the sausage is a nice combo
Tagliatelle - great texture to the pasta, good clams
Dessert - the tart was disappointing, didn&#39;t seem homemade

The service was a little lackluster and it can be noisy but... it&#39;s nice to finally have a restaurant like this out our way."

This place looked very cute, and like a nice place to leisurely hang out with a small bite to eat.  Well, we were sat at the table at 1:30pm and the first thing our waiter did when he came over was pull out his cell phone, look at the time, and then say &#34;Just checking the time because we close at 2pm&#34;.  I have never felt less welcome in the first interaction at a restaurant.  Then when he heard we were just having coffee and dessert?  Forget it.  So we sucked down our coffee and gelato in our allotted half hour and got out of there.  Too bad, because I really wanted to like this place."

The service and the food are terrible. The waiters don&#39;t pay attention to you at all and never return to check to see how you&#39;re enjoying your meal. Ordered a second glass of wine which didn&#39;t come after 45 minutes. Main waiter ignored us even when checking on tables on either side of us. Food was very salty and tasted like it came out of the Chef Boyardee can! Save yourself from wasting your money and your time on this restaurant. There are much better options in the Lowry area.

Twice we have had the same experience here as we did at their sister restaurant at lunch. One server for the entire restaurant and despite trying hard the wait to even get drinks was about ten minutes. Finally the manager came to take our food order.

Bar tender was friendly and we had some Italian beers and shared a salad and a pizza. The beers were good, the Caesar salad was not so good. It came drenched in dressing on top of lots of wilted lettuce. The pizza we had was a Bianca. It was a white pizza with goat cheese, mozzarella, spinach and bacon. The bacon came in thin light colored slices...may have been prosciutto? Wasn&#39;t sure, it says bacon on menu. Anyway it was good and we ate it all because we were starving, but oh my God it was soooo salty. We were both kinda grossed out after we ate it and came home to chug water. Not sure why it was so overly salty- obviously cheese and bacon are salty but this tasted like they salted the entire pizza and crust too. It would&#39;ve been amazing 5 star pizza if weren&#39;t so salty- that&#39;s just our opinion. Either way, it was nice to support a local small restaurant in our hood and to not have to cook."

The patio looks like it would be great in the summer. Had the burrata app and a bottle of wine. Burrata was good! It included red peppers with it rather than tomatoes, interesting pairing. Though I think I prefer tomatoes. The only thing I disliked is that the bread they served with olive oil was nothing special. Just a plain white italian bread, sliced. As an italian restaurant you HAVE to have great bread!! The menu said the burrata would be served with ciabatta, but it was served with the same boring bread from the bread baskets. Hopefully they have a better bread option and they just couldn&#39;t get it out their first few days!! I&#39;ll visit again, and hopefully update this to a 4!!"

Nothing stood out, but the service provided by the bartender was excellent.  The dinner experience was also mediocre.  The restaurant was half full on a Saturday night, but we waited several minutes for the hostess to set a table when we arrived.    We started dinner with the mussels and clam appetizer, followed by the tagliatelle and filet mignon.  The steak was ordered medium rare, but arrived well done.

It was packed, but the service was excellent and timely.  We ordered several apps which were great.  I would very much recommend the burrata.  

For my entrée, the tagliatelle was magnificent; VERY fresh clams.  For some reason the portion size for the pasta itself was a little on the small side compared to identical dishes I saw at nearby tables.  That was my only complaint of the night, and I chalked it up as an honest mistake since they were really busy.  My girlfriend had the pappardelle, and no problems with taste or portion size for hers.  I had a few bites of the pappardelle, and it&#39;s definitely something I will be ordering in the future.

Dessert was great. I can&#39;t remember the name, but it was a chocolate mousse-filled torte.  I&#39;m used to mousse being very rich and heavy, but this was light, airy, and absolutely wonderful.  It was honestly one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

I worked in serving for over a decade and am always forgiving but repeated bad service and/or food is hard to ignore. During one visit, we even overheard a server (who was training a new employee) say &#34;I never ask what kind they want, I just give them whichever one I feel like.&#34; We think he was referring to gelato but don&#39;t know for sure.

I tried to get to two stars and just couldn&#39;t justify it.  We went on a date night, excited to try out a new place in the neighborhood.  They sat us at a table that felt like it was under a spotlight - not ideal for a cozy date.  All of the two person tables are along the wall and super-bright.  Finally we asked if they could at least turn down the lighting a bit and they said they can&#39;t - the contractor didn&#39;t install a dimmer.  Really, in a romantic Italian restaurant?  It felt like we were in Denny&#39;s.  We went around and around about ordering.  The server tried to get us to buy a bottle of wine for over $60.  Too much for us for a casual week night.  The wine for $40 tasted pretty bad so we finally had to spend more than we wanted.  We ordered the halibut and ravioli.  The roasted vegetables that came with the Halibut were so overcooked I was embarrassed for the kitchen.  Clearly they had been roasted earlier in the day and then kept in a pan with a cover on them.  Mushy and basically inedible.  We also ordered a Charcuterie board to start.  She said it was $20.  We didn&#39;t really need all that, and requested to order a half order (one meat, one cheese instead of two).  Nope, couldn&#39;t do that.  When it came out it was so much food it could have been our entire meal.  Really, we wanted half and would have really appreciated saving the money given the wine issue.  In the end, we ate way more than we wanted to, spent more on wine than we wanted to, and sat under spotlights on date night.

There were 3 of us, one of whom is the owner of 3 restaurants in the area, and the other two who eat out over 200 nights a year. Other than the food, which held up to its good reviews, the night was a disaster. We had a 7:30 reservation and were sat promptly. Nice start!   It took our server 15 minutes until she first &#34;stopped by&#34; to take a drink order.  We had seen the wine list which was very ample and reasonably priced, and ordered a bottle of Barolo.  About 10 minutes later the server, after taking the order of the folks at the next table, &#34;stopped by&#34; to tell me that they no longer had the Barolo. She suggested a different bottle at $20 more (strike one).  When I declined and picked a different at the same price point as the first bottle, she seemed miffed. When she attempted to walk away we told her that we would like to order now. She took our order a few minutes before 8 pm. We ordered two salads, the burrata and tomatoes, and the beet salad. The beet salad arrived in 5 minutes, with the server saying that the burrata was &#34;right behind&#34;. 25 minutes later, at 8:30 we had to ask the hostess to find our server (and the missing burrata).  A few minutes later the burrata showed up (with barely an apology for its tardiness ). About 30 minutes later, at 9 pm (90 minutes after being seated) the 3 entrees showed up.  At this time the manager came over (he actually brought 1 of the dishes to the table) and apologized for the delay. He told us that the head chef and others were arguing all night about why the kitchen was backed up, and that &#34;several cooks&#34; were fired.  Not sure if that was true or a line, but what he didn&#39;t do when he made the apology was offer to make something right. We know that restaurants run on thin margins, so we weren&#39;t looking for him to buy dinner, but to offer a drink, or a dessert, would have been appreciated.  At the end of the day, the food was very good, but the service failures cast a negative pall on the evening.  For a restaurant that&#39;s been open 10 months, you would think that these issues would have long been resolved."

I have been here twice and BOTH times were dismal. The first time my family and I went to Mercato, we were so excited that Lowry finally had a lovely restaurant near our home.

The first time, all was going somewhat ok despite the waiter being very slow( waited 20 minutes for a drink!)  then I saw one of the people in the open kitchen constantly scratching his head and cleaning out his ears with his hands and then proceeding to prepare food!  I asked to speak to the owner( who was sitting having a drink with his back to the restaurant) I told the owner about the incident and he COMPLETELY brushed me off, no apology at all.  He simply asked me if I own a business, to which I answered yes, he then said that as a business owner I should expect that things cannot always be perfect!   

We decided to give Mercato another try and hoped that the first visit was teething problems of a new business.  We arrived at 6pm and were not greeted or acknowledged for 10 minutes!  When the manager did greet us, he was very aloof and unwelcoming.  Our waiter was fine at first, but our charcuterie arrived so late that we barely had time to wolf it down before our entrees arrived.  I had ordered the Ribeye steak and specifically asked the waiter ( Michael) to please make sure that the steak was medium rare and not at all overcooked.  Needless to say, the steak arrived well done.  I asked for another one and when that arrived it was raw on the inside and burnt on the outside.  At this stage I was ravenous and my dinner companions had finished their meals already, so I just went without dinner. The last straw was when the manager came over and explained to me that because their steaks are dry aged that it was impossible to achieve a medium rare steak!!!!!!!! I could not believe that he had the audacity to blatantly lie to me and there was no apology AT ALL.  When the check came we did not receive any discount for all the problems throughout our meal. 
It was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have EVER experienced.. The staff are not trained properly and the management has no idea how to handle customer problems or any sort of crisis."

We went for happy hour but we were disappointed in the very limited food selection for happy hour.  There are not enough wines by the glass.  We ordered the calamari and had to ask the server what the three dipping sauces were.  We sat at the bar over looking the kitchen.  The executive chef overheard us talking about the sauces and corrected what kinds they were.  The server was wrong.  We enjoyed sitting close to the action in the kitchen and the executive chef was very friendly and helpful.  We will give it another chance and hope I can then post more stars for the review.

I was worried as I am a neighbor to this place, and didn&#39;t want my expectations to be too high. We had a vegetarian meal, with salads and veggie lasagna...the lasagna was great.  Wine selection was good, beer selection BAD, but they said they&#39;re working on it. I&#39;m excited to try their brunch menu which looks delicious.  I look forward to the next trip, and hope their service and menu options continue to improve.  Enjoy!!!"

What an excellent surprise that it was super cool Italian place. We started with the calamari which was ok needed a bit more spice of aoli or something. We ordered the side of spaghetti and red sauce and meat ravioli. The entrees were fantastic! The spaghetti noodles are some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Wine menu was decent. The service was FANTASTIC the chef/owner was checking good to be sure everything was up to par. Overall great addition to the neighborhood and I cannot wait to have more of that delish pasta!

First let me say that the food was exceptional and the back of the house knows what it is doing but unfortunately that does not go very far when the front of the house fails miserably.  We were seated promptly with no wait but then we were not approached by anyone for almost 40 minutes from out initial seating.  The water girl brought water two times while we tried to make eye contact with several wait staff.  When a waiter finally came to our table he explained that this was not his station and he would gladly buy us a drink and make everything better and promptly get us some bread.  The bread never arrived and we finally had to ask for it.  The original waiter who&#39;s station our table was assigned to came over and did apologize for having dropped the ball.  We accepted his apology gladly.  We did finally order the amazing pork chop and brussels sprout side dish and a pasta with bolognese sauce and the food was delivered at a reasonable time and was truly outstanding.  The waiter we did end up with came back again and said that the manager would be buying us dessert.  After dinner we decided to order one dessert and split it because the dinner had filled us up.  When the final bill came the one glass of wine was taken care of and not charged and the dessert was one the bill.  We paid our bill with a credit card and cash and waited for the change to come back.  Our waiter had pocketed the change assuming it was his tip.  To add insult to injury we had to ask for our change and it took the waiter another 10 minutes to get it!!!  The whole customer service and wait staff experience was horrible and the only upside was a pleasant hostess and the wonderful food.  If you plan on staying in business and not just turning into a pizza joint you truly need to work on the service levels that were provided.  I think if I return I would sit in the bar and order the higher priced items and skip the bad wait staff and servers all together.

There have been times where the service was indeed spotty, but the restaurant is only a month old so I&#39;m hoping they will work this out. Service at the bar, however, was excellent. The salads are somewhat disappointing but the pastas and pizzas are AMAZING. Simply fabulous. One reviewer complained about not trying the $8 gelato...too bad, you should&#39;ve tried it. It was delicious and filling, worth the $8. I do wish the wine selection was better but supposedly their wine list is a temporary one. Prices are a little higher than Lowry restaurants but this place definitely has a &#34;quality over quantity&#34; approach. Overall, we love this place and will be back on a regular basis."

This isn&#39;t your topical restaurant. They have a very large cheese and wine list. All we had we great. Also had a crepe, really good.

I try to avoid eating there when they have live music. It&#39;s typically has been super loud, so much so that I could barely hear the person next to me. 

Also I wish they had a sampler on the menu!! Getting the 3-4 kinds of meet and cheese is great but I want to try a bunch more even when it&#39;s just 2 of us eating there. Smaller portions but more variety would be fun. 

PS. What&#39;s up with their new logo? It looks dumb and sexist.  By the logo, it makes it look like you can get a prostitute as a side item on the menu."

We were sat and greeted promptly as well. 

Definitely a great place for a glass (or more) or wine and a cheese/meat plate! 

They have a wide variety of wines available with ample description of each. Prices are in line with the market. Our trio plate (we chose one meat and two cheese) was $32 I believe and the portions were definitely worth the price!"

The restaurant is beautiful with plenty of seating, indoors and outdoors.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly server who explained the entire menu to us, page by page.  They have a great wine list with prices by the 2oz pour, by the glass, and by the bottle.  With such a great wine list, I opted for two 2oz tasters - a sauvignon blanc and a rosé.  My guests and I ordered a 3 cheese plate, and I ordered the beet salad, and my friends ordered a panini with a side salad.

The wines came out first, and the entire table was pleased with their selections.  Next, the cheese plate came out...and WOW!  I love a cheese plate, and this is one of the best I have ever had.  All three cheeses were amazing, but it wasn&#39;t just three types of cheese on a cutting board...it came with mustard, mango jelly, crackers, nuts, dried fruit, bread, and other amazing accompaniments.  

The sandwich and the salad were good as well, but the wines and the cheese plate were the stars of the show!  We enjoyed ourselves so much, that we decided to finish off our meals with a nice glass of prosecco.  

This place is dangerous!  If I lived in town, I would go for that cheese plate and great wine list weekly."

I always indulge in there panini choicest D&#39;Apple being one of my absolute favs. There soups are great but I also find myself going for the side salad because they have this amazing feta dressing I still haven&#39;t been able to find anywhere else. You can never go wrong with dessert so feel free to indulge in any one of them- my favs being the fondue (which is gigantic) and the profiteroles."

The servers are very attentive and will guide you if you&#39;ve never been there before. If you&#39;re a little more experienced, they&#39;re willing to hang back and let you do your thing. 

The cheese platters are to die for, and you can get completely full just munching on all the goodies. My only complaint is that their meat options for the platters only offer pork products and one fish product, neither of which my family can eat. It didn&#39;t dampen the experience, though, we just added on more cheese.

The wine selection is wonderful. If you have an idea of the kind of wine you like, the menu or your server can help narrow down something you&#39;ll enjoy. I loved that they had a couple unfiltered, organic wines on their list. You also get a 10% discount if you go next door and buy a bottle after your meal. 

Overall, very enjoyable. I can&#39;t believe it has to be said this isn&#39;t a family restaurant like some of these reviews have mistaken it for, it is clearly an adult establishment. That makes it great for get-togethers with friends or significant others. I will certainly come back."

We tried the goat cheese and pear crepes, apple nut and bleu cheese salad and the traditional fondue. The crepe was our favorite-absolutely delicious. The salad was the perfect size to split and paired nicely with the wine recommendation.

The service staff is friendlier (prior to this, the 2 I had were standoffish and rude), they&#39;re more attentive and some are willing to share their favorites and things worth trying.
I had to my update my review to just OK to it&#39;s better.
I love the cheese/meat plates to share with a nice bottle of wine. Also, there is occasional live music which only adds to the fun ambiance.
In 6 months, this place went from tolerable to worth trying again and again. One note to the service staff - if you don&#39;t want to share things to try or aren&#39;t excited about questions and serving tables, do something else. Quality and food go far, but service is the first and last interactions customers have. All customers have different needs - you have to be able to adapt to that.
I always go in secretly hoping I don&#39;t get the 2 rude servers but have the 1-3 really nice and friendly ones. That&#39;s not the greatest business practice and not fair to customers or the business who is employing you. So to customers - I hope you get one of the friendly ones. If so, you will have a 4 star experience. If you have one of the distant rude ones, your night is ruined."

We stopped in at Orchard Town Center for lunch and afterward decided to seek out a decent Happy Hour. What a gem we&#39;ve found!

Build your own flights: not cheap but turns out, not a bad deal! We selected 5 BIG red wines to include in our flight, one of which was free because we checked in on YELP. The check-in says that they&#39;ll comp the least expensive wine, but our waiter offered to comp our MOST expensive one! Nice! Then, as we were enjoying our tasters, he brought over an additional wine to taste that he thought would go well with our other selections - GRATIS! Cha-ching. 

Tally - we&#39;re up to 2 free tasters.

Toward the end of our tasting, and because we had ordered big, tannen-heavy wines, our paletes were falling apart so we asked for some bread and some olive oil. Our waiter then brought out some bread, crackers and 3 &#34;dips&#34;: olive oil, apricot spread and balsamic glaze. We figured we&#39;d be paying for this (which was fine) but that turned out to be free as well. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s standard procedure but it certainly wasn&#39;t something that was offered out-right as normal &#34;munchies.&#34; We were so pleased and were able to enjoy the rest of our wine flight with some great nosh.

At the end of our flight tasting, as we were paying, our waiter brought over another complimentary sample for each of us, this time a dessert wine...tawny port. Tasty!

Needless to say, he was great. So gracious and so attentive. And he got a nice big tip :)

Other than being a bit pricey, the ONLY other complaint I have about Wine &amp; Cheese is how our experience started out. As I have mentioned our waiter did an amazing job. BUT when we were first sat, it took him about 15 minutes to come greet us. We had 3 other waiters stop by our table to tell us that our waiter was &#34;with the manager&#34; and would be with us shortly. This was not a big deal; we were given water and were even asked if we were ready to order, which we hadn&#39;t been. We felt well attended-to. When our waiter did finally come to the table to introduce himself, he reeked of cigarettes. Whether he was &#34;with the manager&#34; or not is of no consequence. They deserve breaks too. But I will say that ANY time you&#39;re enjoying a meal, it&#39;s always a bummer to be inundated with the smell of cigarettes, especially when drinking and eating wine and cheese which employ a great deal of smell. 

I will say that we will most certainly return and were it not for the unfortunate way it started, Wine &amp; Cheese would have gotten a solid 5 stars from me!"

They offer an assortment of cheese trays with different meats and fruit. Plus they have gourmet sandwiches and many other amazing dishes to choose from. 

You will have to try a wine flight. The waiter was very helpful in helping us choose wines that we have never tried. You can choose from any of their wines and even mix and match whites and reds. I love port, so needless to say I had to have a 20 year tawny. Amazing!! I am hooked, I loved the over all experience! This quaint wine bar is located in the Orchard Mall.

Not from the food or wine but the service. So snobby and standoffish. We had two young children (babies) with us which clearly annoyed the hostess from the second we walked in. She didn&#39;t even say hi or anything. We asked for two high chairs after a few minutes  she snapped &#34;give me a minute.&#34; The server was unfriendly as well, didn&#39;t describe or explain much at all and stared at me when I asked her to describe the happy hour wine...like I was an idiot for not knowing. We were at a table where the sunlight was blaring in our face and they sort of laughed it off. The wine was alright and the cheese plate tasted good but was overpriced especially for a happy hour menu item. My friends and I just didn&#39;t appreciate being treated like second-class citizens.

A friend and I walked over for dinner after getting massages at Spavia nearby.  We got the trio platter with two cheeses and some prosciutto.  The whole platter was to die for.  The cheeses and meat were served with perfectly baked slices of baguette, Nita crisp, slices of granny smith apple, candied nuts, perfectly marinated olives and the most delicious marmalade I&#39;ve ever tasted.  

We also each enjoyed a glass of wine and the server - who was full of information about the whole menu - even brought us a few small glasses of wine to taste in addition to the ones we ordered. 

At the end of the meal, we ordered the chocolate fondue which didn&#39;t disappoint, although we were completely stuffed by the time we left.  It was really delightful."

After contemplating the final bill we inquired why our wines that we ordered during happy hour time were not discounted.  We were told that only specialty wines were included and we had to ask for the happy hr menu.  Note the happy hr sign on the door does not indicate select wines. This is a pretty sneaky way to up price and squeeze out of written specials.  I am disappointed by this practice and no offer to comp anything or discount for next time when were asked about this .

Our waiter looked like David Cross from Arrested Development. I wish I had caught, his name, but he was awesome.  Funny, good pacing, helpful without being overbearing.  Love him to death!!!

Stopped in after seeing Ender&#39;s Game with hubby.  We split the trio platter and enjoyed a salty prosciutto, creamy Fromage D&#39;Affinois that was better than Brie and a Gruyere which was out of this world!  The trio runs about $30 but is loaded with goodies, and they&#39;ll bring you more bread, mustard, jam, etc. if you need.

We each did a trio flight of wines:  I chose reds, hubs chose whites, and while our waiter left us to our own choices, I think he would have gladly made recommendations if we asked.

Our waiter even brought us complimentary tasters of a delicious dessert red for being first time visitors!!!

The setting is large, but the tables felt cozy.  We ate indoors as I was a little chilled this afternoon, but the patio was amazing.  

$60 for six tasters of wine  plus two free pours and a HUGE cheese and meat platter feels like a bargain, to be honest.

This is going into the official date night rotation for sure!!!!"

We got a salad, salmon appetizer and shared one of the platters.  There was a lot going on on these plates.

For the most part, our experiences have been great.  However, there was one instance not too long ago that really surprised me. 

I arrived for a dinner with my wife, her sister and her mother.  We were promptly seated and thats where things went downhill.  

I could tell from the very first words that came out of my waiter&#39;s mouth that he was not in a good mood and that we were lucky he was waiting on us.  Needless to say, the rest of the night was marred by what i would call deplorable service from this waiter.  

After having to wait 15+ minutes for new drinks each time, we finally ate and were ready to go.  I happened to have a gift card and gave it to him so that he could take it off the bill.  He came back after 10 minutes or so and presented me with my new bill which went from $120 to $70 after the gift card.  Having spent an awful night dealing with this guy, I gave him what, at the time, sounded like a good time of $10 given the putrid service he provided.  

Now what I know about &#34;the right&#34; way to wait tables, this guy promptly came over and took our check BEFORE we even left.  Within 2 minutes, faster than any other service he provided us the entire night, he asked me why his tip was so low.  I calmly explained to him that his service was sub-par and that I&#39;m not going to pay him for food that the gift card covered.  He continued to argue right there in front of the room so I had to put him in his place. After some conversations with his manager, I think he got the point but even the way that the manager handled the situation was not appropriate nor did it seem that it would solve the problem. 

This place is great.  I just hope that this was not a sign of things to come.  I&#39;ll update my review the next I visit if it was indeed an exception to the rule."

They were very busy and understaffed according to the owner and I think possibly running out of food as the accompaniments to the fondue were minimal and poor especially the bread, not what you use for Fondue.  Maybe we made a mistake and should have ordered the cheese platters either way we won&#39;t be going back.  It&#39;s too bad I wanted to have something like this to go to on the North end of the Denver metro area, but will still travel for it to be good."

I will say, it is probably ideal to go with at least one other person, if not a group if you&#39;re planning on doing a cheese plate.

What&#39;s great about their wines is that you can build your own flight from a massive selection of wines.  Each is priced by the tasting pour, 1/2 glass, glass or bottle.  They have a great selection of both old and new world wines and some I haven&#39;t seen anywhere else in Denver.

So for a $13 cheese plate where you only select one type of cheese is where I thought this experience was going to go downhill.  (BTW 2 is $23, 3 is $31, and 5 is $43).  First the amount of cheese you get is crazy - so much that I had some to take home with the huge amount of leftover condiments and sides they give you.  You get a baguette with green apple slices, dried cranberries, olives, figs, marmalade,  mustard, pickled onions, flatbreads and I think a couple other things.  There was no way possible for me to eat more than half of the plate.

The service and knowledge of the staff is also exceptional.  The only thing that I didn&#39;t like about this place is it&#39;s so far from my apartment.  It takes 30-40 minutes to get there from my place without traffic; if it didn&#39;t you&#39;d probably see me there 2-3 days per week!"

But good luck getting a good server, and good luck getting a double charge reversed. My girl friend and I go here about once a month. They only have few decent servers. We have been left on the patio for about 30 minutes without service returning to us with checks, checking on us or anything. We have had orders screwed up, wrong wine delivered, been without a way to finish our cheese to name just a few. No one ever checks back to make sure things are ok, so getting more bread, or crackers, or another glass of wine is difficult. As a server for about 10 years, I know what two bites, two minutes is. You should be checking back in with your customers after they have had their food for no more than 5 minutes, if you screwed something up, how would you know so that you could fix it? And what about upselling...ever heard of it, don&#39;t try to hand me my check without asking if there is anything else that we need (happens way to frequently here). This last time we went for a birthday (9/24). I paid, they were having issues with their credit card machine being down. They ran my card twice when it finally came back up (9/27). I have been trying to get this resolved since I noticed the mistake (10/13). I have since called them 4 times and spoken with the owner twice, and the charges are STILL on my card. Now I going the route of disputing with my credit card company. The owner keeps telling me that the machine is new, and they don&#39;t know how to use it. How is that your customer&#39;s problem again. FFS get it together. Just know what you are getting when you go here. Good food, a chance at the two good serves and nothing else!"

Select your wine, choose your cheeses, and prepare for 2+ hours of lazy nibbling and drinking.  I highly recommend the Prima Donna Red (a Dutch cow&#39;s milk cheese with salt crystals and a balsamic glaze) and/or Belle Chevre (goat&#39;s milk cheese served with a hint of honey).  Add a prosciutto or salami from their charcuterie options and prepare to be dazzled when your platter arrives with olives, mustard, marmalade, crackers, bread, toasted nuts, and all things glorious.

We definitely picked the wrong night for a quiet dinner out b/c there was a huge party that took over the entire dining area, making it impossible for us to hear ourselves talk and really throwing the wait staff off.  Good thing we placed our order before the large party was seated b/c after our food arrived, our server was no where to be found again.  

We both ordered the beet salad and unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.  The dressing for me was far too sweet and was too heavy for the greens.  We were brought a few slices of dry bread which was just not appetizing. 

I may try this place again for a glass of wine in the bar area, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll spend my dining dollars out here."

Let me first begin by saying I have been to the orchard location many times and recently there is a decline in service and friendliness.  It would seem there are several employees who are more interested in catching up with and serving &#34;regulars&#34; and friends than being considerate and helpful to all guests who enter their establishment.  I&#39;m not certain if they are under new management or have just gotten lackadaisical, but I believe maintaining a fair and friendly atmosphere for every guest is paramount in customer service.  Be prepared if you visit, while shopping at the mall, if your aren&#39;t a personal friend or a &#34;regular&#34; you may have to take a back seat.  Forget that you will have to pay between $17 and $50 for a plate of cheese and crackers just to be treated like second class guests.  Really unfortunate to see one of the nicer restaurants in the shopping center start to decline in this area of service.  It was nice dining with you while it lasted."

Ambience - very convivial.  Lots of duos and larger groups.  Single guitarist was easy to listen too - heard his day job was a librarian - lot of that going around.

Extensive selection of wines with excellent descriptions, great cheese selection, a few standard choices of charcuterie, and a menu full of gourmet salads, small plates, paninis, and soups.  If you can&#39;t decide - order one of their platters that come with your choice of cheeses, meats, along with a marmalade, a spicy dijon, flat breads, apple slices, spiced nuts, apricots, figs, and cranberries.
We chose a platter with the prima donna red cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze and the sopresatta cured meat.  It was more than enough for two people since the amount of cheese on the platter is impressive.  We couldn&#39;t pass up the spicy orange hummus either which was probably the second best hummus I&#39;ve had.

Our server was knowledgeable about all of the wines and helped us make a selection of cheese to go with the our meat choice.  To top it off... she took our wine flight selections and food choices at the same time without writing it down and remembered who got what.  Not something you see very often these days :o)"

The cheeses here were amazing, and they had to have four pages of wines to choose from. The cheese plates also came with baguette slices, cranberries, apples and condiments. There were really good ingredients all around. We did the restaurant week deal and tacked on prosciutto and a cup of soup. The soup was really tasty, but way too small for $6. I really can&#39;t say anything bad about the food, as every single thing was delicious here.

The service, however, was pretty crummy. There were only five tables in the place while I was there, two servers and a guy going around with water. It took forever to get anything. I know it&#39;s really great food, but there&#39;s no reason for the slow service. They weren&#39;t packed, and I don&#39;t know how it can take so long to slice up some cheese and drizzle honey and balsamic over it. I could even look into the prep area and just see our server having a conversation with his co-workers. I&#39;m usually not a stickler for service, but this place was not even trying."

I live in Denver, and I&#39;m not a huge fan of suburbs in general, but this place is great!  Just a bit of background on me: I love wine... I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m an aficionado, but I do have a pretty good palate and I can be a little snobby in certain situations.  That said, our server recommended the OZV Zinfandel, which I believe was one of the less expensive wines by the glass - and I must say, it was delicious!  Good enough for me to want to track down a bottle for myself!  We also got a bruschetta appetizer, which was pretty small, but delicious enough to be satisfying.  I glanced at the food menu, and it seemed reasonable with delicious-sounding paninis and salads.  The cheese plates look pricey, but I&#39;m sure it would be worth it, knowing that they use great-quality cheeses.

The second time I came here, my friend ordered water and I just ordered a half-glass of wine, so my check came out to be something like $3.50... even though we didn&#39;t spend much money, our server was still very kind in checking up on us and didn&#39;t make us feel like terrible people for taking up a table.  It wasn&#39;t the busiest time of day, so that helped, but definitely appreciated!

First, the staff and service are friendly and knowledgeable.  We only tried a few dishes because there were only two of us, but we enjoyed everything we had.

One of the highlights was the wine menu.  I love wine, but I am not an expert.  What I really likes is that the menu has a good selection of just over 100 wines available by the flight or glass and several more by the bottle, all of which are reasonably priced.

Typically I get a little overwhelmed by wine lists, and I think I do what a lot of us do: order the second cheapest wine on the list.  The wine menu here offered well thought out descriptions of each wine which made selection a lot easier.  If you don&#39;t want a full glass or bottle they offer flights or tastings ranging from $3-$7 per wine.  It is a great way to sample many different wines.

We didn&#39;t try to the panini&#39;s, and opted for a trio platter of cheeses and meats.  The trio was definitely a lot of food for two people, but we loved the selection.



If I could offer just one suggestion: bring friends when you dine here.  While it is nice for a couple, we both thought it would have been even better to go with a large group and share the platters so everyone can try more of their excellent selection.


Lastly, the $$$ price indicator is not accurate.  This restaurant is very affordable.  With wine flights starting at $3.50 and sandwhiches around $11 this place is not expensive.  The trio platters will run around $30 and can feed 2-3 people."

The whole cheese / wine bar thing was a completely new experience for me, and one I look very much forward to repeating over and over again. Even my meat and potato husband was satisfied upon leaving. 

We started out with the Spanish quesadilla and bruschetta - Both unique and delicious. For dinner, we got a couple of different platters to share among 6 people. There was a couple of goat cheeses that I wasn&#39;t crazy over, but that is just my particular palate. The horseradish cheddar however, is now placed squarely in the &#34;I&#39;ll fight you to the death for it&#34; category. And for dessert, I had the champagne grapefruit sorbet. Wow. That was a perfect ending to a great meal.

Now, besides the food, the atmosphere is really nice. It&#39;s kinda dark and intimate, but certainly not pretentious, not at all. Perfect for small parties or a fun date. The bathroom is really cool actually. You&#39;ll know what I mean when you go. And you will go right? Cause seriously. This place is fun. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable as well.

Oh, and my eat on.  Because you know what they have here?  The best gosh darn mac and cheese ever.  Creamy cheesy goodness wrapped in and around the cocoons of noodles, topped with....

Wait for it....

Seriously, wait for it...

LOBSTER!  And none of that fake stuff either.  Huge chunks of real lobster that take the mac and cheese from a childhood favorite to an adult epiphany.  Does the mac and cheese taste better because it has lobster in it?  Would it taste just like any ole mac and cheese if it didn&#39;t have that luxurious seafood on top?  Maybe, but it&#39;s a thought that I do not want to entertain.  Just order it.  

Order the above mentioned lobster mac, and be sure to order the wings.  These things are massive and juicy.  HUGE.  Like the size of my behind huge.  Half off I think during happy hour (if not half off, then definitely discounted).  Just order them.  Please.  You have to see the size of these things.  Poor chunky chickens.

And service is always great.  The bartenders know how to keep the patrons happy.  Places like this make Cap Hill what it is.

Now, to end this review.... LOBSTER!"

Cute little neighborhood bar. I really liked the decoration - it was old fashioned, but the bathroom was like a club bathroom - with the coolest sink! Lol 

They were playing all the reggae jams that day - my boyfriend and I loved it.

The drinks were good and we tried the fries. OMG - so bad for you, but sooo good! They were covered with BBQ sauce, ranch, queso, and jalepenos. Definitely try them for a cheat day!"

The boyfriend and I visited on a Sunday afternoon around 4. There were 2 tables and 1 bar guest when we arrived. We were greeted and asked what we wanted to drink, but not offered menus. It took another 10 minutes to get menus after 2 minutes we were asked what we wanted, but we were not ready. Another 10 minutes passed (while the bartender was taking shots) before we were asked what we wanted. We ordered the cap hill Cesar with dirty fries and spicy garlic wings with ranch. 

Our sandwich came out, but with the wrong fries. No big deal after about 5 minutes we asked if we could get the right fries. Never once was checked on if our food was ok. I sat with an empty beer and water the whole time and our wings never came. Given the whole time the bartender was taking shots. Also 2 other customers sat for 10 minutes waiting on her to come back and even started whistling.

Even though I was frustrated we decided not to say anything. We asked for a box. A few minutes passed and the bartender came back and poured herself and another customer a beer in a rocks glass and them preceeded to start drinking the beer. At which point I lost my cool and interrupted her beer to again ask for my box and my check. Upon finally getting a box I asked to speak to a manager only to find out there was not one present. 
I was asked if something was wrong to which I told her that I didn&#39;t appreciate being ignored and sitting with an empty beer and water and not receiving half my food. She said she would comp our food. After telling her that&#39;s not what we wanted she insisted. We left  $10 as a tip. 


On the was out the bartender started talking about me and saying nasty things which I could hear because all the garage doors were open and my car was parked in front. I informed her I could hear her. She in turn preceeded to yell at me across the bar. 

After leaving a bad Facebook review the owner seemed concerned and reached out and wanted to hear my story... I provided my contact information and 6 days later still have not heard anything... guess they don&#39;t care about the complaint."

On the first, we met Butch the Bartender who is equal parts knowledgable and friendly. A better mix you cannot find. Echoing another review, the wings aren&#39;t memorable. However, the Stromboli is. Very crispy, complex flavored and the perfect complement to a beer or really any kind of food. 

This place feels undeniably good -- it&#39;s got positive mojo. 

Can I make a request/suggestion? While the menu is still fluid, I&#39;d consider getting something that&#39;s easy to pick at. I&#39;d suggest deviled eggs. So hot right now. So delicious. That&#39;d be a homerun."

The kind of place you could go to night after night and you&#39;ll never get tired of it. Just feels like home. My brother had been haunting this place for awhile and continually invited me out; glad I finally took him up on the offer. It&#39;s literally a house in the middle of a neighborhood, and the inside is reminiscent of a giant living room -- big chandelier and all. There&#39;s a bunch of mismatched tables and big cozy chairs, and a great classic bar menu. Full bar, burgers, wings, salad, fried stuff. They even have gluten free options! I went with a local Stem Cider (so good) and the gluten free roasted wings with bleu cheese, which were seriously phenomenal. I wasn&#39;t expecting them to be so yum. 

The bartenders were nice although a bit aloof. Everyone seemed pretty preoccupied and very casual, but I didn&#39;t mind. Seems like all are having a good time, staff included, and that&#39;s always nice to see."

The building is beautiful and I can&#39;t beat that it is just down the block. However, the wait staff is the worst I think I have ever experienced. On my most recent visit, I waited 20 min to be greeted and we were asked our drink orders without any menus ever brought to us. Then the worst was we asked for the check and we put our credit cards in while she was still at the table and then we waited maybe 20-30 minutes for her to come pick it up. One member of our party actually venmo&#39;ed me because he couldn&#39;t wait any longer and had to leave.

Cap hill tavern(still want to call it Oblios) has everything going for it and should be my favorite spot. However, the wait staff doesn&#39;t seem to care about the customers. Wait staff makes me want to put 1 star, however that stromboli gives it the additional 2, but 2 stars just cause stromboli does not a successful business make. Hopefully they will fix this problem immediately."

Waitress was not that attentive and seemed a bit annoyed when we wanted to order more drinks. It was a Sunday brunch but the place was empty so we ordered apps and wanted to wait for our mains so we could just hang out a bit and literally 3 minutes after ordering the apps and saying we wanted to wait a bit to order our mains she came back and wanted us to order. Told her again we wanted to wait a bit, got a roll of the eyes and walked away. 5 mins later again asking us if we were ready. So we caved and ordered. Apps came, and before we were half way done our mains came... Annoying but the food was good. Last complaint, we sat on the patio, and the heat from the pipes under the canopy were radiating so much heat it was almost unbearable. 

Definitely going again, maybe it was an off day."

Bar service is good, but sometimes the bartender is also the wait staff, despite there being a significant number of tables in the place.

Good food and drinks and the happy hour includes both and starts late which I appreciate because I&#39;m a night owl. 

The mood is set as soon as you walk in with people laughing and drinking. Seems to be a place full of regulars because the staff and customers have a very playful relationship. The lighting is dim and perfect for a intimate night out with friends. 

The food is awesome and the prices during happy hour just make it all worth it. I recommend the Thai Chili wings. Sweet and spicy with a kick of flavor. Plus you get 12 for $6! Also the Politician is the perfect comfort food for when you&#39;re having a bad day. House wines on tap for $5. Great deal. 

The wait staff is always attentive, and like I said before they aren&#39;t shy to be very friendly. They always notice when my wine glass is running low and the food also comes out pretty quick. Great place to relax and enjoy a nice time."

I called ahead to make sure they would be showing the NBA finals game.  After searching for a parking spot for ten minutes, we waited an additional ten minutes inside before my guest elected to get up and request that one of the three wait staff working would mind getting us a menu.  After providing menus, our waitress (Kelsey) immediately inquired if we&#39;d be eating or just getting drinks.  Would be nice to have a second to peruse the menu.  I shortly informed her we&#39;d be getting both and that we&#39;d need time to look over the menu and asked for water.  Took no less than five minutes to get the requested water at which time we ordered 12 wings (6 dry rub and 6 thai chili) as well as a Caesar salad.  The food took over 35 minutes to arrive.  Granted the wings were hot and the dry rub is to die for (per usual) and the salad was delicious.  The thai chili wings weren&#39;t my bag.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of wet (not crispy) wings.  However, the overall experience was tainted by the poor quality of service and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Only qualm is the portion for the Lobster Rolls. For $18, and being that Lobsters are still going for the lowest per pound they ever have, would be nice if these lobster rolls at least were comparable to those of the East Coast. A little &#34;over the top&#34; would be nice. And the mayo was barely noticeable.

With said, the rolls were delicious if not a little over toasted and with a bit much garlic slathered on the roll. 

I don&#39;t know if they make fries (Didn&#39;t see any on the menu, but might be a good idea to compliment several of the items on the menu (people get tired of chipa, but never fries. Also, a lobster roll goes well with a cool slaw side.

The servers and bartenders are all very friendly, and they have a great selection of drinks to choose from. I&#39;ve never had the good here, but I&#39;m told it&#39;s very tasty. 

Since their taps are always changing, you&#39;re going to find a different beer selection each time. I wish they had at least one good brown or stout on tap during my last visit, but their selection seemed to be geared towards lighter summer beers like lagers and IPAs, none of which I&#39;m a fan of. 

I ordered a Moscow Mule, which has become my favorite summertime drink. They serve it in a copper mug, which makes for a better Mule, but aside from that I found it a bit overpriced for an underwhelming drink. It had too much lime juice and I could barely taste the ginger beer at all, so it tasted like an $8 vodka with lime. I&#39;m hoping that next time I visit they&#39;ll let me introduce them to the best Mule ever (hint: angostura bitters), and then they can make it for you when you visit.

Aside from that, I&#39;m a huge fan of Oblio&#39;s. I love the decor, the bathroom is very neat (and I mean both clean and pretty cool), and it&#39;s a great place to spend time with friends after work. See you there!"

Oblio&#39;s delivers all of this in full and is a welcome business in Cap Hill. It&#39;s one of the unique charms that make this neighborhood so great. You really can&#39;t go wrong when you stop in to this place.

Got a hangover? Not after a stop off at Oblio&#39;s. They offer Bloody Mary&#39;s and Mimosa in addition to brunch/lunch menu items that will cure any ailment. Breakfast burritos, breakfast cocktails, salads, pizzas, flat bread, everything that you need to move on from the night before is all here. Even if you aren&#39;t hurting from a night on the town you can enjoy the food and drink and the really laid back feel. Most peeps go in for the Banker&#39;s Plate which is a pizza, salad and drink for $9.25. Not too shabby for a little place.

Since this building became Oblio&#39;s it has gained so much personality. It&#39;s so easy going what with the big chairs, open patio, TVs for TV watching, courteous and prompt service. I have never had a bad time here - mostly I do daytime stops but a weekend evening excursion would be a lot of fun too. If you know and like the people in Cap Hill then you&#39;ll be in good company.

What really stands out to me is that this place is so easy. Easy to get to, simple but delicious menus, effortless service, trouble-free clientele, straightforward Cap Hill goodness. I&#39;m very glad this institution is part of the hood. Food, drink, and fun - need you ask for anything more?"

I had my birthday party here in their large back room and the service was great! Daniel and Ally were so accommodating and everyone at the party kept commenting on how awesome they were! The event coordinator worked with me on all the details from how many people would be coming to the music we wanted played. It was great to receive this kind of attention!

I also just recently brought my family in for Easter brunch and it was still a great dining experience! Nancy was nice and attentive.

The outside patio is great. Like, really great. Awesome location. 

The beer selection is pretty decent. Except the last time I was there, trying to figure out which beers they had on tap was a lot more difficult than it should have been.

Brunch, late night, lunch, dinner - all appropriate and delightful. I love this location, vibe, and design! In a large space there are options to sit at the bar, slide into a booth, sit at a table or chill on the patio. There are some TVs for sports nuts, great music is always playing and they offer a myriad of excellent drinks and food options.

Some out of town family loved this spot so much we went twice in three days! They have a selection of local brews, a full bar, and a sweet brunch mimosa deal. Everything I&#39;ve had on the menu rocks. The banker&#39;s special is a favorite - a small pizza, a salad and a wine or PBR for around $9. The pizza is super good! The wings, breadsticks, salad, desserts are all tasty too! Plus, it is easy to take left overs as we live in the hood. 

The only issue is sometimes there isn&#39;t enough service as they often have a large crowd with few staff members. But, this is usually during the weird hours I end up there. At large meal times, they seem to be fully staffed. 

You have to see the place for yourself. A Victorian mansion meets modern functionality, in a great neighborhood to boot!"

This is my view from my living room).  On my first night at the new place, me and my new roommate checked this place out for dinner and a couple drinks.  This place has only been open for a couple days, and like every new place, definitely has a couple kinks to work out but nothing that won&#39;t be worked out in the next few weeks. 

The pizza is FANTASTIC! This is coming from someone who is just a super snob about pizza in general. I had a pizza with artichoke hearts, garlic, and sausage (that I custom created).  The sauce is superb, the crust is even very delicious and the ingredients were fresh. 

They offer a decent beer selection on tap offering a few local brews as well. This could be deadly..or awesome..living so close.

But after eating here once, I think they&#39;ll probably do just fine. The biggest improvement by far is very smart and extensive upgrades to the space. Eating at Fleur was kind of like eating in your rich aunt&#39;s parlor, but Oblio&#39;s looks like a great hipster date spot. I love the beaten tin bar and the grey and brown color scheme that accompanies it. The bar itself is pretty cool as it faces the patio, which can open up with a garage door. I can see that being very popular in the summer. Oblio&#39;s also opened up a previously unused back area as a dining room so it won&#39;t be nearly as crammed as Fleur (and they can make more money on those tables too!).

When I went it was pretty crowded already despite not even having a web site and being open for less than a week.

The menu looks good though it is a bit more limited than I was expecting. It&#39;s also probably a tad more expensive than it needs to be. I ordered a 11&#34; pizza with two toppings and it was $16. Should probably be more around the $13 range in my opinion. The pizza was good with a savory pizza sauce and pretty quality ingredients. I am not he biggest fan of their pizza dough, which has a good texture but almost seems rolled like a cinnamon roll or something as parts of the crust would literally unravel and leave bits of toppings behind with nothing to contain them.

As I am quickly approaching the time when I am leaving Capitol Hill for awhile, I am not sure how many more times I&#39;ll be able to return to Oblio&#39;s. But I&#39;ll definitely come back if I am in the area again."

We say at the bar and it was all open air since it was beautiful out!  Cool little place transformed into a restaurant. They had trivia that night which wasn&#39;t too bad. 

The pizza wasn&#39;t all that great. Super doughy and didn&#39;t seem fully cooked. Definitely not the type I liked. And they got the toppings wrong.

Away from most of the busier spots in cap hill. The selection of food is basically sandwiches, pizza and salads. All of which are pretty average, nothing to brag about.

Great space and good people watching. The service, however, was horrible. A friend and I came and sat at the bar - we were the only ones at the bar - and not greeted at all. Only one other table in the restaurant. The bar top was dirty to start. We had to ask for drinks, a menu, and a rag to clean the bar. Then we had to ask to order food. When we did, they messed up our order - both size of pizza and toppings. The chef delivered the pizza and apologized for the size mistake. When we realized the topping mistake and told the bartender, she rolled her eyes and stormed back to the kitchen. It was corrected and the pizza was really good (hence the 2 stars). Our drinks were empty for 10 minutes (no joke - we timed it) before they were refilled.

While we sat, we observed a few other things. The bartender started pouring a Stella, noticed a lipstick stain on the glass, got a new glass, poured the half beer into the new glass, and kept filling from the tap. It was served to the table behind us. A similar situation happened with a glass of wine and a chipped glass. When I was bartending, this was NEVER ok. You got a new glass and a new pour.  We also saw them handling the glasses by the top and putting dirty hands where people would drink. In general, the bar service was slow and unsure. 

As we sat, others came and it was no different. They had to ASK for drinks or menus.  The patio got busy and service seemed equally horrible out there. The most annoying part is that there were other waitstaff just sitting around. 

OMG! As I sit here and type this, we just saw a new bartender start to fill a beer from the tap, notice a lipstick stain on the glass, wipe off the glass, continue pouring beer in the SAME glass, and serve it to a customer. Gross. 

The food saved this place. I&#39;ll probably give it another chance - but not order a drink :)"
capitol-hill-tavern-denver,Carl W.,YkSIrSJXf_OvIsinxBB7Rg,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,21,7,SgUMtQ0kJQenzqm1xA7oPw,1.0,2014-05-18,"My girlfriend and I both awoke this morning to hangovers and an empty fridge - going out for brunch sounded much more attractive than heading to the grocery store, so we walked over to Oblio&#39;s, about a block from where we live.

This is a cool old building, that does well representing some of the unique architecture of Cap Hill.  The interior has some odd design choices, but overall it was a comfortable space.  No qualms here.

The brunch menu is incredibly short.  Omelet, pancakes, an egg scramble, and a breakfast burrito.  We both ordered bloody marys, and both got scrambles after the waitress warned us away from the omelets (quote: &#34;they&#39;re made in the pizza oven.  They&#39;re not good.&#34;).  

They advertise a bloody mary bar, but that was nowhere to be seen.  Instead, we simply ordered drinks from the bar.  It appears that they use a bloody mary mix straight from the bottle, and it&#39;s just plain bad.  Too sweet, and full of bits of whatever it&#39;s seasoned with.  I really wanted to pour my drink through a sieve, though that still wouldn&#39;t have improved the flavor.  Garnish for the drinks was 1/2 frozen celery (though somehow dried out at the same time), and a sad toothpick with the tiniest lime slice you&#39;ve ever seen, and a couple of the cheapest Sysco green olives they could find.

The egg scrambles are described on the menu as eggs, with your choice of 2 toppings, cheddar cheese, all served over red potato homefries.  I ordered mine with black olives and tomatoes, and GF got hers with bacon, onions, and topped with pork green chili.  Starting with hers, the &#34;pork&#34; green chili was clearly from a can, and didn&#39;t seem to have any actual pork in it.  The &#34;homefries&#34; were nothing more than shoestring french fries, chopped up, deep fried, with nothing added to them, and no seasoning at all.  My scramble was ordered with black olives (cheap Sysco canned olives again), and tomatoes (which were about 1/2 ripe).  The eggs were horribly over cooked and brown, and were also completely unseasoned.  

My final conclusion: even though I like supporting local business, and this place is close enough to hit with a thrown rock, I can&#39;t see any reason to go back.  There are too many other restaurants in or near Cap Hill where I can get a good bloody mary, a better selection of brunch dishes, or really good pizza.  On the upside, I&#39;ll be looking forward to checking out whatever restaurant moves into this space once Oblio&#39;s fails."

Now, let me start this review of the Oblios Cap Hill Tavern, by stating the following ratings for it:
pizza = 4 stars
interior/overall experience = 2 stars

Oblios Cap Hill Tavern was once Fleur Bistro, once a flower shop, once a bridal shop. All are still invisible inside.

The front room is the &#34;bar area.&#34; The ornate ceiling is still there, from one of the previous establishments. This room is small and bright. There is a tv, and a nice atmosphere.

The back room is definitely &#34;the back room,&#39; and not well thought out. We wondered if we were still in the same restaurant. There are purple &#34;tiles&#34; or what look like tiles, along the wall that is the exterior of the kitchen, which run along the length of this back room. There are two large L-shaped sectionals, and I mean LARGE, on each end of the room.  Each of these can seat (but not comfortably) 8-10 people, so LARGE sectionals. Sitting on one of these L-shaped sectionals, either forces you to sit forward, at the end of the cushion, so you can reach the table. Or, if you sit way back, to try to be comfortable, you won&#39;t be able to reach the table. Did I mention the sectionals are LARGE! The tables in this back room, are large rectangular tables, which look they have were after thoughts. There are also smaller square tables, which could seat four people, but the type of chairs in this room are &#34;lounge&#34; type chairs, which cut the seating down to these smaller square tables to two.  Maybe that is what they were going for, I don&#39;t know.

There are three large screen tvs in this room. There is also a large (no LARGE) chandelier in the center of the room, which seems out of place. I&#39;m assuming this is from when the place was a bridal shop. Can you see it now... the bride-to-be steps out of the dressing room, and steps onto the round circular platform that is in the center of the room, under the chandelier. She can see herself in the row of mirrors that were along the wall, between the two large L-shaped sectionals, where her family and friends were anxiously waiting to see her in her wedding gown. Oh, I digress. This is now Oblios Cap Hill Tavern. Are you getting the picture?
The back room is dark, and nothing seems to fit, the back room seems like an after thought. Several other people walked in while we were there, and had odd expressions on their faces, as if they too questioned if this was the same restaurant.

The food is good, and we still love the pizza! We have previously eaten at the first Oblios Pizza in Northern Denver, so we knew what to expect, at least the food anyways.

Service - ok.  

Parking - street parking, and in this part of town, there are plenty of apartments, so plan on walking.

Will we be back? Maybe in a year, when they finish the interior, and actually turn the place into a great restaurant, like the original Oblios.  We&#39;ll see if they are still around."

Nice patio and inside ambiance,  there&#39;s some great plaster work inside for those that appreciate it.  The food is quite good and is consistent.  Try the rotisserie wings extra crispy; they are ridiculous!  The pizzas are quite tasty as well.  They have a suite of TV&#39;s as well, viewable from the main room and patio for the sports fan.

In general great neighborhood spot to meet friends or a group.  My only complaint,  which is improving every time I visit, is quality of service across the board (servers and bartenders), except for the chef/cook that always seems to deliver my food.  He&#39;s a gent and just seems to loves his food and the people that eat it!

It&#39;s definitely worth a visit, the service has improved and it shouldn&#39;t disappoint!

The bar opens to both the inside and outside for those nice summer days, and it&#39;s a great place to grab a drink. Full disclosure- it is a pizza place. We didn&#39;t order but they looked pretty damn good. 

I took off one star because the cannoli I ordered left something to be desired. The shell was overdone, and they were lazy on the filling. Also the generic chocolate syrup they used to make it look pretty ended up drowning the cannoli."

For food, we ordered up an Italian sandwich and some wings, both delicious.  There is a limited brunch menu but they plan to expand on it.

The crust is good, there&#39;s a good selection of toppings, and the mutz is nice and soft.

Bonus points for having delicious appetizers, a good happy hour menu (try the Bankers plate- a small pizza, salad, and beer for under ten bucks), friendly servers, and a good bar. Not to mention a historic building and outdoor patio.

The only downside I can think of is parking; it is Cap Hill, after all. But after 7 PM you can park right out front."

Two things I would like improved- one, I would like to see prices next to the beers on the menu, since everything else but the specialty cocktails had prices (and I mean, those could have prices too), two, the meatball sub was tasty and the lobster roll looks good as well, but LAYS as the side? Not the nicest complement to a fancy sammy. But hey, the place just opened, maybe an upscale chip is on it&#39;s way.

Overall, I have high hopes for this place, with its comfortable seats, metal detailed bar, jazz music and beautiful antique design. They took an already interesting space and classed it up even further. Cheers!"

Situated in an old Victorian house in Cap Hill, this restaurant is great for day drinking/eating. The garage style doors open up behind the bar to a nice sized outdoor patio that gets busy during happy hour and on nice days. The Stromboli is greasy, but really good and the pizza is decent. They host Trivia during the week. One downside is they used to deliver, but have stopped which means I don&#39;t order nearly as much....really ever. If they would hire a delivery driver, I would be ordering much more. Otherwise, I pop in on nice days when I am looking for pizza, a beer, and decent atmosphere."

The $2 mimosas saved the experience slightly, as did the very nice albeit extremely slow staff. My friend got a traditional item on the menu and had a better food experience.

The first time they forgot my drink, the next time they forgot our pizza. After 40 minutes, the waitress remembered us and came to inquire what we&#39;d ordered- she had never even put the order in. We kept going back thinking they were just taking awhile to get all of the kinks of running a business worked out. Nope! 

The most recent time, they forgot us!  My fiancé and I spoke with a staff member at the host station (presumably the hostess) and got on the wait list. Several minutes later, we saw the couple behind us speak with the bartender and she put them on a different list. We were confused so we went up to check that we were still on the list. It turns out there were &#34;different&#34; lists. The bartender told us in no uncertain terms that she had no idea about the list at the front hostess stand but that her list was the &#34;real list&#34; and that we could be put at the bottom of it. We said forget it and promptly left and haven&#39;t been back. How rude! Our friends went and described a similar experience. 

My experience is similar to some of the other one and two star reviews. Whereas this restaurant was once packed on Friday and Saturday nights, I now only see a couple of customers at any given time. Not surprising in the least. You can&#39;t treat customers like crap, or they won&#39;t be customers for long.

UPDATE: In addition to being treated rudely while visiting this restaurant, the owner, Thomas G, posted an unhinged rant in response to my (fairly moderate) Yelp review above referring to it as &#34;slander&#34; and &#34;feible critique&#34;. Within a few hours, his response was removed by Yelp because it was harassment. I&#39;m also assuming he meant feeble but who knows? It&#39;s a bit shocking that the owner would continue disrespecting customers even after the visit. Due to my treatment after the fact, I definitely won&#39;t be back to this establishment and will ensure that I warn my friends as well."

It took forever to get our appetizer and finally our salad came out and I asked when the pizza would be up,  my kids were very hungry.   She said the kitchen was backed up,  even though we were one of the first ones there,  but it should be out in 10 min or so.   After about 20 minutes she came back and handed me the bill saying she took the pizza and salad off the bill.   I asked when the pizza would be out and she said unfortunately they dropped the pizza.   I asked if they were going to make another one  and she said no. I was beside myself... My kids were so hungry.   I told her to go back into the kitchen and have them fire a new one for my kids.   She then went to another table and handed out silverware and then went to the bar and spoke to someone.   By this time I was so fed up I walked up to her and said not to fire that pizza,  we were leaving. I cannot believe they dropped our pizza and didn&#39;t make another one!?   Rediculous.

First the good. I left there with all of my body parts intact

The bad was the service. I had to track down our server to let her know we wanted to order after sitting there for 20 minutes. Then at the end of the meal (meal is being generous in terms) their register system went down. After another 20 minutes I stated that I was leaving so either figure it out or dinner is on the house. I&#39;m sure the number I was given was inflated

Now for the ugly - the food. Casa Bonita would have been better. Beans served with an ice cream scoop - and these were old - had been in the warming tray a good two or three days. I honestly think alpo dog food would have tasted better

If you&#39;re hungry and desperate I suggest you resort to cannibalism before dining here"

The best part about this place were the chips. The salsa tasted like tomato soup with onion.

I had the combo number three. It came with a shredded beef taco, been burrito and cheese and onion enchilada. I am 99% positive that the food was frozen. My taco was soggy and drowning in water. My plate with the burrito and enchilada was also soaked in water. Usually, water comes from meals that are frozen.

I was a bit reluctant to try it because of the lower rating, but the bad reviews are honestly absurd. 

I&#39;m not sure what people expect, but this is one of the better Mexican places.  Maybe we got lucky (we&#39;ve only been there once), but it was honestly pretty darn good.

When it comes to Mexican, I am very picky about being a &#34;regular&#34; customer. There are key components that it must contain. There are so many of these around, there has to have a perfect combination of the following in order for a 5/5:
1) Great food (Entrees, chips/salsa)
2) Inexpensive (which I feel should be a staple of Mexican food)
3) Great Margaritas (100% must have)

La Cueva has 2/3 of these in the bag. Their food was great.  The staff did a good job and the Margaritas are excellent. The only problem is that it&#39;s a bit on the pricier side for me to become a regular. The food is fair enough, but the margs are expensive. Now, with that being said... the margs cost a bit more because they only have higher quality tequila stocked. Would love to see a $6 Cuervo House on the menu. Ha.

We will be coming here again, but I&#39;m not totally convinced this is a regular spot for me. 
Overall, I give it a 4/5. It is definitely worth giving a visit.

(As a disclaimer, the only Mexican restaurant I&#39;d give a 5/5 would be Los Dos Potrillos, as it has all 3 components. La Loma would be close at a 4.5/5, but their margaritas are very expensive, but really good, and the food is incredible.)"

On the other hand if we lived close I would be here all the time.  We have been coming here for over 34 years and have never been disappointed.  I love the green chili. It is so tasty.  Sometimes it is really hot and other times not so much but it is always good.  The beef burritos and the enchiladas are great.  The staff is always friendly and the service is great.  The restaurant is always clean, including the restrooms. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price this is the place to go."

Much of the food tastes like it came straight out of a can.  Chile rellenos seemed to be boiled and beans tasted like they were purchased in the chip isle at the local grocery story.  Great customer service would have made it better, but they seemed to be fresh out of that as well.  Cheese and onion enchilada should be renamed onion and cheese.  I think four years in Albuquerque might have spoiled me for good food.  Green chile was the biggest disappointment.  Probably deserve a 0 star rating."

Apparently our reservation had been &#34;misplaced&#34; so we wait 15 minutes to be seated. OK, that happens...no big deal

Strike Number Two: Our food arrives one and a half hours later! I&#39;m not kidding. Can you imagine with four kiddos as bedtimes are missed? My Diet Coke glass sat empty in full view of our waitress for over an hour plus chip baskets were never refilled.

Strike Number Three: OK I admit to being a Tex-Mex snob from Houston. But their food was very average even by Colorado standards. I ordered the Punta a la Ranchera which was advertised as a rib eye steak. Wrong... What I received was a tasteless piece of recently frozen Swiss steak covered with raw onions. Yummmm!. 

Tonight three firsts occurred in my life: I returned a meal for the first time in my life. I stiffed the wait staff for the first time in my life. I wrote a negative review for the first time in my life.

It was a bunch of ground meat with some melted cheese on top. We also had the guacamole, which needed more flavor. Then we had the Haga Su Taco and the Fajitas de Camarones.

Close to an hour later, more than half the tables were empty but we were still the 8th name on the list. We figured the only way to get any food was to order some apps from the bar. We ordered a quesadilla and some nachos. (pretty simple food). These took so long to arrive that we had to each grab a piece of the quesadilla on the way out the door and we gave the nachos to another group that was waiting.

I give this restaurant a one star for customer service, price and food preparation ; 3 for taste. The staff is not friendly including the woman that provides the water and chips. Wondering why they are in business for the public if they hate the &#34;public&#34;? Which comes down to the price. The companies in it only for the money. From 2005 the plates have became small and price has dramatically increased. They had signs making excuse for the small portions recommended by F&amp;D administration but could not find why all the plates doubled even tripled in price? Beans are cheap you can go anywhere on colfax for a combo plate for cheap! When receiving the plate there was no cheese, there was no chili and the staff seems extremely agitated for a request for more chips and salsa. I wanted atleast to put the salsa on the burrito but the owners daughter never came back. In turn I wound up pouring the tbs of salsa on my burrito. So I give the food preparation a one star as well. Lastly, while the wait staff was cleaning off the other table Angie poured the remaining water from the other table into my glass while walking by. I was so agitated by the lack of customer service, the flippant attitudes and the comfortability of being rude to its customers... after being a loyal customer since 2005, it is very evident this restaurant does not value it&#39;s customers, ARE IN IT JUST FOR THE MONEY and I in turn will not value this resturant."

So far, the service has been pretty inconsistent... no one had been outright rude, but we&#39;ve had pretty long breaks between visits from waitstaff. Drinks and items from orders have been forgotten, but have been brought quickly upon the second request. Keep in mind, though, that the restaurant is probably busier before a show at the Fox than usual, and I never did see waitstaff just standing around doing nothing. The manager and owner were also quick to jump in when they could see a problem. 

Overall, the food has been pretty mediocre. As others have noted, many dishes don&#39;t come with rice and beans, and to order them as sides ends up pushing the tab above comparable restaurants in the area. Others have noted that the quality of the food seems to have taken a turn for the worse over time, and I suspect that this may be the case. There aren&#39;t a ton of dinner options in the area, so there may not be much incentive to want to get better. 

Others have complained about the salsa being heavy on onions - this is true, but is actually a positive for me. I love chunky salsa, and that at La Cueva has always seemed extremely fresh. 

Drinks in the bar area, margaritas especially, were pretty darned expensive for the quality - I haven&#39;t ordered one since my first time there."

I got a quesadilla and asked for beef.  It came out and was the barbacoa (beef so I think it technically has a different name as I think barbacoa is pork).  Anyway, it was the shredded beef that was in a broth, so it make the quesadilla really soggy.  I really should have been carne asada or fajita meet that was grilled.

The chips and salsa were ok, but nothing to write home about.  They apparently charge for extra chips/salsa after the first complimentary round.  I hesitated to ask for more salsa as I did not want to be charged, but I went ahead and did so.  Fortunately they did not charge me for the seconds on the salsa.

They are ok friendly here......pleasant but it is more of just going through the motions and not really being sincere about it.

I have been eating here for close to 20 years and the taste of the food is always the same!  I used to get my fix once a week; however, since my job location changes I make sure to visit at least twice a month.  This restaurant is only one of a few Mexican restaurants that I have been to in all of my years in Colorado (born and raised, with a mother that LOVES Mexican food) that serves everything house made, even the tortillas!  When guests come to town, this is always their choice for Mexican food.

I have tried pretty much everything on the menu...the shredded beef and chicken burritos  smothered with green chile and queso cheese are pretty much my usual orders, but my husband loves the tamales and the chile rellenos that are both served with your choice of green or red chile.  I have never had the red chile as I&#39;m a green chile fan.  La Cueva does not disappoint on the green chile that looks like gravy and lacks flavor.  Because the green chile is made daily the spice index of the green chile can range from spicy to hot depending on the heat of the chile pepper.  Molly and Alfonzo (the owners) are quick to let you know how spicy the chile is prior to ordering.The meat is stewed with seasonings and tomatoes.    The enchiladas are made with homemade corn tortillas, white queso cheese, and an enchilada sauce that tastes like it has a hint of mole in it.  

Another plus for them, they do not use yellow cheese that takes away the flavor of the food, but authentic Mexican white cheeses that enhance the flavor of the meat and the chile.   

Need a margarita fix?   The margaritas seem pricey but they are served in fish bowl sized glasses.  One or two are pretty much all you need, unless you want to walk out of the restaurant sideways. 

The service can be a bit slow if they are crowded (the most I waited to order was 10 minutes), however, the food takes no time to come out of the kitchen and when it comes out, it&#39;s piping hot.

 The only things that I have found disappointing here is the chips and salsa;  the chips lack flavor and the salsa consists of tomatoes and onions with a spicy kick.  And, I think that they overcharge for extras such as a side of sour cream.

Compared to the many other Mexican restaurants in and around the Denver and Aurora metro areas, the cost of the food has not escalated that much since I started eating here 20 years ago."

First of all, to park here is a nightmare.  The parking lot is behind the restaurant, so you have to navigate the off-shoots of East Colfax.  And who does&#39;t enjoy that?  But I can&#39;t really blame La Cueva for that nuisance.
  
Although we were quickly seated, our server didn&#39;t realize that we were waiting to be served for at least 10 minutes, which I guess gave us plenty of time to choose an entree.  Everything our party of three ordered was what I would consider to be &#34;easily made&#34; food at any Mexican restaurant:  tacos (soft shelled and hard shelled) and flautas.  After nearly 30 minutes, our meal finally arrived.

Definitely tasty, and thankfully still hot.  But sadly, if you wanted any sides with your tacos (rice, beans, etc), it would be an extra $3.50.  A bit too pricey, really.

Twas a mess to separate our bill as well.  Ugh.

Sadly, I would pass on La Cueva in the future for a lunch out with coworkers.  The service was much too slow to make it back to work in an orderly fashion.  Especially since the dinning room was only half full.  

Maybe their happy hour is good?  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be back to find out..."

After coming back to the house and checking the Yelp reviews of La Cueva, I was really surprised to see so many reviews with a single star.  We had a very good experience at the restaurant.

The ingredients were all fresh, the chorizo was homemade and was very good.  The margaritas were also good.

The prices were a little high for the location, the atmosphere and for Denver, but they weren&#39;t exorbitant.  However, you are getting fresh ingredients, not food dumped out of a can.

The service was attentive and the woman who served us was very nice.

I do recommend this restaurant."

Margaritas were pretty good (we all had the house Margie&#39;s for $6), but a $10 Cadillac margarita was a bit ridiculous given the rest of the menu&#39;s pricing and sketchy neighborhood La Cueva is in.

It certaily has street appeal which is why we drove the distance to give it a try.  Upon entering it is warm and welcoming with a colorful palate lit with dancing candle light and individual lights above each table.  At this point I was really excited and in the mood for some flavorful Mexican food that was different from the norm of cheesy, greasey mounds of meat with a side of salsa.  

Ok, here comes the hostess.  Uh oh.  She is clearly not excited to be seating another table and is is only 7 p.m.  I will wait to judge based on the actual table side service.  

Can you say indifferent?  Our waitress really did not seem to care at all that we were in her section and ready to spend some money.  Beer (bottled), margarita (good, worth two) and salsa (fresh, mild and packed with onions)...let the food review begin.  

Wait, stop....what the hell is wrong with this menu?  All four or five combos consist of a beef taco, refrito tostado, refrito burrito and an onion and cheese enchilada (all priced at $8.75 not including beans and rice). Yes, it clearly states that other combos can be made from the a la carte menu, buy why?  Oh, I see.  All the plates you really want to order cost $15.95.  Wow.  

The Carne Asada - Chile and garlic marinated thin slices of tender beef, grilled and served with grilled onion, roasted jalapeño, pico, guacamole, and two flour or four corn tortillas sounds lovely as does the Haga Su Taco - Beef barbacoa (Mexican barbeque) marinated in black chiles, slow baked and grilled with onions, tomato, jalapeño, served with pico, guacamole, two flour or four corn tortillas BUT NOT for $15.95.  None of the specialties are represented on the a la carte menu or the combos plates.  A real downfall.  

So we ordered the chile rellenos and a chicken burrito a la carte and beans a la carte.  The green chile is quite lovely with its smokey sense of straight forward heat.  No pork here, just a wonderous array of fresh ingredients that dazzle with color and texture.  

Will it be enough?  Sadly, no.  The service and the food options will not draw us back down Colfax even though it is my favorite road in the state.  Maybe we will try Rico Pollo 2 a few blocks to the west.  Bummer."

They have a variety of wines and the decor is really weird for a mexican joint.  The wait is super long and the food is pretty mediocre other than the green chili.  And the chili was really only good becuase it was really hot.  So if you don&#39;t mind a long wait but want really hot green chili, you should go.  I also felt like the wait for a drink at the bar was really long.  

Oh and they brought out our food at different times, I got my food like 10 minutes before my ladyhawk got hers so, although I am a gentleman, after it started to get cold I ate it.  I was done right about the time she got hers and watched while she ate.  

So I guess, I just feel that this place is average at best.  I&#39;m not really excited to go back, but happy that I checked it out."

I was part of a lunch party of 12 and they seemed well prepared for us at first, we had the conservatory area and as we were led through the restaurant, I&#39;ll be honest, I quite liked what I saw of  the interior.

The illusion that the staff were prepared was somewhat dispelled by the patchy service. I&#39;d guess there was a good 10 minutes between the first and last dishes to arrive on the table. Add to that a mistaken order (&#34;Oh you wanted no meat?&#34; - yes, that&#39;s generally the concept behind a vegetarian dish) and a &#34;generous&#34; 4 flour tortillas to split between 3 people (although when we pointed this out, they did give us another 4) and I was left wondering if they were even paying attention. But these are minor complaints and not the real crux of the problem with La Cueva.

Frankly, the food was, at best, average. When done right, I really like Mexican food. I usually judge it on my experiences in New Mexico, having never made it south of the border. Unfortunately, too many restaurants serve a mess of congealed cheese, which to me, is an easy way out.

I guess the Green Chili is dish to go for, judging by the reviews, however, one dish does not a good eatery make. As it turned out, I had the Chicken Mole which was distinctly average, served with the usual trimmings, plenty of food, but honestly, rather bland considering the flavours involved in a good mole.

None of my companions appeared too taken with the place and I left distinctly underwhelmed. Maybe it deserves a second chance, maybe there are dishes that win and dishes to avoid, whatever, I can&#39;t see myself giving it a second chance."

I enjoy their shredded chicken most, and the various combination plates certainly give you plenty of food.  Chips are good, but salsa is very thin and watery.  Service is very friendly, though often slow.  Their margaritas have been pretty hit or miss, sometimes really tasty, sometimes pretty weak.  And they&#39;re very pricey; a pitcher costs $30!  Entrees are in the $8-12 range mostly, though there&#39;s an entire page of specialties that run about $15.  Seems a little high for the neighborhood, don&#39;t you think?  Parking is behind the building, in a funky lot that requires some serious navigation skills, but at least you don&#39;t have to park on Colfax.

Like most Mexican restaurants you start off your meal with a basket of chips and salsa.  They have recently added notes on their tables explaining that only the first basket and salsa are free.  The ice cream sopapilla is a bit of a monster, but can be easily taken down by 3 people...for 2 it&#39;s a bit of a feat.  The service is average, but the servers are nice.

The smoky flavor is great. 4 stars.

The service was 2 stars. Slow to arrive. Indifferent attitude. Never returned to see how we were doing. They lost a beer sale purely because of the waitress.

I like the atmosphere.

Since it was my last chance to yelp a new spot, I grabbed the opportunity with two hands. 

Not sure what came over me, because rumor had it, that Mexican or latin food in the Denver area couldn&#39;t hold a light to Cali&#39;s offerings.  But Mexican food calls out to me constantly! Salssssaaaaaaaaa, tortillaaaassss, guacamoleeeeeeeeeeee.... And then my mouth starts to salivate. Yes, the sight is not pretty. 

Yelp lead me here. It was close to the airport,  got some solid reviews, and one from someone from Cali to top it off! Okay, I had to try it then. 
Long story short, the food was definitely different than I had expected in a few ways. Their refrijitos, which had awards on the wall, were scooped out onto the plate with in an ice cream scoop, and a small scoop at that. Well, as you guessed, any beans that can be scooped and placed on a platter while keeping its shape were not too moist. I am just not used to that. They weren&#39;t bad though, just not award worthy in my book. Rice was average. 
Fajitas were not cheap at close to 16 bucks, and had only a small portion of meat. A hearty meal if you are the only one eating, but seemed a little steap. 
Salsa and chips were good. The salsa had a kick to it which was good. 
I think that the best deal were the taco plates. The tacos and flautas were greasy, but definitely tasty. They fry the tacos and the meat is juicy. We also liked the chili rellenos with Green sauce. Spicy and cheesy. My fave combo. 

The service was good, and the waitstaff nice. I would have given the place 3 stars, for the steap prices, but I would much rather come here and support the mom and pops, than go to a place like El Torito or Acapulco&#39;s."

I thought that the chips were great - they were thin, packed a nice pleasant crunch and had a great flavor.  The salsa was disappointing.  It tasted like something you&#39;d get in a jar at the grocery store.  The guac was fabulous, but the price was way too steep.  $7.95 for what estimate to be no more than two avocados is a little ridiculous.  But it is really tasty!  Our margaritas were perfection - though it was disappointing that it wasn&#39;t happy hour and the prices were once again - quite steep.  For an entree, we split an order of their slow roasted pork shoulder - it was good, though I felt that it lacked some flavor and was a bit dry.  

Overall, La Cueva is a nice place to eat.  A fun spacious decor nestled into the historic Fletcher city center in Aurora."

OK, here&#39;s all I have to say --- green chili.  The hottest, meanest, most delish chili I&#39;ve ever had.  I mean, ask my husband, I have spent entire Sundays trying to mimic their green chili using everything required of great chili, freshly roasted chilis, everything!!  La Cueva&#39;s comes in one temp. and that&#39;s hot.  Although you can opt for vegetarian (w/out the pork).  I once read a review that said the person would be happy just sitting in a corner, all alone with their bowl of green chili.  It&#39;s hot.  I mean religious experience hot.

Well, I guess there&#39;s more to say... flour tortillas.  When I was about 10, my family lived about a mile away from my best friend at the time.  She is now running (and has run in the past) in the Olympics by the way.  Anyway, her family migrated from Mexico.  Her mom stayed at home and cooked all day.  One of the things I always looked forward to was coming over after school and chowing down on some hot off the griddle tortillas.
So you must go to La Cueva if anything to try the tortillas.  Second, the green chili.

They have an impressive selection of tequila.  Margs, I guess are just so so.  That&#39;s a drawback.

I&#39;ll speak for my husband now:  He doesn&#39;t like the Southwestern/Mexican food I grew up on, he&#39;s more Calif. style.  He LOVES their specialties, the fish, etc.  Try that if you are a Calif. transplant searching for your home food.

My only worry:  The owners will call it quits someday!!"

- The kids in the room next to us were all really loud, it was very echo-y.  I don&#39;t remember any background music. 

We found the menu to be very unfriendly and &#34;bossy&#34;.....
The menu reads:  Yes, these dishes (their specialties) take 20 minutes (because they have to thaw them?...)   No, there can not be any substitutions, but you can build your own plate from the a la carte (you do the math).  Yes, if you want rice and beans with your enchiladas it is $ 3.50 more (for a gob of dry beans and cold rice?!!).  Every one of our entrees were ordered different, but every one looked the same with the same &#34;straight from the can&#34; enchilada sauce.

I now rate them along with Benny&#39;s and the Blue Bonnet and, if you read my reviews, you know what I think of them.  The food is nothing more than ordinary.

When La Cueva opened in the early 1970&#39;s, it was your typical small Mexican restaurant fighting to survive.  Through the hard work and persistence of the Nunez family, they were able to build a restaurant that became a mainstay of downtown Aurora.  Walk into La Cueva and you see the restaurant that hit its peak in the 1980&#39;s.  The Southwestern decor and food all are typical of Mexican restaurants of twenty five years ago.  There are very few of these 1980&#39;s style Mexican restaurants still around.

The restaurant business is a dynamic industry.  Interior design and menus have to change to retain business.  A few restaurants refuse to change and in time they become institutions.  They survive because they are great at what they do.  However, most restaurants that refuse to change, just dissapear.

I am amazed that La Cueva still survives.  It is not great at what it does.  The food and decor are very tired. The service is indifferent.  The Nunez family must own their building.  When their matriarch finally dies, I would be very surprised to see the business survive.  Running a sucessful restaurant requires energy and a basic vitality.  The next generation lacks these qualities."

This describes the service at La Cueva. Although the food is excellent (I&#39;ll get to that later) the service is...well, not. We arrived for lunch and the three of us were promptly seated and then ignored for several minutes. The restaurant was about half full and it looked as if they were not under staffed. Finally our drink order was taken and we received a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa. We received our food in a reasonable amount of time. Then we were completely forgotten. No &#34;can I get you a refill on your soda or bring you another beer&#34; or &#34;would you like some more chips&#34; - nada. Yes, I did want a refill and yes my husband did want another beer but apparently our waitress was too busy to notice. 

The food however is great. The green chili is thin but not watery and full of flavor and lots of heat. After a few minutes getting used to the spice, the inside of your mouth adjusts and you&#39;re ready to eat more and more. I had a simple ala carte burrito which included beans and shredded beef, smothered with the fabulous green, and light amount of melted cheese, lettuce and tomato - simple and perfect. 

The chips are fresh, crisp and not greasy. Thy only need a bit of salt. The salsa is the only downer here - I agree with other Yelper&#39;s complaints that the salsa, although obviously homemade has way too much onion. It&#39;s like a bowl of onions with some tomatoes mixed in.

Four stars for the food - two for the service. Since unless you live in Aurora, you practically have to pack a lunch just to drive there, they should make the experience worth your while. Sadly, the quality of the food does not really make it worth the trek."

We chose the shared dish Vetkoek &amp; Mince and main courses Ouma&#39;s Bobotie, Chicken Sosatie and a sampler plate. They served all the dishes -- shared and main -- at the same time. We might ask next time if the vetkoek could be served first like an appetizer. The Ouma&#39;s Bobotie was our favorite of the four.

The stupefyingly swell South African food truck called Jozi&#39;s Kitchen &amp; Shebeen now has a brick-and-mortar location in the &#34;Hobby Lobby&#34; stripmall at Parker/Mainstreet. And luckily, the food&#39;s just as lekker as ever.

One of my favorite starters here is the pillowy Afrikaner fried bread called Vetkoek, available with either tangy homemade apricot jam or lightly spiced mincemeat. (At Jozi&#39;s, the latter is served on the side rather than already stuffed in, making these vetkoek a bit similar to their Zulu cousin, the Amagwinya). Alternatively, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Safari Platter and its bountiful bevy of dried meats like Biltong and Droëwors (no, please don&#39;t refer to them as &#34;jerky and Slim Jims&#34; - you&#39;ll give the owners a conniption - and quite rightly so, too) with a little fruit on the side for good measure. Or, if you&#39;re bound and determined to add some pizzazz to your palate, how about chicken wings with tongue-tingling Mozambican-in-origin Piri-Piri sauce? But don&#39;t get too wild - after all, you want to have quite a few tastebuds left for the next course, as I&#39;m about to illustrate!

South Africa&#39;s Cape Malay communities (who have their earliest origins in present-day (for example) Indonesia, Malaysia and India) are famed for their use of spices such as cardamom, cloves and cinnamon, and nowhere is this clearer than the casserole-like item known as Bobotie - spiced ground beef or soft lentils napped with a savory egg topping. Or, you could always partake in some Bunny Chow which, despite its name, consists of curried chicken or beef (or the zesty bean sauce called Chakalaka) ladled into a hollowed-out bread loaf. If you come late enough in the day, you can even avail yourself of Potjiekos - the rich lamb stew which kept many a Voortrekker warm on their journeys across the country (get it over corn porridge (Mieliepap) for the full effect). And don&#39;t forget to end with a Koeksister (syrupy pastry) or a slice of Melktert (custard pie)."

It wasn&#39;t mind blowing as the other reviews I read made it seem but I liked it. You walk in, order at the counter and get a number then they bring the food out to you. Props to them for an independent soda company vs. the bigger guys like Coke and Pepsi. The guy working the counter suggested we get the platter for our first time there but I feel like when we didn&#39;t order that he got short with us so not sure what that was about. I just wanted a smaller portion of something so a huge platter wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. I ended up going with the vegetarian bunny chow which is a vegetarian curry served over a huge piece of sour dough bread. The bread was fluffy and pretty much perfection. The vegetarian bunny show was mostly beans and tomatoes and not a lot of flavor. I was expecting some spice or flavor to it but I had to load peri peri sauce on there to make it pop. The portion was hearty and perfect for a cold night but I wouldn&#39;t go back for this alone. My husband had the peri peri chicken with rice and a salad and it was some of the best chicken I&#39;ve had.

My wife had Chakalaka and I had Ouma&#39;s Bobotie. Both were delicious and will be had again. I think I might try the Potjiekos next time, so we will have to come on the weekend. My wife wants the Chakalaka again!

The pièce de résistance, though, were the Durban Samosas which we took home for later. I have been complaining for years about the Samosas one finds in Indian restaurants here, which have a thick batter, which interferes with the flavor of the filling (in my opinion). 

The genuine Durban (where I grew up) Samosas are done with filo pastry, as were these. They were DELICIOUS!!

You have all the facets of a great and profitable restaurant, Angus, regards from Bruce &amp; Janine. Sarah, who served us, was delightful, funny and a great asset to the restaurant!"

I first became aware of Jozi&#39;s at Friday Night Bazaar where they served some food and were selling bilton.

The various salsas are really good, but they only have really small to go cups to serve them in (even if you eat there, which you shouldn&#39;t).  You&#39;ll have to spend more time at the salsa bar than you spend at your table. 

If you plan on paying with a card, they only take visa.  And like I said before, don&#39;t eat there.  Get your order to go, because the service here is utterly abhorrent and the TV is obnoxiously loud.  The food is pretty good, but even for restaurants food isn&#39;t everything."

Last year we ate here quite a bit &amp; always left satisfied! NOT THE CASE this time! Today was our 1st time going this year &amp; probably our last. We asked for asada tacos, they &#39;&#39;don&#39;t have that anymore&#39;&#39;, it&#39;s now ground beef or pulled beef. Asked for al pastor.... Nope! Don&#39;t have that anymore. I settled for a ground beef smothered burrito, my husband got the ground beef soft tacos, and our kids had nachos &amp; chicken smothered burrito. Everything except the nachos were watered down and bland. Not sure what change took place over 6 months but they are definitely on the bottom of the list of Mexican restaurants we&#39;ll eat at. 
I would really love to find the nearby Mexican restaurant that is now getting their business.

After a few months I went to get menudo, or try to get it when they opened early Saturday morning (you would figure would be ready for the cruda) but I was told had to wait 45 min. Why?! If you sell it, be ready to sell it to the early birds wanting it. Problem two, I called to make a order since I only have an hr lunch, someone picked up the phone and hangup. I called again because I like their tacos and I told the lady i had just called and they hangup, her reply was oh, sorry. I placed order and when I got there she said she tried calling me to tell me no more asada meat but call would not go through since I had an out of state number -_-. On both these incidents I did not buy anything from them but went next door to the little Mexican store and bought my food since they also have a hole in the wall restaurant where it&#39;s ALWAYS READY with the same product. If a worker or owner of this tacos and salsa location reads this, hire a better staff with more customer service and be ready to sell the food you advertise or you will keep loosing business."

He tried to order the chile relleno, but was told they were sold out. Ok, he ordered the pollo asado which came with a side of rice and beans and a little basket of 4 home made tortillas. I ordered 4 tacos; 2 adobada with pineapple, 1 tripa and 1 buche. We also ordered an agua de jamaica. Dad said the chicken, rice and beans were good and he was thrilled about the homemade tortillas. My tacos were good as well, but I was surprised that they were served with lettuce- typically it&#39;s the tortilla, meat and chopped cilantro and onion on top and a red or green salsa depending on the meat. The buche taco was my favorite and I added a spicy red salsa to it. The tripa was my second favorite- added green salsa to it. I didn&#39;t notice onion or cilantro at the salsa bar like other reviewers have mentioned, but it&#39;s possible I just didn&#39;t notice it as I just assumed they didn&#39;t serve their tacos with cilantro and onion as it didn&#39;t just come on the plate. The agua de jamaica was WAAAAAAAAY too sweet, in an obnoxious way. I ended up buying a bottle of water to water it down. I literally used the entire 16oz water bottle before the jamaica was bearable. The service was only ok. The waitress showed us a table; we sat down and she immediately wanted our order. We had to ask for more time twice and the second time she just stood over us until we ordered. The experience left a lot to be desired. It wasn&#39;t down right awful, it just wasn&#39;t great either."

Heading towards Carls Jr. my husband said he saw a sign for Tacos y Salas.  I probably turned the car towards the restaurant before he finished his sentence.  
 
I haven&#39;t been to any other locations so I don&#39;t know if the El Salvadorian food is a standard part of the package.  My husband and I used to eat at an El Salvadorian restaurant in Palm Springs and haven&#39;t had anything similar since living in Denver.  

I wasn&#39;t 100% sure the Pupusas would be what I was expecting them to be but they were, little pillows of deliciousness.  I ordered two, a queso and loroco and a queso and frijoles.  They are served with a cabbage and carrot slaw that I piled on and ate like a taco.  I was in heaven.  My husband tasted them but there wasn&#39;t any meat so he wasn&#39;t too impressed.  I also ordered an al pastor taco and was a bit underwhelmed.  The tortilla was homemade and delicious but the meat was chewy and not very flavorful.  I had pretty high expectations after having amazing tacos al pastor in Santa Fe a few weeks ago.  Alas, there was no pineapple and no flavor.  

My husband ordered a carne asada burrito.  The burrito wasn&#39;t sealed on either end which caused it to just break apart the moment Brian tried to pick it up (as I told him it would and suggested he rolled it over and was more cautious).  The carne was very flavorful and tender though so it smoothed out the minor inconvenience of picking at the broken carcass of a burrito. 

I rounded the meal out with a chilly Sidral and happily paid the $14.  I am salivating just thinking about another pupusa."

Dine in or order in, but it&#39;s just a hole in the wall. There&#39;s also a salsa bar.

Tacos were $1.50 each and papusas were $1.75 each. The carnitas and asada tacos are pretty darn good =) Wouldn&#39;t recommend the buche unless you already are a fan.

Pros: Tasty food, complimentary chips &amp; salsas, open late

Cons: Ran out of one of the salsas and didn&#39;t replace it and I once may have gotten food poisoning too after eating a buche taco"

Let me make one thing clear: This is not fine dining. Don&#39;t go in expecting fine dining, because it&#39;s not. It&#39;s delicious, infinitely customizable, quick personal pizza that is super well priced, and conveniently located. The patio is cute, if weather allows, and they allow dogs.

Through the years iPie has changed their ordering approach a little bit - originally you went down the line selecting items to add to your pizza as they constructed it. Now, you order all items at the cash register and then wait at your table as they construct and bake it. Beer and wine is also a change since iPie first opened.

The new location has lots of seating which is a positive. It also has the eye-popping paint colors that seem to be an iPie signature. And an electric train that circles one of the dining rooms which is kind of cool. Except it apparently overheats so it needs to be turned off much of the time. Which brings us to the less than positive about the new location - much of the facility - flooring, walls, booths, tables, chairs are definitely in less than good repair. This is unfortunate because if you&#39;re not an iPie regular, it could negatively tinge both your expectations and your perceptions. 

My family and friends and I have always enjoyed the pizza at iPie. They have a number of predefined pies but I strongly suggest that you design your own with unlimited toppings. Great value at $8.00. Lots of choices - 5 crusts (including gluten free for those in need of that), 11 sauces, 3 cheeses, 18 veggies and 8 meats. (Yes, I do need a life since apparently I have nothing better to do than count the number of toppings on the menu.) And kudos, iPie, for including anchovies as one of your &#34;meat&#34; options. Truth be told, they&#39;ve had to put my pie through the oven twice on some occasions because of the impressive number of ingredients I&#39;ve piled on it high. The young woman at the cash register even complimented me on the impressiveness of my pie this visit. 

I should also comment that with rare exception, the staff at iPie are generally great. Nice people, good food, good value - pretty much a winning combination. But I am concerned that the facility has the potential to weigh them down and I would hate for that to happen. I love funky, but there&#39;s a fine line between funk and grunge, and I hope that iPie will put some work into the facility to be sure that it&#39;s clear to all that they come down on the side of funk."

But eating gluten free and having good options is a different story.  That being said, I am so pleased with IPIE&#39;s gluten free crust! So much so I went back the next day to get another pizza! The gluten free crust isn&#39;t like biting into a steel cracker; its soft and chewy with just the right amount of crunch.  The size of the pie is perfect personal pan pizza style (reminiscent of the old Pizza Hut personal pan pizza style except better!), and for a little over $7 for a gluten free cheese pizza it doesn&#39;t break the bank.  The service is wonderful and friendly.  I&#39;ll probably be there sometime this weekend again to get my pizza fix in :)"

What we have always liked about I-Pie is that you get individual pizzas for a reasonable price.  The hubs and I are polar opposites about pizza.  I think meat on a pie is gross and he thinks meat on a pie makes the pie.  Doing individual pies let&#39;s us be our unique pizza selves and keeps the price and calories to a reasonable amount.  I also like the gluten free crust and it doesn&#39;t leave you bloated or feeling like you&#39;ve just eaten a strange version of cardboard.  I always get the Amy pie, no onions, sub green olives.

I have always loved IPie. Thier take on an egg breakfast pie is fantastic and unlike anywhere else. I also love the unique varieties of pizza pies available and the ability to make it unique to your own preferences too.

 The owner takes a lot of pride in her little business and it is neat to see her poor so much heart into the place. 

A great place to try out if you haven&#39;t. Be patient with the timing of the pizzas they are fresh made and cooked to order. Of each pizza takes 5-7 minutes to cook and you order 5 you might be waiting a while. However, unlike the other place they have new ovens that can cook more so they do get done faster."

I love it too but if there&#39;s something you should know about my mom: she doesn&#39;t love a lot of places.  She&#39;s one of those diners who is hypercritical of her experience from start to finish.  When I&#39;ve asked her how her food is, or what she thought of her breakfast / lunch / dinner, I can count on one hand the number of times she hasn&#39;t said something negative.  I have taken her to restaurants across the spectrum of fancy to divey and she&#39;s liked other places before, but iPIE is the only place I&#39;ve ever taken her that she&#39;s immediately wanted to return to.  

This weekend my mom was in town for a visit and we were out and about on Saturday: hiking at red rocks and dinosaur ridge, took a drive in the mountains, walked around the 16th street mall.  Typical &#34;family in town sightseeing&#34; type stuff.  At the end of the day, we were hungry but didn&#39;t have reservations anywhere and wanted something quick and easy.  I told her about iPie, since it was on the way and we could each get an individual pizza.  I&#39;m glad we did.  There was plenty of seating, the staff was friendly and funny, and the food was so good.  We ate our individual pizza at the restaurant and my mom decided to order one to go so we had a snack for later.  The next morning, she asked if we could call in an order for one of their breakfast pizzas.  She couldn&#39;t stop raving about the crust and how it was the best pizza crust she&#39;s ever had.

When I noticed iPie moved a little closer to my house and received good reviews on their GF pies, I thought I&#39;d give it a try. The new building is cool on the outside, but not so cool on the inside. I definitely prefer the old ordering system vs the new order at the register and take a seat while they prep your pie. The interior is very off-putting and needs a lot of work. Please remove that dingy carpet. If the owners put a little money into the interior and improved the ordering system, I might eat there again. Until then, it&#39;ll be only take-away."

Here pizzas are definitely completely edible and some might enjoy the flavor and the crust but once you&#39;ve had the real deal (blistery, wood fired pizzas with just a thin coat of tomate sauce) : Basta, Locale, Racca&#39;s, Cart Driver...you&#39;ll find that the crust here is way too sweet and doughy, the sauce is more like a paste and way too spiced (in Italy that would be a sin since the only use straight good tomatoes and salt). The toppings are not top quality, cheapy olives, cheapy arugula, cheapy tomatoes. The fact that they are sliced fresh doesn&#39;t mean much if you&#39;re not using top quality vegetables. They&#39;ll still takes like not much. Maybe find a better source, maybe a local farmer? The other thing is that the interior really needs a little remodeling. The carpet seems sad and worn and it&#39;s too much of a reminder of Red Tango. I love how this is a family business and how much care they put on their operations. They seem really nice, solid people. Service is very good and warm. Again, this is just an opinion on the style of pizza that I prefer.  I am sure that quite a bit of people would enjoy eating at this place a &#34;pie&#34; (as they prefer to call it here )...and nothing wrong with that.

Met up with friends for lunch. The menu had me at &#34;XL Pickle Brined Crispy Chicken.&#34; Basically, a pound of chicken fingers with two fantastic dipping sauces (remoulade &amp; green chile ranch) and plenty of shoestring fries. This is for $18. Normally, that&#39;s a little steep for chicken fingers, but when they say one pound of chicken minus the bones, that&#39;s a ton of chicken. I didn&#39;t finish all of it and it&#39;s probably for the best I didn&#39;t. I opted for Nashville hot chicken and you accumulate enough of that in your system, you&#39;re gonna have trouble.

I had trouble. 

But Red, our server, was pretty good. Kept that water and coke flowing. Also, I got a little distracted from my friends watching this ginormous TV showing the Alabama game.

I had 2 vodka/sodas with the house vodka (New Amsterdam), and while it was a good drink, it was a little pricy for not being Grey Goose (~$10 a pop)..so that&#39;s why I&#39;m giving 4 stars.

The pricey cocktails were lacking alcohol. Not worth the money.
It wasn&#39;t busy Wed night, the wait staff spoke more to each other than to our table. Sadly, the customer service was very poor for the price tag of this restaurant.

We didn&#39;t have any food, just drinks but the bartender was working alone and overwhelmed.

Second time was today for Mother&#39;s Day. Average crowd,plenty of empty seats. My daughter had a good kids meal, but my pumpkin spice pancakes weren&#39;t cooked through - none of the 3 were. The parts that were cooked through were delicious, but when you pay $10 for 3 pancakes, they&#39;d better be cooked. My husband had the applewood smoked bacon burrito and said it was fine, but nothing he would order again - especially after having breakfast burritos at places like Pete&#39;s Kitchen.

Typical diner food, but almost everything had a twist to it.  Two of my guy friends tried the fried chicken and were not unhappy with their decision to stray from the easy choice of a burger, which it appears Tom&#39;s is known for.  I shared a bunch of sides (garlic fries and brussels sprouts, hollerrrr) and the chopped salad with a friend, and everything we had was delicious - our plates were empty.

Food: ehhh.... very sloppy, some things tasted frozen
Come back? Only if you don&#39;t know where else to go

What we ordered:

- cheeseburger sliders: patty tasted frozen, but still good.

- avocado shrimp salad: so this salad has all the great, refreshing, ingredients you want. However, the dressing was poured over a flat (not fluffy) bed of spinach leaves. It really needed to be dressed well, and the fact that it didn&#39;t speaks to the quality and pride in the dishes this place serves (bleh).

-steak nachos: again, the ingredients were all there. But huge slabs of tasty steak topped the chips, so you either have to cut the steak into smaller pieces to get the perfectly topped tortilla bite, or eat the steak first and then.... it&#39;s already getting complicated. Point is they should cut the steak into smaller pieces for the purposes of topping nachos with it.  

Paid about $50 for two people."

I ordered the crispy brussels, which were HUGE (my Yelp check in ended up getting these comped).  We had tacos and fried pickles as well.  

For drinks, I had a margarita and some lemonade option.  Husband tried a local beer.   The atmosphere is fun.  They played 90&#39;s rock/alternative music, so we found ourselves singing along.

The menu is fairly expensive and varied - reminds me a bit of cheesecake factory. The lunch special for $10 is a good bargain - choose a half salad / hamburger / sandwich  + 1 side. I went with the kale cob salad, which was a little smaller than I would have hoped but was good. The thin-cut fries were a nice accompaniment to make a seemingly healthy meal not so healthy. We ordered a few starters as well - calamari (full of pieces of bell peper as filling, no bueno), bbq wings (decent) and the ghost pepper wings (from what I heard from other dining guests, these definitely packed a punch; keep some milk nearby)."

Tom&#39;s Urban was just around the corner from where we were, so we decided to check it out.

The interior was modern and inviting. They had cool crescent-shaped booths for seats as well as a bar behind the booths, and what seems to be another floor upstairs for additional seating. I really liked the fact that this place gets a lot of natural lighting and you can see what was going on outside.

The food on the menu all sounded good, so it was actually hard for me to pick and choose the perfect dish (though I was leaning towards getting a burger). I decided to go against my gut feeling of ordering a burger and got their mahi mahi.

The mahi mahi was bland. I don&#39;t think the stuff around it made it taste better, either. The avocados on my plate didn&#39;t taste very fresh and the slaw was just average tasting. I didn&#39;t leave completely underwhelmed because their fries were actually pretty bomb. I&#39;m not exactly sure what &#34;Moroccan ketchup&#34; is, but it had a unique flavor that went pretty well with the fries. Add a little Cholula hot sauce to the Moroccan ketchup for an extra dose of zing!  

My experience here was alright, but I feel like it would&#39;ve been better if I went with my initial notion of ordering a burger... I really have to try it out again on a different occasion, but in the mean time this place is just average."

Everyone does brussel sprouts, right? These were different: they described the sauce as Asian, which I would say accurate. You had your typical aromatics: ginger, garlic, lemongrass with what tasted like soy sauce and citrus. They were cooked perfectly. Drinks on point. We will be back!"

We were crawling the streets of downtown Denver and thanked our lucky stars we found a place to cure a case of the late night munchies. Also, this would beer #6 of the night. :)

BACON JALAPENO MAC &amp; CHEESE: Sans the bacon. This was on their special menu available only for the month of the July. Admittedly, my taste buds weren&#39;t 100% because of all the beer drinking and what not, but I liked my dish. It was spicy and perfectly creamy. Didn&#39;t even finish it all either even though it looked puny to me. 4/5

BOULDER CLUB: Both my husband and brother-in-law got this. They thought it was bomb.com 4/5

SERVICE: Host was nice, server could have done a better job with refills. We got a free Brussels sprout with Yelp check-in!

The dessert was the only part of the meal that had any real flair to it, it was also the best part of the meal! I enjoyed my time while I was here, but would not recommended. I can find similar or better places for my money."

Pros. Location. Atmosphere very attractive. Service. Happy hour.  Enjoyed figgy piggy. Saying figgy piggy is fun.  Served local Denver red wine. In can.  Nice menu with good variety.  Large number of small plates to share. 

Pick two for $10 lunches seem like a decent lunch.  A dozen options to mi and match. Nice different customize a smallish mid day meal. 

Cons. Uneven execution (sprouts not chopped/ unevenly.) 

Desserts. Don&#39;t do it. Hershey&#39;s syrup. ( or tasted just like it) on chocolate cake dessert.  Any time my daughter doesn&#39;t finish a small dessert it&#39;s just not worth it. 

I want to try other items but not impressed so so far. Am I picky and pretending to be a food critic? Yes and yes."

The food is overpriced and low quality, and everyone knows it, which is why this place is nearly empty during Sunday morning brunch rush. I ordered a sandwich and got something totally different than what was described on the menu; when I asked about it, the server had no idea why the kitchen didn&#39;t make the sandwich as described, and the kitchen didn&#39;t know, either. There are much better options in the neighborhood."

Between 3-5pm the drink prices for a pint of beer or well cocktails/some other cocktails on HH menu are between $3-$4 depending on the hour. $9 will easily get me 3 drinks which most other places around tend to be a lot more expensive. The draft beer selection is pretty good, and I&#39;ve enjoyed some of the menu HH cocktails like the Urban Mule.

I&#39;ve had a few of the HH appetizers and have enjoyed every one I tried.

The service from the bartender, Claire (blue hair), has been great.

I will keep coming here for Friday HH."

Here&#39;s mine:

The crispy Brussels Sprouts, I thought, had way too much soy flavor. Texture was good, but heavily salted.

The Grilled Croation Fig Jam + 3 Cheese was AMAZING. Add the bacon - you&#39;ll be glad you did. Fries were nice and crispy, but a little too much garlic for my taste.

Larimer Mule wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. The SideCar was pretty good.

A couple friends and I decided to come in one Saturday for a late lunch for our friend&#39;s birthday a few weeks back. We were promptly greeted and seated as soon as we walked in.

It seemed pretty steady for a lunch on a Saturday. One of my friend&#39;s and I got there early and were waiting on our third friend. It took about 10 minutes before we were even greeted by our server or to get water.

I ordered some drinks  and they came quickly. I had a special cocktail and whiskey was the base. It was delicious. My friend had a lemon drop. She said it wasn&#39;t that good but didn&#39;t want to send it back. 

My third friend finally arrived and we ordered appetizers. I ordered the Brussels sprouts. They were quite delicious. My other friend&#39;s food was just ok.

It took about another 10 minutes for our server to come back again. We had to flag her down and ask her to take our lunch order. MY friend and I shared a chicken burger and sweet potato fries. It was delicious but it didn&#39;t come out very hot. 

We talked for quite some time and was ready to pay for our meal. We noticed our server wasn&#39;t coming by our table and we actually had to stop the bartender to grab the manager. After explaining our experience to the manager, she ended up removing a couple appetizers from our tab. She was very sweet. She must have spoke with the server because our server quickly came back to apologize. I understand people have bad days. That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. I really want to come back and try again but it might be a while before I do."

Only downside, we were seated at a 2-top, next to a table with the same configuration, and that couple was fighting the entire time. Don&#39;t be those people!! Would have been better if the tables weren&#39;t so close in this one area, which would provide diners more privacy."

I did try the corned beef hash and it was pretty lame.  The portion size was really small for the price and it was totally lacking in flavor. Bummer.  The one saving grace for this meal was the brussels sprouts.  You managed to miraculously turn a veggie I despise into something pretty tasty.

Really strong but not particularly tasty. The fact that they have a cocktail with wine, whiskey, Coors Light, OJ and blackberry liqueur . . . well, you get the idea. I got the Darker and Stormier. The bartender told me the &#34;only 2 per person&#34; label on the menu was a marketing ploy. But it was pretty strong, yet not very flavorful. Not a great beer selection. But they were nice about offering samplers of the beer before we committed to one. 

Friendly staff and the walk to the bathroom was exciting with a substantial yet hidden bump that makes walking drunk a challenge. They marked the bump with a large sign, but I stared at the sign in confusion until I stumbled and almost fell. 

The dessert special was an Oreo cheesecake which we tried. It was ok. What you would likely expect from Oreo cheesecake. Come for the fun. But don&#39;t expect too much in terms of food and drink."

The food is really good, that atmosphere is cool (they play old school music videos which is entertaining), the service is reliable and the best part: You never have to wait to get a table, even at 10am on a weekend morning. I HATE those places that require an hour + wait for brunch. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.

The breakfast burrito is amazing, and my brother said their french dip is the best sandwich he&#39;s ever had (which is a BOLD statement coming from him).

Brian was our server and seriously, the best service we have had in Denver. The man humored my need for coffee creamer by bringing me a case of it. Loved it.

We both had omelets, since I think it is a law in Denver to get omelets for brunch. Killer. But they were huge, so we could have played the part of senior citizens and split one plate.

Being Southern, I hesitated to get the grits but decided to grit my teeth and live on the edge. They were creamy polenta so not really grits but dang, they were good. 

They also were offering a free cocktail if you purchased something at a Small Business on #SmallBusinessSaturday so kudos for supporting the neighbor companies.

With it being both of our first times visiting the restaurant and the extensive menu they had, we had lots of questions. So of course we did the classic &#34;what&#39;s the best thing to get?&#34; Dylan was very knowledgeable about the menu and explained what he liked about each of the dishes that he recommended. 

I got the XL Pickle Brined Chicken with the garlic fries and my girl got the Midnight Slopper burger. I got my chicken Nashville hot and it was fantastic. Cooked well, seasoned well, great flavor, and a ton of food. I&#39;m a big guy and the full pound of chicken was for sure more bang for my buck. 

The drinks/cocktails are a bit pricey, but I think that&#39;s just the name of the game downtown and especially Larimer Square. The drinks tasted good but I would probably skip the alcohol next time.

Ordered the ghost pepper wings.  They were actually good.  Nice and spicy.  However, was sharing it with 4 other people.  They gave 4 serving plates.  ALL 4 were still wet from the dishwasher.  1 was clean.  The other 3 had old food residue still left on it.

Friend ordered the shrimp/lobster taco.  The tortilla was rock hard (it was soft shell) and was absolutely stale.  Ended up eating the filling only.  A cool $20 down the drain.

Another friend ordered a salad and the ribs.  They said it was &#34;fine&#34;

I ordered the Korean burger.  Nothing to be desired.  Only ate half and threw the rest away.  I never waste food.  I knew if I took this to-go, I wouldn&#39;t have eaten it anyway.

We came in for a semi fast dinner before heading to a hockey game.  The outside looked appealing and the inside decor was cool.  The menu was pretty standard, and reasonably priced.  I ordered the grilled cheese and fries, and my beau decided on a burger and fries.  We both had a draft beer as well.  It was still happy hour which made the beer a bit cheaper!  

The grilled cheese was perfectly toasted on white bread.  It had a trio of cheeses (fontina, brie and havarti) as well as some fig jam on it.  The flavors were great, however the cheese was not melted well.  I was super impressed by the fries.  They were shoestring fries. which are some of my favorites, and had been tossed in a garlic oil that tasted soooo good!  They also seem to make their own ketchup in house, or at least are using one that is not of the norm.  It was a bit chunkier than usual and had a nice flavor.  

The burger seemed underwhelming, and the bun was a bit larger than the meat patty.  

Our server was a nice guy too.  

The neatest part about this place in my opinion was the music playing in the background and the corresponding music video showing on the tv in the bar area.  They did that for each song that played.  A cool way to stray from the usual sports channel/news that is otherwise showing.  They did still have other tvs playing sports, btw.  :)"

The small womens rr had a totally clogged, nasty toilet and the stall i used had no toilet paper. Thanks bunches.

The Brussels sprouts tasted great and all of my friends really enjoyed them. Something else that came in handy was the wifi. I LOVE WIFI. 

The food looked and tasted phenomenal. The only thing was my yolks weren&#39;t runny in my Benedict. It&#39;s somewhat upsetting. 

Overall a four star experience. My server was beyond phenomenal. Thanks to her it&#39;s getting a one star swing.

Don&#39;t let the strange menu choices fool you, everything is tasty. I love the atmosphere here, you have a very open setting that isn&#39;t too loud or too cramped all while having plenty of seating. 

The drinks here are really good, I suggest the moscow mule for something light and refreshing or the bloody mary. Everything I&#39;ve had here has been really good drink wise.

Food, the good part. I highly recommend coming here during happy hour so you can try a little bit of everything at a discounted price. Each time I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve gotten something different with one exception, I always (and I mean always) order the brussel sprouts. These are probably the best brussel sprouts in Denver, they are in this fantastic asian-vinegar sauce that is perfect. I also love the carnitas burrito smothered in green chilli. The green chilli mac and cheese is also pretty on point. I love that they are open late night on the weekends so you can drunkenly stumble there and get some late night eats, they start their breakfast menu but they will still let you order anything you want off of the regular menu (hint, hint the brussel sprouts).

If you haven&#39;t tried this restaurant I would highly recommend it because it&#39;s in a great location and the food will never disappoint."

My applewood smoked bacon burrito was $10. The bacon was minced; the eggs were not hot; the cheese was not melted; the green chile had a bitter edge.

Mom and pop BBQ trailer/food truck that was a retirement job for the Cubs. We saw how good the reviews were and decided to travel up north check them out.

Super nice family and the trailer is amazing! Everything was clean and looked like it was freshly prepared. Many food trucks prepare days in advance and mix old product with the freshest and it is obvious. Not the case here. 

Brisket cooked to perfection. Great bark and elasticity that would make Grill Masters send them to the semi-finals! 

BBQ was moist and appeared to be hand picked. Not chopped, not thrown through the chipper shredder, just moist pulled pork without overpowering spice and un-needed flavor. 

They were out of ribs but looked amazing on the plates of others...

Spicy sausage was fantastic. Had a great bit of punch to slap you on your rear moments after indulging.

Fries were equally perfect as far as fries go.

Cubs is well worth the trip to find them!"

The food- very good green chile in spicy hot.  Otherwise, don&#39;t even bother.  Portions are that of our Mexican restaurants but at nearly double the price.  I can get a combo plate at my fave mex place for $7 less with just as much food, if not more.   
The wait- always terribly long.  Is this the only mex rest in commerce city?!?   They should incorporate the seating buzzer thingy, it may help the congestion and poor table tracking policy they currently have.

For $57 ex tip, we had 1 reg bev, a coronarita ($9), combo plate, chuletas plate, and a teeny tiny fried ice cream.  Definitely $15 more than our fave spot with nearly the same order.  

Wah, wah, wah, will we be back?  Maybe, the rents like to eat here."

I&#39;m not a local, but this was the first Mexican restaurant I went to in Commerce City and it&#39;ll now be the only one I go to after trying several others in the area. Where to start? The service is always, 100% of the time, amazing. The staff are friendly, prompt, and have yet to mess up one of my orders. (This is huge as I tend to customize.) Anyway, the salsa is fresh and the chips keep your tummy happy while waiting for your meal. So, here&#39;s my only dilemma.... I always think I am going to try something new, but I can&#39;t get past how much I love my &#34;go to&#34; of chicken enchiladas with the hot green chili. It&#39;s just out of this world! I have taken several of my family members there and they also have always liked what they&#39;ve ordered. I will absolutely be back time and time again!"

This establishment has built a solid local reputation. The food strikes me as New Mexican cuisine  (Think green chili on everything, tamales, hearty type of meals accompanied by refined beans and Spanish rice).  Vibe and feel is traditional, not trendy. Warm tortilla chips upon arrival with the perfect amount of salt, and red salsa.  Huge portions of which we usually take home leftovers.  My wife typically goes for the tamales which are in her opinion the best in town,  I like the steak and eggs smothered in green chili.  Their breakfast is pretty good too...large breakfast burritos where you eat one and are good for the rest of the day.   Good mix of locals of all ages and families, it&#39;s usually busy on weekend evenings. 

There are three main seating areas, including a bar.   Service is good with a friendly and accommodating staff. (I.e. I&#39;m lactose and requested no cheese and it&#39;s never an issue). Had a couple instances where the bill was incorrect and another time where we were charged for a side we sent back. Not a big deal. Prices are middle of the road but worth it for the amount of food you get.  Keep an eye out for the promotions they have.  Also, $2 Margs on Thursdays!"

El Jardin is overpriced, make weak drinks, and their food is average Mexican fare at best. They do have a following because of all their mailers, but good marketing does not necessarily translate into good food or service. 
For example, their &#34;free&#34; birthday entree value is only up to $12... way below the average cost of a combo meal, and then everyone in your party has to order an overpriced drink (almost $3)... for a party of 3, with the birthday coupon, I still paid about $40... way too expensive for this type of food.

They frequently mail coupons to me, which actually take $ off the total price - not a scam like other places.  I always take advantage of the birthday coupon they send me.  

Also, you have to take advantage of the Mother&#39;s Day and Father&#39;s Day buffet. Little pricey, but plentiful and delicious.

Rated, El Jardin. My rating totally varies from other reviews, but as two star rating reflects &#34;I have definitely had better&#34;.  

First  thought, Parking lot full , must be good.

The Good: 

Seated right away, whole place was busy.
Friendly, attentive service.
Warm chips, tasty salsa.
Food served very hot, yay.

Not as good:

Don&#39;t other the regular house Margarita, very cheap tasting Tequila .
Very weak, well the Tequila was so cheap tasting maybe that is ok.
Chili Rellano: bland, way too much greasy cheese, typical dry bland Spanish rice, excellent Refried beans, green chile very good, but skimpy on portion so did not save the meal. Tacos, ok, although shell was but our preference.
Prices actually seemed high, considering. If food was outstanding, but food wa not.

I usually order a few meals to go to split for my lunches at work...altho Desirea remembers black beans instead of refried beans and corn tortillas instead of flour, I tend to get a mix of both in my 3 to 4 to go orders, but oh well, the main courses are so yummy, the slip-ups don&#39;t mount to much set back...

The food isn&#39;t actually half bad, but the ambiance of the entire restaurant completely puts me off.  There isn&#39;t really a whole lot of Mexican-fare in Commerce City, and as a result, this place gets packed, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  They seem to be the only real Mexican joint in town.  ...and it&#39;s almost as if El Jardin knows exactly this, which is why they run the restaurant the way they do.

How else would you explain a menu that is as pricey as it is?  For two individuals to dine, plan on spending around $30, and that&#39;s not with alcoholic beverages.  The small combination plate is almost $13.  Mexican should not be this expensive.  They also refuse substitutions.  Another interesting aspect is that the chile relleno is offered on the menu, but as an add on for nearly $4.  Most Mexican restaurants I&#39;ve been to have chile rellenos readily available and on the menu, part of combination plates, etc.  But El Jardin gives off the vibe that the chile relleno is some kind of a delicacy.

Also, and I realize that this is nitpicky, but the building itself is a frustration.  They have two entrances, both with hostess stands where you can wait to be seated.  If you don&#39;t get there on a Friday night before 5:30, plan on waiting for 25 minutes or more.  Yet the one hostess stand, which I&#39;m assuming is near the back of the restaurant, rarely gets used, so you&#39;ll be waiting a few minutes just to be told that the wait is over 20 minutes.  To the average patron who is new to the establishment, confusion will begin to set in...  If there&#39;s a 25-minute wait, then where are all of the other waiting patrons?  Do I wait here, or do I cross the restaurant to where I&#39;m assuming the other customers are waiting at the other hostess stand?  Like I said, frustrating.

I want to like this place, I really do.  We&#39;ve given it a few tries, but each time we leave disappointed... at both the prices and the completely backwards way that this restaurant is ran."

The chips and salsa were awesome. The chips were warm and the salsa was just a little toward the spicy side.  I had the Steak Ranchero.  It really was smothered in green chili sauce.  It does come out super spicy when you order it hot.  If you keep that in mind you should be OK."

Being family owned and operated makes you feel like family when you are dining. Ben, Paul and Johnny alway greet us with a warm smile and hello. Desirae is the best bar tender a thirsty customer could wish for. Never leaving a glass unattended and if you are regulars like ourselves, she is preparing the beverage as we enter the Cantina. The food is very delicious. The flavor is consistent everytime, making your craving satisfied each visit made. Whether it&#39;s a Happy Hour visit or dining with family and friends, you will not be disappointed. Here&#39;s to many more!"

The food was neither good nor bad, but when you&#39;re the only game in town, you&#39;re going to be crowded!

I came here to visit a family member, ordered the tequila lime chicken.  The meat was a bit dry but had good flavor and the rice and beans were ok, a bit on the bland side.  Chips and salsa were also neither great nor terrible - they came to the table room temperature and appeared to be pre-made, and the salsa was a nice medium heat.

Overall, I&#39;d say it&#39;s nice having a decent Mexican restaurant in Commerce City, but I think all the hype for this place is based on a lack of alternatives."

They&#39;ve added a bar to this place, Benito&#39;s Cantina, and it&#39;s really nice. We decided on eating in there because there&#39;s less families with kids. And, natcherly, we ordered a couple drinks. Now, these guys have a fairly decent happy-hour, mojitos are like $3, and my wife, who likes cheladas, got a couple of those, also $3.

We had our usual email coupon deal, thought nothing of it, ordered, ate our meal, got the ticket, and were FLOORED by the total.

Seems the email deals say right in the fine print that no other offers, etc. apply, so we got charged FULL PRICE for the drinks, even though it was happy-hour. Couple of mojitos, cheladas at SIX BUCKS A POP adds up quick.

We objected of course, but were shown no mercy. 
Sorry, but I call BULLSHIT. No place I&#39;ve ever been takes away the happy-hour discount on drinks because you used a coupon for the food. And if we had known that would be the case, we sure as HELL wouldn&#39;t have ordered any alcohol, would&#39;ve stuck to iced tea.

I hate to give up on this place because they did so many things right, but I gotta tell ya, I won&#39;t tolerate being ripped off like that.

So no more El Jardin for us. Adios, amigos."

Because this place does fundraisers for non-profits, it got three stars, otherwise, it would have only received two stars. We had a big group of people (about 15 if I remember correctly) and were placed into a separate room/area from the general restaurant population. 

Once again, automatic gratuity (see my review on Las Hadas Mexican Restaurant), and once again, it seems like the wait staff thinks they don&#39;t have to give the same level of service since they are guaranteed a tip. Service was HORRIBLE. We waited 25 minutes from when we ordered until we received our food, We saw some people who arrived after us, ordered after us, receive there food before us, and were finished and leaving at about the time we finally got our food. A member of our party overheard the waiter say he had been out at a party the night before and wasn&#39;t happy that he had to work that day. Too bad and so sad for him, but Ive worked my fair share of holidays in my adult life, too. 

At any rate, unless Turnberry Elementary school has another fundraiser here, I will not be returning to this restaurant. (I don&#39;t have kids who go to Turnberry, but I have friends who do)

On one occasion not only did we find hair in our left overs, we had waited ten minutes to even be greeted. When we were taken to our table, by the extremely pregnant waitress, she seemed almost irritated that we were there. She didn&#39;t even check on us to refill our drinks. This last visit was put together by my aunt for my uncle&#39;s birthday. I was told the reservation was at eight for 20 people, but to be there early to set stuff up. All of our running around fell into place and we ended up at the restaurant at seven. No big deal right? I went to who I assume was the manage,r because he dressed a tad bit more upscale then everyone else and told him we were there, he said the table was in use. I said no problem we are here  and will be waiting until it&#39;s available. I felt good about our conversation until , I grabbed a drink from the bar and over heard him complaining that we were early,and our reservations wasn&#39;t even until eight. It really erked me, because I wasn&#39;t rude or impatiently waiting and he should probably not talk about the people that build the business. The chips and salsa were absolutely delicious and everything else was mediocre at best. They took forever to take our order! and also failed to tell us when making the reservation for eight that they closed at nine. So half way through the party, every employee was staring.awkward. Needless to say we spent well over three hundred dollars there, and thankfully my auntie has a big heart and left the waitress a 60+ dollar tip.

We will not be spending any more time or money there."

Chips tasted fresh. Salsa was a disaster and fully gringo-ized ground to a liquid. I like chunks of tomato in my salsa.

Meal was your average quality - again compare to Three Margaritas. There wasn&#39;t much that was &#34;homemade&#34; here and the taste proved it.

Weird flow to the dining room with 2 entrances. Two dining rooms connect together and there is a weird, high-ceilinged mega banquet hall also attached to the dining room.

Service was friendly but attentiveness sometimes lacks. Frequent dining program can save you some money but only after a ridiculous amount of purchases (around $100) and returns something like a $10 discount.

Parking sucks here. They try to push the Frequent Diner program down your throat at every visit.

This place not only represents good Japanese food but also family to my mother and my siblings. Going to this restaurant has been a family tradition of ours and we go as much as we can. We always celebrate New Years with the owner here at the restaurant. This business is very family oriented and I love that. The owner of this restaurant has literally watched my whole family grow up and it&#39;s crazy. Other than that little history, I love this place. I love it because of the food. The udon and tempura I get from time to time is delicious and the ramen is decent. The sushi here is good too and fresh. The yaki zakana (broiled fish) is my favorite here and it tastes great. I&#39;ve also had a chance to try a good chunk of their dishes, and all of them have been good. I&#39;ll always love this place and it will always be like home to me."

I also really enjoyed there katsu curry as it is comfort food for myself. The sushi chef who I assume is also the owner is super friendly. There staff is made up different ethnicities of asians are also very friendly. I think they truly have one of the best Japanese food in the area I can&#39;t wait to be back and try there ramen since winter is coming up. Also I just want to add that seeing Japanese customers at this place makes me feel all the more authentic it is!"

We (two people) spent over $75 *before* the tip on dinner tonight and received terrible service. The sushi itself was very good but our waitress was frustratingly bad: never checked up on us, absent, slow, spilled things on our table without cleaning it up or bringing us extra napkins, and I didn&#39;t even have a plate to eat off of on our second round because she cleared it with our first round (but not my girlfriends&#39; for some reason) and didn&#39;t bring me another one, then was nowhere to be found to ask for one!

We were pleasant from the beginning to the end, walked in at 7:50pm so it wasn&#39;t close to closing time, and she wasn&#39;t swamped, there were only three other tables seated in the whole restaurant and *two* other servers on shift. Just horrible service. Our money would&#39;ve been much better spent elsewhere."

Since my last review, I&#39;ve tried countless other sushi restaurants in Denver and didn&#39;t find one that really wowed me. They actually had me running back here!

The caterpillar roll here really just melts in your mouth and the different ingredients blend perfectly together. The avocado roll usually has the perfect rice to avocado ratio, and the house salads are always yummy. The tempura that comes out with the nabeyaki udon is always hot and crispy as well!

At my most recent visit, I tried the unakyu (freshwater eel) roll. The roll looked a bit flimsy (it fell apart when I tried to pick it up), but the roll was filled with meaty eel (I asked for less skin), cucumbers, and some avocados with some eel sauce. It was very tasty! Though, I think the caterpillar roll wins the eel roll contest.

My family recently brought uncle and aunt from California here and they even said that this place had good sushi. They both had the sushi deluxe and said the fish was fresh and everything was really tasty overall.

The price for the food here is also very reasonable, considering the quality of the food. Most places will be around the same price or a bit more expensive, but the quality of the food here is really unbeatable. The total for two came out to around $28 (before tip), and we even had dessert!

In addition, the green tea ice cream that they serve here is perfectly creamy, not unbearably sweet, and the perfect palette cleanser after a delicious, light meal here. Do make room for it!"

sonodas-sushi-seafood-aurora-2,Hideki G.,i68JG_-QblhCcJx1ippyUQ,"Fort Collins, CO",0,1,0,81,175,reQ9mRGsbgLIcikt6nmeSQ,5.0,2015-09-19,"My favorite sushi place in Denver was Sushi Sasa in downtown. But I&#39;m sold to Sonoda&#39;s... again. When I lived in Denver as a college student, Sonoda&#39;s was the place to hang out with other Japanese friends occasionally. But after moving up Ft. Collins almost 20 years ago, because of Aurora location, the place had completely slipped out of mind. Aurora is known for Korean establishments so my go-to-food had been Korean when I was in the area but 2 weeks ago, something has made me stop here. 

My way to see if sushi is good and authentic is ordering Chirashi. Pieces of fish and rice, simple enough but I could usually tell how good the place is from how the chef presents Chirashi. Theirs is so delicate, a real thing as you see in Japan (I must say it is prettier than what I have seen back home indeed.)

Sonoda&#39;s isn&#39;t a white table cloth restaurant like Sushi Sasa. It&#39;s not a social spot like Sushi Den. But when I crave sushi, I don&#39;t need anything else but good sushi. The majority of fish is imported from Japan. You can&#39;t go wrong with the freshness and authenticity. Every bite takes me to the heaven, yet, I feel like I&#39;m &#34;home.&#34;

But the biggest reason why I have become a fan was the chefs, Kawafune-san and Tajima-san. They laughed at themselves by saying they were old fashioned - when you step in the place, you hear them welcoming you. When you leave, they thank you individually. That&#39;s the manner real sushi places back home do. I just adore their Japanese hospitality, &#34;omotenashi.&#34; I never feel that from the chefs at Sushi Sasa nor Sushi Den. 

Glad that the place is 80 miles away from home. If it were closer, who knows I might end up going a few times a week without looking at the inside of my wallet!"

While the rolls featured a good amount of fish and not just a lot of rice and filler, it wasn&#39;t as flavorful as other places I&#39;ve been, and the rolls did fall apart a bit while I was trying to pick them up.  Plus, the prices were a bit expensive...  $15 for a Rainbow Roll is something I&#39;d expect to pay at Sushi Den, not a neighborhood place in a strip mall in Aurora, especially given the quality.

At the end of my meal, it took a while to flag the waitress down to get my check -- I must&#39;ve been waiting for at least 5 minutes and made eye contact with more than 1 waitress, who instantly looked away when I started raising my hand to ask for the check.

Everything is so fresh and high quality you would think you are close from the ocean. They don&#39;t compromise quality for quantity, and when you get a roll you get a good balance of ingredients, not just rice. Rice makes or breaks sushi though, and their is seasoned well, but not overly, and has good texture.
Lots of options, great ramen as well, meat dishes... Impossible to not find something to eat, quite the opposite as it is hard to pick. Today I got the freshest sweetest uni in a very long time, in Denver, and I live in San Diego! Go figure... Had a great custom roll that had everything a good roll has: flavor, texture (crunchy and creamy), sweetness and a little spice.

My boyfriend and I stopped in with high hopes of the chirashi bowl. We started with the spicy edamame, which was baked I&#39;m guessing, and flavorful and spicy, but a little tough which edamame can be. 

He ordered the chirashi and I ordered the sushi dinner. We were not disappointed! The chirashi was the BEST we&#39;ve had since moving to Denver! It was full of a generous, fresh assortment of fish! It was awesome! 

I loved my sushi dinner which consisted of fresh fish nigiri and 6 spicy tuna rolls! Both of our order came with a house salad and miso! The house salad ginger dressing was delicious!

It&#39;s going to be 5 or 10 minutes before I can take your drink order.&#34; Later in the meal she said, &#34;Do you mind if I bring your dinner out ahead of your appetizers?&#34; Later- &#34;you guys don&#39;t want desert do you?&#34; The sushi was fresh but really lacking in any creativity or flavor. The special rolls were limited to about 6 or 8 different ones and had indecipherable ingredients like &#34;Suzy Sauce&#34; (or something like that- mayo and ketchup?). Maybe those rolls were a hit 25 years ago but today we are used to ingredients like, mango, apples, scallions or cilantro with a drizzle of oyster sauce. The end result were pretty bland basic rolls. We left with a bill over $100. I can not think of any reason to go back."

My boyfriend and I were craving some yummy sushi in the Aurora/Denver area. After reviewing over yelp reviews we found this place. Mind you, we are from Maine and DO NOT mess around when it comes to seafood and it being fresh.

I was SO excited for our shuttle to drop us off here. Not going to lie- as soon as we pulled up I almost asked our driver to bring us back. This is a true tale of DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER! I was very skeptical. 

Instantly greeted by both sushi chefs and the host. Warm ma &amp; pop atmosphere. And last but not least- the food was AMAZING! We ordered you&#39;re typical spicy salmon &amp; spicy tuna rolls. But we also got one of their specials, the Dynamite roll. Truly delicious! 

My advice is if you&#39;re looking for a casual, good quality sushi meal, come here!"

This is true to how sushi should be it isn&#39;t like the Americanized Hapa. No offense or anything but this place puts Hapa to shame! Yes I have eaten at Hapa and I wouldn&#39;t go back it isn&#39;t a Sonoda&#39;s.

The wait staff is awesome and always makes sure their guest are taken care of (especially Ad)! The sushi bar is the best place to sit at watching the chefs whip up the sushi is amazing it is like watching trained sushi ninjas. 

The food is to die for. The oysters are a great way to start the dinner off. The sushi is always fresh and not to forget the pieces are so big! The scallops are one of my favorites, and is the best! I have had scallops every where and these are by far the best. The sushi in General is the best.  The Mochi balls for dessert can I say yum!"

I really don&#39;t want to go into detail about the disgusting bad sushi here because I still feel sick from the food there, just AVOID IT. Also, the waitress wouldn&#39;t even let us leave before harassing us about giving her a bigger tip. I still can&#39;t believe that happened, how insane does someone have to be to demand a bigger tip when the service was nonexistent? I asked for the bill 3 times and ended up waiting 15 minutes to receive it. I asked to send a roll back that was made incorrectly and they refused and wouldn&#39;t do anything to compensate us.

Everytime I was in Denver (at least once a month) it used to be pretty decent... The fish wasn&#39;t the freshest, and the rice wasn&#39;t the best... But it was always satisfactory.

The last time, I was here, the rice was over cooked, soggy, and disgusting.  The fish was dry, and not fresh - I expected this a little, considering we came in on a Monday, but not to the extent that it was.

Service, at least, was the same as it&#39;s always been... Friendly and efficient.

The meal was bad... Just terrible... I&#39;m shocked that none of us got sick from this last meal... It&#39;s too bad... I used to be a regular here, as much as I could be, whenever I visited Denver. It was part of my ritual, but no more...

After this last experience, I doubt I&#39;ll be back... It&#39;s too bad..."

I think this is a safe bet for you if you are in this area, off I-225 and Parker area.  

We pretty much splurged (they had a couple of appetizers &amp; drinks before I got there) and our meal came to $90 for three people.  I&#39;ve spent more on two people.  The yellowtail nigiri was some of the best I&#39;ve had."

The restrooms are semi-broken, etc. 

If you can get past the above and give them a shout, you will get good sushi (for Denver). Thursdays are a good day as they get some specialty fish and it tends to be fresher- note we are in a landlocked state so plan your fish eating accordingly. 

We go with Omakase (chefs choice type of arrangement) and have not had a bad meal yet. With the arrival of a new chef (Jimmy) they are experimenting with new items and are getting better.
The newest invention was the Shrek Roll - haven&#39;t tried it (we are more of sashimi / nigiri type customers) but it did look good and customers next to us said it was great. 

A decent place for a decent dinner. Interior remodel and update would do this place wonders!

Fast forward to 2016 - specialty fish selection has improved, specialty dishes are awesome - just ask the chef for specials. Seafood udon is yum!
Servers are hit or miss but the quality of food makes up for that. 
If they just remodeled a bit it would be a more pleasant place to the eye. Thankfully, it is a great place for the taste buds!"

I stopped by for happy hour after work and was disappointed.  The happy hour prices, especially for nigiri, were higher than other places.   I got a few rolls and hoped for some quality to go with the price.  Nope...

See the photo I added (salmon &amp; spicy scallop rolls).  The rolls were small, there were no veggies (no avocado or cucumber in a salmon roll?) and they were very basic.  Nothing special.  On the bright side, the baked yellowtail roll was really tasty!  That one at least tasted like it had some effort put into it!

I waited for an eternity for them to bring me my check.  $15 for 3 tiny rolls and I&#39;m still kind of hungry.  Freakin&#39; lame sauce."

When it closed years ago, I was so sad (yes, please serenade me with your miniature violins). 

But then I realized that frankly, I needed to pull up my britches. There are plenty of other sushi places in Denver and beyond and for me, Sonoda&#39;s of Aurora fits the bill nicely. 

Just think, I can sit down and be treated to a piping hot bowl of Miso soup, or an ever-changing array of Oroshi (little vegetable or seafood plates - the last time I was there it was a marinated octopus dish). 

Then I can stuff myself with sushi and sashimi. Do I want to do Chirashi (assorted sliced fish over rice)? Perhaps some Chutoro (fatty tuna) or Kaibashira (teensy little scallops) or Uni (yes, sea urchin milt - &#34;the guy stuff&#34; if you know what I&#39;m saying). Or a veggie roll - maybe some Natto (stinky fermented soybeans) or Yamagobo (crunchy burdock root)? 

And if I&#39;m not in the mood for sushi (say WHAT??!?) there&#39;s always tonkatsu, teriyaki and tempura to titillate me. 

Cheer up folks! And savor Sonoda&#39;s."

I&#39;ve been here a few times for pick up but never ate in. The service was incredibly slow, and there&#39;s no reason it should have been since it was pretty much just us and another table.  Even the sushi took a long time to come out.  I needed to hurry since I was on my lunch break, so my friends and I were getting really frustrated.

The rolls were expensive and unimpressive.  We ordered a variety of &#34;spicy&#34; rolls that pretty much sucked.  The texture was off and they all tasted the same-bleck.  There was no spice at all.  We ordered 2 other rolls that had more flavor than the spicy rolls, but still were pretty bad.  In the past I&#39;ve ordered miso soup and I never liked it from here, there&#39;s no seaweed in it, just broth, onions and tofu.  Today I tried the soup of the day which was a clear soup with mushrooms and tofu that was actually the only good thing I had.

The food is always great and the fish has always been fresh. I&#39;ve always been a bit disappointed by the chef specials though, never as good or as creative as at the Sushi Boat. Because of that I always seem to get the same thing when I eat here.

The great things about Sonodas are 1) the happy hour sushi prices and 2) they have a Sonodas card which gives you points for the sushi you eat. When you reach a certain number of points, you get a gift certificate by mail. They also send you a gift certificate on your birthday.

nice clean and cool inside with plenty of seating for inside and those who prefer, plenty of patio seating too.  

menu was big, easy to read and understand and pricing pretty reasonable for bbq joint.  they do weigh out the meat for accuracy. i got the party marty which was very good deal with pulled pork  and hot links chopped up with pickles and pickled onions.  loved their crunch kettle chips.  very crunch.

i got more spicy hot sauce to put on but the bottle was covered with sauces and had to clean up first before i can even grab it.  looks like mgmt may need to keep an eye on them for cleanness.

The sides were ok, and the sauce was decent, but the meat was served lukewarm. WHY??? Portions were average sized, I suppose. We all kinda wished there was more meat. Side note: When we were leaving, one employee was eating a sandwich on his lunch break.  Go figure that he put WAY more meat on his sandwich!

The 2 employees working seemed barely able to handle the 6-8 people that arrived for late lunch. It felt like the problem was more with the process than the people... Several steps made it go slow.   I couldn&#39;t imagine how this place would operate during a busy time.
-writing down the orders and then having to reference them each time they added items into the plate
-weighing out exact portions of meat (I mean, I understand the purpose, but it makes the experience feel a bit mechanical/transactional instead of friendly).
-having to serve several people at one station (orders, meat, topping, sides, paying) before moving on to the next station."

The brisket had some nice fat to it but managed to be dry.  The guy slicing the meat had attitude.  The burnt ends were mostly fat and sitting in grease.  The chopped chicken was the best protein by far.  

It&#39;s a relatively hidden location in a strip mall and the food was very average."

We got the El Jefe and Party Marty with mac and cheese and baked beans. 

Good:  Party marty was tasty with a good spicy sausage, a crunchy texture from the pull pork, and well-paired accompanying sauce.  Nice decor and great service.

Ordinary: Baked beans, kettle chips, and large shelled mac and cheese. El jefe tacos were a bit dry, but manageable because of the sauce.  

Overall, the food is decent and they do a good job on certain dishes.  I&#39;m glad we tried this new business, but likelihood of returning is low given other options."

Tried most of the menu items that night and was impressed.  The pulled pork with the mustard-y BBQ sauce were really really really good.

I like that the meats are ethically raised while delivering a very reasonable price point.

A few weeks later, a girlfriend suggested meeting at a spot for lunch in their same parking lot.  I was jonesing for Carve so happy she was flexible.

On this trip I ordered just a sandwich, 1/2 brisket and 1/2 burnt ends.  This sandwich is perfect because it allows me to slather as much of the Sour Cherry BBQ sauce as I possibly can while not have a &#34;BBQ sauce sandwich.&#34;

This sauce is out of this world...you have got to try it!  Trust me, it&#39;s no accident that Carve and crave are so similar.

The manager is out and about meeting customers and the staff is friendly, speedy and competent.  They clearly care about their customers and it&#39;s very welcomed.

I look forward to returning again and again."

They definitely did it and then some.  I had a brisket sandwich, baked beans (with burnt tips), and pesto pasta.  Garnishes included the corn and sweet onions.  When you add all this together, you get many flavors that sing together so well! I tried the Carolina sauce, Spicy Hot BBQ sauce and Cherry Sweet sauce.  Spicy Hot was my favorite but the others brought something I have never experienced before in any BBQ place!

I hope they introduce more of a smokey flavor to their meats or even introduce a slow smoked meat each month.  For their location off of Colorado, I know it can be bit of a challenge but I&#39;m positive it can be done!  There is smoke-ish flavor but I know they can do pecan wood or hickory or something to raise the bar!

People here are friendly and passionate about their food as well.  The atmosphere is inviting and really promotes community sitting.  However they also do have their seats for couples and smaller parties.  Keep in mind they cater AND offer vegetarian/gluten free options.  I wish these guys all the best.  Tonight was a successful soft launch.  Can&#39;t wait for the mac and cheese they mentioned and everything else they will bring to the table. Cheers!"

First off, I gotta say I am not really a fan of BBQ. But THIS place... was seriously cool. It&#39;s a restaurant that has taken the Chipotle concept of seeing your food prepared line-style, but they put their own twist on it. 

As the owner explained they took some classic bbq staples and incorporated some modern alternatives and sides (like the barbeque pico de gallo which was fantastic). Since it was a Yelp even, we got to try anything and everything courtesy of Frances and the management staff. Highlights for me, besides the pico mentioned earlier, were the burnt ends and sweet potatoes. The lemonade was really refreshing and crisp, as well. I bet it would be perfect on a warm evening. 

Colorado Blvd is full of so many great restaurants but I think this place has what it takes to stand out and draw a steady following. I was really impressed last night and would not hesitate to return!"

When you walk in the restaurant smells AMAZING because of the meat and the wood they have piled right next to the door. We weren&#39;t really sure how things worked, but when we got to the front it became apparent that you choose a meat and they carve off a decent amount for you. Then you choose your sauces and free toppings and then any sides if you want.

I decided on the brisket and went with the mild sauce after reading the descriptions on the wall. *Don&#39;t worry if you only get one sauce because they have sauces on the tables and near the beverage area if you decide you want more or want to try a different one. Then I added on a bunch of veggies on the side: okra (YUM), peppers, cucumbers (kinda weird), red onions, and corn. I also had to add a side of pesto pasta salad which I would HIGHLY recommend, it was super delicious and was a great balancer for the meat and sauce. 

The portions can be a bit small if you only order one meat so be aware. However I love that you can add as many veggies as you want, and the side portions are quite substantial. Also YES for sustainable, hormone-free meat :D"

I am always hesitant to do this, but agreed and waited a few months for changes she mentioned were going to happen.  I also brought along my mom, who had not been.  We both ordered El Jefe (three street tacos), and I asked her to change her order to another meat as I already ordered brisket.  She got the turkey ones.  I got mac and cheese as a side, and she got sweet potatoes.  We both really enjoyed my brisket tacos, but were not big fans of the turkey.  Not that wasn&#39;t good, just probably would have stuck with brisket as it was so good. 

My complaints in my past  were feeling unwelcomed and the prices being too high for the food.  Well, when we walked in, we were greeted by almost every employee.  Everyone was great and helpful.  I do not remember if they had the three street taco options when I was there last, but it was a good choice.  Lots of food, but not an insane price.  It had appeared the prices had changed slightly, but I do not remember from last time.

Oh, the potato chips were insanely great.  I might be addicted."

The menu is a little confusing, and the staff not very forth-coming in helping, so I just ordered burnt ends with a side of beans (no mac n cheese, come on guys!) 

The food was very tasty, and I got a couple of different bbq sauces on the side for variety. Also ordered a banana pudding to go which was very good.

I think the menu, or at least the ordering system, needs to be simplified a little so customers can order more easily."

Between the 3 of us, we had two sandwiches (chicken and pork) and the BBQ Mac &amp; Cheese. They have several sauces to pick from - and what I wish I had known was that you can try ALL of the sauces because they are actually out on the floor near the soda machine - so unless you are truly dead set on one, get it on the side so you can try some others (it wasn&#39;t mentioned until I checked out and by then, your meal is already made).

So what I will say is overall - the BBQ meat itself was good. Tender and good flavor. Where things are a bit lacking would be the sides IMO. I had the coleslaw and it just was pretty blah - I couldn&#39;t quite pin down what was missing - we determined it was probably vinegar? But I grew upon KFC coleslaw and while this is in know way an industry standard lol, it is damn good and full of flavor which was just not the case here. The mac &amp; cheese was good but different in that the noodles are cooked and the cheese sauce poured over them. Not incredibly rich, kind of light, which can be good or bad depending on what your taste is. I also had a side of kettle chips and these come with Carve&#39;s BBQ rub on them - I enjoy kettle chips in general so these were good in that regard but again, I wasn&#39;t overly wowed by the flavor and they weren&#39;t as crunchy as I am used to. 

Last thing and something I haven&#39;t actually reviewed before - there might be such a thing as TOO much customer service. The staff here are incredibly helpful and nice - which is awesome. However, during our meal, they probably came by our table about 5 times - we were there for approximately 20-25 minutes. At one point, two people came by in literally a span of 30 seconds. While I can appreciate wanting to ensure you have happy customers, we also wanted to enjoy our meal and conversation which we had a hard time doing with the interruptions. Again, there are probably worse things to complain about but it was just something we all noticed.

I will definitely try to make a return visit as I love BBQ and this was not a bad experiences, just not a wow-ing one."

The burnt ends and chicken were superb.  My husband and I then got the garnish of pickled red onions, coleslaw and pickles which all lacked flavor.  

We then shared sweet potatoes which were savory and good but needed salt.  The potato salad was a bit too undercooked for my liking and lacked seasoning as well.  

One piece of advice would be to have the staff smile and help customers so have never been there before.  Walk them through the items, make suggestions and just don&#39;t stand there impatiently."

If you are in the mood for some southern style samples this is your place. Carve gives you the option to create your dish just how you like, as many of the fast dining spots are doing. First you pick your smoked meat, then what to put it on (sandwich, taco, on a salad, or just as is) Then pick some toppings, a sauce, and last a side. I tried the pulled pork for this first outing with the Carolina Gold sauce (mustard based) and Mild sauce on the side....can&#39;t commit quite yet! For a side I got the sweet potatoes which are good (not sweet which is a personal preference) but a tasty treat with the dish. A friend got the kettle chips which I could snack on for hours.

Even though this is a counter service restaurant (think Chipotle/Qdoba style), the kitchen is wide open and the chefs carve your meat right in front of you.  

What impressed me most tonight was the passion every chef, server, and cashier obviously had for their food. And Carve gave my taste buds something to be passionate about!  I tried the pulled pork, street (taco) style, and the naked brisket. I&#39;m no BBQ expert, but I really enjoyed the smoked flavors and sweet cherry sauce (it has more tang than it sounds like). I love that the meat is natural and hormone-free, and smoked on site. The whole restaurant smelled smokily amazing.

You do pay extra ($2.50) for the sides so choose wisely.  My favorite was the BBQ potato salad. It had a subtle flavor that was unique and complemented the meat. The sweet potatoes were unusual- savory instead of sweet and I think I tasted curry.

I tried the salad with turkey and burnt ends. It was very tasty and filling. I also tried the collard greens. They were good but could use more spice and/or heat.

He&#39;d been wanting to try this place for a while, but when we pulled up at 7pm, having just driven by hundreds of places hopping for the weekend and saw a completely empty Carve, he looked a little uncertain. &#34;Are they closed?&#34; No, they were open until 10pm. &#34;Should we go somewhere else?&#34; I certainly wasn&#39;t going to deny the man the barbecue he&#39;d been wanting to try for months, let alone as we were sitting in the car right out front, so we decided to give it a go.

E got a chicken sandwich and I got a pulled pork. In retrospect, sandwich-format wasn&#39;t really necessary, because, you know, unnecessary carbs, and also because the buns were very thick and dry. 

E said he liked the chicken, but not the toppings he put on it (Carolina barbecue sauce and pickled onions). I reminded him that was really a matter of operator error. I opted for a condiment-free sandwich with only their regular mild barbecue sauce on it. Although it helped my dry pulled pork a little, it was poured on pretty heavy-handed, and next time I&#39;d opt for the same sauce but pick it up from by the soft drinks, so I can add it myself. 

 A note about the sweet cherry sauce, which we picked up to try a little of- if you are into the fake cherry flavor (i.e. Cherry blow pops, cherry cough syrup, etc) then I&#39;d say go for it. I am a huge fan of fake cherry, so the sauce was okay for me. E hated it though.

For sides, we tried the potato salad and Mac &amp; cheese. Not the best I&#39;ve had, but I actually really liked the Mac. The potato salad was typical run-of-the-mill, which I was kind of thankful for. You see, I had really wanted coleslaw, but all they have is a Caesar coleslaw and I wasn&#39;t really digging it. I&#39;ll take plain Jane potato salad, please. Why ruin a classic?

Overall,  I really left desiring more. I think the concept is creative, especially the make-your-own barbecue concept, but I just wasn&#39;t super impressed."

First of all, this is a great BBQ eatery with quality meat (sustainably raised), carefully thought out menu options that focus on seasonal/local ingredients that sure to please meat lovers! 

FOOD: according to fellow diners, the meat options were very tasty and generous in portions.  Out of the all the side dishes I tasted, mashed sweet potatoes, pickled vegetables, rice and beans and seasonal veggies were my favorites!  They complimented the heavier meats very well!  The house made potato chips were also a highlight!  The dessert provided a sweet ending to our meal!

SERVICE: excellent!  The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to ensure a enjoyable dining experience!  The owner and chef each talked about the concept behind this restaurant and the menu, which shed some light on behind the scene work that they did to open this restaurant!

They serve Black angus beef, Duboc pork, and cobb Harvard chickens. The pork and chickens are from Colorado and the beef from NE as it has the taste they were looking for in their barbecue.

This place popped up where Bruxie&#39;s (the waffle everything place) used to be in. They have some nice seating inside as well as a indoor/outdoor section that will be great to sit on in warmer weather.

I had the brisket served &#34;naked style&#34; with baked beans and cole slaw. I figured that is a good baseline to judge their overall barbecue by.  The brisket was amazing with a solid smoke ring that I uploaded a picture of as well. For my lunch-dessert I had their banana pudding which was a great finish to the meal.

I initially had really high hopes for this place after reading some of the reviews and browsing through their startup-like webpage.

We showed up right after the lunch rush on a Friday and both ordered the brisket.  I got it street style, while my buddy ordered it on a sandwich.  The excitement I felt when the dude slapped a slab of brisket on the carving table was confusing....  Did I really just get this excited over a slab of meat?

Down the line, I asked the dresser to hook it up with some recommended toppings for the street brisket.  He loaded on the cherry (i think it was some type of fruit)barbecue, crisp coleslaw, and some pickled peppers.

Upon getting to the side section, none of their offerings looked very thrilling.  Their veggies seemed to have been sitting in the steam holder for an hour (all  wilted and shit), wasn&#39;t too intrigued by the potato salad, so I ended up getting an asiago slaw as my side.

With a cup for water, a side of slaw, and street brisket it was $12.something.

Naturally hungry, I noshed down 3 tacos in record time.  The brisket was so tender that i literally was able to gut the bite without chewing (not recommended).  There was a nice lingering taste of smoked beef and sweet bbq sauce after the initial swallow.

The asiago slaw was.... meh.  I was expecting a crisp, bright, and creamy bite to compliment the tenderness of the brisket and was greeted with a thick and chewy cheese slaw.

Overall, definitely worth checking out again.  I&#39;m thinking next time I get the ribs, or order a pulled pork sandwich as that also looked delicious."

Pick your meats, sides, etc., and off you go.  Very quick.  The pricing is a little much for a quick lunch, but it does taste good.  There&#39;s also some thought put into the meat, as the chickens are all local, and the beef comes from the NE, as it&#39;s apparently the type of beef they are going for.  SORRY, I didn&#39;t get to understand the why behind that, but I can attest that the beef was especially tasty.

The sauces are all very good.  The Carolina Gold goes amazing with the Kielbasa, and the worker was the one to make me aware of that.  Kudos to the service.

Between the mezmerizing aromas when you walk in the restaurant to the abundant array of meats and sides to choose from, I was so excited that I dove right into my meal and forgot that a picture was worth a thousand words.

Trust me though, this is GREAT BBQ. The meats had beautiful flavor and they were so tender.  So good you didn&#39;t even need sauce, but I am a bbq sauce addict so I couldn&#39;t resist.

Also loved the creative menu, where you could choose just the meat, turn it into tacos, or a sandwich - all for no extra cost!  Not to mention all the creative side dishes to accompany the meal.

Trust me though, this is GREAT BBQ. The meats had beatiful flavor and they were so tender.  Plus such creative sides to accompany the meal.

Highlights were:
Burnt ends paired with spicy bbq 
Turkey paired with bing cherry sweet bbq

Sweet potatoes (note the Indian flair with a hint of cumin)
Banana pudding

All paired nicely with the craft root beer on draft.

You can even order BBQ tacos in corn tortillas if you want.  You select your serving style, then your meat and then add on all your toppings.  I recommend either the &#34;naked&#34; plate or the sandwich.  My friends said the tortillas were less than impressive.  They offer smoked chicken, turkey, brisket, hot links and Kielbasa.  All of the meats are hickory smoked and they have the wood on display all throughout the dining room to prove it.  I loved the spicy BBQ sauce the offer, but the sweet cherry sauce was truly unique.

Loved the Brisket sandwich I had with pickles spicy and sweet cherry bbq sauce.  However, the biggest turn off is the price.  It was $9 just for the sandwich and if you wanted a side like potato salad, mac and cheese or rice and beans it was an extra $2.50."

The first thing I noticed was that the layout and design of the restaurant was relatively modern-looking. The food handling is similar to that of Chipotle and Qdoba, where you first order your meat and carb-vehicle and move to other stations to get toppings and sides. This is a relatively easy restaurant model that most people are use to now, so we didn&#39;t need any explaining of how to order (a plus!). I ordered a brisket sandwich and topped it with some pickled onions, coleslaw, and some carolina sauce. I think if we were actually in BBQ Country, my topping combinations would be considered sacrilege, but thankfully, we&#39;re in Colorado, and my sandwich turned out to be delicious! The beauty of Carve is that we can be the creators of our own BBQ fantasies! :D

I do not frequently indulge in BBQ, out of fear for my health, but the meat and sides here didn&#39;t seem overly rich or greasy. Many of the sides we would commonly associate with BBQ have been modified at Carve to cater to the more health-conscious folk. I was particularly impressed with their potato salad--they kept the mayo light! All in all, I had a great evening at Carve, and I expect it to be popular with many Denver folks!"

Got a take home tray of bbq mac n cheese w pulled pork - was a tough call between that and a less carb-filled Party Marty tray option. The mac is just boiled shells and cheese sauce poured over it, *not* baked mac n cheese. That said, it&#39;s tasty with the cheese sauce mixed in with the BBQ sauces on a chilled early spring day. Meat was spiced well and moist and delicious.  There&#39;s plenty in what you are supplied to make a 2nd meal out of, or serve 2.  Banana pudding container is 2 3/4&#34; by 1 3/4&#34; on the top, tapering to 1 1/4&#34; on the bottom - it&#39;s not big.; but it is tasty - strong on the banana flavor. Took some pics to illustrate, next to my finger. Servers were excellent and split my tray on request with 1/2 sweet cherry sauce and 1/2 spicy hot sauce (which is only mildly spicy) - also gave me a sample of collard greens which were tasty, so I can cross that off my bucket list now.  The big surprise was the side of sweet potatoes which were wonderfully seasoned, slightly chunky - not pureed smooth - and definitely savory over sweet.  I get why the do the mac and cheese the way they do; cuts down on waste if they have to throw some away...but that would have made it 5 stars.

On a side note...just noticed that this makes review number ***500*** for me for Yelp.  Onto the next 500...kind of a landmark-y number to celebrate. :)"

The Caesar slaw sounded good but didn&#39;t really work for. 
Prices are a bit high. My lunch cost 20.00 with no drink and one side.

The restaurant looks like a nice place when you walk in, but the fact that there was no one in there should have been my first clue about the place.  At first we were disappointed with the quantity of food for the price.  We ordered 3 plates (brisket, chicken and pork), plus mac and cheese, coleslaw and potato salad for 2 adults and 2 small children.  When we walked away, we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have enough food.  But since no one liked any of it, it was all thrown away and we had to buy a second dinner somewhere else.  The meat was dry and flavorless (you definitely need a good sauce to douse it in), and they should probably just call them noodles, since they were dry and cheese-less.  I couldn&#39;t get my 2 year old to eat the noodles, and everyone knows most kids can live off of decent mac and cheese."

Anyone who gave this place a good review has never had good BBQ before in their life, otherwise there would be no way this place has 4.5 stars.

First of all, the menu....what a confusing disaster.  This is the first BBQ place ever to not just offer a meat plate with sides.  

Next the meat you choose is sliced order by some guy in a white chef coat.  I suppose this is to give of a prestigious vibe that he is some real BBQ expert chef, that is expertly slicing your meat to order.  The problem? They very tackily weigh out your portion of meat right in front of you, like a drug dealer, taking a little bit off to make sure it&#39;s juuuust enough.

Next your meal gets passed to the sauce guy.  I think his only job is to put sauce in plastic cups...apparently restaurant patrons would abuse the whole sauce system if they just had bottles at the table.  As for the sauces? Terrible.  My wife had the Carolina mustard sauce.  It was pretty much yellow mustard watered down with even more vinegar.  There was almost no spices in it at all. You know how I could tell? There was not a speck of spices visible in the sauce.  There was also the sweet cherry sauce. Now, I know by the name it will be a sweet sauce, but holy crap, it tasted like sweet and sour sauce from a Chinese restaurant, there was nothing BBQ about it

Next your food gets passed to the person that is the equivalency of the person who asks you what you want inside your burrito at Chipotle.  There is a bunch of different pickles, and some roasted corn salad, and a few other things that just made no sense. So I ask for pickled okra, and what do I get? I single okra put on the plate, and get moved on down the line.  

Next is the sides.  The beans were obviously from a can...which is fine. But you could tell they were not made from scratch.  The potato salad was &#39;meh&#39;.  Sweet potatoes were so plain, and just getting dried out and gummy from sitting in the warming dish.

And the price for this craptastic meal? $17.50, for 1 person.  You look at the picture and tell me if that is worth $17.50

If you have ever been to a real BBQ place before this place will only disappoint you.  I would only recommend it as a place to drive by to show people one of the worst BBQ restaurants ever.

It also sounds like there was also some kind of Yelp event held there that people had to promise to give a good review in order to attend or something."

Pulled pork
Burnt Ends
Hot Links

Along with:
Caesar slaw
Sweet potatoes 

Carve is a great BBQ experience. High quality local meats. The 2nd best BBQ in the local area, making it the best BBQ after the other sells out.

Pulled pork was flavorful and moist. Recommend.

Burning Ends are good, especially the fattier pieces. Although I&#39;m suspect if these really are &#34;burnt ends&#34; or rather twice baked/smoked brisket from other than the point. Either way, I&#39;d recommend it and have it again.

Hot Links are weak. If you are in the mood they are ok. You will enjoy them. But I would rather get another meat next time.

Sides were great. Slaw was well done and had a nice subtle Caesar flavor. Sweet potatoes... well all I have to say about these is my wife got a side to go. There good.

Overall nice decor, it fit for what it is. Manager was friendly and knowledgeable."

I also got the Carolina Gold for a dipping sauce (very tasty).  Overall the food was good - not knock your socks off - but good.

I&#39;ve never seen such a small amount of meat given to me at a BBQ joint (esp for the price-$20 for half a palm full of chicken and another half of a palm full of brisket). The chicken was cut into these tiny pieces, and when I asked the girl not to cut the chicken so small, she looked dumbfounded. Plus, when I brought it back to my apartment, because she shredded it so small all the juices came out leaving me with these dry pieces of shredded chicken. 

The cherry BBQ sauce was very interesting. You could taste the tartness from the cherries. The BBQ ranch was good. It had a good smokey ranch flavoring. Along with one other BBQ sauce with a yellow color to it, get this if you enjoy mustards. It has a really strong mustard taste.

Honestly, this place is over priced for the proportion of food you get. Just be warned."

It looked like they have an outdoor area when it&#39;s warmer which would give them more seating area. I ended up getting the pulled park sandwich which was excellent! They have the option for gluten free buns as well which was a plus. They prepare everything right in front of you which is part of their business model so you can see your food along the way. After you select what you want they bring you down the line for sauces, garnishments and then sides. I got the potato salad and kettle chips as sides which were both really good. Maybe a little less seasoning on the chips would be better. They also have lemonade which is excellent! Thanks Carve for having the Yelp event and thanks Yelp as always for putting on a good show."

My wife had been bugging me to go here but the location (Colorado Blvd) is one of those areas that I avoid as much as possible with traffic. In this case we were heading to the zoo with the kids and driving right by it at lunch time. 

I was impressed as I didn&#39;t have high expectations in general. I had the pulled pork tacos which were really good. They baste the tortillas in butter on a roller then a quick fry on the skillet, add a good helping of really delicious pulled pork and a bit of spicy BBQ sauce. The sites were all good as well.  We do that same dish at home with leftover pulled pork the day after smoking a shoulder and doing the traditional pulled pork sandwiches. 

I noticed that they use heritage pork which is cool and I know that drives up their costs but as a pork purist, money well spent in my opinion. 

You get plenty of food and leave full but don&#39;t expect the portion sizes of like a Rudy&#39;s or Famous Dave&#39;s. The individual dishes are a bit pricey for a strip mall BBQ spot but with the high quality pork, it makes sense. 

Definitely would come back if I&#39;m stuck in traffic on Colorado Blvd at some point and hungry."

Previous review:
I&#39;m not a huge meat fan, but today I was craving BBQ, so I decided to try out Carve. It wasn&#39;t bad. But I wasn&#39;t blown away. I&#39;ve had a lot of BBQ being from Kansas, so I went into it with an open mind. 
I had the burnt end sandwich, a side of Mac n cheese and coleslaw. Burnt end sandwich was okay. The meat had good flavor but I would have chosen a different bread to put the sand which on. The coleslaw is super sloppy, which is how I love it so that was good. The Mac n cheese was not so good... Very dry with little flavor at all. 
Overall it&#39;s a chipotle-ish feel when you walk down the line, but overall it&#39;s clean and nice. The woman who helped me was great but as other people lined up behind me her coworkers focused on other tasks than helping them (like bagging chips).  That kind of threw me off, I&#39;m sure the chips could wait. I paid 17 dollars so it wasn&#39;t too bad, and the sides are large portions.

I went with the Chicken Carve, Sandwich Style, a nice dose of Spicy Hot sauce, all garnished with pickled bell peppers and the Sweet Potatoes on the side. All that for just barely $11! 

The chicken was nice and moist and very flavorful, the bun was toasted just right, and the sauce was the perfect amount of heat and sweet I was looking for. I could have gone without the bell peppers and been just as satisfied. The sweet potatoes were phenomenal, better than I expected, best I&#39;ve had in a long while..

Atmosphere is relaxed and warm, I finished eating 10 minutes ago and I&#39;m in no rush to leave.. staff is very friendly and welcoming too!

Upon walking in there was a fairly long line, but surprisingly we progressed through the line quickly. The selection of meats were amazing and I ordered the brisket sandwich. 

When getting to the garnish section of the line I was a little overwhelmed, but the girl working the line helped me with her favorite choices of sweet red onions and some BBQ Pico piled right on top of my sandwich. For some sides I got the kettle chips and Potato Salad which I really enjoyed. Some of my family got the sweet potatoes and Caesar slaw which they said were different but still very enjoyable. 

Overall we all had a great experience so much that I convinced my work to have Carve cater our Black Friday lunch this year. Excited for this new addition to the Denver fast casual scene. My only complaint would be the cookies need a softer center."

I really appreciate their gluten-free options along with all of their sustainably sourced grass-fed meats. I had the brisket and hot links with the spicy bbq sauce and ordered sweet potatoes and vegetables for my sides. I also loved their selection of toppings- I&#39;m a huge fan of their pickled peppers and sweet pickled red onions. My boyfriend had the brisket on a gluten-free bun and the ribs with a side of kettle chips. All of the food was well seasoned- their house rub is delicious! I wish however the sweet potatoes were spiced differently. They are savory and I prefer sweet potatoes to be on the sweet side. The roasted squash was really tasty. My boyfriend wished that the gluten-free bun had been toasted- but for gluten-free he said the taste and texture was good. Overall, we both agreed that the flavor of the entrees were good, however the temperature of the food could have been warmer and the brisket unfortunately was flirting on the dry side.  The service was exceptional. Everyone was friendly, attentive, patient and helpful. Nothing beats great service! We&#39;ll be back."

How this place has 65 reviews and 4/5 stars is beyond me. These people would probably give the McRib a 5 star rating 

I ordered the burnt ends, bbq beans, bbq potato salad, and ribs. My wife ordered the brisket sandwich and the bbq beans and bbq potato salad.

First off, there was no noticeable smoke flavor in any of the meat. Fail. The ribs were very bland, poorly seasoned, and small. Nothing to enjoy there. My wife&#39;s brisket reminded me of shoe leather. Dry, tough, and no flavor. She had to drown her sandwich in sauce just so she could swallow it.  Bad brisket. My burnt ends were the only saving grace of my meal, and they were nothing noteworthy. 

The sides were boring. BBQ beans were standard BBQ beans. Hard to mess those up. The &#34;BBQ potato salad&#34; was a joke. Absolutely NO flavor at all. Tasted like plain potatoes 

I sampled the mild sauce as well as the sweet cherry sauce. The sauces were pretty good except for the mustard my wife got. Sorry, but Carolina style mustard base BBQ sauce shouldn&#39;t taste like straight up yellow mustard. Hands down the worst mustard style bbq sauce I&#39;ve ever had

I like that you get an option when ordering if you want it naked (just meat), a sandwich or tacos, but I&#39;m used to BBQ joints supplying you with bread/toast on the side anyway, which I wish this place did.  T and I ordered a pound of pulled pork and a single order of brisket = $25.  The brisket itself was a little dry but with the hot spicy bbq sauce, it was better.  The pulled pork was good, good flavor and it was juicy.  I will order it again if I come back.  They have a lot of options for &#39;garnishes&#39; but none are really that fantastic, and they really fall short on the portion size of it as well.  You would think for a whole pound of meat they would hook you up, but for us they didn&#39;t.  They gave us the same amount of garnishes for the whole pound of pork as the single order of brisket.  Our total garnishes included one little scoop of charred corn, slaw and boiled eggs, 4 pieces of okra, 6 half slices of cucumbers and half sours and a pinch of carrots.  I wish I had taken a picture to illustrate how little amount it was compared to the meat.  Would I come back?  Maybe since it&#39;s right down the street and fast, but if I want real tasty BBQ, I will probably go somewhere else."

After ordering you choose your relishes and can have as many as you want.  The pickled okra was out which sounds interesting and wanted to try so went with a few others... Nothing stands out.  Then you come across the sides that are an extra 2.99.  I ordered the veggies and two side of bean and rice.  It might of been a bad batch of beans and rice because the rice was to mushy for my and my husbands liking.  I like the concept and is probably better for lunch...overall it was mediocre and a bit overpriced.

Small portions.  I left feeling hungry. I don&#39;t like my dinner severed on a cold metal tray with NO plate. ( I&#39;m not kidding...look at the pictures). Sides were expensive and bland .  No corn on the cob, French fries, Texas toast.  That&#39;s the stuff people love with their barbecue.  Dessert were unappealing.....hard chocolate chip cookie or unappealing yellow custard stuff. 

They need to serve apple pie, sweet potato pie, ice cream, etc. people don&#39;t go to a bbq restaurant for &#34;healthy&#34; foods. They want good hearty old fashioned bbq.

The burnt ends were the best out of everything we tried but the portion was superrrrr small especially for the price. The sides are where Crave really falls short.

There are several things to nibble on their happy hour menu including hush puppies which looked crispy and delicious and were served with a side of brown gravy. They also came out super quick.

What a happy surprise.

The Great:
+ The bartender was on point.
+ Fried chicken? Yes. Amazing.
+ The Decor was fantastic
+ Great selection of rare draft beers (Thing rarities from Sierra Nevada and Ballast Point)

We opted to sit outside on what appears to be a shared patio with the bar to the west.  Our waitress was friendly and patient giving us ample time to review the food and drink menu.  They offer a slew of whiskey options (not my jam but my guest eagerly approved) and a healthy selection of beers.  I opted for the Sierra Nevada Otra Vez, a delightful Gose, served perfectly chilled in a mason jar.  

I ordered the fried chicken served with a yummy pickled red cabbage and sweet corn with bacon and a chesse pop over.  The chicken, comprised of a single breast and a drumstick, was served piping hot and cooked well (crispy outside and soft and meaty inside).  I would have liked it to have been a little saltier but overall pretty tasty.  The popover was average in my opinion, which was slightly disappointing.  It seems difficult to NOT blow someones mind with cheesy rosemary bread.  The cabbage was tasty indeed.  I also sampled my guests shrimp and grits which were tasty indeed.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly with a hint of smokey BBQ flavor and well complimented by the chunks of bacon, tomato, and onion.  

Only have a couple of qualms with our visit.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food.  Seems excessive considering we were the only people there who were eating for at least half of our visit.  Lastly, we waited for quite some time to get our check after finishing up our meal.  They certainly got busier as the night went on but patience is unfortunately NOT one of my virtues so it would have been wonderful to not have had to wait so long to eat and or pay.  

May give this place another shot."

The pickle chips were ok. I think it was $5 for five pickle slices - so not a tremendous value there. The pickles kept coming out of the breading, so the solution was to just stuff the entire pickle chip into your mouth.

The fried chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy outer skin/batter, with the insides fully cooked but still juicy. You would think that fried chicken is a graduate level course given how many restaurants in denver either overcook, undercook, or use too low an oil temperature. The batter is light and didn&#39;t seem like there was enough salt and other seasonings.

the red cabbage and corn were fine sides. the popover (muffin) was weak though; not much flavor.

Cocktails? Hell, yeah, check.

Bread N Butter popped up on 17th Avenue in a micro-neighborhood that is fast becoming one of my favorites. On a recent date night Nick and I headed to this casual spot for 1. fried chicken and 2. whiskey cocktails and we were not disappointed on either front. I started with the Vieux Carre, which is basically a rich man&#39;s Manhattan. (I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s a phrase, but now a Manhattan feels like a poor man&#39;s Vieux Carre so...) Made with rye, cognac, sweet vermouth, aromatic bitters, Benedictine, and an orange twist it&#39;s a hearty, warming drink that goes down quite nicely. Sir Nicholas order the standard Manhattan and switched after his first drink to make his second the same as mine so there&#39;s that vote of confidence.

The menu is small, but tantalizing. I had a terribly hard time trying to decide what to order so I pulled a classic Tiffany move and ordered a little bit of a lot which means I had leftovers for days, but was able to sample a nice bit of the menu. We had the fried pickles, a cheddar cheese popover, fried chicken bites, a tomato and cucumber salad, charred corn, bourbon-baked beans, and jalapeno corn bread. So much deliciousness and I couldn&#39;t stop eating. My favorite was the beans and the chicken though. I am definitely interested in heading back to try out the Po&#39; Boy, the pulled pork, the, well pretty much everything left on the menu.

Service was friendly and casual. The interior is full of lovely wood and dim lighting. It isn&#39;t overly large so I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for big groups, but it is quite lovely for dates, Southern food, and whiskey cocktails. I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

I&#39;d just come from Acorn at The Source, right, where they stuff your drinks with ice and garnish an&#39; all that, like all I wanna do is snap a flick of the thing when really a drink&#39;s for drinkin&#39;, right?  So when I ordered a Manhattan at this joint, homegirl&#39;s like, &#34;Up?&#34; an&#39; I throw a li&#39;l temper tantrum &#39;bout, &#34;Christ, if I get any more ice in my drinks tonight, I&#39;m gon&#39; kill myself.&#34;

So she makes it up, but didn&#39;t put no ice in the shaker-- which is understandable, given my petulance. It comes out up, but room temp and I&#39;m confused, but when she came back we sorted it out (meaning I admitted I was throwin&#39; a li&#39;l tantrum and I should&#39;ve been clearer (an&#39; I&#39;m sorry)). I even tell her that I&#39;ll drink cuz it was my bad, but she insists I have exactly what I want, takes the tepid Manhattan and shakes up one fresh.

And you know I only be usin&#39; that good bourbon.

Tha&#39;s just great service, and tha&#39;s what I&#39;m about.

As for the joint itself, I&#39;m lovin&#39; the hardwood e&#39;erthang and the pipe-fitting coatracks, but I could do without the iron work hangin&#39; in the windows. 

And those bathrooms need to be stripped down, yo. It&#39;s like relieving yourself in the sale section of Cost Plus World Market, nahmsayin&#39;?

The combination of poached eggs, homemade gravy and perfectly cooked biscuits really won me over. The service was great, it helped we were the only ones there, but very impressed overall.

They have a solid collection of whiskeys and a smaller set of drafts on tap so if you&#39;re looking for a stiff drink with your meal you will have options- I wouldn&#39;t go there to drink but most of their alcohol would go well with the food being offered. 

We ordered fried pickles to start with which were excellent. They were accompanied with a house ketchup and remoulade to dip in- the ketchup was meh but I enjoyed the remoulade. However, both were not needed the pickles were fried beautifully and had excellent flavor. No sauce was needed. 

I ordered the catfish po&#39; boy which was fried in cornmeal. Outside was crispy but the inside was tender. The sandwich was large and I had serious concerns about finishing it and the bread holding up. But those fears were unfounded. 

Overall the food was great and the ambiance was chill and a bit rustic. Some other reviews have complained about service- I saw no problems there. The servers were moving around the room consistently and were attentive to customers&#39; needs. Food take a while but I think the kitchen moves slower since everything appeared to be made scratch and to order."

We were promptly informed that literally everything on the brunch menu was sold out. Annoying planning on their end, but I understand mistakes happen. What really earns them one star is the complete lack of service that we were given. Despite the fact that we were just one of three or four parties there, the staff seemed happier to hang out inside talking than attend to us. We seated ourselves and it was about ten minutes before we were even offered menus or water. We quickly placed our orders and it took an inordinately long time for even our appetizer to come out. Throughout the meal we asked our waitress for a couple things - a refill, a straw, extra sauce, etc. - and it either took ten or fifteen minutes or, more likely, we just never got what we asked for.

We chose a table in the corner where nobody came to wait on us for at least 10 min. Finally we got some attention and we ordered popovers, cucumber and tomato salad, po boy, fried chix and greens. Our greens came out first by themselves after about 25 min...very strange. Literally everything came out in reverse order.  So the po boy and greens were really good. Everything else food wise was below average. Waitress was MIA a lot as well.  I would probably give it another shot if in the area but I hope things get sorted out."

The same owners own the bar next door, which shares a patio, but you can&#39;t order anything off their menu instead. Odd arrangement.

Wow, amazingly good food! What a great surprise! We had calamari, fried to perfection. Not overly fried like most places. Then we had our choice of 5 different oysters. Great! Then we had one of their cheese plates, Brie, which came with sauce crispy bread, small gherkins, roasted peppers, shredded carrots. Yummy!

The decor is homy and far from pretentious, so it&#39;s even more impressive how beautiful and decadent the food that emerges from their kitchens is.

It was near empty by the time we arrived for our reservation at 5:30, but guests slowly trickled in as the meal progressed. We started with the Crispy Fried Calamari and Stuffed Artichokes, which were brought out to use in a timely manner. Both were well portioned--enough to share around the table, but not enough to make you full before your meal arrives.

As my entree, I chose the Duck Two-Ways which was absolutely stunning when it was brought out. The grilled duck breast was cooked beautifully with the fat nicely rendered and the confit duck leg was rich and delicious. I was definitely thankful for the pile of arugula on the plate, which kept each bite balanced, even for such a rich protein. The Sunchoke Puree was not my cup of tea, but that was more due to personal preference for anything else.

It was definitely a pricy meal, but was still a fun place to go for a pre-show dinner."

We picked here because we were going to the theater and wanted a place close by so we didn&#39;t have to rush to make the show on time. We checked out the menu online and the flavors sounded amazing. 

We made a reservation but the place was dead at 6pm on a Friday. We sat outside and ordered the following:

Lobster deviled eggs and classic deviled eggs as an appetizer. Decent flavor but the lobster eggs didn&#39;t taste like lobster. The eggs were also placed on a bed of guacamole which was a bit strange. It just felt out of place and was only used to stick the eggs to the plate. 

For dinner we ordered the lobster ravioli and the pork tenderloin. The ravioli was decent in flavor but again didn&#39;t have a strong lobster taste. The bed of asparagus the ravioli was on was very under seasoned and didn&#39;t taste like much at all. Overall pretty underwhelming. 

The pork was better, strong bacon flavor as it was wrapped in bacon. Fried tomatoes and corn cake were decent flavor. 

Overall service was very very slow. I only comment on this since we were one of a few tables in the whole place. We went early hoping to make it to the show early, and spent over an hour there...and I&#39;m not sure why. 

So based on all of this, the experience was a little underwhelming. I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t go back, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be heading back again soon."

Once we were seated (took a while even though it was half empty) and our drinks order taken, I advised the wait staff that we had to be at a show by 8.00 pm, so would like our food to come out reasonably quickly. Not to hard a task I thought, given that we had just over an hour before the show.  Well 45-50 minutes later, our food finally arrives with profuse apologies from the manager.  At this point I must highlight the excellent way in which the manager dealt with the problem and promptly comped our meal.  The food was excellent but the delay was inexcusable.  I will come back here to eat but not if i need to be somewhere else. 3 stars for the quality of the meal but would have been an easy 4-5 stars if the  service was better."

Upon first arrival- the restaurant almost looked unfinished. The entrance is a little bare and the floors are uneven with incredibly old looking surfacing. While waiting for our food I decided to take a walk around the restaurant and realized its far from unfinished! There was so much detail put into decorating the place. It doesn&#39;t have large/extravagant decorations like we&#39;ve become accustomed to in Denver. It has simple, easy, old-fashioned decorations to appease you on any date night and set the mood for some jazz!

Now on to the food, we got the banana doughnuts to start us off. Warm, soft, and crunchy on the outside. They came with a side of chocolate pudding and chopped walnuts to dip into! I was scraping the plate at the end to get more of the pudding! We ordered the biscuits and gravy and we can now say this is one of our top spots in Denver for biscuits and gravy. Too many restaurants try to cover up stale/hard biscuits with a lot of gravy. These were warm, soft, and flaky. The gravy pour was generous enough that it was served in a bowl to us- my kind of gravy!

Will be coming back here for a jazz night- the stage is adorable and looks as if it will take you back in time!"

I&#39;ve stopped by and supported the venue via drinks and dinner. The house salad is quite good, as is the gnocchi. However the service leaves a very, very bad aftertaste.

I sit at the bar and find that the service from the bartenders is extremely slow and inattentive. They seem rather annoyed by the dancers asking for water --- can somewhat understand the feeling. Yet as someone conscious of a venue that does not charge cover for a live band and a dance floor, I too am still getting some &#39;tude.

Just the other night I wanted to order a second drink as well as dessert post dinner --- was totally ignored by both bartenders. I tried to hail them down to no avail. While sitting at the bar!!!

The night started off with my boyfriend and I ordering a deviled egg each. They were priced individually on the menu and so I didn&#39;t think it was that strange to order just 2 eggs, but our waitress seemed very appalled that that was all we were ordering to start with. We were part of a large group (10+) and the rest of our party had ordered more appetizers to share. The deviled eggs were great as were each of our entrees. My boyfriend and I had parked at a meter and had to leave before the rest of our party. I didn&#39;t know that my sister had asked for her family&#39;s meals and my boyfriend and my meals to all be on the same check. She had talked to the waitress privately. I asked our waitress for my boyfriend and my check since we had to leave and 10 minutes later she brought me a check that was far too expensive for our two meals. When I asked her to confirm this was our check she proceeded to explain that my sister had asked that the checks be combined. She charged me for 5 meals instead of 2 without telling me when I wasn&#39;t who requested the checks be combined. I am giving this place two stars because the food was delicious but for the prices of the food (which reflect the food&#39;s quality) I expect a five star experience - which I did not receive."

I wasn&#39;t totally sure they were open and serving because there was only a bartender and two patrons in there (seriously, Sam&#39;s No.3 had a 40m wait! just next door).  But sure enough they had both a brunch and lunch menu.  

Our bartender was friendly and the food was quick and fresh.  I had the cubano and it was a great version of the sandwich (loved the spicy mustard), plus it was served with homemade tater tots!

Upon entering, there was no one to seat us si we decided to find our own seat. When no one came to serve us,  we went to the bar to get our menu. Once our waitress came, service was efficient. Probably too efficient because I hate people clearing out plates when we are still eating.
There was a live band playing. The music is ok but really loud so it&#39;s hard to have a conversation. 
The pale ale was watered down - Not really good. The salad was ok... We also ordered spare parts salad &amp; that was terrible. The fried chicken, duck &amp; spare ribs were bland, and the beans had too much vinegar I thought my parotid was gonna atrophy on the spot from overworking! The pork shoulder was great especially with the mushrooms sauce. But the vege underneath was way too salty. 
All in all pretty average."

First of all - those banana donuts are even more amazing than they look! So tasty, so sweet, and so cute! Really great for splitting with the table (or eating by yourself, no judgment!). 

I can&#39;t remember what else I got, but I remember it being fantastic (eggs, maybe? Definitely something classic brunch-y).

On a wine glass, they brought over 1/3 full glass of beer. The wine we ordered had a lot more in it than this one.  I literally got a sample beer amount.  I am pretty sour about getting 1/3 wine glass worth of a $7.50 beer.  

Awaiting food. I&#39;m sure the food is decent, but just on this beer experience, I won&#39;t come back.  Thanks bartenders for losing a customer.

Now for the food... The cod dish... The fish was undercooked.  Had to sent it back.  The deviled eggs were excellent.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, Bauer&#39;s is another hyped up fine dining restaurant located in a major city that gives low value for high cost.  Being pricy is perfectly fine as long as they give me a reason to come back. I didn&#39;t get that here."

Banana Doughnuts - Crème Brulee Custard, Nutella, Strawberries, Hazelnuts
Crème Brulee French Toast - Bananas and Berries, Maple Syrup, Chorizo

Established in 1872, but currently in the process of redefining itself with turnover in the kitchen and Brunch hours expanded to include Friday, downtown Denver&#39;s &#34;Baur&#39;s Restaurant and Listening Lounge&#34; was sort of a mixed-bag experience, the food quite good considering the reasonable prices while the service was inexplicably slow despite the restaurant being completely empty - the waitress either new or completely uninformed as relates to recent changes on the printed menu.

Surprisingly sizable considering the dearth of patrons, dinner and weekends reportedly busier as a result of live music, expanded menus and a chef&#39;s counter for charcuterie as well as daily specials, it was at a large booth parallel to the bar that seating was offered and finding out that the &#34;famous&#34; pastry basket had recently been discontinued a three-part order shrank to a duo of items, 25 minutes preceding the appetizer with entrée arriving hot on its heels.

Taking the opportunity to browse the heavily wooded space as I waited - booths, banquets and tables filling several rooms with a performance stage to the left and wine cellar at the right, Baur&#39;s undoubtedly shows signs of its age in terms of décor and degree of dreariness, the overhead tunes featuring Rock from the last forty years with a menu that thankfully spins more modern including an opening act of Banana Doughnuts undoubtedly worthy of &#34;destination&#34; status with Bruleed Fruit Custard stuffing each cavity as a pile of five is stacked atop Nutella and caramel with a handful of chopped Hazelnuts and fresh berries.

Making sausages and chorizo on-site, the later redolent with spices though not as hot as some, those looking for something meaty to offset sweetness would be well advised to opt for a few extra slices in addition to those served with the Crème Brulee French Toast as each custard soaked slice is grilled to a light crunch beneath Bananas, Berries and Pure Maple Syrup - the end result so sugary that it poses a challenge to even the most pronounced sweet tooth."

Our server, Keely, kept the drinks flowing! She was awesome! The brunch was one of the best we&#39;ve been to in Denver! It was a buffet of oysters, crab claws, biscuits and gravy, mac and cheese, plus all the normal breakfast foods you would expect. The gravy was out of this world! The salad selection was great too. Unfortunately, the buffet is not a normal thing and was put on for the Derby Party event. Baur&#39;s should definitely consider making it a weekly thing because everyone around our table kept raving about the wonderful selection and how great everything tasted!

We loved it so much, we ended up coming back after the Derby Party for dinner! We ordered the Spare Parts which is a selection of various meats and the duck was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back to Baur&#39;s for brunch and dinner in the future!"

The person in front of me order a long island to which the bartender shook his hand at him and said, &#34;I am NOT making that.&#34; I ordered 2 beers and my friend ordered a shot and another beer. The bartender rolled his eyes at the shot (a straight whiskey shot). The beers he poured were ridiculously foamy, flat, and only about 1/3 full, yet we still got charged full price. My friend gave him her card and said she was paying for the three beers and shot. He ran her card then looked at me expecting me to pay. I said she had paid for mine to which he replied, &#34; Well THAT would have been nice to know!&#34; 

There was 1 bartender that was really nice and was having a good time. He was the stand out super star of the night. I think overall, they just need to get rid of that one rude bartender that can&#39;t pour beer. His negative energy was wearing down the rest of the staff."

My friend and I decided to check this place out after visiting their booth at the Cherry Creek farmer&#39;s market.  Baur&#39;s exceeded all my expectations from the character of the building, their menu offerings and the ambiance! Bonus points for using seasonal and local ingredients!!  I loved the old world charm of the dining room which fits well with the history of he building. 

Brunch: it was thoughtfully created to feature the best of the season.  We couldn&#39;t resist but to order the banana doughnuts and we were so glad that we did!! The silky smooth custard filling and Nutella just melt in your mouth after you bite into it! For the savory entrée, we shared the garden omelet. The different flavor and texture of the mushrooms definitely added an extra layer of deliciousness! However, the fruits on the plate seemed like an afterthought as they&#39;re not the freshest. The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food and presentation. Our bill came out to be less than $20 for the two of us!

I would gladly return for brunch any day. Maybe I will try their happy hour or their live music next time!"

Banana Doughnuts are really creative and delicious. Omelette was good and creative. Eggs Benedict was a little disappointing. Eggs were over cooked and the hollandaise sauce was odd. Too salty or too much vinegar or something. Wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had. Very nice wait staff. Apparently quite the night spot for live music and dancing.

For an appetizer I had &#34;Spare Parts:&#34; Berbere Spiced Duck, Salt &amp; Pepper Pork Spare Ribs, Vadouvan Fried Chicken Wings, Chow Chow, House Pickles. The chow chow was my favorite part of this dish. The spare ribs were too chewy &amp; dry with little meat. For my main dish I had the house-made carrot tagliatelle (Confit Rabbit, Black Garlic Chips, Roasted Baby Carrots, Poached Egg, Parmesan Cheese). They ran out of rabbit for this dish so they gave me duck instead. I loved the pasta texture &amp; shape but the entire dish was too salty for me. I had a lemon mousse cake for dessert which was a good portion size (larger than all the other desserts) but had too much mousse &amp; not enough crust. I also tried my friend&#39;s ginger ice cream &amp; apple tart. The apple tart was delicious. I am normally a huge fan of ginger ice cream but this one wasn&#39;t too creamy.

This place is right across the street from where I was staying and have walked by it numerous times. I was planning on going elsewhere but when I stepped outside I saw it and thought I&#39;d check it out. It was about 6:20 and some tables were full so I thought I&#39;d end up with a seat at the bar. The hostess was very nice and said a reservation had cancelled so she sat me in a booth which was nice. I really was more interested in wine and nibbles not really hungry for an entree although the pastas looked really appealing as did the Halibut. Pasta dishes $15 which is very reasonable compared to others I have seen. Halibut was also very reasonable and I may go back to try it. 
I decided to try a Trio Flight of Rose...$15...a good amount in each glass and were all good. 
I ordered the deviled egg, chicken liver mousse, and a selection of cheese. They were all very good and hit the spot. The Chef responsible for the Charcuterie menu visited the table to see how it all tasted which was very nice.  I asked to see dessert menu. Very nice selection and about 7 different ice creams all made in house. Dessert was $8 and Trio of ice creams were $3. I&#39;m
from DC so very used to over the top prices....and these were very reasonable for the type of dishes. 
Desserts in DC range from $8-$12. I ordered the Lemon Lavender Tiramisu and it was very good. Great balance of flavors, not too tart, and extremely light. The ice creams had very rich consistency with no ice crystals. (Sorry there is a Pastry Chef in the family so I have a tendency to be really critical on desserts). Avocado Sorbet was really well balanced with citrus to cut through richness. The Strawberry Basil was a little faint in flavor but had really good creamy consistency. 
There was a Jazz Blues band that was excellent! I think the Brunch menu will be my next try. The hostess was very nice and the waiter was very informative and even though I was there for appetizers and desserts did not rush me at all. Overall an excellent experience for me."

I have been in to Baur&#39;s on multiple occasions now, and absolutely love this restaurant. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and works hard to go the extra mile for the customer. We had Aaron as our server this last time, and he was a joy to be around. A great attitude, and you can tell he enjoys what he does.

The bartenders Attily and Allie are amazing. These ladies are true mixologists that know their alcohol. They were friendly, made wonderful recommendations, and mix some mean drinks.

Most recently I had the wild salmon. It was cooked perfectly for how I ordered (medium-rare). The sauce was superb. The portion sizes are just right. I&#39;m looking forward to trying the burger on my next trip in, it looks phenomenal.

This venue also supports live music with multiple nights of live music (with no cover) every week. 

Whether you&#39;re trying to impress a first date, new potential client, or if you just want a great place to relax, take in live music, and converse with friendly staff, Baur&#39;s is the place to be."

The bartenders will create an amazing drink if you just tell them what you like. We ordered the chips and dip, pork chop, steak, and chicken. All were good. The dip with the chips was an olivade, which was perfect. The pork chop came with polenta. The polenta was a little under seasoned, but the pork chop made up for it. The frites with the steak were a little thicker cut, not what we were expecting. Again, they needed a little more seasoning. Chicken was good. Tasted good, but the winner on this plate was everything under the chicken. It was plated nice. If I go back, I would sit at the bar, make friends with the bartenders, and order a few apps."

As our starter we first chose the Chips and Dip (Artichoke, Portabella, Elephant garlic, Beet, Yellow fingerling, Prosciutto and Olivade) was our first starter. The combination of the Olivade and thinly sliced melt in your mouth Prosciutto is amazing. We then ordered the Octopus a la Plancha (Lamb Merguez, Smoked Potato, Eggplant and Tomato Salad) as a second starter. This arrived with beautiful pieces of octopus that had been prepared to perfection. The addition of the tomatoes and the Again, this was another outstanding choice to go along with our drink of choice tonight the Elder Rose.

For the main courses we selected the Venison Schnitzel and the Bucatini Carbonara (Pork Cheeks, English pees, poached egg and Parmesan). The Venison Schnitzel (Herb Spaetzel, Grilled Zucchini, Roasted Pearl Onion, Ravigote and Charred Lemon)  was my dish for the main course. I am a huge fan of venison and to have found a chef that can prepare it correctly in a dish like this truly warms my heart and stomach. This dish was all parts right, mixed with just the proper amounts of love and flavor to bring it fully out to your tastebuds in every bite. 

The Bucatini Carbonara was my wife&#39;s main course for the evening. It&#39;s served in a large bowl and arrives with a heap of noodles and light cheese infused cream. The treat of the dish are pork cheeks throughout that have a wonderful flavor and truly add to the experience. 

Dessert we selected the 6x Ice Cream flight on handmade waffle cones (Death by Chocolate, Nutella, Goat Cheese and Cheery, Vanilla Salted Carmel, Earl Gray, Cinnamon) w/Strawberry Basel Sorbet and the Chocolate Fixation (which was OMG!)

(12 Hours later) Brunch

Because dinner was absolutely amazing and Baur&#39;s offers a brunch menu we decided to come back and enjoy more goodness. 

Brunch was started with a cup of coffee that is from a local Denver roaster. Maybe the best cup of black coffee I&#39;ve had in many years. We were then given a basked with a few of the mornings fresh pastries (Chocolate chip scone, banana nut muffin, ham and cheese turnover and cinnamon roll). These were all hot and fresh from the oven and as you can maybe imagine from the rest of the review so far were beyond belief when it came to taste.

The three dishes we chose for the main course were the Garden Omelet, Creme Brûlée French Toast and Breakfast Poutine. There is too much to list for the ingredients of these dishes, however they are simply amazing. The Poutine was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had and because it was included along with handmade tater-tots and a soft scrambled egg the combination was out of this world. My Creme Brûlée French Toast was stunningly delicious and absolutely does not need any toppings or syrup on top of it. The Garden Omelet was made with all fresh ingredients and could be the perfect size for two people to share.

Finally this review would not be complete without mentioning our staff from both dinner in the evening of the 24th and brunch on the 25th. We were looked after by Attily who was both our bartender on the 24th and primary server as well. She is truly a delight to have take care of us and very excited as we worked our way through the menu. Attily was also part of our experience for brunch as well in the 25th. We also had the pleasure of interacting with Jessica both trips in. She was on constant watch of any needs we might have had while dining. Finally we had Erin as our primary server for brunch on the 25th. Erin was outstanding to talk with and knowledgeable about everything in the menu (this was the case also with everyone in the establishment). 

Overall if I could give our experiences a 5+ on the star scale I would do so! We will be back up to enjoy more of the rotational dinner menu as well as in with friends to get the word out so we can continue to enjoy this new gem in downtown Denver."

The bartender responded simply with a &#34;someone will be with you in a minute&#34;, which is fine, but his attitude was awful... kind of like someone who&#39;s been doing the same thing for too long and is just worn down. Someone finally came out from the kitchen and offered to seat us... his attitude wasn&#39;t great either. Seemed annoyed. The overall vibe was kind of off putting. There were dialing piano players performing that night which was great. Haven&#39;t event tried the food yet, but I&#39;m giving this place 3 stars right off the bat purely because of the poor service.

They told us we couldn&#39;t order at the bar, but we could sit there and order mimosas as we waited for a table. The restaurant was almost empty, but sometimes the servers aren&#39;t there yet to accommodate, I get it. We obliged and started mimosas at the bar with a nice gent named Patrick. Not long after, our table was ready. Each of us (3) ordered something different and played &#34;rotate your plate to the left&#34; - I had the eggs benny, my friends had rancheros and an omelet. I liked mine the best, but I think my friends loved the omelet. 

We went ahead and decided to truly live it up on game day, so we ordered the entire bottle of champagne. No regrets there--it satisfied us perfectly. I was amazed that the bill was only about $28 each. We drank to our heart&#39;s content and sampled 3 brunch items with attentive service (albeit sometimes confusing-- we had to ask different people for different things after our initial server disappeared)

I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was among the worst I&#39;ve had. The pork was very dry, the bread was hard and there was just a bit of mustard seed. I requested more mustard, and our server brought honey mustard. He said they only had that or dijon. At $15 I expected better.

We ordered some snacks woth our drinks that included poutine, calamari, and the corn dogs. If you know any Canadian poutine, you know this one is pretty inferior. The calamari was good in flavor and breading, but I wish it were just a bit more golden and warm as these were a bit cold. The corn dogs are well, corn dogs. High quality corn dogs at that, but corn dogs nonetheless. Meh."

Baur&#39;s is definitely one of them.  They have a ridiculously innovative and tasty opening menu.  Great list of beers.  Not overwhelming, and still, very well represented by all of my favorites.

I had the abalone.  Their dish could be another reason why this delicious little shellfish is hard to get, and so strictly controlled. Total sense of umami is happening on it.  The rabbit with artichokes was... It was good.  Again, it had a TON of different things going on, and the flavors all popped... But, as a personal preference, I feel like it needed something... Texture maybe... Regardless, it was still, very good - Or the Abalone is just that difficult to follow.

Service was friendly.  Very friendly, and seemed just excited to actually be there.  Not in a weird Chotchkie&#39;s (from Office Space) way at all.  Very pleasant and helpful.

I&#39;m going to minus 1 star for the ambience and atmosphere... It&#39;s new, and they took over what used to be a french brasserie - So they have that going for it. They have a huge space, and in the back they put in Chotchkie&#39;shat seems to be a lounge and stage (Note Restaurant &amp; listening lounge).  When I first ate here, the lounge seats were vacant, the stage was empty and looked lonely without a piano being played by some with a 70s massive, thick, brown mustache, and a prince valiant bowl cut, in a light blue and yellow 3 piece suit.smoking cigarettes - I can see this being a wonderful addition to the space, or a complete disaster.  I like that they&#39;re trying out a new idea (to me, it&#39;s a new idea) But, right now, it&#39;s ugly.

But yea... This is one of the most exciting restaurants to come to Denver, in my opinion."

The food was high quality with great portions, though it lacked some of the creativity of other Denver household restaurants at a similar price point.

Tater tots with sausage gravy (the gravy was fantastic!) and fried eggs on top.  Super filling, excellent if you have a hangover, creative and yummy.  My boyfriend got the steak tacos, also delicious.  And we each had a house bloody mary - seriously one of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

We also tried the Spare Parts, a combination of Berbere spiced duck, pork spare ribs, fried chicken wings and pickles. The duck did not receive positive reviews. 
With the sweet sounds of Bluegrass wafting through the air, we decided to stick around and enjoy music and the chocolate cheesecake. A fitting end to a day full of NCAA men&#39;s basketball."

Although I think the name is a little weird for a restaruant, it was really good! I got the french dip and my husband got the filet salad. He loved the salad. The french dip was not the best I have had, but we also ordered the spinach artichoke dip and that was great! I had a white chocolate martini and a moscow mule. The martini was awesome but I think the moscow was a little watered down. Not much vodka. My step dad got the ribs and they looked really good!

The atmosphere inside is great! I love the bar and the fancy glasses they have. We live in DTC so we will be back for sure! I will need to check into their HH menu to see if they have any good deals since it is very close to another restaurant we go to religiously for HH."

The portions were great I had the salad with a light ginger taste I couldn&#39;t get enough of it. Loved it. My date was concerned I wasn&#39;t as chatty as I usually am :) it was because I was enjoying my dinner!!!  The large piece of salmon, on a generous bed of mixed greens,  halved grape tomatoes, orange sections, an apple or two soo good. 
I could hear others say they&#39;ve never had a bad meal there... I believe it!   Worth the trip to Park Meadows Mall in the South side you can miss it was you shouldn&#39;t miss trying it out!!!

All the food is amazing. The ahi starter is divine. Burgers are delish. Interesting choices of sides like cous cous or honey carrots. They also have seafood dishes, salads, soups and sandwiches. I also really love the ribs!

Even the bathrooms are the best- big, vanilla candles burning and almond soap.

I absolutely love the filet salad (although it used to be twice the size and cheaper) it&#39;s the only salad I truly crave. 

Burgers are perfect... I wish they would let you order it with an over easy egg on it but besides that it&#39;s to die for.

Dinner and dessert in under 45 min, which is great, but then we were all dressed up with nothing to do the rest of the evening. 

  Hubby ordered the barbeque platter that had ribs, pulled pork, chicken, and mashed potatoes. It was fantastic but the potato ratio was inadequate, so an extra side or potatoes was promptly delivered.
  I had chicken enchiladas with a side of brussel sprouts that was chilled and tasted similar to coleslaw. I was very pleased as well.
  We split a slice of banana creme pie for dessert that had banana chunks, whipped cream, caramel sauce and white chocolate shavings. So good."

For my main course I got the balsamic ribeye. The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The steak had a great taste but was a little on the chewy side. For my sides I got fries and the mashed potatoes with gravy. The gravy is always delicious. 

 If the review was based solely off of desert it would be a 10 star review. We&#39;ve continuously got the bread pudding and it&#39;s top notch. I&#39;m sure everything on the menu is delightful but I can&#39;t say no to the bread pudding.

We have finally resurrected &#39;date nights&#39; and chose WCG as our first official dinner place!  Super busy on a Wed night under somewhat threatening skies. We had a shorter than expected wait and were seated at a booth near the door. I&#39;m still getting used to the chilly indoor air conditioning so each time the door opened the inferno blast of heat was quite nice!!

We ordered the crab cakes and the jambalaya thinking we would share.  When the dishes came out I quickly devoured the Israeli cous cous side dish made even more delicious by the addition of some mint and pistachios. The crab cake was quite hot which was a delight as my husband&#39;s dish, while spicy and flavorful was room temperature at best. He is often reluctant to send food back to the kitchen so he
just ate it more quickly. 

The crab cakes were filled with lumps of crab and very little breading and cooked to a golden brown so that the outside was crispy, which I love. Overall a very good meal...a bit on the pricey side...$24.99 for two medium sized cakes but well worth it. 

For dessert we had the apple pie, again, but it was a bit heavy on the carmel this time which made this otherwise extraordinary dessert a bit too sweet.  More apples, less topping would have been a better end to what was otherwise a very good meal. 

There was a brief downpour at the very end of our meal which had all of the diners from the patio flocking inside holding their plates, congregating at the door. While the employees did a great job rescuing all of the cushions from outside they left a mass of diners at the door to linger around the tables of those of us who thought better to sit inside. Some kind of back up plan to seat these diners should be in place and ultimately they did disperse but only after about 10 minutes. Not enough to cause the loss of a star for this visit however. We will be back."

We waited an hour for the table while waiting I had a mojito and my boyfriend had a margarita, both drinks were fine not anything to write home about. I ordered a burger and the waitress told me they freshly ground their own meat so I was excited to hear that, however again it was just ok. My bf crab cakes were tiny for the cost ($25) and he also they were just ok. Personally, I would not go back it was fine but definitely overpriced.

(Yes it was 86 degrees and I think it was a Denver record) we arrived about 11:30 and were immediately seated.  I ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas with a Brussels sprout side.  It was great and very filling.  The Brussels sprouts was almost a salad sprout leaves with nuts and cranberries and a vinaigrette dressing.  That may be one of the best sprout dishes I have had.  My wife had the French dip which was suggested by our server.  It was very good and tender.  My daughter had the child&#39;s ribs.  She was ecstatic they had ribs on the child&#39;s menu.  They were fall off the bone tender and she did not really even have to pick them up.  They had some great looking desserts but we ate too much to try them.  We had great service.

I had the cajun chicken sandwich with a side of honey roasted carrots. The sandwich was good but the carrots were SUPERB. I&#39;m a fan of cooked vegetables to begin with, but these carrots were flavored to perfection.

Had the ahi salad- as described was to come with mangos etc. I counted a couple teeny pieces of diced mango atop some romaine. The ahi tuna was seared rare but texturally was off. It was almost too tender.

Waking into the establishment and the menu and location was very inviting. The restaurant was 75% full for lunch...which we thought was a good sign.

We ordered the grilled artichoke as a starter, which was under cooked and chewy. It should have been steamed more before hitting the grill. I ordered a Caesar salad which was frozen and over dressed. I did not have the time to send it back.

My partner ordered the chicken sandwich which was ok.
 
We both walked away from the experience feeling underwhelmed for the experience and the price. You could walk next door to cheese cake factory and order a small plates and have a better experience...in fact we had cheese cake factories grilled artichoke app on Sunday when we adobes in Denver and it was 10x&#39;s better."

From the hostess who did not smile, or make eye contact, and shrugged when we said we had a reservation. To the 10 minute wait we had while 5 other tables were sat. To the waiter who seemed hopped up on drugs, caffeine, or I don&#39;t know what. Our food arrived in a reasonable time, was hot, presentable and delicious. Offering a vegetable would be nice. Offering a variety of non-alcoholic drinks would be nice as well. What was really a shame, was that not one person wished me a happy birthday.

Even though our Open Table reservation was made with the birthday notation, and even though my husband told our waiter when I was in the restroom. Our dessert was not comped, and another server barely made eye contact, didn&#39;t say a word, and practically dropped my banana pie with a droopy candle on it. Not one happy birthday, nothing.

Really disappointing. The entire restaurant staff needs a complete overhaul in training, especially the front desk staff as they are front of the house. Wish we went to Cheesecake Factory, where at least they sing happy birthday to you, comp a dessert, and try to make it special. My other thought while dining at White Chocolate is that we should have booked at Perry&#39;s across the way - a much higher level of service standard. I don&#39;t think we will be back here.

UPDATE: I received a response from the restaurant with an &#34;we are sorry&#34;.  I also received a note from someone on here who thinks it&#39;s bad business to comp a dessert - I wholeheartedly disagree.  What&#39;s more important here, which everyone seems to miss and dismiss, is the shabby treatment provided by the White Chocolate Grill&#39;s front of the house and servers.  Really sub par and I would think would be more of a concern.  Regardless, I didn&#39;t realize White Chocolate operated on such a lower class level, had I known I would have spent my $$ on a more deserving restaurant."

Had to get the tomato gin soup and the wild caught ahi tuna salad based on reviews, despite the BBQ ribs calling my name. There was a large selection of specialty cocktails and wines. But I was going to the gym afterward so I only had water.
The lighting was dark and more like a bar versus a restaurant. Good music in the background but volume was low. 
The tomato gin soup is advertised to be a house specialty. And you have to be 21 to order it! Amazing! Creamy with bite size slices of fresh mushroom, tomatoes. Wow. And it was served hot. The portion size could be a light meal. 
The menu says bread served upon request- so I requested it!!! Two round buttery rolls came out piping hot from the oven and were served with honey butter. 
The salad was also a healthy portion and delicious. The lettuce was ice cold. There were mango and avacado pieces in it. The dressing had a slight tang.
It would be hard to return here and not get the same two dishes; they were both excellent.
My server, Jason, was sweet and attentive. Water was refilled, and he checked in regularly.

The service from our server though was a vision in perfection. She was attentive but not annoying. Polite but not afraid to suggest. 

Their Ceasar salad was my favorite of the night. I am actually salivating while typing this. Not the baby back ribs. That was disappointing. Food came quick. A full slab of meat. I took 3/4 of it home. Part deux the following day to confirm my dislike for the sugary ribs. Yup. Confirmed.

The wait was over an hour long, but luckily we had called ahead to get our names on the wait list before we arrived. 

We ordered the grilled artichoke as an appetizer,  which was pretty tasty. We really enjoyed the sauce it came with. 

I was craving steak, so I ordered the center cut filet with marinated mushrooms and steamed broccoli. The steak size was not indicated on the menu, and it ended up being only about 6 oz. It wasn&#39;t very flavorful and was actually a bit dry. 

My wife ordered the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was cooked well with great sauce and the salad had a nice vinnegrette. However the salad itself was disappointing. It was mostly romaine lettuce with a few field greens. The toppings were few and hidden underneath the bed of greens. 

Overall, while a nice ambiance for dates and great waitstaff, we wouldn&#39;t come back. Our bill was more than the food was worth.

Fresh croissants baked w/ Godiva white chocolate liqueur and golden raisins, topped w/ whipped cream, caramel and white chocolate sauces. It&#39;s as good as it sounds. Rich too - we had 5 people share this one dessert :) Oh that was really yummy.

FILET MIGNON COBB SALAD - $16.99
The restaurant is more than just the white chocolate desserts - they have quite a menu. I wanted a protein and our server recommended this dish - didn&#39;t expect to order a Cobb Salad for dinner but this was very good. Wood-grilled marinated filet (served rare), field greens, Hailey&#39;s croutons, bleu cheese, chopped eggs, marinated mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, smoked bacon and red zinfandel vinaigrette. The filet was the best part b/c you could really taste the wood-grilled flavor -- and having all the veggies was  bonus.

Next time, I&#39;d like to try their Tomato Gin Soup which is their house specialty ... apparently you must be 21 to enjoy :) One of my co-workers raved about the soup - he said it&#39;s more like a mushroom cream (vs tomato) soup, and topped w/ Tanqueray Gin."

But yet  the shrimp while warm on the outside was ice cold in the center..rice was clumpy and had a sindged taste..not their best effort...will I go back..probably not.

Must have been an off night for this place as we visit often. The server (name shall not be posted to protect his dignity) was hands down one of the worst in my 20+ years of dining out and working in the restaurant business. It&#39;s simple: listen to the customers, bring things they ask, smile, clean up the table, bring check, get a tip. 
Well, besides the above, the food was off. Not sure why but the chicken was cold, the blue cheese filet served with honey carrots, simply had the ugliest presentation and the taste was off.
Our friend finally could not take it anymore and spoke with the manager, who acknowledged complaints about the server and took care of our entire tab (well done in my humble opinion). 
We will give this place one more try since we do come here often and any place can have an off night, not ok but hey, it&#39;s happens. 
So, diner beware, it might happen to you."

I come here with girlfriends every couple of months and we always leave full and satisfied. It is a little more expensive than other chain restaurants but it feels infinitely nicer when you are inside and the wait staff and food are all fantastic. It can get very busy as it is in a nice location in the vistas at park meadows but they offer reservations and I always make one with open table before heading over there. We always get seated right away.

There is not anything I have tried that I would not recommend. The spinach and artichoke dip and caprese are both good starters. The shaved turkey dip is delicious and comes with the best gravy I might have ever tasted. Their sandwiches are huge and have quality ingredients. I&#39;ve tried the roast chicken and the prime rib for dinner and neither disappointed. But my favorite is the ahi tuna salad. The champagne dressing is so light and fresh and the ahi is served perfectly. You have to end with a white chocolate brownie it is by far the best part of the meal.

I went for dinner last night with a friend and we shared the caprese, had two glasses of wine, each had an entree and got the brownie and it was about $65 before tip. I think that is very doable for all the tasty food we got. We will continue to come back!"

We went on Easter Sunday for lunch. This restaurant has a great ambiance to it. 

Our waiter was extremely nice, good grief!! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was pretty decent, the fries were absolutely incredible, no lie. And the bbq sauce they give you for dipping is a delicious sweet sauce

My husbands dish was better than mine though! He got the bbq bacon cheeseburger. Y&#39;all that grilled cheeseburger was out of this world. It had an amazing smoky flavor to it!! He got the carrots with it and they were a 10 also!!


For dessert we did the blondie, it  was decent, I won&#39;t rave about it though!! 

I highly recommend this restaurant."

Just big chunks of not very flavorful meat. Minimal sauce and broccoli that had been covered in parmesan cheese. I&#39;m not sure why anyone would want to do that to broccoli. The Mojito was pretty light on the alcohol. It was expensive so all in all not a great time."

This was our first time there and had heard great reviews from friends and co-workers so our expectations were pretty high. Used OpenTable to set reservation since we went on a Friday night and I highly recommend doing so as we had no trouble getting seated. 

We explained to the waitress that it was our first time and she was extremely helpful in highlighting certain menu choices as well as answering our questions. We ended up getting the Prime Rib and the Parmesan Fillet. Both were outstanding along with the mash potatoes. A little surprised they did not have a baked potato option but the mashed were great. 

Drink wise, disappointed they did not serve Guinness and the Left Hand stout a let down. Passed on dessert but did have chips and guacamole that had a side of salsa and it was great!

Very friendly staff and valet parking paid for was a bonus. Definitely recommend and will go back soon."

An hour went by and we got no offers in drink refills not even water, we had 4 different servers, so no clue who was even helping us, then had some guy server after we got bill and wanted it split, take my credit card from
Sitting on my wallet. Very awkward. Didn&#39;t see him all night? But he grabbed my card and it wasn&#39;t even in the bill folder... Them after we were signing the bill, we get the manger to come by, names heather. Not only did we think she was being nice to ask how our meal was, so we could tell her how we would have liked at least more water. NO, she came to our table to ask us to move because another party had been waiting for our table! We just got our bill and now we&#39;ve seen a bunch of different people and still no drinks of water?

First off, the menu of new American fare is expansive.  There really is something for everyone!  Their chopped salads are delicious.  My favorite is the ahi tuna with champagne vinaigrette.  My bf is your typical meat and potatoes guy, and doesn&#39;t typically branch out into the green items... but he&#39;s now ordered the spinach and kale (KALE!!) salad twice now and left nothing on the plate. 

We went here for the 6th time since I moved here (3 months ago) just this last Monday when his family was visiting.  We requested two kids menus as well as two gluten free menus.  They have a nice selection of gluten free items and are aware of other sensitivities, even boasting on the menu that they are open to suggested cooking practices (they typically just brush the grill after every meal is cooked on there).  This awareness and flexibility makes me want to support them for good business practices, but I also like knowing I can have a satisfying (and TASTY) meal when I&#39;m trying to avoid gluten.

Now, I have to talk about the service.  It&#39;s always been phenomenal.  When we were there on Monday, our waitress noticed the girls had almost finished coloring/completing the kids&#39; menus. She asked the girls if they wanted something else to do while we waited for the food to arrive.  The girls were a little tentative but interested.  She gave them a piece of paper and pen and told them to name 10 body parts that were only 3 letters long.  Acronyms, abbreviations and compound words could not be used.  She walked away and the girls stared at each other excitedly, and started writing down the names they could think of.  They were thrilled that an adult gave them a critical thinking task (these are some smart kids), and eagerly wanted to complete their assignment!  When the waitress came back around and checked their list, she told them how impressed she was.  She&#39;s apparently a pre-med student and told the girls that her class had a bit of a difficult time with this task...so the fact that they completed it rather quickly said a lot about them.  The girls BEAMED. 

She came back a little later and said she couldn&#39;t help over hear that I was looking for a nail salon, and gave me a recommendation for the one the girls at the restaurant use.  I can&#39;t wait to try them out!  

This level of customer service cannot be taught...it&#39;s innate.  She just wanted to be helpful and make sure we were having a good time!  I wish I could remember our waitress&#39;s name so others could ask for her.   My bf took care of the bill (and made sure she was compensated well), otherwise, I would check there for her name.  But even if you don&#39;t get her, I&#39;m sure your waiter/waitress will be great, as we&#39;ve always had fantastic service here.

As for the desserts, mine (and apparently the staff&#39;s) favorite is the cheesecake!  SO yummy.  But they said they sell 2 brownies for every other dessert option they&#39;ve had.  I&#39;ve had both as well as the apple pie, and trust me...you will not be dissappointed!  

Definitely give this place a try if you haven&#39;t been here yet!"

No what anyone at our table considered &#34;a side of mashed potatoes&#34;.  When we decided against dessert (we have had their desserts in the past and were greatly disappointed), we were given the Bum&#39;s Rush out the door.

The first was to take our drink order and the second and third were to refil drinks and bring the check.  We went nearly 20 minutes with empty drinks at one point.  Even worse than being ignored, she had a terrible attitude the entire time.  I think we caught her on an off day because this place usually has great service.

The food was great.  We split the cajun chicken sandwich and the southwestern chicken sandwich.  I think this place is a bit overpriced but it is offset by the quality.  Both dishes were great for sharing.  We left happy with the food but disappointed by lackluster service."

They do not have a gf bun or anything like that, but the Idaho Trout on the gf menu and the steak cobb salad are both delicious options. 

Back when I didn&#39;t know I was celiac, I ate the famous chicken salad here and it is to DIE for. Also, my family that is not gf always scarfs a white chocolate brownie every time we visit. Love it. This place has great food and good customer service (the way they tag team tables is great). The only complaint I have is that you definitely need a reservation and even when you have a reservation, they usually make you wait 5-15 min from the time of your reservation.

This place blows all the other Park Meadows places away. The Ahi Tuna salad is incredible, the Cobb salad is delicious and they have an awesome wine selection.

The food was better than average.  I had a New York strip steak with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  My wife had a steak sandwich that looked pretty good.  It had a Parmesan mayo on it, so I didn&#39;t try it.  She had fries as her side dish.  She did share those and WOW amazingly good fries.  When we come back (and we will) I&#39;m going to order fries with whatever I order because they were stellar!!!  We had the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  It was very good as well.

We managed to get lucky and get a table on the sunken patio. The patio can be best described as cozy because it is a tight space. Our server was all business because the place was hopping and she was hustling to take care of her customers. 

We ordered the chips and 4 salsas to start, the chips are ok but I liked the salsas that were served. For lunch I ordered 1 lobster taco, 1 swordfish taco and 1 hanger steak taco. The best taco was the lobster taco but it could have used a little more lobster. The swordfish taco came with a sizable portion of deep fried breaded fish and it was delicious. The hanger steak taco was good by any standard but the lobster taco was sooo good.

Yes I will return here because the prices were reasonable and the tacos were very good."

I was a bit concerned about &#34;Machete&#34; in the name because that&#39;s a damn big knife!  If someone tried a dine-n-dash would they chop off his head?  Very messy.  If I flirted with the bartender too much would they lop off my family jewels?  That would be unfortunate.  I queried the bartender and she assured me they only brought out &#34;The Blade&#34; when someone wanted ketchup on their tacos!  On that I heartily agree!

ATMOSPHERE- This is a basement location so it&#39;s just a little dim but it has a very nice casual vibe.  There is a sizable bar and outside seating.  Considering the sophistication of the drinks and the menu I can see why some call this fine-dining Mexican.

CUSTOMER SERVICE- I sat at the bar and my bartender was cute and a little sassy and efficient.  I kept the flirting to a minimum as I wanted to hold on to &#34;my jewels!&#34;

ADULT LIBATIONS- My first was a Spicy Rico Rita @ $12 and I was blown away!  It was beautifully made, strong and had the expected spicy kick.  It was truly an excellent drink.  Next I tried a Coin Purse @ 11.  It was described as tidy &amp; smooth and it was exactly that kind of margarita.  Once again it was beautifully mixed and excellent.  I agree with others that their drink prices are probably $1 too high.  $12 for a marg is high even for Cherry Creek.

FOOD- I went for the Chile Relleno @ $12 and it was excellent!  The batter was light and the Oaxaca cheese stuffing was crazy good.  As you can see from my picture the dish was beautifully plated.

The accompanying beans &amp; rice were so exceptional they deserve a separate paragraph.  So many times the B&amp;R at a Mexican restaurant are an afterthought but definitely not here.  I&#39;m going to have dreams about these guys!  

Hundreds of reviews give these guys a solid four stars and my fellow Yelpers know their stuff.  If I could I would go for 4.5!"

Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I did! Interior has darker lighting, but a good vibe- not at all Cherry Creek North valet-parking-only stuffy.  Our server was kind and friendly. 

We started with a round of margaritas and sangria.  There are several varieties of margs on the menu- we tried the cucumber, hibiscus, and pineapple.  All were tasty, but a bit on the smaller side.  Cocktails are about $11 each.

For starters, we got the 4 salsas and guac- WOW, that fresno is delicious!!!  It&#39;s the reddish creamy one.  Super tasty and memorable!  Guac was good, but not particularly memorable.  I think the chips were made from some sort of pita?  They were thicker than tortilla chips.

Dinner was tacos, tacos, and more tacos.  Our table got a wide variety- I had the lobster, the fried swordfish, pork w/ apple (highly recommend this one!), and rotisserie chicken.  Yummy!

Overall, it ended up being a really good experience.  While our bill came out to over $180 for 5 people (okay, so we got a few rounds of drinks...), it was great quality good that I will cherish and remember for a good friend&#39;s final meal in town before moving.

I started of with their Michelada.. it was decent. I am really tough with micheladas as I found the best one in Houston, (Captain Toms -- go, order it, trust me) so I almost always find every other michelada just decent. 3.5/5

We ordered the chips &amp; guac for starter &amp; it was tasty! Very delicious. It came with 4 other sauces/salsa.. They were delicious too. Devoured that app in 2 mins. 5/5

Then we ordered 12 different tacos. All were sooooo gooood!!!! All were tasty, but if there was a standout, just a tiny bit better than the rest, its the lobster taco. But then again, all are superb so order with confidence. The only thing that threw me off is their chicharron taco... You would think its actual chicharron in a taco, but no... its fried cheese. Weird.... 5/5

Then, we had flan for dessert. It was aight. I can make it better :) so 2.5/5"

As far as ambiance the place felt like a dungeon and was very muggy. The air circulation in the place was horrific. The menu was awfully sticky as well. 
Out waitress was not rude or anything but she wasn&#39;t that great at her job either. She seemed to go about with a lackluster attitude and a slight indifference to the customers. She was not incredibly attentive and we waited a while for our drinks and then when she brought them she simply set them down and walked away instead of asking if we were ready to order.

I took our server&#39;s suggestions and was glad I did. Ended up splitting 4 tacos and enjoyed (almost) all of them. 

First off, the rotisserie chicken taco was my favorite of the bunch. So much flavor in the chicken! The crispy potatoes and avocado salsa were both welcome additions that set this taco over the edge. Next up, the fried lobster tail taco. The lobster was great, but was a bit overpowered because of the amount of chile aioli they put inside the taco. I then tried the crispy beef tripe taco and wow, was this good! The crispness really gave this taco what it needed. The salsa roja also provided so much more flavor. Really recommend this one if you&#39;re looking to expand your horizons a bit. What I wouldn&#39;t recommend is the beef tongue taco. I&#39;ve had tongue before, but this was not well prepared at all. The entire taco was bland and the tongue did not help matters. 


Fortunately, we still left with full bellies because of the drinks and appetizers we started with. The traditional guacamole was perfect! Great ratio of lime to avocado. The 4 salsa spread was also amazing. I&#39;m not sure what each of the salsas is prepared with, but they all tasted distinctly different and were all yummy. This is the starter you cannot go without!"

As for the food, we tried the four salsa sampler and guac - great collection ranging from creamy to spicy. Must try! 
Now the rest gets a little blurry but I do remember our server was absolutely great. It was dingy and hot inside so we requested to sit outside and he made it happen! We ordered enough tacos that he suggested we do the 12 for $42 fam deal. 
Fish tacos are good except I thought the lobster tail was too salty. Camerones tacos were good. All the steak ones are good. Tinga is good. Do not ever try the one that has the potato. It&#39;s bad. 
And the warm, fresh out of the cookies at the end of the meal just really add a cherry on top."

It reminded me more of a pita chip. The guacamole was good too. Not as spicy as I like it but still delicious. Out of the 4 salsas I liked the regular and tomatillo the best.

I really wanted to try the tacos but I was so full after all the chips, guac and salsa. Based on what I had I would give this place a 4. Next time, tacos it is!"

Cheap and tasty Margarita&#39;s that are packed with a punch, slightlly overpriced taco&#39;s (but they are &#34;premium&#34; tacos so-to-speak, kinda fancy, so almost worth it). Everything there is trying to do something just a little new or do it really well. Service is usually great.

It has a sunken patio that really helps give it a private and friendly feel. 
I was seated immediately in a corner seat during Happy Hour. 
The clientele ranged from blue collar to white collar to no collar. 
Everyone was having a great time and the vibe was welcoming. 
The Tequila drinks are AMAZING ( and I normally don&#39;t drink Tequila). I can recommend the Cucu and the Spicy Rico Rita! 

The wait staff was very friendly. Our waitress smiled every time I saw her. I told her to bring me her favorite tacos and she did me RIGHT! The lobster was my favorite for sure. This is a very popular spot and I can really see why!"

I got up at the ass crack of dawn for my flight and had no time to catch a nap before a day full of trainings. Mexican is one of my comfort foods and I was looking forward to some tasty tacos to set myself right. Machete got me close, but not quite there.

I was lucky to score a table when I walked in. I felt a bit like a jerk since I got a table for four when the place was filling up, but that&#39;s where the host seated me. I sat for a bit before my server noticed me; between the bottleneck around the front door and how busy it was, I&#39;m not terribly shocked.

I started out with the Spicy Rico Rita. Most times when I order a spicy margarita, I&#39;m sorely disappointed; nine times out of ten they aren&#39;t the least bit spicy. From a heat perspective, I have no complaints; from a balance perspective it was off, it was almost all spicy and fell short on the sweet side. That said, I&#39;d consider getting it again.

To eat, I went with three tacos - Langosta, Chicharron, and Pescado; the more traditional ones came on squid ink tortillas. As a non-meat eater, I was confused by the chicarron, which roughly translates into pork rinds. This taco, my favorite, was vegetarian. The cheese was fried, kind of like a cannoli shell and the inside was stuffed. My next favorite taco was the Langosta (lobster); there was a lot going on, but the smoked avocado and lobster paired well together. Surprisingly, I liked the Pescado taco the least. It was pretty boring, basically fish and aioli, no crunch of cabbage or other textures really involved. In terms of presentation, it looked boring compared o the other too and taste-wise was the least exciting.

I know I&#39;m spoiled, I come from a town with a lot of excellent Mexican options. Overall, it&#39;s just ok in my book, but good enough that I&#39;d make a return visit if in the area."

In this case the location more has the feeling and layout of a bar that happens to have a real kitchen in the back, and the only place you&#39;ll find &#34;the street&#34; is where you park your car or bike.

That said, you&#39;ll like this place as much or more than some of the other well-regarded street food places that have planted roots and sprouted sit-down restaurants. 

Machete has some really neat recipes (my faves: the arrachera, the campechano, the al pastor, the camaron, and the langosta). And the best deal is that most (not all) of the above are served at lunch as $3.00 specials which is almost a buck off a piece. Maybe you can eat three, but for a wimp like me two are enough when accompanied by some chips and (a very good tray of 4) salsas.

I met a couple of friends here for dinner after hearing great things about this place. We arrived just in time for Happy Hour, so I figured I might as well grab a margaritas. But OH MY LORD! It tasted like 3/4 tequila, which some people would probably consider a good thing, but not me. Even my friends who are more avid tequila drinkers agreed that it was way too strong.

I decided to just enjoy a couple of tacos instead, but that was truly disappointing too. It was a mass of unappetizing, congealed cheese and meat that was so tough it was had to bite into.

And that wasn&#39;t even the worst part! It took a solid 45 minutes for us to get our check from our waiter when we were finished even though it was CLEAR that we were done. It wasn&#39;t even all that busy--he was just too busy disappearing into the kitchen or chatting up the hostess. 

Was very unimpressed and will not be retuning."

We had the chips and salsa, which were actually really good.  Flavorful and unique salsas with some solid chips.

The staff was nice, polite, pretty quick, and overall good.

But the tacos were just so mediocre.  No strong flavors, nothing that stood out whatsoever.  The tortillas were weak, and fell apart almost immediately after a bite, turning my tacos into a salad situation.  The meats were plain and not flavorful.

The chips and salsa cost so just FYI on that but the 4 sauces are a nice change from the status quo. The chips are thick cut (also an FYI) in case you like the thin crispy style.

It&#39;s a go to place for me for a quick bite or a happy hour drink. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, outside even offers a nice big area with couches and umbrellas, perfect for summer.

However something changed here recently. The menu was updated from a tasteful classy design to a very tacky generic style. Some of the best tacos (Make shark, daily veggie, etc) were removed from the menu, and there is now a pretty much complete lack of veggie options (if you don&#39;t count the cheese taco that is counted as veggie). The meat was overcooked and slightly dry, and the entire presentation was just so so. The service was also lacking, we sat during a very slow late lunch period, where there were just two tables outside and two inside, and despite there being at least 3 servers, ours couldn&#39;t get a handle on keeping water on the table, timely service, or even something as simple as getting our order right.

I don&#39;t know if there is new management, ownership, or if someone just lost sight of what made this place great, but please fix it! Dump the horribly tacky menu, get your kitchen back on par, and get your servers in line.

This may be my last visit for a while, be wary of the amazing reviews from before a couple months ago, I too would have been one of them."

It&#39;s located near the cherry creek mall and on that busy street with lots of restaurants and shops! We went here last night for drinks and food. It has a modern twist to it. I like it and it was perfect enough food. They have tacos (around $3.75-$4.50 each) , quesadillas, and other entrees. 
We got the:
Lamb Shank taco- YUM! I would recommend it
Beef Taco - my partner enjoyed that one too
Lobster Tail Taco- AMZING!! we got 2 of these. It&#39;s a MUST if you come here. The sauce is creamy and perfectly goes well with the buttery lobster tail. It could not be more perfect.

Chicken Quesadilla- Delicious. I relay enjoyed it...I do wish they gave better silverware because it&#39;s not like you traditional quesadilla  cut up in like 4 pieces. It&#39;s one big piece and the knife was useless to cut it.

Had the house margarita and the Coin purses. Both were good and strong. A bit expensive at $11 but worth it.

The environment is very nice and they have outdoor patio with couches, and tables on a beautiful summer night. We were seated on the outside bar. It&#39;s perfect for either a couple to have dinner or after drinks place with your gfs or guys to hang out. The music playing their is pretty solid.

First off, the $12 margaritas are a tad overpriced albeit tasty. 

Second, you have to pay for your chips and salsa. They bring 4 different sauces for $4, but they are strange salsas. They are thick and creamy and taste funky. I just asked for a regular ol&#39; salsa, and even that wasn&#39;t good. I honestly think pace salsa is much better than their &#34;gringo&#34; salsa. I&#39;m all for cool salsas- maybe a roasted tomato one or something, but these sauces are not what you expect when you ask for salsa... They are sauces. Weird for chips.

I&#39;m always trying to find a good taco place in the Denver area. Being around Cherry Creek, the bae recommended this place. Entering the restaurant, the place was jammed packed! I guess Happy Hour is their peak time. Luckily we were able to get seated.

We started off with guacamole and their 4 salsas. To be honest the guacamole was decent but neither of us liked the salsas. They tasted pretty basic. As for the main courses, bae preferred to ordered a quesadilla and I ordered three tacos-- the Arrachera, Al Pastor, and the Chicharron De Queso. They were amazing! Bae enjoyed his quesadilla as well.

But...the chips and salsa were average. My margarita: the Spicy Rico Rita - average, and a little overwhelming in the spice department. For $11 it should have blown my mind. My tacos: Al Pastor (marinated pork) and Robalito Al Pastor (halibut with a squid ink tortilla) were lacking in flavor and excitement. Sadly, what disappointed me the most was the crowd.

I&#39;m so happy my friend MAUREEN was in the know!!  I&#39;m not a  tequila person but they have a pretty spectacular selection of non-margarita tasting margaritas.  But the tacos are amazing.  The campechano was pretty amazing, it tastes like 3 tacos in one, part steak, part charizo, and part cheese.  The tacos are not teensy street tacos either, they are regular taco sizes, but at 3.00 at happy hour from (11-6 m-f) it seems like street taco prices.  I am coming back.  A lot."

It turned out to be a very nice experience for me. Because we were such a large group, we got the sofa pit in the back with a couple of adjoining tables, which all  worked out fine. We were even able to watch the Kentucky Derby on the screen on the adjacent wall. 

I know they are known for an excellent variety of margaritas, but that is not a favorite drink of mine. It turns out they make a great Paloma too. I ordered the taco al pastor with chile marinated pork, pineapple and cilantro. It was very well seasoned, the pork was lean and chunky, not greasy and shredded as some places serve it. The pineapple was finely diced so it all blended well. And since I personally love cilantro, I loved that it was a visible component. 

I will return should I find myself in Denver near this taco spot."

The al pastor was my favorite and the costilla ahumada is worth a try even though it might sound strange to include apple slices in a taco. The chips and guac are a must have though!

I tried the Kona margarita and loved it, not super strong but that&#39;s the way I like my margs. My friend tried a strawberry margarita (not sure which one) and it was amazing as well.

We ordered steak quesadilla (very good) and lamb taco (also excellent).  Nice atmosphere -- dark wood, high ceiling, casual wood decor.  All the music coming thru the stereo was reggae music, which sounded great but was a funny twist for a Mexican restaurant.  This place is fun, and it&#39;s located near the Rockies ballpark.  One problem:  there are no free chips and salsa provided.  Everything is paid for a la carte, and prices can add up to being higher than expected.  Our bill came to $51 including drinks for two.

Cool taco choices, reasonably priced.  Friendly staff, HUGE tequila selection.

Everything seems fresh.  The place seems dirty, but not in a bad way... It just feels like the southwest to me...  The dirtier places, where you probably go through to get to the beach front resorts that all the tourists go to.  But, in a good way - Nostalgic way almost...

The men&#39;s room has what looks like old spanish comics, which gives it a pretty unique vibe.

Add to the fact that the name is, intentional or unintentional, the same as my favorite Danny Trejo character/movie/whatever makes this all the more awesome."

For a local, $4 taco joint, they know how to deliver a bang for your buck! This restaurant opened six weeks ago because a son wanted to honor how he and his father used to bond of tequila drinking fun in Mexico when he was younger. I love the story. And it&#39;s 100% Colorado owned! Even if the tequila ingredients are from Mexico. 

The menu was fantastic.  The Arta Tequila event was showcasing their tripled distilled tequila cocktails with the absolutely scrumptious tacos from their venue. Talk about the best of both worlds. The tequila expert and the chef prepared a tasting that was to die for. My favorite was the mouthwatering pairing of the Arta Reposado Cucumber / Grapefruit Mojasa with the Tacos de Tivuron and Tacos de Arrachera Com Chile Relleno. For those that don&#39;t speak Spanish, that translates to shark and beef with chile. These are custom made tacos with mixed drinks that are to die for. The drinks are more bitter that I typically like it and I can&#39;t help but admit that it&#39;s educating my pallet! 

These are great tacos. Of you&#39;re from Houston, they are even BETTER than Torchie&#39;s tacos and I know that&#39;s hard to believe. So be prepared for greatness and sit at the bar to learn more about the tequila you&#39;re drinking :)"

There is a nice area with outdoor seating as well as indoor seating.  There is also an area with couches if you are just stopping in to try one of their delicious margaritas.

The restaurant is a little loud but I probably only noticed because my friend had a newborn baby with her.  She asked the owner to turn the music down, and they were very accommodating and did so.  The server was very nice and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, describing her favorite drinks and tacos.

We started out with chips and guacamole which comes with four salsa/dips.  The guac was good and the green creamy dip was excellent.  It tasted like it had a hint of green chili in it.

I ordered two tacos for dinner (based on the waitresses recommendation, which she thanked me for taking her advice!):  the arrachera con chile relleno and the costilla ahumada.  My favorite was the costilla ahumada.  It comes with sautéed green apples which complements the pork meat very well.

First of all, it&#39;s a little hard to find if you&#39;re not familiar with the area. The service was good, Our server was nice and attentive! 

We ordered classic guacamole to start, or plain guacamole. The was nothing special about it. Could of used some more flavor. The chips were very unpredictable. Some were crispy, some stale, and some chewy. 

To drink, we ordered margaritas. My boyfriend ordered the raspberry margarita that was delightfully sweet. I ordered the cucu margarita that was suggested by the server. Both were good and strong. 

We taste tested a few tacos. The pescado was a little fishy. The Cochinita had good flavor bit meat was tuff. The only ones we enjoyed were the campechano and the pollo rostizado. I highly recommend sticking to those. We also ordered beans and rice which were very bland. 

Overall, we enjoyed ourselves. If we were to come back, we would pass on the chips, guacamole and beans and rice."

The service was smiley, but a bit inattentive.

Sadly, I was disappointed with nearly every aspect of Machete, almost to the point of doubting the high praise that other Yelpers had to offer.

First, you head down into the basement of one of Cherry Creek&#39;s many three story office buildings. Initial reaction was good, tin ceilings, Christmas lights everywhere (I assume this will not be around after Christmas), and couches hugging TV&#39;s along the walls. So, an OK start.

Then the poor to super poor began. The waitress either had a twin, or forgot that she offered us drinks three times, and asked us how we were twice. Very odd. The happy hour menu is TINY, three or four items with &#34;$$ off&#34; instead of actual prices on the menu. Misleading, and not good. We order our drinks, and find the house margarita to be barely palatable. My head was spinning from cheap booze even before the first bite of chip.

Speaking of chips, they were average pieces of cardboard. And that is the best compliment I can give. The guac was also average. Finally, the good comes out served like high priced cuisine which certainly didn&#39;t taste like. Guys, it&#39;s Mexican food, just serve it normally and we won&#39;t have such high expectations for the taste.

My reward for a bad meal, stomach pains and a $40 bill. I will bypass Machete until hell freezes over."

We went in around 3 on a Wednesday and we apparently sat in her section (though you wouldn&#39;t have known since she never checked on us after the initial order). 

I&#39;m not a huge Mexican food fan so I asked Gina if they had a chicken quesadilla and her response we was a snappy &#34;does it look like it?! Is a quesadilla on the menu?&#34;.... Uhh no but it&#39;s three ingredients and most places don&#39;t have a problem with fulfilling such a simple request. (Oh and I found out that they do indeed have quesadillas on the children&#39;s menu). Apparently my question agitated her so much that she didn&#39;t come back until it was time for the check. We even had to go to the bar and ask the bar tender for thing a because when we would wave at o get her attention, she deliberately turned away from us.

The food was good with thoughtful presentation. We got the guacamole to start which did the trick. I may not go out of my way to get to this place, but if you&#39;re in the neighborhood-- sure, why not."

I recommend the one with hanger steak and chorizo. I regret not trying the guacamole. We had the queso fundido with chorizo. My one and only complaint is the price of the margaritas ($11-13). If you want just a plain, house margarita try the machete. It is $11 but served in a bigger glass."

We were looking for a quick lunch and asked the concierge at our hotel where the best mexican food was in downtown/lodo, and the told us to go to Machete.

You can usually tell if a Mexican place is going to be good by their chips and salsa and ours were great, with 4 kinds of salsa, just like the street food I eat when I am in Mexico.

The margaritas were strong and good.

If this place were at home, I would eat there all the time."

It&#39;s was smaller than I expected but one might also describe it as nice and cozy. 
Not a huge menu but I think a Cheesecake Factory-sized catalogue is too much anyway. 
The food is a little expensive but not outrageous and, given the size of the place, I think it&#39;s understandable. 
Bottom line: The food was excellent. 
The website showed from what local farms they buy so I assume that all of the food is sourced locally and, if so, that scores big points with me. 
If I had any small criticism is that a few more beers and wines would be nice. Being unique and artsy/foodie is great but a couple of the staples like a nice Pilsner covers a larger demographic. 
All-in-all I loved the place. 
5-stars!"

We were seated in a nice booth in the corner but it was still quite noisy. The decor is nice - bar in the center, nice lighting and a projector playing an old movie on the wall which was cool.

The food was good. It wasn&#39;t something that I walked away from &#34;wowed&#34; but I enjoyed my meal. We started with mussels, bacon wrapped dates and duck fat fries. All were very good. They bring bread to the table too which was excellent. I was able to try some of both the beet salad and the wedge salad - both very tasty. For our meals, my guy and I got the Monkfish and the Duck Confit. Both enjoyable - and we cleaned our plates, but it simply wasn&#39;t FANTASTIC. It was good. My friends shared the Fried Chicken plate which they seemed to like.

All in all, we paid a lot of money - yes, we ordered a lot of food - but compared to other places we&#39;ve been where we could expect to pay the same, there are other places I&#39;d choose to go first. Don&#39;t get me wrong, though - I would happily go back to Satchel&#39;s and give it another shot...maybe in a different season if their menu rotates seasonally."

We were a little hesitant going in as some of the other reviews were only so-so but we were pleasantly surprised.

Satchel&#39;s is very cozy so be ready to get up close &amp; personal with your neighbors; however I do think it is part of its charm. If you&#39;re going for a super intimate, private dinner I would recommend looking elsewhere. Satchel&#39;s is a place where your chair might get bumped or your conversation may be overheard.

Now onto the important part - the food - so delish! We ordered the steak and fries and the fried chicken. I loved the steak and my husband loved the chicken - worked out perfectly. The steak was juicy and tender and the chicken was nice and crispy. My favorite dish of the night though were the dates - I am a sucker for good stuffed dates! Theirs were delish. 

The reason I gave Satchel&#39;s a 4 rather than a 5 is very similar to the other reviews - the service. Our apps came out almost immediately and then we waited almost 30mins for our entrees. I was shocked it took so long - it probably didn&#39;t help that we were both extremely hungry. Our server wasn&#39;t quite as stuck up as some of the other yelpers experience but he did not go out of his way to be overly friendly. Maybe it was just an off night - you never know.

I would definitely come back to Satchel&#39;s - its a great neighborhood joint and if I can get a reservation and not wait, why not."

The menu is small, but everything sounds (and looked) delicious. The appetizers are perfect to share for 2, and the entrees are the appropriate portions. Service and cocktails are the perfect welcome to an already cozy spot. While I was surprised to see a more expensive tab than I anticipated, I was happy to pay up knowing that the meals were fresh, hot, and made to order.

So therefore, it&#39;s really relaxing and refreshing here!

We took a seat then, with a moment, a staff came and welcomed us and asked our order. After, he told us that it would be delivered with the assuring particular time that it would arrived.
Truly, our dishes arrived, house salad with papaya and avocado (very savoring and appetizing), southern fried chicken, truffled Mac and Cheese, local sugar snap peas! All were just perfect and excellent. We couldn&#39;t ask for more because we already have the &#34;more&#34; we experienced!

Satchel&#39;s is tiny. Reservations are highly recommended. It&#39;s so cute though. It reminds me of a certain song, where the hi-fi was in the background, seriously they play the music on a record player including Sugar Hill Gang and Toots and The Maytals. The wine was in fact delicious! The dining room felt like it could easily be in anyone&#39;s house, complete with a chandelier, less the space hog of a bar right in the middle. It&#39;s a good thing the bar is there as since this was last minute, there were no available tables, so that&#39;s where we ended up sitting. As we perused the menus and venue, we took in a bit of the musicals projecting on the back wall.   
We started with a round of the pear and rum cocktail, which was very herbaceous and equally drinkable. As we tried to not down the cocktails, we looked over the succinct, yet delicious sounding menu. The house made pasta dish caught my eye with lamb ragout. Sadly, they were out of the pasta. When it came time to order, my husband and I got the burger with fried green tomato, Colorado chevre, and duck fat fries and my mom got the mussels.
Another round of drinks and then the food came. Our burgers were cooked perfectly, aka rare. The duck fat fries were the perfect combo of crisp and tender. I wish I were able to have more of them though my mom kept helping herself. I would have tried her mussels (shallots, piquillo peppers, garlic, chorizo, butter, white wine) but they too were gone quite quickly. She said they were delicious and has already asked when we can return.
We moved on to dessert and wine. There were only three options for dessert, so naturally we ordered them all. I got a glass of white burgundy (France), which I&#39;d never had before and was so crisp and drinkable. I&#39;d have to compare it to a pinot gris or chenin blanc. My husband got a glass of pinot noir from Oregon that was tasty.
The desserts were a bread pudding, beignets with chocolate sauce, and a pear tart. We were informed that two of the three were made to order so there would be a bit of wait. We are not a quick dinner group. The bread pudding was the clear winner, great flavors, very tender with just the right amount of sweetness. The beignets were rather lack luster sans sauce, which seems like a bit of cheat. They were just a bit flat. I think maybe some spice in the batter might have helped a bit, even if it was just some vanilla bean. Either the pear tart used pears that were not ripe or they were not cooked long enough. The pastry dough was a bit sad as well. It was in desperate need of browning and was a bit wet if not undercooked. The mixture the pears were in either needed a pinch of salt or a lot more sugar, likely both. 
All in all it was a very delicious dinner served in a very quaint space. A very welcome, neighborhood gem we can&#39;t wait to visit again."

I went around 5pm to beat what I thought would be a crowd, and had the place to myself (alongside a very nice woman at the bar with her child asking me if I were here to crash her party (wink-wink (that&#39;s her winking at me, not me winking at you, reader)).

The exposed brick is fantastic, and the place is basically just tables along the walls with the bar dominating the floor space.  I didn&#39;t mind the bar at all, though.  You go to a place like Humboldt&#39;s, and the bar ain&#39;t kept well at all; like, the curtain at Oz&#39;s palace was pulled back.  But they keep it classy here.

The cocktails are slammin&#39;, too.  I suggest the Long Walk.

And any meal with the polenta.

It picked up around 6:30-7, and a small joint can get loud.  Killer music playing alongside classic films projected on the wall.

Get at this joint."

It is a small place, so it can be a little loud. We sat at the bar while we waited for our table. I had a martini and my boyfriend had a Manhattan. The drinks were superb. They actually used the correct cherries in the Manhattan. Our waitress was Emily, and she was so polite, and suggestive. She rocked.  We started with the oxtail, it was so flavorful and moist. Then we had the Steak and the Duck. All I can say is that the Duck was out of this world. It was so tender and juicy, I could have ordered another. We will totally be back. There is so much more we would like to try here.  Make a reservation as they are a small place, but totally worth it."

Ate here the other night for the first time. Food was ok--not great--but ok. 

Ambience was quaint and comfortable.

But the service was rude, arrogant and downright snooty. Four of us sat at the bar and were treated to a bartender who made us feel decidedly unwelcome.

Look, I understand that bartenders today consider themselves to be fine artists of some sort. They are called mixologists, after all. But arrogance and indifference are totally unattractive, and reflect poorly in the entire restaurant.

I&#39;ve encountered a number of restaurants where the mixologists are friendly, inviting, helpful and at least pretend that they are glad to see you. I&#39;ll always go back to these places. Great service can trump a number of shortcomings. Unfortunately, Satchel&#39;s doesn&#39;t make the grade."

The place was tiny, quaint, and oozed vintage vibes with the turn table in the front being key!

The menu was small, but thoughtful.  My roommate and I shared two small plates to start:  Caesar Salad with white anchovies and Potato Gnocchi.  Both were excellent with unique flavors.  We then split the Braised Pork Osso Buco (big portion of meat) which was amazing as well!

Our bartender (Derek?) was super nice and took the time to get to know all of the guests at the bar.  The drink menu was great and they have an excellent selection of liquor to craft up anything.  He listened to our preferences and created some classic cocktails that were not only strong, but exactly what we wanted.

I&#39;ll definitely be going back to this joint and will be recommending it to my friends.  It&#39;s nice to have a local spot with friendly staff and great food!  It&#39;s unfortunate reading the bad reviews on here and I&#39;d encourage those who wrote them to give it one more shot."

Must be my Chinese root, I&#39;m used to perusing huge menus with pages after pages of selections so nobody in the restaurant is eating the same thing! With that said, Satchel&#39;s menu is very limited. Look over, at least one person at each table is having a burger (*eyes rolling*). But the place sure is cute with its tiny wooden tables and red, patio-like chairs, brick walls all around, and, you guessed it, very dimly lit. 

Bread came first and I appreciated that. My boyfriend didn&#39;t care for the extra layer of dusted flour but I liked it, especially like seeing the flour disappear as soon as you dip the bread slice in olive oil, lol. He had the Patron Burger with duck fat fries and I ordered Salmon on slaws. They split everything in half for us so we could share (thanks for our friendly waitress). I asked for the salmon medium-rare and it was exactly that! The burger was greasy but the portion of the patty was very generous. We enjoyed the fries very much as well."

We were greeted by African music (Zimbabwe frontline) which was a nice way to start a Sunday brunch. As I was seated I had a direct view into the bar and noticed that they had a decent selection of sipping rums, which is extremely hard to find in the U.S. Already I&#39;m in love with this place, but then, I noticed they have a large grill outside and they are roasting a full pig for the evening!  

We started with some New Orleans style beignets with a side of dulce de leche (Carmel sauce) for dipping. I must say I enjoyed these more than the authentic Cafe du Monde ones because they were smaller, but much denser. The dulce de leche just took it to another level!

We had the chicken and waffles and I must say it was an interesting take on the southern staple. It came with pieces of pear in the waffles. Although not  the best interpretation of this dish, it was good.

Great place to go for some cheese and wine and conversation.  Anything more than!  Every piece of food after the cheese plate is NOT worth the price of admission.  Lamb burger is only ok. (Highland Tap &amp; Burger is the only place in town to ever eat this.)  Steak and Frites were bland.

Our waiter knew nothing of the wine and did a horrible job pretending. (Tip: a rose&#39; can never be compared to &#34;the bold flavor of a barolo.&#34;  They are not even the same genre, server guy).  The bartender made a weak martini too.

It&#39;s not fun to point out the flaws of a dining experience. Most of use would rather write a glowing review about the delicious food we ate and the awesome service we received. This just was not the case with my last visit to Satchel&#39;s.

My friend and I decided to go for brunch on a Sunday morning. We did not have a reservation but noticed only 3 tables occupied so we went in. The host said that all the other tables were reserved, which was strange, and so we sat at the bar and ordered lattes. The lattes were good (bartender was great), I must admit. About 20 minutes later the host came over and offered us a table since, I guess, several reservations were canceled (and it seemed silly that 12 tables were still open and we had to sit at the bar for so long). Great. We were happy and ready to order. 

I got the crab cake Benedict (ordered hollandaise on the side) and my friend ordered the arugula salad with pear, apples and goat cheese. After a while the restaurant started to fill up and our order came about 30 minutes later. Hollandaise was all over my benedict. The chef, who brought it to our table told me the server never said hollandaise on the side and then he abruptly left. The server returned and offered to do it over but I didn&#39;t want to wait any longer, especially after more people had just ordered their food and it would take a while. 

My friend began to eat her salad and then noticed that there was no arugula. It was all mixed baby greens. We asked the server and she said, &#34;Oh, we ran out of arugula. Don&#39;t you like mixed greens?! Sorry, I noticed that right before they served it to you.&#34; I was thinking, &#34;Are you crazy? Do I order a steak and then you serve me lamb without telling me because you ran out?&#34; Aren&#39;t you supposed to inform the customer of a menu item change before they order not just serve them what&#39;s available in the kitchen?!  

The kicker was before our server brought the bill she asked if we were using the Living Social deal, because a lot of people that day were using it. We were not, I replied. At this point I thought, well since we are full paying customers she might comp us the salad or give us a discount for all the blunders. Nope. Check came in at the full amount. Never again, Satchel&#39;s, never again."

This place is that good.

My wife and I visited Satchel&#39;s on back to back days last August. We enjoyed dinner so much the first night, we came back for a tasting menu dinner the following night, with our &#34;adult kids&#34;.

Their selection of wines is interesting, off the beaten path, relatively inexpensive, and fantastic. To be honest, I enjoyed their wines so much I don&#39;t have my usual photographic memory of each meal, nor the names of the wonderful people we met.

The owner finds the wines, and named the restaurant for his younger son. Our waitress, a tall, congenial, blonde lady, was a terrific server. She was hospitable and informative. The busboy came out to our car with an umbrella, because we arrived in a downpour, and escorted us into the restaurant.

At the end of the tasting dinner, we met the chef. We had thrown him a curve ball: we arrived with a bag of freshly harvested Matsutake mushrooms, hand picked in the pine forests of Northern Colorado and Wyoming. We asked him to incorporate these amazing mushrooms, sometimes costing as much as $1,000 a pound, into his tasting menu.

Some chefs would have thrown us out of the restaurant for our presumption. Others would have simply said &#34;no&#34;. This young man said &#34;sure&#34;.

He did a phenomenal job.

I cook, casually. If a dinner guest showed up at my house and gave me a surprise ingredient to be used immediately, I would be at a loss. This meal was terrific, and the pungent, meaty mushrooms were a wonderful complement to the chef&#39;s dishes.

I have been slow to write this review, but my enthusiasm for this small, unpretentious and wonderful restaurant continues undiminished.

Visit Satchel&#39;s on 6th. You&#39;ll enjoy the time you spend there."

It&#39;s a tiny place and we couldn&#39;t get a reservation, but sat at the bar, which was fine.  Overall, loved the ambience, the staff and the food.  It&#39;s a bit pricey for what you get, so that&#39;s the only reason I don&#39;t give it five stars.  

Food- The small plates really are small, so be prepared to order a few.  My husband got the mushroom burger and was blown away... it&#39;s fantastic.  I had the lobster sandwich, which was good.. wasn&#39;t blown away though.  

Apps- Had the fried green tomatoes and fingerling potatoes.  Both very good, but again pretty small.  

Drinks- Loved the tea-infused gin martini!"

My boyfriend and I dined here on Valentine&#39;s day and truly enjoyed ourselves. Yes, it&#39;s a bit dark inside, but we had no issues with the music volume, speed of service, or closeness of tables that other reviewers complained about. My boyfriend enjoyed his mezcal cocktail and pork entree (can&#39;t recall if it was a shank or some other cut), while I was a fan of my glass of bordeux and seafood pasta. We certainly plan to come back one night when they have live music!"

Andrew, the owner, was behind the bar answering all our questions about the myriad of wines available. Normally I&#39;m a red-only girl, but sometimes in the summer I&#39;ll seek out something cold, crisp and of the pinot grigio variety. Andrew recommended a great glass that I thoroughly enjoyed - a few times!

Apps started with the fried green tomato with pork belly - SO glad I chose it. The combination of flavors and textures was spot on. Two in our group got the grilled squid salad, which was exceptionally tasty too. The only thing I didn&#39;t sample was the tempura crab, but word around the table was it was delicious.
My entrée was pork loin with white wine poached apricots, grilled leeks, English pea puree and herbed spaetzle with pork belly. I think I found what heaven tastes like. I also sampled the duck, lobster tagliatelle and the flat iron steak. I think I was the clear winner, but the duck and lobster were not far behind.

Topped it all off with some wonderful coffee and desserts - a strawberry shortcake and a chocolate concoction that was the perfect sweet ending to a great night.
Satchel&#39;s has such a local neighborhood feel - with a great owner and a friendly and knowledgeable staff. I&#39;ll be back guys!"

But this is a place to pay attention to! 

When trying a new place out I will over order to the point of explosion, but death has never tasted so good.  Pork belly on fried green tomatoes, Arugula salad and Soft shell crab tempura and a Colorado beer of choice to start.  Carefully crafted flavors that just refresh your pallet from some boring dish you might have had at some other joint here in Denver.  I might need a few more beers to get through all of these plates.  Nevertheless, the Duck is on its way and it made my day (night really).  This was a delightful choice.  There is something about duck that just can make a night and this dish was it.  I loved the little mushrooms in the dish, place as if they were there to celebrate this sacrificial duck breast.  All the dishes were cooked to perfection and I was stuffed on great tasting food and great Colorado beer.  

Yes, the patio can be loud with passing cars but inside is perfect.  It is a great place to take a 1st date that would be off the beating path or your millionth date with the one you love.  Even if you would like to take an employee for his last meal before you fire him to soften the blow.  (that would suck actually)"

I felt uncomfortable walking into a restaurant, but this place seemed to have a relaxed atmosphere so in I went. The server grabbed me a glass of water right away without question and one of the bartenders engaged in small talk while I pounded my drink.

We had reservations, and had to wait quite awhile for our table (or even a drink at the bar), but I brushed it off, knowing they were busy. However, the meal ended up taking HOURS, with 90% of that being wait time for meals. We ordered within a few minutes of being seated, but the food took forever, even just for a plate of cheese. The restaurant had all but cleared out and we were still waiting for entrees. My dessert, which was just a scoop of sorbet, took the longest. I thought it was ridiculous of them to add a &#34;small surcharge&#34; (aka $5-6) on all but two entrees on the menu.

The worst part was the bill. I chatted with the waiter, settled my bill with him, and when I got up to pay, the bartender/manager refused to let me pay my bill. They have us an extra ticket with an extra $30 meal, insisted we couldn&#39;t figure out our meals, that we must have moved around our table (we didn&#39;t), or that the two people who paid a few minutes earlier hadn&#39;t paid for their meals (they had, the receipts were on the table). After we showed them their mistake, they still refused to let us pay our bills, making us sit there until 10:30 because they wouldn&#39;t acknowledge their own error. I didn&#39;t even eat the meal on the extra ticket (I had lamb, this was chicken)and they STILL wouldn&#39;t let me pay and leave. The bartender was extremely rude, condescending, and arrogant. 

I also think the drinks are extremely overpriced ($6 for Great Divide beer?!). I won&#39;t be returning to this place again, I haven&#39;t had such terrible service in a long time."

Maybe it&#39;s because, as someone that lives near Satchel&#39;s, you should know that  most places here suck if you aren&#39;t in the mood for bar food. Or rats (Pho on 6th). And maybe you don&#39;t want to wait three weeks (Fruition).

It really is amateur hour on my damn street, so when I get good service in a restaurant that wasn&#39;t designed in the 90&#39;s by a soccer mom in Colorado Springs I&#39;m pretty much in. 

The lobster BLT was not as amazing as it sounded, granted- but the fries were good, the beer and wine list was more than adequate, and I haven&#39;t even tried their brunch yet but I&#39;m hungry just thinking about it. 

Satchel&#39;s reminded me of one of my favorite bars in east LA, The York, and i&#39;ll definitely be back."

I&#39;ve been here for dinner three times. I live very close by so it&#39;s a fun pick because we can walk there. I&#39;d describe this place as having a more slow, romantic, European vibe... Sorry for the run on of adjectives but it&#39;s just that way. It has a great ambiance and they always have great music. Yes, it&#39;s dark but it&#39;s an intimate candle lit dinner sorta joint. 
I also enjoyed their food! Example: I am from Georgia and I their fried green tomatoes totally passed my test. They lightly coated them with polenta (creative break from tradition) and executed the proper breading-to-tomato ratio flawlessly... On top was delicious goat cheese (pretty sure it&#39;s locally sourced too) and a raspberry sauce. Delicious - it&#39;s was a soulful dish with twist. 
I have actually found their staff to be knowledgeable about their wines... okay one time our waitress didn&#39;t know about them but she was very open about that fact and got us a more knowledgeable source to help us pick out our wine... OH and he let us try two of them free of charge! 
So I guess what I am trying to say is don&#39;t go with the expectation that the server is going to ask you every five minutes if you&#39;re okay. It&#39;s purposefully a slower place. The staff is very friendly but they let you take your time and enjoy your meal. It&#39;s a great spot for a good conversation with your significant other or with friends..."

I had a friend in high school who definitively had everything going for her. Because her parents were professionals, one a partner at a law firm, the other a neurosurgeon, she enjoyed a wealthy, privileged, stable childhood. She was destined for Harvard or Yale; her parents could totally afford it and she started practicing for the SAT when she was 13. Ultimately, her insane coke habit blew it for her (no pun intended); she ended up barely graduating high school, her parents cut her off, and her trust fund will be depleted soon. 

Satchel&#39;s on 6th is like my former friend. It has everything going for it: tried and true location and great ambiance. However, it flushes what it does have down the toilet with its poor service, mediocre (at best) food, and its uncanny ability to have nothing on the menu actually in stock.

My bf and I along with my bf&#39;s friend arrived on a recent Saturday evening on time for our 7:30pm reservation. Our table wasn&#39;t initially available, so we decided to have a glass of wine at the bar to pass the time. NEARLY AN HOUR LATER, we were seated (so much for putting in for a reservation.) Instead of wholeheartedly apologizing, like any good maître d&#39; should do, the maître d&#39; became demonstrably defensive and preemptively gave us an order of fries to &#34;make everything better&#34; when neither me nor my bf nor his friend even wanted the order in the first place.

By the time the waiter finally came to the table (we&#39;d been waiting an hour to sit down; what&#39;s another 10 minutes) apparently EVERYTHING on the menu had run out. Steak frite? Out. Lobster BLT? Out. The only thing I wanted to eat ( I mean who doesn&#39;t like a lobster BLT) was out for the evening (who runs out of their menu items? Seriously.) So we ultimately settled on a watery, ostensibly inedible grilled Ceasar salad, a cobbled together Tartine sandwich and some blasé blah brussels sprouts. 

Their menu online (which mind you does not match their actual menu in house) looked great. However, looks entirely can be deceiving. To top it off, like pouring salt on an open wound, the terrible evening ended with receiving the completely outrageous $125 check for three subpar appetizers, an entree, a few drinks, and a salad. And we left hungry. Vomit.

Will never come back to this sorry excuse of a restaurant again."

Too dark and noisy.  My dinner mates couldn&#39;t even see the menu, and had to use the flashlight on her iphone.  In addition, we could barely hear each other talk, with the excessively loud music.  It was a horrible ambience.

There is nothing special about the menu.  Bland flavors, overpriced items.  I can&#39;t believe how much we spend there for mediocre food.  The staff seemed snobby and extremely unfriendly, like they couldn&#39;t be bothered.

When we entered at brunchtime (my companion chose the restaurant), the women in charge of the place were blasting music at way too high of a volume. Unprofessional. 

Nobody had any uniform or even basic apron on, so we couldn&#39;t tell who worked there. Unprofessional. 

The employees seemed to be intermixed with the customers, and were apparently drinking mimosas (ON THE JOB, though I could have misperceived it), and we felt like we had just walked into a private bachelorette party. We stood in the doorway for a bit, ignored. I was thinking, &#34;Oh, sorry we&#39;re such a burden to you, walking into your annoying hipster restaurant to GIVE YOU OUR MONEY.&#34; Unprofessional.

One employee was wearing skin-tight, multicolored tights with nothing over them. Come ON! Tights are not pants, genius. Dress for work. I do, and you can too! I&#39;ll show you how! Here&#39;s how you dress as a waitperson: Wear black pants and a black, button-up shirt and a black apron and black shoes with black socks. Really tricky, I know. You&#39;re welcome. Unprofessional.

Our waitress was just really weird. She seemed like she was on drugs of some sort. Between helping customers, she&#39;d sit at the back on a booth seat and text message (NOT COOL) while putting her feet on the seat (I bet I was sitting on whatever her shoes walked in, since she probably did that on every seat in the restaurant. Gross, man.) Later, she got what appreared to be a beer and walked outside to drink it. Unprofessional (and illegal). It&#39;s like they were trying to say &#34;We&#39;re wild here at Satchel&#39;s, man! We party at all hours, on the job, off the job, anywhere! We&#39;re wild!&#34; Seriously. You&#39;re grown adults. Act like it. A partier older than 25 is just pathetic.

My burger was super expensive ($14! STOP THE MADNESS!), the meat was pretty bland, and I got LITERALLY a tablespoon of ketchup with it in a microdish, for the burger and fries. Are they trying to &#34;go green&#34; by depriving customers of enough ketchup for their food? Lame. How about this?: I PAID FOR IT, SO GIVE IT TO ME. The burger was fine overall, and had good toppings, but NOT worth the money. If you&#39;re going to charge me a ton of money for a burger, it better be the best freakin&#39; burger on earth.

My friend&#39;s salad with chicken was small, expensive ($14!) and didn&#39;t come with anchovies as described.

My other companion&#39;s omelette was dryish and brought out by a child who works in the back. Why do they employ teenagers? The girl was nice enough, but again, no uniform. It was like being served at someone&#39;s house, and not in a good way. 

Everything seemed pretty chaotic, haphazard, and again, unprofessional, like they were &#34;playing restaurant.&#34; It&#39;s their legal right. Sure. But I won&#39;t be back. That&#39;s also my right.

We finished with an order of beignets. Seriously, just go to BJ&#39;s (Gasp! A chain! (Which is both successful and employs a huge number of people directly and indirectly...I guess we should hate them! Why?) and get the best beignets in America. Satchel&#39;s beignets were like super boring, oily sopapillas. Nobody else wanted them, so I ate nearly all of them, not wanting to waste food. But we&#39;re supposed to say that everything indie is superior to everything mainstream, right? BS.

When hype and image surpass substance, you get restaurants like Satchel&#39;s. They should call these places &#34;Hypestaurants.&#34; This is why mainstream, much-maligned chain restaurants thrive (and rightly so!): They deliver what people WANT. But the cool thing now, apparently, is to hate success in most of its forms, so people flock to goofy eateries like Satchel&#39;s so they can support &#34;local businesses&#34; that can barely function and which can&#39;t survive without hipsters&#39; hatred of the mainstream successes to keep them afloat."

Okay, I&#39;ll be the first to admit that my posterior is larger than most posteriors, but sitting in the chair at Satchel&#39;s was PAINFUL. As soon as I sat down I felt mortified and wanted to leave. Both of my dining companions agreed that the chairs were awful. I&#39;ve never experienced this at a restaurant! Don&#39;t you want your patrons to be comfortable and NOT rush out the door???

So we delved into the menu... Apparently they got a new chef a few weeks after posting their restaurant week menu online, and several things had changed. The menu item that my friend was looking forward to was no longer there, and there wasn&#39;t an appetizer that her hubby could enjoy. I also tried to order a glass of wine to help numb the pain in my hips, but the three times the waitress came to our table before I was able to order, she paid absolutely no attention to the fact that I had my ID out at the ready and was trying to ask her for wine! 

After we finally ordered, everything took FOREVER. I have never waited 20 minutes between dinner plates being cleared to be served dessert. And when you&#39;re in as much pain as I was sitting there, you want to get out of there as quickly as possible. 

The only reason there are two stars on this review are because they accommodated my friend&#39;s husband pleasantly, and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the braised short ribs and they were AMAZING. The portions just left something to be desired. 

After having such a frustrating and not to mention humiliating experience at this restaurant, I will never be back. It&#39;s going to be hard not to wince in pain simply driving by."

The place was almost empty.  Have been here before a few times and it is usually a fun, busy neighborhood place with interesting food.

This time, not so much.  Appetizers were okay, one a tomato and Burrata cheese salad and the other was fried green tomatoes.  My partner&#39;s entree steak was okay.  I ordered clams for the main course, and prior to delivery I was given a steak knife and a dinner fork.  The clams came, and there were only a few and they were small.  I still had no seafood fork or spoon.  The menu described an enticing broth, but that was not possible to eat with a fork and steak knife, nor was the diced chorizo.  I could have used bread to soak up the broth, but nope.  None.

When the busgirl picked up the dishes, I explained that I couldn&#39;t finish because I didn&#39;t have utensils.  She was flustered and cleared the table.  When next we saw the waiter, I said, &#34;I want to talk about my dinner.&#34;  He said, &#34;I heard.  It was a miscommunication.&#34;  And left.  

We both had a peach tart-like dessert.  It consisted of a lot of pie crust and a suggestion of peach, but did have a delicious ice cream on top.

When he brought the check, the waiter said, &#34;I took a little bit off to make up for our miscommunication.&#34;  He took $10 off.

This is not the standard of service or quality we&#39;ve received here before.  It will be a while before we try again."

They have a new-ish chef (new to Satchel&#39;s but obviously not new to a kitchen) who has some amazingly creative dishes.  The Fried green tomato and pork belly appetizer is a must to start with.  As far as entree&#39;s go - they are all really great and the menu changes with season/month.  This is why I have to go back so often!!!   

I don&#39;t know much about wine, I really just know what I like and that&#39;s good enough for me.  But, if you want more information, they are more than happy to direct you to a glass that will compliment your meal.  There are many choices that are well priced too.  

You really can&#39;t miss with this great little restaurant.  It&#39;s impressive as a date night, and friendly enough as a neighborhood hang out.

Restaurant Week menus are almost always limited offerings of the main menu, but generally offer great choices at a restaurant you might not otherwise visit.  Satchel&#39;s posted menu on the DRW website looked great-- 5 courses with nice offerings and a great opportunity. But we arrived this evening to a menu vastly different than the posted one. 

Our waitress meekly replied to my boyfriend&#39;s question regarding the menu change that it &#39;read as 5 courses&#39; but was really 3. No wonder they booked up immediately-  too good to be true. That&#39;s the truth.  

The food was fine-- nothing special or out of this world. The burger was underseasoned and evidently a preformed (frozen?) patty. My pasta was good but drowning in sauce. Portions were exceedingly small and the desserts were not unique. Mousse cake was obviously preciously-frozen. 

Overall it was quite a disappointing start to Denver Restaurant Week. Here&#39;s hoping we get $52.80 (really $74) worth next week elsewhere!!"

Great atmosphere, community style seating, overall great appeal.

Service was very &#39;meh&#39;. We went about 30 mins after opening and there was one server and only 2 tables, my guest and I and another table of 2. We had to get our waiter&#39;s attention multiple times to get refills. I have a feud with places that give you a shot glass of water. Obviously people are going to finish it in two drinks so get bigger glasses so you don&#39;t have to be bothered as much.

The service is what made this 3 stars. The food was excellent. Mimosas were fresh, get your choice of champagne. I had the breakfast burger (Yea, I&#39;m the type that can eat a cheeseburger at 930 in the morning), cooked perfectly, great toppings, duck fat fries were pretty good. My sister had eggs Benedict and it was delicious as well. Again, food took a lil longer than I thought considering there were only two tables, but it was close to opening so it was forgivable. 

Tab was what I expected, but well worth it. Definitely going back to give it another shot."

We did not have a reservation however there was a table open.  However we, a 91 year old woman, a 76 year old woman and myself were offered seats at the bar.  When we asked about the table, we were told it wasn&#39;t available however, a party of 5 that arrived after us, also without a reservation were then seated at the table.  I have spent hundreds of dollars at this restaurant in the past but will not return.  Whether it was age discrimination or the fact that they felt they could make more from the party of 5, I don&#39;t know.

Our server was nice and was knowledgeable about the food and wine on the menu.  The one time she didn&#39;t know, she was smart enough to tell us that and then she went and asked someone.  When the bottle of sparkling wine that we ordered wasn&#39;t available, they brought us something at least twice as expensive and only charged us for the original bottle.  That&#39;s a sign of good service.

All four of us started with the soup du jour, which on this night was Curried Carrot Soup.  We also shared the brussel sprout appetizer, which while good was a little small. 
For entrees, two of us had the short ribs, one had the butternut squash risotto topped with shrimp and one had the scallops.  I agree with previous reviewers that the portions were on the small side and the shrimp that came on the risotto were embarrassingly small.
It took an inordinate amount of time for us to get our appetizers (it&#39;s soup, don&#39;t they just pull it out of the pot?) but that is my only service complaint.

I was a little surprised that they only had two options for dessert.  We did get the chocolate decadence to share and it was quite tasty.

All in all - OK to really good.  Not the best place I&#39;ve been but FAR from the worst."

retuned recently to see how the place is doing.  it was very slow for a Thursday night.  perhaps the screaming kids running around have something to do with that.  the food is still pretty good and the wines are very nice."

Satchel&#39;s was added to our list as one of just a couple of restaurants that we hadn&#39;t been to.  The food was excellent.  The panko crusted risotto with truffle aioli was crazy good.  Our entrees and dessert were good as well.  My knock is on the service and there were several occurrences that made me think, &#34;this is not worthy of a $23 per plate restaurant.&#34;  While many are minor, they add up.

Issues:

- Nowhere to hang your coat, and the chairs in the dining room are not coat-hang-friendly chairs due to their shape.
- No small plates to accompany the bread that was on the table when we sat down.  We had to ask for them.
- Our waitress didn&#39;t mention that she wanted us to order everything at once, so when we ordered appetizers she then asked for our entree orders as if we knew that we were supposed to have been prepared for that.
- Water glasses were allowed to drain several times throughout the meal.
- This was greedy on our part, but our group of four wanted to split the 1st course offerings so we asked if they could ladle a bowl&#39;s worth of soup into some ramekins so we weren&#39;t all spooning from one bowl.  Another restaurant in town split the soup for us without being asked to earlier in the week. Our waitress said on a regular night she would ask but since it was restaurant week she didn&#39;t want to make that request of the kitchen.  Fair enough, but more about self-preservation than not being able to get it done.  
- Uneven wine pours.
- Shortly after the check was signed and we were finishing up, we were offered glasses of wine if we would move to the bar.  AKA, we need your table so could you leave or move to the bar.  We were done drinking for the night so wine was not in the cards.  Nice of them to offer but the premise was rude and it was a bad last impression.

As I mentioned, nothing egregious in it&#39;s own right but when you add up all of the drawbacks, it made for a sub-par experience on the service side of things.  Our waitress was perfectly nice, just not very good at her job.

Overall, I would try it again based on the merit of the food being excellent but I would temper my expectations if you are used to a high standard of service when eating at an &#34;upscale&#34; restaurant."
satchels-on-6th-denver,Doug H.,x4oWeIl2HdTtALEq4y0raA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,53,498,BfhbAoXSTqLT_cwAx1JkhQ,3.0,2011-09-12,"I&#39;m not sure that Satchel&#39;s has decided what it wants to be, a wine bar with savory accompaniments or a fine dining restaurant.  This confusion is exemplified by their chairs.  The chairs are informal, modern, slant-backed chairs, sort of like fancy outdoor furniture.  What do you want me to do in these chairs?--lay back like I&#39;m taking in a waterfront sunset?  They&#39;re certainly not comfortable enough to have a leisurely, upright restaurant meal.  The result is sadly a winebar/restaurant that is successful as neither. 

As a wine bar, the selection of wines was good, but limited.  The bar is the centerpiece of their space, and you could fit a nice group around the center island.  I could see sipping on a nice cabernet at the bar after a movie at the Esquire.  I thought the wine prices were very high; there was nothing lower than $8 a glass on the night that we were there.  

As a restuarant, that&#39;s where Satchel&#39;s runs into real problems.  Its dishes are too small to be full entrees while too large to be mezze or appetizers.   The U12 scallops, which I ordered. were delicious; two fat scallops nicely seared over a delicious creamed corn risotto.   The bacon bits on top of the scallop were a nice salty, crunchy complement to the soft white mollusk interior.  But it was two scallops--not quite a full meal, really.   The steak entree with duck fat fries, again, was done well, the steak had a nice char on it, and was done a perfect medium rare, but it was half of a rib eye, around 6 ounces.  The duck fat fries were disappointingly bland; I couldn&#39;t taste the duck at all, and they could have used some salt.  Duck fat fries usually are much more crispy; that&#39;s when you really can taste the richness of the duck fat.   For dessert, we had peaches &#39;n cream, half of a grilled peach and a scoop of ice cream--$7?!    With the portions and pricing as it is, everything seems  overpriced for what you get.  The menu is very limited, about six entrees, two salads, and four appetizers, so  they are reallly going to have trouble satisfying everyone as a small eats place.          

Service was OK, friendly servers, although one of the waiters abuptly walked away upon assuming that we weren&#39;t ordering drinks when in fact one of us had a question about the wine list.  

All in all, a nice local, neighborhood restaurant that prices itself out of its own category. Satchel, let me know what you want to be when you grow up, and I&#39;ll be back."

We picked this place out weeks ago and made reservations after I viewed an impressive and exciting menu. The moment we were sat, things started to go all wrong. The menu that was posted on the rastaurant week menu was changed because the old chef left and the new chef wanted to be adventurous. Big mistake! My husband is a rather picky eater. He turns his nose up at Emeril Lagasse. That being said, the new menu left much to be desired for him and sadly for me too. I had been dreaming of butternut squash lasagne for weeks! Now the reason this place is getting 3 stars and not 2 is because the manager came out and offered to have the chef prepare something special for my husband. Thank you! 

I had: the beet salad, butternut squash risotto, brownie sundae. The beat salad while tasty, was so tiny it was as if it was a scrap of someone&#39;s real salad. The risotto was flavorful, but it was runny and the rice was not cooked through. The shrimp were overcooked and so small they could have come from a sizzler. The dessert was decent, but not housemade I presume. I made higher quality ice cream in plated dessert class at Johnson &amp; Wales. The brownie was rich, but nothing special.

Husband had: chef special grilled cheese on brioche, chefs special sauteed chicken over mashed yukon golds, ricotta mousse. His grilled cheese while nicely sized, was burnt. His meat was bland and boring. The dessert was tasty... all 2 bites!

Friend had: seared scallop(s), braised short rib(s), ricotta mousse. I used the plurals in () because they are listed in plural on the menu, but you are served a single scallop and single short rib. She enjoyed her scallop and I tasted her rib which was delicious. 

The waitress was decent, minus the eleventy times she came to our table to tak our food order, but not our drink order, even though my friend had her ID out the entire time. it took 20 minutes in between courses and These &#34;courses&#34; we&#39;re so small we needed no longer than 5 minutes in between! Overall the experience, the portion and some of the food really made my restaurant week experience a downer. We shoulda gone to Euclid Hall or Shells &amp; Sauce...

P.s. should you still decide to get food here after all this, take it to-go, unless your built like kate moss, because those chairs are so narrow and god awful!"

Of course we showed up on a Saturday night with no reservation (duh), but were seated at the bar right away.  This is not an issue for the three of us, and the place was small and busy but it didn&#39;t feel congested at all. 

We were quickly greeted by the lovely Jessica, which was a great surprise since I know her from Platte St.  We are not wine snobs and had no problem settling on a crisp light bottle of cava, it was exactly what we wanted.

For dinner Jenny and I had both had a filet with duck fat fries, need I say more?  We both loved our dinner.  Dakota had the pork, and the star of that plate may have been the siracha risotto, but everything was delicious.  Since we all ordered from the large plate menu we were pleased with the size of our meals, and we did not leave hungry.  We had some dessert and polished off our bottle.  I will say that the carrot cake, red velvet, and bread pudding were mediocre, but it didn&#39;t stop us from eating it all up!  We will certainly be returning soon.

Jessica was awesome because she is a total rockstar, but so was every other person working.  We chatted with several employees as they were in and out from behind the bar. It was nice to find a great little spot where parking seemed to be in abundance.  The atmosphere was fun and comfortable.  The only small draw back may have been the funky movie that projecting on the wall!   I don&#39;t have anything against people bathing in the Ganges, but I don&#39;t really want to see it when I am eating. Truth be told we got a good laugh from it, but it might not be for everyone."

When we got there the menu was completely different. I am aware the menu is subject to change but this borders on bait and switch. Especially since they called to confirm our reservation and never mentioned a change. Going from a five course to a three course is more than a change. I started with the short rib which was quite good. My entree was the satchels burger. On my burger scale of 1-100, I give it a 72. Nothing made this burger warrant its price. The meat was nothing special, burger lacked flavor and originality. The duck fat fries were not crisp and lacked flavor. The chocolate mousse cake was delicious. The only thing is the cake is made at a local bakery. I would compare Satchels to Tables. With Tables being far and above Satchels. If you want disappointment and a bait and switch then Satchels is for you."

Chef Jarod Brant, formerly with Mizuna and Bones among others, is serving up some seriously delicious food all in a cozy neighborhood place.  

The idea is smaller plates, but not so small that you would consider them a tapas restaurant.  The restaurant is fairly small but tables are not on top of one another.  It is lacking in some visual interest - there&#39;s nothing on the walls at all, but somehow it doesn&#39;t stop this place from feeling warm.   But the additional of something to look at couldn&#39;t hurt.  Then again, who cares when they serve food this good!

We started with the asparagus salad.  It was superb.  Asparagus, home-made ricotta, shredded ham, and a poached egg sitting on top. Wonderful.   

Next we had the mussels served with house made ciabatta bread.  The mussels were moist and tender and we used every bit of the rather generous portion of bread to soak up the wonderful broth.  

My &#34;main course&#34; was the fava bean ravioli.  It was served with pea shoots and finished with tarragon oil.   The flavors really blended well - I only wished there were more ravioli on the plate!  My husband had the steak and calamari for his &#34;main course&#34;.  It was served with a bright chimichurri sauce.  

One of the things that really impressed me was the friendliness of the staff and the way they worked together.  We had a dedicated server but everyone seemed to pitch in to make our experience a good one.  

In short I&#39;m thrilled that Satchel&#39;s on 6th is in my neighborhood.  Though if it weren&#39;t, I would certainly travel to dine there!"

Not so good -- they re-define portion size of &#34;small plates&#34; - the gouda cheese plate had 3 nickel sized triangles of cheese, a half a dozen almonds and dried cherries . . . that&#39;s it. Also the food quality was sub-par at best. Soggy, bland fried green tomatoes and goat cheese on everything! The vegetarian galette was like a rock with huge chunks of bland zucchini. Anyway, I received a &#39;push&#39; from living social which was for 50% off at Satchel&#39;s off 6th. After receiving a 20% coupon reducing the price further, I decided to buy a voucher and give it another try --- HUGE mistake!

So we went there at 130pm on Sat. The place had only 2 other diners, one set of which left shortly after we arrived. Our server was the bartender and there was a blonde woman cleaning the wine glasses (I think she&#39;s either the manager or the wife/owner) -- anyway, we ordered our food and patiently waited. About 15 min. later, I noticed the other table receive their food -- so it appeared the kitchen was slow. About 25 minutes after we ordered, a hamburger plate came out. I thought it was part of our order, however, it was set on the bar (later I learned, for the restaurant manager/owner) -- and we still waited. So finally, after 30 minutes of waiting, and an employee receiving her meal before we did, I inquired about our meal (which was just a hamburger and a chicken club sandwich). The bartender/server left the front and went into the kitchen. The blonde manager/owner, after overhearing, also went into the kitchen. A few minutes later, they both came back out to the front and instead of letting us know what happened or when our food would be ready, the bartender/server went to the computer for a while then disappeared again. The manager/owner, also didn&#39;t speak with us, but instead sat down at the bar and started eating her hamburger! REALLY! UNBELIEVABLE! Well, that was the last straw. How arrogant and selfish! 

Not caring that their customers wasted 30 minutes waiting for their food -- when literally no one was in the restaurant, was the least of their concerns. Not even having the common courtesy of speaking with their customers who were waiting for an answer, was the least of their concerns . . . BUT her sitting down to start shoving a hamburger into her pie-hole -- that was the priority! My jaw hit the floor. After seeing that unbelievable display and utter lack of customer consideration and care, we got up and left. She finally came out as we were getting into our car. I told her that her arrogance and unbelievable lack of customer service truly reflected the entire establishment and permeated throughout the whole restaurant. Not once did anyone attempt to explain to us why we waited and waited . . . and her response of indifference and &#34;whatever&#34; attitude just solidified everything we observed. I called living social, who was horrified about our experience, graciously refunded our living social voucher. I also contacted open table about our experience as well -- and of course my fellow yelpers need to know about this as well.

I am all in favor of small restauranteur&#39;s who have a dream -- and love it when they make it a great success. This place, however, is eerily reminiscent of other small restaurants (some who had great food, unlike Satchel&#39;s) who let their inability to treat their customers well, spell ominous fortunes own the road. Shazz Cafe and Holly Hartnett&#39;s Venue Bistro both in north Denver come to mind. Those of who dined there know exactly what I mean ;). Venue offered tons of Living Social, Travel Zoo, etc. discounts just months before abruptly closing . . . just saying"

I headed to Satchel&#39;s on 6th for a birthday dinner with one of my girl friends. We went in on a Wednesday evening and had made reservations a head of time. The place is small, and it was crowded but not loud, a great atmosphere for a little neighborhood place. 
Our waiter was great with recommendations, from food suggestions to wine, which I always like at a new place. We decided to share and settled on a few small plates (fried goat cheese and crab cakes), a salad, and scallops. All the food was amazing. The highlight of the meai might have been the butternut squash risotto which came with the scallops but can be served on its own. It was the perfect creamy texture, warm and melt in your mouth delicious. We finished the meal feeling full but not stuffed, a good way to feel.

The wine was reasonably priced, the quality of our meals was impeccable, and service was excellent.  This place has a great vibe, we will return often!

My boyfriend got a crab cake benedict that made him very happy.  Our mimosas were nice, and we liked that there was fruit on the side of our meals.  We were extra jazzed on the old school hip hop on the stereo and the unexpectedly great vibes of the restaurant.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back."

What I look for is a casual, friendly atmosphere with great food.  Some other well known restaurants have stuffy, overly formal feel.  Satchel&#39;s is friendly and personal.  As far as the food, I really like the small plate options: the bone marrow is fantastic!  The asparagus  with shaved ham and egg was great too.  I already knew Andrew, the owner, who is always there with a warm welcome, and we met the chef: Jared Brant, who was really friendly and happy to chat about food.  I will definitely be coming back!

I can&#39;t forget the wine - Chad, the wine distributor working with Andrew has introduced us to some really spectacular wines.  I am no wine expert, I really loved what he recommended."

My wife and I had a lovely dinner, sharing a pork belly starter in which the meat was crisp and moist, and its texture perfectly complemented the fried green tomato cake underneath.    She had the hanger steak, I tasted a piece and it was marinated perfected, surrounded by sweet tomatoes which she didn&#39;t let me sample since they were so tasty.    My duck breast was flavorful, with lots of crispy thick skin, and complimented by pan roasted potatoes, small mushrooms and watercress- you could still taste the caramelized &#34;fire&#34; in the dish.

We were very impressed by this neighborhood restaurant, by the hospitality of the staff, and congratulate it for having past its first year anniversary, and we wish it many more."

The aroma in the air was wonderful.  The atmosphere reminded me so much of NYC.  The restaurant is small.  The decor is minimal.  The bright red chairs popped.  And the best part was, we didn&#39;t even intend to go here. We were hungry, thirsty, and it was getting late.  We just got in our Jeep and headed out, destination unknown.  With help from the Yelp app, we decided to check out this new establishment.  What a wonderful discovery.

We sat down at the bar and were welcomed immedialty. We browsed over the drink menu, I went with Proseco, which was delish, and the hubs had a beer.  There is a large selection of wines and bubblies, I don&#39;t recall any liquor or premium cocktails.  The owner chatted it up with us, and went over the menu. It didn&#39;t take me long to decide on soft shell crab and the hubs chose the pork chop.  The plates were quickly brought out to us, and we dug in.  The crab was great, cooked perfectly over top potato blintizies and drizzled with a rich, creamy sauce.  This dish was paired with a light heirloom tomato and micro-green salad.  The pork chop was cooked perfectly and topped with a pesto sauce over top of what we think was either rhubarb or celery root.  The combo was excellent.  We wanted to inquire more about these dishes, but chatting with the owner, found us side tracked. We were talking about everything other than the food!  The plates are small, but that is just fine because you have room for dessert.  

And let me tell you about the dessert.  This was the best dessert I&#39;ve ever had.  It was amazing.  As soon as I saw it on the menu, I knew I had to have it.  I am not a dessert person either, so to impress me like this is a feat.  We shared the peanut butter cup.  This dessert was a soft, sweet shortbread crust layered with thick chocolate  gnache.  It was topped with peanut butter brulee served over a homemade chocolate sauce.  Wow, that&#39;s about all I can say....wow.

So, on the menu, it states across the top &#34;a nice place to eat and drink&#34;-that&#39;s for sure.  A really, really nice place to eat and drink.  I think we&#39;ve found our new spot."

You gotta try it at least once, right? After a long business meeting a colleague and I ventured to Satchel&#39;s on 6th to see what there is to review.

Tired, thirsty, and a bit anxious, we crossed the threshold and were greeted by the pleasant host who, with a nonchalant nod of his head, directed us to a tiny 2-place table. We pulled up our bright red metal chairs that seemed to belong more at a high school picnic site rather than a restaurant on 6th Avenue. We examined the menu, pondered appetizers, and decide to go straight to the main courses (duck fat fries? popcorn? - it is a picnic!).

We ordered the scallops (U12 Scallops) and pork tenderloin. We examined the sparse selection of wine and each decided upon a glass of puligny montrachet. This was a nice touch. Steely, bright, refreshing...

The U12 Scallops were cooked nicely and had a creamed corn risotto that was delightful. The pork tenderloin was over-cooked but the chutney compensated for the failure. The garlicky swiss chard should be called &#34;Swiss Chard with slices of garlic haphazardly placed amongst the leaves.&#34; There was no blend of the two. Two separate items, placed together with no skill. Too bad the guy who made the chutney did not make the chard (or, did he?). There is no amplitude in the Swiss Chard and Garlic dish.

The plates were a bit sloppy, little style. In fact the entire restaurant lacks style. Its almost like industrial warehouse meets high school picnic. No visual theme at all. The noise factor was tough to handle and the restaurant was not full. All hard surfaces, many of them metal, echoing the laughter of patrons, clanking of plates, and clinking of glasses. 

But my most memorable take-away from this experience is the AMF Factor. The AMF Factor measures how well the establishment executes its value proposition. Satchel has yet to define his so it&#39;s tough to execute an amorphous concept. 

The owner should listen to some Jazz and try to gather the concept of hanging a melody on a harmonic sequence. Satchel&#39;s ain&#39;t there.

I went there on a Tuesday night with one of my friends. They had an ample wine list, but we settled on some great craft beers. The waiters were unobtrusive but quick and took great care of us. We had the risotto and the scallops. Both were excellent. The portions were modest, but the quality made up for it. We finished off dinner with a flowerless chocolate cake that was great. I wish they had a little more of a drink menu, but other than that, the meal was great."

So we have lived in park hill for 8 years and Satchel&#39;s market in park hill went from Ok to AMAZING the last year or so it was open there; no-one came right out and said it, but I figured out it was because of the new Swedish chef.  So, once it was amazing , we became regulars and then they decided to move to 6th.  We were disappointed that a great hidden secret in park hill was moving but assumed the chef would be the same one at the new location.

So finally about a month ago we visited Satchel&#39;s on 6th; very excited to be back at our place!  only to be super disappointed in everything.  We walked out saying &#34;this is not the same restaurant at all&#34; and we will probably not go back unless we feel generous enough to give it another pricey try!
 
So today I was reading the Denver Post and find out that the Swedish chef Patrcik Landberg who was at Park Hill&#39;s Satchel&#39;s Market for &#34;a short stint&#34; is now at a new place called Charcoals (which I have not been to yet) which got an excellent review in the Post.  Hence the downturn at Sathcel&#39;s on 6th.......For me an excellent restaurant is all about the food.......so bye-bye Satchel&#39;s, I am headed for Charcoals!"

Maybe it was because we went to Osterio Marco the weekend prior and we had high expectations. Either way, the brussel sprouts were undercooked, both meat dishes were chewy, and the desert was not worth the wait. It took us almost fifteen minutes of sitting at the bar to have our drink order taken. And, when we finally sat down we waited during each course for one of our dishes to arrive or for plates to be cleared. Overall, dissatisfied."

We went in with our two-year-old son during happy hour for a quick snack and a glass of something refreshing. We were unsure if milk (about the only thing our son will consume in a restaurant) would be available, but sure enough, the hostess returned from the kitchen within minutes with a glass of milk and a straw, which she quickly refilled at no charge.

My husband had the fried green tomato with pork cubes--the batter on the tomato was crisp without overwhelming the citrusy green tomato flavor, and the pork rounded out the Southernness while also making the dish richer and more filling than   either of us suspected.

Last night was the first night a sweetbreads dish was on the menu, and I had to have it. The sweetbreads were cooked perfectly--nice and browned on the outside, juicy and rich on the inside. They were paired with asparagus, morels, and a gribiche sauce that provided a perfect herby, springy, maybe even citrusy note. Absolutely perfect. 

There were other items on the menu that I&#39;d love to go back for, including a grilled squid salad, as well as a special menu for patrons seated at the bar. 

Husband and I both really liked the decor and the music (R+B mix from 60s/70s). The only reason I didn&#39;t give 5 stars--our server was definitely working on the assumption that we were out for a leisurely evening. I would have liked the service to pick up the pace a little bit, but the food and atmosphere are worth the wait."

I sat at the bar where I was attended to by (what seemed) each member of the staff - despite it being an almost completely full restaurant.  The wine list was wonderful, as was the menu selection.  I opted for a few indulgences:  the lemon ricotta gnocchi and the mac and cheese small plates.  The gnocchi was perfectly prepared and the mac n&#39; cheese was so rich and flavorful i could eat it every day.  Not only that, but my order came out pleasantly fast.  Everyone at the tables surrounding the bar were lively and gushing over their meals - next time I will be ordering the U12 scallops for sure.  And I saw their brunch menu online and can&#39;t wait to try that!

All in all, Satchel&#39;s is the perfect neighborhood favorite."

Overall, we felt it was okay and would not make a special trip to go back. From the start our waiter was not very knowledgeable about the wine and food. We wanted to order a bottle of white wine and to know some of the differences between the wines. It would have been nice if there was a brief description on the wine menu describing each wine. The waiter kept going back to the bartender and asking the differences between the wines. Furthermore, when we went to order and ask questions about the food and appetizers again the waiter was not very knowledgeable about the food and would give us basic answers. He also could not give us any straight recommendations. I personally find it annoying when places say everything is good and cannot list their favorites. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and the food was okay. We ordered brussel sprouts, duck fat fries, lamb and lobster sliders, and mussels. The brussel sprouts were undercooked and unseasoned, the duck fat fries just tasted like normal fries and were overcooked and some were even soggy. The mussels were good but they didn&#39;t bring out any bread for the mussels. That is another pet peeve of mine is not having some sort of bread to soak up the mussel sauce. I tried the lobster sliders since I am not a fan of lamb, and you barely tasted any lobster and really just tasted the mayonnaise and tarragon. My friends who had the lamb said the lamb was overcooked and again unseasoned. Overall, it seemed that most of our food was overcooked, undercooked, or under seasoned. Also, I don&#39;t know if our waiter was new but they should really make sure the wait staff is more knowledgeable and has a full understanding of their drink and food menu. Overall, we are not rushing back and would rather go to other restaurants in the area. It&#39;s a nice set-up but they need to work on consistency with their food and making sure their wait staff fully understands the menus."

I really wanted to experience his asparagus appetizer with ricotta cheese, poached egg and grated Benton&#39;s country ham once again as well as the frighteningly refreshing ginger watermelon.  It seemed that his style worked so well with the vision of owner Andrew Casilini at Satchel&#39;s.  The dishes were simple and fresh, yet deceptively refined.  

The menu has changed a bit with the new chef, Kurt Boucher.  I recently had the mustard encrusted pork tenderloin which was supposed to be accompanied by a coconut peach chutney.  This sounded like a great vehicle for those freshly harvested Colorado peaches, but the chutney&#39;s flavors were unfortunately obscured by many dried fruits decidedly not in season in Colorado such as golden raisins, dried apricots etc.  It was also disconcerting that the boldest flavor on the plate (besides the heavy handed garlicky chard) was the wilted flat leaf parsley draped over the encrusted tenderloin.  This is not to say that the tenderloin wasn&#39;t cooked perfectly, it was.  The dish just didn&#39;t deliver based on it&#39;s menu description and tasted like something I could just as easily have been eating in February as opposed to peach harvest time.

Hopefully, the new chef will regain his footing and begin to jive with the vision the owner had established so perfectly with Jared Brant.  He is going to have to do better than duck fat fries to keep me coming back for more."

As for the food- I got the steak sandwich with truffle fries ($17). The steak sandwich was pretty tasty- tender meat and good sauce. The truffle fries were amazing!!

My husband got the pepperoni pizza ($15) which was really cheesy and delicious as well.

I tried someone&#39;s risotto and that was very creamy and yummy too!

The atmosphere is absolutely grand. Exposed brick, modern art, Edison bulbs... the works. The bar is absolutely gorgeous, I could just live there!

I ordered a pizza off the menu bc the guys next to had some and it smelled divine. I got the prosciutto, arugula and mozzarella pizza and hot damn was it good. Perfect crust and dough. Wouldn&#39;t change a thing.

Between the four of us, we had two orders of the short ribs and two orders of the Barramundi. The short ribs were fall off the bone DELICIOUS. The risotto that accompanied the dish was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor.

The Barrumundi dish didn&#39;t go over too well. While the fish was good, the stew bed that the fish sat on had so many bland garbanzo beans that they muted the flavor of the lentils and other items in the stew bed.

All four of us commented that the portions were small and pricey. We left hungry and the bill was approximately $60 for each couple -- for entrees ONLY. The restaurant had more of a bar/social hangout spot, but the pricing and food type seemed more of a quaint, cozy, bordering on upscale restaurant.

And finally, the lighting was .... well... DARK! It was beyond dimly lit. More than one person at the table had to use the light on their phone to properly see the menu!"

My boyfriend and I grabbed dinner with another couple last month and they set the spot. Gozo is conveniently only a handful of blocks from us, so we were psyched to hopefully find a nearby favorite find.

Our server was friendly, but everything went downhill from there. My boyfriend and I shared the burrata salad and margherita pizza. The burrata salad was decent, but didn&#39;t &#34;wow&#34; me like I would hope for $12. Once the margherita pizza came out, the cheese was funky cold medina. It looked like the pizza had sat for a while and the cheese cooled and raised away from the sauce. It wasn&#39;t hot and although it tasted okay, it was very mediocre for $14. Punch Pizza in my home state does it way better for less than half the price. Shameless plug.

So promising, but I would not return to this SoBo spot."

We started with the octopus and meatballs.  The octopus was cooked beautifully with the slightest hint of char.  The polenta under the meatballs was rich, creamy, and a great combination to the pork. 

Still quite hungry, we decided to share the artichoke.  The green goddess dipping sauce was the perfect pair to the tender dish.

For a sunday this place wasn&#39;t packed like every other brunch spot in town. We got a table right away and got served drinks and were tended to immediately. 

They offer bottomless mimosas! The brunch menu has so much to offer BUT the options on it are SO yummy. sandwiches, benedict, crepes, hash. I had the avocado benedict. the quinoa cake that was part of the dish was one of my favorite parts. a nice twist on your classic benedict. fresh avocado and i chose a side salad to go with it. it paired nicely. not too heavy of a dish and it was rather healthy too. I recommend trying this if you&#39;re into avocados and egg benedicts. 

I will definitely be coming back here whenever i&#39;m in town."

I got the pork shoulder and the star of that dish is definitely the broccolini and polenta. I was kind of disappointed with the meat, which was kinda a major bummer. The fries were pretty delicious.

That smoked old fashioned, tho. DANG. I&#39;d go back just for that drink. But I&#39;m a sucker for smokey things and whiskey. 

Wait staff was great and the atmosphere is pretty trendy. Not sure if I&#39;d go back for food but I&#39;d definitely go back for drinks."

I had the avocado Benedict. The eggs were hard boiled  so I asked the server of that was usual. My friend had the same order &amp; issue. He said he&#39;d bring more eggs. After 15+ min he brought my friend eggs but not me. We rolled with it and shared. The potatoes were delicious. The quinoa was bland and there was barely any hollandaise sauce. Seems they should stick to dinner. Server was friendly and comped my dish which was nice. Love the aesthetic but think the food is way over priced for the quality."

Everything on my $13 Two egg breakfast with polenta and fennel sausage was completely cold and disgusting. The only reason I ordered it was for the fennel sausages and they were awful. My friend&#39;s breakfast was good, however, so perhaps they just let mine sit a LOT longer. The atmosphere is great so I may give it another chance sometime."

I love the interior decor and kind of even enjoyed the super hipster move of not having a big ol&#39; restaurant sign. I made reservations here for my birthday and was placed next to the garage opening and it really made it that much more of a pleasant experience. The waitress was super awesome too! My only thing was that all the food I had was bland. My girls and I like to do family style so we tried about 6-7 dishes and most were bland. The only one that stuck out was the octopus. The short ribs, I still enjoyed, because I do like my food a little bit more bland sometimes but the rest of the table definitely enjoys flavors. Both pizzas we got just tasted like dough, even the sausage itself had no flavor. Overall, had a great birthday dinner and great service but not sure I&#39;ll be back."

I knocked off a star for over-charging us $15 for wine, and for charging $16 for a plate of buttery noodles for the child in our party (charged as linguini with clams, server claimed he couldn&#39;t change the price. He should have brought out the clams for the adults!)."

We had the chopped brussel sprout salad which was so good, I forgot to take a picture! It has just the right amount of dressing on it to help hold the ingredients together, but not drown everything to where all you can taste is the dressing. Then, I had the meatballs (see picture below). So good! I honestly couldn&#39;t finish it all because the meal was a little rich...I REALLY wanted to, but I was stuffed. 

The hostess and our waitress was super nice!  There was a 30-45 minute wait so we went to the bar to grab drinks. That actually took much longer than I expected. I understand that they&#39;re making craft cocktails and we should be a little patient...but the problem was the dark-haired bartender (might have been a manager of sorts, too), was gabbing with customers instead of making drinks. Gotta learn how to multitask, lady! She just didn&#39;t seem like she wanted to hustle...maybe it was an off night for her. The sweet hostess came over to tell us our table was ready and we were still waiting on our drinks...but when we finally got them, they were pretty darn delicious. 

The only other thing I would note on here is the noise. OH MY GOSH, THE NOISE!!! If you are with a quiet, soft-spoken group, go elsewhere for dinner. You will not be able to hear each other over the roar of the crowd. Maybe I&#39;m just getting old, but this is a pet peeve of mine. A restaurant should think about all the senses when creating a space, not just sight, smell and taste. They should invest in some acoustic tiles for the ceiling, hang rugs/curtains/cloth of some sort on the walls/over the windows, OR glue the foam egg crate stuff on the bottom sides of the tables, IMHO. ANY soft textiles in the space would help to dampen the reverberations. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re going for that industrial look, but they could always go with grey acoustic tiles or the egg crate/foam suggestion (again, IMHO). 

These blips aside, I would def recommend this place for the food and drinks. Plus it&#39;s in Baker and there are plenty of places to bar hop afterwards.  I just know that, next time, I&#39;ll either go much earlier, or later (rather than right at dinner time), to hopefully have a more acoustically pleasing experience."

Holy cow what a gem. Awesome location on south Broadway. Love the decor, very simple, white painted brick, wood and metal with garage style doors making you feel like you&#39;re on a patio when you aren&#39;t.. Super knowledgeable staff. Best scallops I have ever had in Denver. Pizza was noteworthy. House cocktails were on point and perfect. And we started with a shares plate of I believe was called barracha? Cheese mixture with an apricot preserves sort of mix on fresh grilled bread. Seriously amazing and is going to be a regular date spot going forward. So great!"

The restaurant is trendy and has nice ambiance in any area. From our seat we, got to see people walk by and cute dogs sniff the food aromas coming from the restaurant. The waitress took our order of rigatoni and porchetta. It came out rather quickly and the portions sizes are perfect. The rigatoni and meat sauce was pretty good. The porchetta was really tender but lacked flavor. The figs, sauce and polenta weren&#39;t enough flavor for the meat to really make it a perfect dish."

I so want to knock off a star for the way you make me wait, and wait, and wait some more for my delicious food to arrive. I also wanted to delay this review until I&#39;d visited you for dinner and happy hour. However virtuous and well thought out that may sound, I just couldn&#39;t resist writing this review now- nor keeping that 5th star intact, because once your food hits my lips, I forget all about my whining and just fall in love with everything on my plate. Of course it is also your fault that Hubs wants to commandeer my fork even though he&#39;s happily stuffing himself with your amazing pizza. The best pizza he&#39;s eaten in Denver? Yes, I think so. Delcious crust baked to perfection in the firey oven and thoughtful toppings that change with the seasons such as a bushel of arugula and tasty prociutto or roasted garlic and uncured pepperoni.

My brunch plates have been nothing short of exquisite. The 3 day short rib hash- a smoky delight. Sure I would have traded out the scrambed eggs for sunny side up, but it certainly didn&#39;t compromise the integrity of the dish. Or how about the latest rabbit dish. Oh Bugs, you are delicious! Tomatoes, rosemary, polenta, and garlic nestled together in a cast iron dish with a refreshing side of arugula salad. Yes! 

I cannot wait to return to you again and sample more of your scrumptious creations. Maybe I will pack a little snack.

Love, Me"

They have the most amazing people working for them, the kindest host, a great bartender, and the sweetest servers. I&#39;m sure the chefs and owners are great too. Here&#39;s what gets me: the food. It just does not cut it for me. Most of their entrees while creative are pretty bland. The only reason I ate as much my flavorless pizza was cause  I was so hungry. My friends ordered the seafood stew and linguine, neither were exceptional. We all agreed the dessert was the only good part of our meal. 

Again sorry for this. I really wanted to like this place but couldn&#39;t."

We had a reservation but still waited 25 minutes past time to be seated. They did apologize and made up for that with free glass of wine for each of us, so forgiven. The burrata appetizer was deliscious. For dinner we each tried different personal pizza and I had the salmon. Everyone thought their pizza was delicious and unique and the salmon was cooked perfectly and some of the best I&#39;ve had in CO. Only problem we had was the noise level. It was so loud my parents couldn&#39;t hear anything and my wife and I struggled to hear each other as well.

Overall, the food was top notch, the atmosphere was too noisy, and the price was decent. I&#39;ll go back for the food, but wouldn&#39;t ever bring my parents there again due to noise level."

Went here with friends for double date night and did tapas and wine.  Wine list was pretty good.  The Brussels Sprout Salad was AMAZING, the meatballs were delicious, truffle fries were awesome (not the shoestring fries you often get with truffle fries, but &#34;regular&#34; sized fries, perfectly-not overly- truffled, yum!) and the risotto was also yummy.  The only thing we didn&#39;t like was the pizza special, it had white kidney beans, arugula, and some other stuff, not enough goat cheese.  It was a strange pizza combination and kind of dry.

I&#39;m sure the residences in the area are fed up as well. Guess this is progress as South Broadway is now a cool place to be. 

We had made reservations but at time of making the reserv said we would be a party of 4 or 6, probably a bad idea to tell them that. Well we arrived (a very busy Friday night) &amp; our table was a 4 top, whoops. The host was so pleasant &amp; accommodating &amp; we waited 15 min or so &amp; got a table for 6.
As mentioned, the restaurant was packed. Space is very tight in areas, but the decor is cool &amp; entire staff cordial &amp; helpful.

We had appetizers, the calamari was fresh &amp; nicely prepared, not greasy  &amp; served hot for once (so many places seem to serve it Luke  warm to cool).

The wine list is decent albeit some a little high $$, but the waitress suggested a couple special wines &amp; they were superb.

I had the salmon which was perfect, two had the Rabbit ragu which to some may sound out there but was pretty good, &amp; the Spare ribs were amazing.

Definitely a place to return to the scene."

Upon entering, we were greeted by possibly the best host in hosting history. We didn&#39;t know you needed a reservation (which you will) because the restaurant isn&#39;t on Open Table.  However, she was so accommodating, and we ended up at the bar for a few minutes -- the bartender was highly attentive during these minutes -- before settling into seats at the pizza bar.  These bar seats, I should mention, are very comfy and have backs.  Definitely eating-in worthy.

At the pizza bar, we talked with the pizza chef from Madrid.  He was wonderfully helpful in selecting our meals and just chatting all together.  We had the pepperoni pizza as a starter.  It was one of the best pizzas I&#39;ve had in Denver.  Then, for an entree, I had the salmon.  It was perfectly crusted and cooked.  My husband had the short ribs, which were cooked/ smoked for 3 days prior to him eating them.  He was in heaven.  He also enjoyed a variety of drinks, including his favorite, the smoked Old Fashion.

The reason I&#39;m deducting a star is because our actual waitress wasn&#39;t overly attentive.  We saw her only once or twice when we flagged her down after several minutes of waiting for her.  She forgot my drink for a few minutes, and maybe went on break or just disappeared for a long time in the middle of our meal too.  It was definitely not service up to par with the modern restaurant and decor and 5 star food."

The water brought to our table however was warm and no ice in our glasses. It was gross. I order some of the more eccentric items on the menu. The baby octopus and the wild rabbit spaghetti. They came to the table looking fantastic. Now I should point out here I work in the industry. Specifically in the kitchen. I have been a Sous Chef in the states and in foreign waters. There is no greater sin than not using salt or using too much. In this case it was the former. The food was tasteless. The rabbit was perfectly cook and covered in a flavorless ragù. It was just sad. The baby octopus was over cooked and again flavorless. Very disappointing."

Pros: 

The space, which is open and bright with a mix of trendy and quirky details (think lots of white subway tile, a speaker shaped like a suitcase above the bar and Edison pendant lights) is just beautiful.  First word upon walking in was &#34;Wow!&#34;

The food was all a hit!  Between the four of us, we shared the cauliflower and artichokes, then my husband and I shared two entrees (the sausage pizza and pork shoulder) and it was all great.  The pizza maybe needed a sauce but the pork shoulder and polenta, plus the salad that accompanied them were a knockout. The other two in our group were raving about the sea bass and short rib they ordered.  

Cons:

The staff was kinda weird.  We asked the hostess if she wouldn&#39;t mind changing the bar TV to the Rockies game (baseball&#39;s back, yay!) and she seemed confused and hesitant then didn&#39;t actually change the channel!  It was strange.  Our server seemed a little distracted and uninterested in our table and I wish she would&#39;ve done the whole &#34;Have you been in before?  No?  Well this is what we&#39;re about.&#34; spiel, but she was still courteous and professional so I can&#39;t knock her too much.

The way the menu is divided doesn&#39;t  make that much sense.  We assumed the &#34;Start&#34; section was appetizers but when we asked for some menu clarification, our server said some of the items were good for sharing and others weren&#39;t, then items in the &#34;Mid&#34; section were of varying sizes?  Call me crazy, but I like to know if the item I&#39;m ordering is gonna be a full sized dish or just a side.  Maybe we were supposed to just share everything and make educated guesses on the dish size based on price?  

Anyway, I think the pros outweighed the cons and now that I know how the menu works a little better, I think ordering would be easier.  And in the end, I think ambiance alone makes this place worth coming back to."

My favorite part was the warm olives appetizer. They seem to specialize more in wine than craft beer, but there are plenty of options no matter what camp you&#39;re in. 

The place itself is kind of nondescript on the exterior (aka hard to spot). It&#39;s on the north end of the block and you almost have to be right in front of it to realize you&#39;re right in front of it.

I came into work Monday, too, rappin&#39; to my ED about rad it was, and she&#39;d heard it was inconsistent-- but I sold her on how, if that were true, it&#39;s def fixed.  She&#39;s on her way, Gozo.

Meals: I went with the bolognese while she-beaux opted for carbonara. She-beaux raved about hers, and somehow believably convinced me that she made the wrong choice, and that bolo is the way to go, yo.  I&#39;m talkin&#39; it was so good it makes me want to put carrots and stuff in MY bolognese, and my bolognese is no effing joke whatsoever sans veggies.  I take it seriously, yo.

We split the brussel sprouts small plate to start, and it was incredible. In the strictest sense of the word-- incredible.

Perhaps a li&#39;l too much ice in my old-fashioned, though I&#39;m known for fishin&#39; most of the ice outta any given cocktail. No sweat, though, when they backed me up with a grapefruit vodka concoction that really set the tone for the afternoon.

By the way, the foot traffic on Broadway is epic, and I strongly recommend a seat near the open walls/windows.

Toppin&#39; e&#39;erthang, every single person working came over and asked us how things were, and they weren&#39;t phony whatsoever.  In fact, each and every one mentioned how much they liked the succulent she-beaux had just bought at Ironwood then rocked as the de facto centerpiece.  They&#39;re paying attention, not overbearing, and they really cared about us. 

At one point, homegirl comes over and asks how everything was, and I take a long pause, searching for words to express how much I enjoyed it all, right? But I&#39;m the Mad One, and I know I look like a [insert expletive here] if I&#39;m not smiling wildly at my lover, so homegirl gets shook for a second.

Then I just unleash how amazing things were, and she was RELIEVED. Not just like, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m glad I ain&#39;t gotta listen to this goon complain,&#34; but like, &#34;Yo, I take this seriously and I want you to have an enjoyable experience.&#34;

Gozo is currently my number one, most emphatic rec. AND they play Sting.

Thank you, Gozo."

But you know what the road to Hell is paved with.  Atmosphere and service very good, but the food has some very good hits and some very odd misses.  Whoever the chef is needs to consistently taste the food being put out, or at least be humble enough to put salt shakers on every table because if nothing changes you&#39;ll need them for some dishes.

5 of us ladies went there for brunch before going downtown to see Beauty and the Beast.  Ordered steak sandwiches, short rib hash, French toast, and smoked salmon crepes.  Both ladies who ordered the sandwiches said they were &#34;fine&#34;.  Decent but nothing special; however the side dish of quinoa had ZERO flavor; I guess they forgot to salt the water when they boiled it.  

Short ribs were to die for.  Smoked salmon crepes had freshly prepared hollandaise with a beautiful presentation.  French toast was delicious.  

Then there was the Brussel sprout salad that was supposed to be so good.  Could not taste any dressing or flavor at all.  Brought it home and threw some Italian dressing on it and it was fine.  Sweet potato &#34;hash&#34; that came with the short ribs were cubed pieces of sweet potato and some onions.  Meh.

And finally the most annoying thing:  apparently Gozo has no interest in accommodating people with food sensitivities.  Out of about 18 dishes for brunch I got to pick from 3, yep just 3.  The hash or two salads.  No GF bread or GF pizza crust.  Sorry.  Any dairy alternative for the coffee drinks?  Nope, got nuthin for ya.

Some day if they modernize for people with food sensitivities I&#39;d go back and try lunch, but I&#39;m not holding my breath. 4 stars for service, atmosphere, and at times great food.  Almost gave it 3 for the glutenfree thing.  So 3 and a half."

Classy environment that&#39;s not stuffy, fresh food that&#39;s not too heavy and reliant on salt, fried, or meaty dishes and top notch cocktails. The very best part of this place is the staff. Jonah, Toni and Renata couldn&#39;t have been any more genuinely friendly. Jonah talked to us about the owners and how well they treat the staff. He also gave us an extra dish for free (I&#39;m assuming a mistake in the kitchen). Toni made great conversation about the dishes and her own recommendations as she quickly emptied the dishwasher and Renata made absolutely fantastic cocktails and recommendations based on our tastes. 

Another new favorite place."

Got to nibble off everyone&#39;s plate.  I thought the braised pork shoulder sammich was good.  The pizza wasn&#39;t too bad, but it was loaded with tons of arugula.  I ordered the wood braised rabbit with pancetta and a fried egg that was just ok.  Service was good he kept pouring us our bottomless mimosas even after we paid when most servers would simply forget about you.

Do this: get a pizza. These tiny guys are deceiving cuz they are loaded with awesome ingredients and sure to fill you up.  I&#39;m shocked so thank you for that. 

Next: get another pizza. That&#39;s right, I said it. You can&#39;t go wrong with one of those guys. 

Do this: come for happy hour. If you miss it, you&#39;re looking at a glass of house wine for $9! That&#39;s may seem on the high side since you can get it for half that during happy hour. Then again, they&#39;re from Napa so they prolly think $9 is a steal.

I asked another very helpful female server to take it back a d just get a glass of wine (very tiny by the glass selection... not great). Our server brought my wine out and said I could have just &#34;flicked&#34; the pepper off? Seriously??? It was floating all over in my drink?

Calamari appetizer was good, but it maybe 1/3 calamari and 2/3 fried vegetables. It was tasty but chincy. Pizza had good chewy crust, but toppings and seasoning was bland. Short ribs were fatty but big and tender, although the tomatoes risotto tasted like bland tomatoes soup, and the risotto was a bit under done, although did have a good consistency. 

Overall, for $80 with only one drink and one app, this place is way too overpriced and under done for me. You should hit up Beatrice and Woodsly next door, also over priced but always a good meal, and experience. Won&#39;t be back here... blah!"

This place has a very nice hipster ambience and it was very pleasing. We got to choose our table near the window that had a nice breeze coming through. This restaurant is perfect for a date night or a nice casual drink with the friends. 

We ended up getting a couple drinks to get the night going. For those that don&#39;t like the strong taste of alcohol you should get the sangria blanco. This drink pretty much tasted like flavored water that has a strawberry and cucumber. It was pretty strong. I forgot what my boyfriend got but it was a beer that came in a wine like bottle. It was alright. 

Food: at first we got the an appetizer. I don&#39;t remember what it was called but it had prosciutto wrapped around a melon and a bok Choy like vegetable. The melon and the prosciutto surprising complimentary to each other. The melon was to sweet and the prosciutto wasn&#39;t to salty. The prosciutto and the vegetable on the other hand wasn&#39;t bad but it was somewhat bitter. Not good enough for what you pay for, but if you want to try something different then go ahead.  I got the short ribs with the risotto. And I just got to say this was mighty tasty!!! The risotto had a nice tomato feel to it, it tasted like a tomato pasta. With the short rib it gave a balance taste. The only thing about this dish was it was a little bit to salty, so it seemed pretty heavy. That was the only downside but I highly recommend it my boyfriend got the pork shoulder dish. It comes with a creamy polenta and an arugula salad. It was a good balance with heavy food with light. It was pretty tasty.

Overall, our experience was very pleasant and they will see us again."

While Gozo offers all the trending foodstuffs (kale, roasted beets, brussel sprouts, wood-fire&#39;d pizza, etc.), they do it well. Not only is the food fresh, suculent, and saliva-inducing, it&#39;s also handsomely portioned and reasonably priced (try the seared bass if you want to know what&#39;s up... or the brussel sprout salad, a giant portion, with a ridiculously easy-on-your-wallet $6 price tag).

The craft cocktails (hey! don&#39;t roll your eyes yet, there, mister/missy!) are made of local alcohols and accoutrements - they pack a punch (booze forward!) and are balanced perfectly. $10-14 bucks a pop for that bang.

Came here for a friend&#39;s birthday dinner and the whole experience was meh.  The seating arrangements are cramped and their open kitchen area looks like a cheap, tiled bathroom.  The only real open space was the entryway.

Their menu was too eclectic for my taste.  I&#39;m not a culinary expert, so I had to Google most of their dishes to have an idea of what they were as the waitress didn&#39;t really know.  I chose the the pork meatballs and polenta.  For $12, I expected more than just three small meatballs on a plate of grits.  I also ordered a double tall gin and lemonade, but received a single short instead.  Since service was very slow and our waitress disappeared, I wasn&#39;t able to get another drink until an hour later.  I did try the Brussels sprout salad as I heard it was all the rage.  It&#39;s not all the rage.  It&#39;s just a different take on coleslaw.  

The bathrooms were nice and clean.  Pretty much the only positive thing about this place.  Guess I&#39;m just not one of the cool kids to have enjoyed this place."

Arrived just after 5 PM and they were doing brisk business compared to my first visit.  Greeted right away and shown to a table close to the garage door which would have been great but a little chilly so we moved to a high top in the bar which was fine.

Happy Hour:  Friend had the house red $5 which he thought was fair and I had a Moscow Mule $6 (not much kick in that old mule) but tasty enough.  They have a number of small plates for $5.  We shared three - Brussels sprout slaw, fried calamari and red onion, individual pizza with porchetta.  

The slaw, according to my friend who really liked it on previous visits, thought is was different this time.  It was pretty dry and boring - in need of more dressing of some sort - didn&#39;t finish it.  The calamari on the other hand was excellent.  I always appreciate some tentacles in the mix so you know actual squid were involved somewhere along the way - delish.  The pizza was a mixed bag - porchetta topping was very good but the crust was &#34;bready&#34; and fairly tasteless - didn&#39;t finish it either but certainly a generous portion for the price.

Service was much better this time (any service would have been better than the no service we got on our first visit).  Our guy was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and right on top of things.  Looked like they had a lot more staff overall which they needed because a lot of their not so great reviews here focus on service issues.

So, not the best HH in town but not nearly the worst.  I&#39;ll probably be back since it&#39;s so convenient to my house."

We had a few failed attempts to make it in to Gozo on Friday and Saturday nights due to horrendously long waits.  This place does incredible business which we learned was for good reason on our first actual successful dinner there a few weeks back.  I made early reservations to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and we made it in without a hitch.  In fact, it was extremely quant and quiet, providing us personal attention and not to mention it was happy hour.  

The manager was incredibly gracious and introduced himself personally to us both.  Upon hearing of the occasion, they brought us both complimentary glasses of cava.  Since it was coincidentally happy hour, we were able to try a few of the happy hour drink and food items.  The Negroni, which happens to be one of my favorite cocktails, was a special during happy hour for $6.  They had $5 select wines which my girlfriend opted for before also switching to the Negroni after sampling mine.  They also offer up a reasonable discount on their draft beers as well. 

As far as the food, they had a few items on the happy hour menu that enticed us that we would have otherwise paid full price for on the regular menu.  At five bucks each during hh, the Brussels sprout salad and the beet salad were remarkable and incredibly filling as a starter on their own.  The pizzas are also half priced on happy hour which is a huge bargain.  Each pizza coming out of the wood fired oven behind the open kitchen, we were blown away by the precision and execution of our pizza selection with mussels and I forget what else.  We also ordered the octopus with chickpeas which was the only let down of the night.  The octopus was over charred and flavorless leaving us with the only drawback on the evening.

By the time we wrapped up our evening, the place had filled to capacity with a line out the door and needless to say it was only 6:30.  Even when the crowd picked up, we still received excellent service and were in no way rushed to finish our drinks or rushed out the door to make room for waiting patrons.  All in all, the space is beautiful, the service is attentive and charming, and the food is approachable, flavorful, and mostly flawless.  My recommendation, go during happy hour where you can get the regular menu with some great deals while avoiding the bustle and commotion during peak hours."

One of the coolest aspects of the space is the garage door that opens out into the street as diners watch passerby&#39;s go by. The menu, meant to be shared, offers some creative twists on otherwise basic ideas. Bacon on toast anytime? How about Tender Belly on toast with green onion butter? Yeah, that&#39;s better.

Went back to Gozo for dinner last night with my best friend and my best wifey. Had an excellent, mainly small plates meal. Highly recommended.

Loved it that the front of the house staff not only seated us, but poured us a free tasting of an excellent rose bubbly.

Liked it that our spunky server (Amy:) felt very free to make all kinds of recommendations; the vast majority of which we took and really enjoyed.

Had previously had the shaved brussels sprouts--which remains a standout salad. This time tried the charred scallion and shallots pizza with balsamic onions and thought it rocked (my honey found it a little sweet . . . but hey, what&#39;s she know?:).  Flipped for the pork meatballs over creamy polenta, and also loved the boquerones (a kind of bruschetta with anchovy (!), remoulade and parsley covering).  Had an entree of pan roasted trout (they were out of stripped bass) with a delicious medley of peas and other fresh-from-the-garden veggies. Excellent. (As were the homemade Italian cookie and chocolate pot de creme desserts).

That the place deserves a solid 4 star rating; and that you and yours should definitely give it a try.

Latte was just right - pork meatball panini was very good but the side salad needs work (very plain - almost no dressing). Pizza crust is awesomely light with good flavor almost like a focaccia bread."
gozo-denver,Jason R.,MRwjwpEgSOldbu9oDEXM7A,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,22,100,_PoxVVzPf1xm97HhbZ6DdQ,3.0,2014-05-17,"Execution and concept are solid. Service was decent enough on our first visit. The food however needs more depth, better balance, and a little salt. 

I cook in two restaurants and eat out far more than I should. I like to think I have a pretty good pallet. I never ask for salt at restaurants but I came pretty close today. The flavors themselves are good but many dishes need acid badly and almost all need at least one other dimension to them. 

The smoked gouda pizza and the pork belly toast are prime examples of this issue. The toast seems to have a light spread on it of some kind but the only flavor you get is pork belly. Put some mustard on it or a pickled veg or something. Similarly the smoked gouda pizza needs (in addition to salt) a balsamic reduction or something to cut the richness of all that (maybe too much) gouda. 

I wanted to give this place four stars but I just couldn&#39;t do it. I like the minimalist renovation and the open kitchen. The menu is pretty good as well. The execution of and freshness of the ingredients are outstanding but the final flavor combinations are definitely lacking. 

Maybe it was an off day but I feel that all the five star reviews here are from people confusing consistent preparation and execution of good ingredients with a great end product. 

More flavor please."

The decor is unique, the facade is garage doors that are kept open, which makes the restaurant particularly inviting. This place is busy on weekend nights, so get prepared for a wait if you don&#39;t have a reservation. There is a bar though, and a nice cocktail list, to kill time before being seated.

On to the food! The menu is comprised of small plates, pizzas, and larger entrees. We started with the burrata, which was served with heirloom tomatoes.
The tomatoes were great, but I wish they had been in a spread, or some other form, as they kept falling off the bread as I attempted to eat it. Other than that, this dish was phenomenal, but honestly, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with burrata. I ordered a pizza for my entree, which came with mozzarella and onions three ways. The onions were charred,  Caramelized and roasted, so there was tons of flavor without the bite. My friends enjoyed their entrees, and the portions were good sizes. The restaurant definitely focuses on seasonal produce, which is always appreciated.

This was one of my best meals since moving to Denver, and it was very reasonably priced for the quality and quantity. I want to check out their brunch!"

We started with a bottle of the Argentinian malbec rose, el libre, which was light and delicious.  Although we were shooting for the Clams (were out), the crispy calamari was well prepared and tasty. By the way, the waitresses served us were also friendly and attentive. 

So you may ask why only 3 stars? Well, it was because of the anchovies pizza we ordered. Actually it should be 2 stars for the oregano herbs that were served on the pizza, and came as additional garnish on a separated plate. First of all, the oregano herbs served were far from being fresh, because many of them have blacken rotten looking leaves. Second of all, when we told our waitress that we were not comfortable to consume the pizza with blacken rotten looking herbs on it, we were told later by the chef through the waitress that those herbs were supposed to look like this, especially when the leaf were interacting with the hot pizza. This comment really tipped me over a little bit. 

Now, let me be honest. If one were a diligent chef and if the  herbs do turn color after contacting the heat, then first of all you should have finely chopped the herbs instead of serving them pretty much the way how one picked them for the plant. If you want to imply that the ingredients are fresh by serving it whole, then please do take the time and pick out the rotten blacken looking leaves before serving them. Even if the herbs do turn color due to the heat, how come the oregano came on a separate plate without interacting with the heat also looked the same? Lastly, I don&#39;t believe that customer is always right, however, please do use some common sense when something on the plate just doesn&#39;t look appetizing

Two photos attached with this review to show how the oregano herbs were looked on the pizza, and were  served as garnish."

We walked in and were fortunate enough to sit at the chef&#39;s counter with a minimal wait.  The staff was incredibly professional, polite and knowledgeable.  It was my first time here so we had to try a little of everything (especially since we were sitting where it all came out from)!  Dishes I ordered are as follows.

*Piccolo*
Shaved brussels, egg, pecorino, marcona almonds (SOOO YUMMY!)
Wood oven manila clams, chorizo, cecchi beans (Incredibly flavorful and tender clams)
Pork Meatballs, ancient grain polenta, ragu (Sucker for meatballs and these were on the money)

*Pizze*
Prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, arugula (So fresh and such contrasting flavors/textures.  LOVED it!)

*Grande*
3-day smoked short rib, squash risotto, rib jus (WOWOWOW!  Tender and ridiculous flavor!)

Will definitely be returning to Gozo as it is now one of my favorite restaurants in terms of food, ambiance, and service.  Two thumbs up!  Now to try brunch ;)"

Atmosphere: The decor is nice but the music is to loud to hold a conversation.  

Food: Beet salad was good but everything else was below par. Pizza was of interest because of the wood oven but the crust needed work and the sauce was boring.  The roasted pork shoulder was completely flavorless and had a mushy texture.  

Service: slow, forgetful, and inattentive."

My iced tea was served in a large mason jar and tasted refreshingly fresh (sad I have to mention this because I&#39;ve had bad tea before....)

I ordered the fried pickles and the lunch cheeseburger ($9.99) with cheddar and tots. They had a bunch of cheese options (bleu, cheddar, pepper jack, Swiss, american, etc), so don&#39;t feel tied to a typically american burger. The pickles are spear form and not sliced, which can make for very salty bites. Regardless, the breading is really tasty after you let them cool down. The cheese on the cheeseburger was just a small slice on a huge 8 oz patty - too small in my opinion and quite comical. The tots are insanely good, and the burger itself was solid (minus tiny cheese).

As I sat at the bar, I spotted quite a few house infused rums and vodkas. I didn&#39;t try any, but would be very interested next visit."

I did not know until I arrived that 1it&#39;s actually a bloody mary bar. I can&#39;t be the only person who is not a fan of that concept. Taking 5 or 6 minutes to make yourself a drink that you pay for is not my favorite. On top of that seeing people dig the garnishes out of mason jars with their fingers was a little off-putting. On top of all this, our server took nearly 10 minutes to bring our drinks. She never brought water even though we asked for it twice , then our food took 20 minutes to arrive. Then, my food was not at all what was described in the menu. Both of our brunch meals we&#39;re heavy and greasy. We could not finish it.

The parking lot is small and packed but the place seems larger inside than it looks. They do not have a hostess but we had no problem finding a table. The service was great (thanks Mike!) and the food was good for average bar fair. 

I got the chili cheese burger (red chili) and was not disappointed. My wife got the Big Ben and our daughter got the Maytag. Both were great. Tater tots were a bonus. Fried pickle wedges were also good.

My second of two visits, not happy with either meal.  Today the steak sandwich bread was soaked in grease with a small overcooked piece of meat (I hesitate to call it a steak).  Gross.  I would have complained but no one ever asked me how my meal was so I paid and left.

My wife had the fish sand, not bad and I know as we ended up splitting it :)

The Glenn is a somewhat upscale bar in the metro area that serves typical American food like burgers and sandwiches and has a big variety of drinks.

We started with the Chil bean dip and this was sooo good! The bowl was practically cleaned by the time we finished. It combines cheddar cheese, bean dip, and green chili with a plate of tortilla chips. I had to stop myself from eating more because I didn&#39;t want to be full before I even got my actual meal! I really recommend this app, I only wish it was a little spicier. For my drink I got Pama Flirtini which I LOVED! This cocktail was made with I think pomegranate liquer, pearl citron, champagne, and some grenadine. I ended up ordering two throughout the night I liked it so much. I let my sister try it, however, and she said &#34;it tates like a Starburst!&#34; So, this drink is probably made for someone with a sweet tooth (like me!) We did have to ask for water seperately, which is annoying to me. This isn&#39;t California where h20 only comes by request because of the drought. At least when it was brought out, they use giant mason jars so it&#39;s enough for the whole night.

For my entree I got the salmon BLT. The salmon was made really well but I wouldv&#39;e enjoyed this a lot more if it wasn&#39;t absolutely drenched in the chipotle sauce. A little goes a long way. The fries it came with were nothing to write home (or Yelp) about. Side note: substituing a side salad with your meal instead of fries is $2.99 which is the exact same price for a side salad on the app menu. We decided to stick with the fries and get a side salad to share instead since it was the same price no matter what. That was strange to me. 

The service was pretty good, although the waiter forgot to ever bring my sister&#39;s 2nd drink she ordered. He was really nice and was cracking jokes, though, so no worries. For three of us our bill was over $100 which is pricey for a &#34;bar&#34; dinner but we did order 1 app, 5 drinks total, and 3 entrees. 

I would definitely come back and first thing I would order is that drink I loved! I am gonna try to recreate it this weekend. Will probably fail. Thanks!"

The place is cozy and everyone seemed friendly enough. There was a mix of people from older folks, bikers, families and a few of what might have been hardcore regulars.

The service was a little slow for not being real busy but that gave me time to look around. They had a Bloody Mary bar set up that was pretty busy. There was preseason football on most of the TV&#39;s and NASCAR on 1 television but it didn&#39;t seem that anyone was there to watch either.

We ordered an appetizer of buffalo wings and they were good, not too hot but meaty and tasty. I ordered the Glenn classic burger well done ( always well done at new places ) with fries. The burger was real good and cooked as I requested with onion, lettuce and tomato. The fries were standard fare and nothing special.

Good bar food and we had a good time so I would go back for lunch and a beer."

I went during Happy hour and man did it make me happy. 
The beer choices were great for the food choices they have. I even tried my very first Martini here. The fried pickles were very well coated and spears instead of slices. The mozzarella sticks stayed gooey the whole time of the meal. I ordered the Maytag burger...... It was cooked the way I asked and it was so juicy and delicious.  It was seasoned simply but had loads of flavor. My friend got the California Burger. I only rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because his burger was medium well but he wanted medium rare. 
The Staff are super friendly and always able to help. Our waitress stopped to talk to us but didn&#39;t carry on too much like some do. She even asked the bartenders to change the TV channel so I could watch the Rockies game.

We both just moved to the area from separate areas of New England, and really enjoy a few drinks, GOOD food and friendly staff.

We consistently get good drinks, GREAT food and terrific staff at the Glen. We hate chains, and much prefer to support private business. That being said, Thornton is full of chains and we deeply value good places that we can support and enjoy.

1st, if you want a good selection of beer or good priced happy hour well drinks, The Glenn is where it&#39;s at. Happy hour includes half-off prices of most if not all items off the Starter menu. $5.00 for a HUGE plate of excellent Nacho&#39;s? Oh yea!  Fried pickles are pretty good too, if that&#39;s your sort of thing. Big pieces, good batter. Asian wings were spicy and good, but not really our thing.

Unlike most bars, The Glen actually has a nice if small selection of starters, salads and entrees, and this is REAL food. Hamburgers are HUGE and very good. The fried fish is too good to be true, and I&#39;m from both New England and the San Francisco Bay area. Both of us know when fish is crappy. Everything we have tried was good, though certain things didn&#39;t appeal to us after the first order.

We have never really had &#34;bad&#34; visit, and this is partially because a certain waitress sort of took us under her wing, and she&#39;s been totally awesome to us since our first visit in July of 2013.

If you like karaoke and live music (in fact this is our only issue with the Glenn), they got that too. Outdoor seating in the Summer is great, and they have an outdoor bar during warm months. Outside, music is typically at a volume that still allows you to talk.

Inside however, music is typically too loud to be comfortable for us. We are both older adults, and the type of music is fine, it&#39;s just the volume that it&#39;s played at. 

We go here and eat a nice meal and enjoy a couple of drinks before 8 pm, or during happy hour on weekends. After that,  inside the music is crazy loud and we can go to more quiet places to drink if that&#39;s our plan. If only those other places had good food and the pleasant ambiance of The Glenn. And our favorite waitress."

Burger was awesome, and I am not one to say that lightly. Perfectly cooked, all the ingredients were excellent. 

Salad was also very good and huge, although the chicken on top could have looked more appealing for sure.

Atmosphere- 5 Stars

The menu is limited to a selection of burgers, sandwiches and pub fare, which suits the place and the people. The steak sandwich is fabulous (add cheese. The fries always come out hot and crispy. I usually get the plate and think, &#34;I&#39;m going to take half home&#34; but then I&#39;m most of the way through it, maybe next time.
Beer selection is limited to the favorites with a few craft brews on tap, and then there is the crazy array of flavored vodka including some of their own special blends.

I wrote my previous review based on our &#34;bar night&#34; here, but on the most recent occasion, we brought the whole fam.

The high booths are kind of nice; my toddler liked sitting high up and my one year old could sit in a booster seat and sit at the table just fine. For an early dinner (5pm-ish) it was BUSY.

The fried pickles were great.

Our burgers and other fare was so-so.  Typical bar food.  The beer selection, however was ABOVE expectations and we were quite pleased there. I had some kind of IPA from Chicago and the hubby had a Batch 19, both on draft.  Nice.

Service was SLOW; this is always exacerbated when you have kiddos in tow.  They start whining and it seems like things take even longer.  Because of this, I watched the time, and it wasn&#39;t just me, it was slow.

However, the main reason I probably won&#39;t be back here in the near future:  my husband could not stand the top 40/hip hop/dance tracks that they were BLASTING the whole time.  Not just background music... BLASTING so loud that it was hard to have a conversation.  I can stand that kind of music a bit more than he, but it does seem really weird that a place with a &#34;biker bar&#34; kind of atmosphere would be blasting  the newest J-Lo remix hit rather than some classic rock.  As we were leaving, the band on the patio was sounding much better."

Walking in, it was fairly dark, with low music playing, and a few sports games on the TVs. We sat ourselves and ordered some drinks fairly quickly. After that, the service was very slow. 30 minutes later we got our drinks then ordered food. 45 minutes after THAT our food came to us. I got a burger, and she got the salmon BLT. Both were good, though not incredible, noting that the price of each was about $12. 

Verdict: If you&#39;re looking for a neighborhood bar to grab a few drinks after work, or watch the karaoke or live music, this is the place! I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a sit-down restaurant, as the staff is very small, and fills up quickly because of the limited seating."

The Glenn offers a British pub style environment (wood booths/bar) and a really tasty menu with good prices.

I have been to The Glenn a few time the fish and chips are another good pick off the menu. My favorite are their fried pickles, they are probably the best that I have had. I love that they fry spears it makes them much easier to eat.

I&#39;ve been there to see Trainwreck a few times now. Always a great show! I&#39;ve only sat on the patio and had drinks, apps, and dinner, never inside. Indoors seems pretty nice though, walking through. 

While their beef is not grass fed, they state that it is fresh ground by a small local producer. A step in the right direction! The burgers are quite tasty. Good sweet potato fries. I like the fish and chips too. The green chili dip is not spicy at all, and it is quite cheesy. It&#39;s a bit wetter than some, not as thick and gooey as you might expect. Good flavor, just not what I expected. They could use a stronger/thicker tortilla chip that would hold up better to being dipped. 

Drinks are good. It&#39;s more of a beer place than mixed drinks. The first gin and tonic was better than subsequent. Different bartenders maybe...very different pours. Service is friendly but at times a little slow. I think they need to staff up a bit more for popular band events. 

Plenty of people bring their kids, even for the loud music. It is fairly family friendly, although there were some smokers later on in the evening. 

I like The Glenn, I&#39;ll have to go for lunch or something another time, even when Trainwreck is not playing. They&#39;re awesome though!"

The place looks like something that should be on the show &#34;bar rescue&#34;.....it smells like dirty socks and the only way they make money is by selling sports apparel and stealing from customers.  We tipped a GOOD AMOUNT on every round of drinks we bought, not because they were awesome but because it&#39;s the right thing to do.  Finally I decided to keep my tab open (huge mistake) because I paid every time I got drinks and then ordered a FEW more on my open tab and then got handed a $70 bill basically claiming I had like a bottle of liquor (not even humanly possible).  Also my friend went to get a couple shots at the bar, left a $10 in cash ON THE COUNTER and took the drinks back to the table and the waitress came over and asked &#34;IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE???&#34;  because she didn&#39;t see or get the tip.  Whether you get a tip or not you do not speak to people that way....lastly I got fed up and asked for the manager only to find out SHE WAS the manager.

It just has that great warm dark homey quality a good local bar should have. We stopped in on a Sunday night and it wasn&#39;t packed but still fairly busy. 

We started with some fried pickles because I can rarely turn down fried pickles at a bar. They were the big spear style and were nice and warm and crispy. Perfect. I got the Maytag burger with sweet potato fries. It is your basic blue cheese and bacon burger. I was a little sad about the amount of blue cheese on the burger. It was just a small amount in the middle and the bacon wasn&#39;t much different. I am a big believer in having each bite of your burger include everything on the burger and it just wasn&#39;t going to happen with the proportions. BUT the burger was big and juicy and yummy so I still managed to scarf the whole thing down. The SP fries were fairly basic but still yummy. The boy got the steak sandwich and loved it. The chunks of steak were perfectly medium rare. 

As we were getting ready to leave the live music was being set up. It was just a dude and his guitar but he was good. Behind him was a wall with board games and the booths were nice and big.

They are definitely capitalizing on the area wth the Asian/Indian fusion.  I had a burrito and chile rellanos which were both quite good. My sister had spicy pepper chicken tacos and said they were out of this world good. That being said, Vic&#39;s Mexican Tavern doesn&#39;t really fit the menu. Sure there are Mexican items but by having a name like &#34;Mexican tavern&#34; you risk really missing the good stuff.

The space is....big...but they definitely need to bring the decor into the 21st century. Currently reminds me of a golf club house with mariachi music playing. If they&#39;re smart, they&#39;ll capitalize on the massive patio right off Parker road. Get the misters going and fun music pumping and you&#39;d draw light rail commuters right in for happy hour during the summer who will stay well into the night with the fire pit going....especially when Regatta Plaza gets redone.

Someone can&#39;t make up their mind because it is still an Indian restaurant. The new rebranding means nothing. There are a few changes in the paper menu, but if you are looking for authentic Mexican, this is NOT it. Everything is a funky fusion of Indian food and Mexican. Bleh. 

Talk about putting lipstick on a pig? We were not greeted by anyone upon entering on a Friday evening and the atmosphere is absolutely terrible. there were only four tables of people dining.  This is what has happened here folks; Nobody has taken care to update the frontage and the interior is a sports bar with a hundred inaudible TVs on different stations throughout the place and Mexican or Indian funk music playing. Not very relaxing. 

Nobody offered us chips and salsa, even when we went to sit at the bar. We had to ask. The offering of spirits is very, very limited and looks like nobody thought it all the way through. We really wanted to give the place a chance, but the customer service is lacking.

There was a disheveled portly man who appeared to be the manager but barely glanced in our direction. The bartender was a nice girl, but seemed to be confused and rushing around like she had no idea where anything was located. Won&#39;t be back."

Queso was cold when served.   Margarita was mostly mix with little Tequilla.   Place had everyserver mixing their own drinks, and bartender running to kitchen for food orders.  Have bartender tend bar, and servers serve food.   Waited a long period for a beer refill, because bartender was in kitchen and BSing with someone in the table area, rather than tend bar.

Place was not busy - about 6 customers, and they cojuldn&#39;t handle it.  It&#39;s a shame because interior was really welcoming.  But the place needs some serious direction by somebody who knows how to run a restaurant.   Having each server make drinks is a recipe for going broke.....

Some elements of the food are Mexican but the main dishes have an Indian strong taste. Even the place smells like an Indian restaurant. No disrespect. But that are the true facts. I was told the owners are trying to do a different twist to the Mexican food. But doing so completely transforms the essence of the Mexican food into something else.

After another five minutes the waitress finally came up and got our drink orders and brought us our menus.

Walked in to moldy smell. Couldn&#39;t order the first couple drinks we wanted cause they were out. I settled on a margarita.. Beyond a shadow of a doubt THE WORST MARGARITA I&#39;VE EVER EVER EVER HAD. 
The chips and salsa were good. The salsa was actually hot which I truly appreciate. 
My kids had the hot wings and fries. They loved the fries but the wing sauce was basically just poured right outta the bottle. Nothing added to actually make it a wing sauce.
I had the smothered burrito with the carnitas. The meat was good but smothered is a stretch as there was barely any chili. I kept the extra salsa from the chips to make the burrito better.
Went there on a groupon. It was for $15 of food but when waitress returned with my check she only credited me for $10 of the groupon. Had I not caught it I would have over paid that other $5.
Finished fair but even though it&#39;s only five minutes from my home I doubt I&#39;ll ever be back"

We started at Avanti hoping to show our out of town guests it unique choices but only one of the kitchens was open so we decided to look for a different eatery. Luckily a stone&#39;s throw away was Stone on 32nd and basically empty probably because it was a weird hour and only happy hour food was being served. 

Gonzo was our server (he&#39;s also the manager) and was exceptionally accommodating and nice!  

We ordered almost one of each of the food options. Sloppy joe sliders were probably my favourite. They were also able to substitute the Pork in the quesadilla for chicken for one of our Jewish friends. She wanted the sliders but there is a mix of beef and pork in those. (FYI) 

Being that I currently am out of commission for the drinking crowd I was unable to partake in a full beverage, however, I took a tiny sip of the port beer and it was great. 

We look forward to coming back for their brunch now!"

First off, the food is really pretty damn good. The turkey burger and the chicken sandwich were both good enough to merit repeat purchases (turkey burger wins in a shootout) and surprisingly filling.The fries are thin and crispy which usually doesn&#39;t work for me, but these do for some reason. They are perfectly crispy and lightly salted and they give a good amount of them...which is good because they are addictive (as fries tend to be). 

The service, however, leaves something to be desired. Whoever wrote that the people treat you like family must really be family because I didn&#39;t get that sense whatsoever when trying to phone in a to-go order. Apparently it was the owner who took the order, and when he did, he made it seem like a huge inconvenience. Like I was calling his cell phone during his kid&#39;s wedding instead of his restaurant during lunch hours. When I arrive, instead of ringing me up while his bartender runs around and waits on everyone else, they stay in the back and chit chat while I stand there and watch my food get cold. According to the staff, that&#39;s &#34;just the way he is&#34;, which is a peculiar personality for someone running a service-based business. 

Like I said, the food is good but there are a lot of good eateries in this neighborhood. In fact, good food is just the minimum buy-in to survive here as a restaurant. If you want to thrive, you have to value the customers and I didn&#39;t get that sense from Stones."

Not only known for its excellence in comfort food, Stone&#39;s is nestled in a heartwarming area of downtown where the people are like family, and the views are gorgeous for pictures. 
I had the steak frites, mac n cheese, chicken pot pie, and brownie sundae. The attention to detail from the culinary geniuses in the kitchen made every bite a rollercoaster of emotions- from sheer joy to nostalgic reminiscent of grandma&#39;s kitchen. 
The staff makes amazing drinks, and creates a vibe that is relaxing, inviting, and friendly. Regardless of what type of mood you&#39;re in, swing by for a bite or drink. Stone&#39;s is the place to call a home away home."

It&#39;s a casual place with a nice view of the skyline at night. I ordered a spare rib poutine, and it came out pretty cold... limp, soggy fries and globs of congealed cheese curds. Not appetizing at all. On top of that, this plus the other entree had taken what felt like an unusually long time after our salads were delivered - clearly it had been sitting in the window for a spell. IMO, the dish was incredibly oversalted - the meat was tender and delicious but the gravy was super salty, on top of the very-well-salted fries (which were cooked perfect, I will add). Now, I like salt, but it was way too much. Otherwise we got a bison chili and that was tasty, had a nice kick, but the cornbread side was dry and seemed a bit stale. The cocktail menu is small, which is good as I like it when places don&#39;t overreach, but - ??? - there were no brown liquor drinks! It was all vodka, gin, and tequila. Odd?  I will say, I did enjoy the Paloma cocktail, made with tequila, grapefruit juice, and a salted rim. And our waitress was very nice. She was pretty slammed because it seemed like the other waiter took on 1 table while she had everyone else. It was weird. Regardless of all this, I do want to try it again and give &#39;em another shot."

FOOD - 4 STARS
The Poblano Chicken Pot Pie was the best tasting pot pie I&#39;ve ever had - I don&#39;t even really like pot pie but I shared it with my friend and it has converted me to a lover of pot pie, but not sure I&#39;d want to have it anywhere else!  Just a note that the pot pie took quite a while to cook, not sure if there was a delay or each order for the pot pie takes a while.  The Mac &amp; Cheese was also amazing, however the $2 up-charge for the pancetta wasn&#39;t worth it because there was barely any (I guess it was sprinkled on top? I missed it completely.).  And for dessert...the banana bread special was just okay, however GET THE BUTTERSCOTCH MALT.  I live in Centennial and I seriously would drive down to Stones any day to get my shake craving here!  It was sooo good, thick, creamy, and malty!  Yummmmm!  Best malt ever!  And $3 bucks for a small (it&#39;s more than enough) - killer deal!

BEVERAGE - 5 STARS
My friends and I ordered a variety of cocktails throughout the night and each one I tasted was outstanding.  My favorite of them all was the Dr. Who (gin based with maraschino liqueur) - great balance, strong, and not too sweet - just as I like.  The margarita was also phenomenal and the marg-mix was out of this world and unlike I have ever had - very unique flavor and great balance of sweet and salty.  The Husky (remix on a Colorado Bulldog) also a hit!

SERVICE - 5 STARS
Friendly, fun, knowledgeable, and accommodating service.  

PRICE - 3 STARS
A bit more than I can spend on a regular basis.  I couldn&#39;t resist trying the cocktails to give an accurate review of the place, and although they were all PHENOMENAL they were $8-12 each (and the best ones are $12 *ouch*).  Appetizers started at $10 (aside from salad/soup options) and and full-size entrees (rather than small plates &amp; sands) started at $18+. They need some more happy hour specials (like a discount on specialty cocktails). HH well drinks were $3 (not bad), along with wine specials, but I don&#39;t recall any food specials.

LOCATION &amp; PARKING - 5 STARS
So easy, FREE private lot out front on Pecos Street!!

Those shrimp fritters we quite possibly the worst thing I&#39;ve ever been served at a restaurant. I think they may have had dirt as a primary ingredient. My date&#39;s fries were too salty to eat and over fried and greasy to boot. Even the side of ranch was way too salty and I&#39;m the person who will salt my chips sometimes.

**Update** we went back another time and was charged between .25 - .50 for their home made condiments.  As in mayo/mustard for my burger (ketchup was in a bottle).

Veryyyy boring menu and concept as a whole... Poor attempt to do the whole american bar food thing - my favorite was when we inquired abt the country chicken noodle soup... Like what made it country? &#34;Umm its just like, regular chicken noodle soup&#34;... Duh 

Considering there was 1 other table in the restaurant the food also took foreevvverrrrr

The food is delicious, you can tell they put together a quality menu of comfort food and classics. Service was standard. We had the fish and chips and shepherdess&#39; pie. The Sheperd&#39;s Pie was vegetarian, hot and delicious.  The odd part is the pricing structure seems off for the vibe. It&#39;s like modern garage environment, but it was $20 for Fish and Chips $18 for Shepherdess&#39; Pie. I worked in a fish house and we sold Fish and Chips for $13.90. It&#39;s in a great location, so they can probably get away with it. It&#39;s a block away from my house, but it could never be your weekly restaurant.

I love love love the highlands but sometimes the pageantry and aggressive trendiness of the food scene can get to be a bit much.  There is clearly no PR machine or giant restaurant group behind this place.  The secret weapon here is...nice people who make really great food.  

Speaking of the food...damn! A friend and I shared the kale salad, pork green chili fries, and the pot pie.  All top-notch.  Flavors were spot-on and well balanced.  Attention to detail was very high.  I could tell that they worked the kale to get the bitterness out and to make it less chewy, and the fries were carefully composed so that each bite had good stuff on it.  The pot pie was the star of the show, though, with a huge mound of flaky puff pastry and rustic veggies (including poblano peppers - yum!) with big chunks of chicken in a gravy that was silky and flavorful.  Perfection.  I wish I had room for dessert.  

The chef came out half-way through our meal and stopped by every single table to say hi and ask after the food.  I hadn&#39;t realized just from looking at the menu, but they lay out on really high-end ingredients (lots of &#34;organic&#34; and &#34;just down the road at this farm or that ice cream shop&#34; was thrown around) and make everything they possibly can in house.  That being the case, the value for the price was much much higher than other restaurants around.

My one and only gripe is that I wasn&#39;t a fan of the drinks list (full disclosure - I put together restaurant bar and wine programs for a living so I am a tad more critical than most).  The wine section was poorly focused and featured wines that I don&#39;t consider top quality in their price range.  Several things were listed incorrectly or misspelled.  The cocktail list was extensive, and featured lots of spinoffs of the classics.  I will reserve judgment till I try one next time, but running a patron-based feature cocktail when there is SO MUCH amazing tequila out there of higher quality for the price is strike one.  Just saying.  

In summary, EAT HERE NOW! These guys are brand new so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get their drinks on lock soon, and in the mean time, the food is top-notch!"

There were four of us and we all ordered something different so we could taste and compare.  Our son ordered a green chilli appetizers and although I did not taste it the others said it lacked any heat.  When we told our Waiter about this he brought out some pickled peppers but that didn&#39;t make the dish any hotter.  I had a chicken pot pie which was very good, another had the special of the day which included a chicken breast, another fish and chips and the last had a pastrami sandwich.  The biggest complaint would be that all the entrees were between $14-19 each.  I asked Darrell, our Waiter, why there was no pepper on the table and his noncommittal answer was because they had a pepper mill.  Were we offered the pepper?  No.  I don&#39;t think Darrell even wanted to be working that night.  Selections on the menu were very limited.  I am a visitor to Denver but there are a lot of good places to eat.

I had the Com Dac Biet. It&#39;s a combo rice plate with grilled pork chop, pork, chicken, shrimp, egg rolls and fried eggs. $11. I asked the fried eggs to be substituted with shrimps instead. This rice plate is pretty simple. But some places still don&#39;t suit my palette. This place is one of them.  My favorite place just season their food way better.

Despite seemingly large amount of staff in red shirts on a Friday at lunch, and not that terribly busy, it took 7 minutes to get water to the table and that was after asking a busser.

Finally, 10 minutes in, they came to take my order, which I made flawlessly because I had 10 minutes to memorize the menu.

The restaurant was hot. It was winter outside. But the heat was cranked past high. I heard other customers talk about the heat. The restrooms were bright and clean. 

Food arrived. The egg roll was cold. Like made 15 minutes ago cold. There was a hair in my food. Hair in my food doesn&#39;t bother me at all. It happens. But there was a hair in my food. Didn&#39;t appear to be human.

Was clearly finished with the meal and dishes were removed from table. No check arrived. Waited. Always waiting.

The food is consistently good here but the service always lacks. I recommend this place, and I will return, but don&#39;t visit expecting the best of the best. Try it. You&#39;ll be glad you did."

The service was a little off but it&#39;s typical of Vietnamese places. The server was very attentive in the beginning but after realizing we were only ordering one plate, he never came back.

First I will say this, their menu has a variety of options besides just pho or cold noodle bowls. Not enough of these places in Denver in my opinion. Now onto the review. Their pho isn&#39;t my favorite in the city but their Thai style salads and rice paper dishes are some of the best in town. My problem is this. Don&#39;t go late at night past 9pm. The service is slow ( as expected ) and borderline rude at times. The last couple of times I&#39;ve gone past 9pm I was basically shooed out by their hurry up and clean everything rudeness. I get that they all want to go home but is it necessary to mop the dinning area during my meal? Nothing like eating my food that now tastes like pine sol and dirty mop bucket water!! The smell almost put me in a panic attack!! As an ex professional chef, I can&#39;t understand this practice? I would never have allowed mopping while I had customers in the dinning area!! This is the second time this has happened to me. I get off work late and all I wanted was some comfort food!! Very few Vietnamese restaurants stay open past 9pm. Truth is, this place has always had a rude undertone and as much as I appreciate the menu there are two other places on federal with extensive menus, better food all around and friendlier staff. I think the mop bucket and pine sol smell while I&#39;m eating is inexcusable as a paying customer. I&#39;m going to guess that they do not appreciate your business after 9pm and are trying to get you to eat and leave. I get the hint. No need to be rude about it. Maybe you should close before 10pm? This is why I&#39;m an ON AND OFF again customer."

It took over 20 minutes for anyone to really acknowledge that we were sitting there. We just got done talking about leaving when a server magically appeared! I should also add that she never really returned either. The only time we could even grab her attention was to ask for the check. Our server walked by us numerous times without even glancing our way when we said &#34;Excuse me, ma&#39;am!&#34;. We went almost the whole meal without drinks. This alone irritates me!

Let me first start out by saying that I have eaten here several times and did enjoy the food, and I even decided to overlook the poor service because of the food. On one occasion a waiter put his dirty fingers INTO my glass of water after clearing away other people&#39;s dirty dishes and grabbed the glass by the lip to make room on the table, but I overlooked it because I like this place. 

However this last time we found a DEAD FLY in a dipping sauce, which means the entire vat of sauce had been contaminated. The staff acted like it was no big deal and continued to serve the sauce to other customers!!! They said there was nothing they could do to prevent against flies getting into the food &#34;because its summer&#34;. 

This is unacceptable and disgusting. If you have no problem with poor food safety standards, then this might be a place you will enjoy. Otherwise find somewhere else to eat."

All 4 of us had to be at the cashier and pay at once.  Today my dinner took so long to come out my buddy was done with his meal and plate cleared before mine even came out.  I asked for mine to go.

Service: The restaurant was not too busy after 1pm on Sunday. We were seated promptly, but had to wait 10 minutes before someone came to take our orders. The vegetables and sauce came out quickly, then my dish came first. I started eating while my partner waited for his. We were also watching the Rio games on TV, so I took my time eating my dish. Halfway through my dish, my partner&#39;s dish was no where to be seen; our waitress had seemed to completely forgotten about us. I had tried first to look her way in an attempt to make eye contact; however that was unsuccessful. I walked up to the counter where boss man stood. He said he would check on it. Then waitress came to our table, told us that the dish was finished but had a &#34;bad smell&#34; so they had to make a new one. She asked me to be understandable since we were all Vietnamese (meaning I should expect less-than-subpar service?).  At this point, my partner was already h-angry and this new information  had our eyebrows raised about the quality of the food, we decided to cancel the order. My partner asked to talk to the owner, seeing that he was just standing behind the counter. However, no one came. When I walked up to pay my bill, he had disappeared, leaving the waitress there, who now said she is the one overseeing the restaurant, and that the owner does not deal with these things. Since I cannot directly communicate to the owner himself, I&#39;ve decided to take it to online reviews. 

To the OWNER: -In the restaurant business, there will be incidents where your customers are not happy with the food, the service, etc. I do not expect amazing food and service every time. However, the least you can  do is to be receptive to feedback, good or bad, and be able to handle it in the most professional manner. Avoiding, and leaving your waitress to be the scapegoat is not it. I can think of a handful of Vietnamese restaurants from Saigon Bowl (Federal), Pho 888 (Aurora), Top Pho (Aurora) to Saigon Basil (Northglenn) whose owners really know how to handle their businesses, that maybe you can take tips from."

On my most recent, and probably last visit, service was painfully slow and completely inattentive. 
I ordered seafood soup which was served in a hot pot;  the waiter brought a ridiculously tiny bowl which was totally inadequate to spoon the soup into. He then disappeared and 10 minutes went by before I could request that he bring me a proper sized soup bowl.
The soup itself was bland and the seafood tough from being overlooked.
It&#39;s always painful to experience ones favorite place hit the skids of mediocrity; and so it goes.
Maybe when enough customers cease patronizing this establishment the owners will be intelligent enough to rectify their service, pricing and quality issues."

However, service is not great, they seat you at a table and leave you there far too long. By the time they get to your table you are ready to take your whole order. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants long enough to know this leads to terrible customer service.

My suggestion is they train their servers on etiquette and processes, otherwise the food is good."

I find this to be true for a lot of people who enjoy Vietnamese and Pho establishments.  We pretend to look at the menu and talk about choices and specials and when it comes time to order we choose the same dish we always do.  We like to think we&#39;ll choose differently if we flip through the menu and talk about all the various options but on the inside we want the same comforting dish we have loved from the first time we ordered it long ago.

At Saigon Bowl, the dish I love is the Bun Dac Biet ($8.49), Combo Noodle Bowl with butterflied grilled shrimp, marinated pork, grilled chicken &amp; egg rolls. The pickled daikon and carrots add a nice hint of vinegar and the minced peanuts add a crunchy texture to the entire dish.  I could easily have this dish once a week.  

Some of the best Vietnamese food in Denver can be found on Federal Blvd. and Saigon Bowl is one of my go to places."

We would drive almost an hour and a half at least twice a month just to get our fix, sometimes more. However with new Vietnamese restaurants opening up closer to home we have not been to Saigon Bowl in a few months. This weekend since we were around the area we decided to stop by. 

We ordered our usual Combination Pho, egg rolls and Grilled Pork rice plate. I am not sure if maybe since we have been trying other Vietnamese restaurants our taste pallet changed , but we were a bit under whelmed. The meat in the pho was dry and a little tough. The egg rolls changed. They are now bigger , but taste like any other Vietnamese egg roll. We use to drive up to this place just for the egg rolls as they tasted home made to us. The grilled pork also was nothing special and tastes like any standard pork entree we can order from any Vietnamese restaurant. We know the owners changed some time back so that could be why the change. I do have to say that the staff was very friendly and attentive unlike before so this was a nice change. 

Overall the place we use to crave has morphed into the standard Vietnamese restaurant. Most likely will just stay close by for our Vietnamese fix."

I&#39;m not an expert Pho connoisseur, but I&#39;ve had my share of pho, and I think theirs is great. The take-out pho is very convenient: they put the broth in a separate container, and all the other ingredients into another box, so you can combine them when you get home. You can even heat up the broth again to make for hot fresh pho. The meat was sliced very thin and tender, easy to eat in the soup. The medium size was enormous, plenty for one person. 

I have not eaten in the restaurant yet, but it looks like a nice big place with lots of tables, and it&#39;s been very busy both times when I&#39;ve picked up my order.

As a common courtesy, you are to wait until all the food arrives before digging in. Well we waited a good long while for one dish until we asked for it, it was then brought out as if it was forgotten and sitting under the heat lamp. Our table also ordered drinks that never ever arrived. Before we got our check, we decided to cancel it because we got drinks to go with our dinner and obviously we never got them.

When we ordered, in Vietnamese, it was awkward and the server looked super annoyed like he had to deal with us.

Our group of four enjoyed several appetizers!  First up, traditional spring rolls with peanut sauce, yum!!  Next was a cold duck salad puled high with duck, cabbage, lettuce, bell peppers and a delicious light sauce for dressing.  My favorite course was the nems, little meatballs served with rice noodles and garnishes, served with rice papers that were cooked at the table top in hot water so we could roll our own spring rolls- yum!

This place gets 5 stars for its delicious food. I am taking off a star because when they are busy, they are understaffed and it takes a while to even get some straws/extra plates and bowls. 

My boyfriend and I come here almost weekly especially because I used to work around here every weekend. This is hands down one of the best places for authentic Vietnamese food in Denver region. Forget the boring old pho when you visit! I always get #147 Banh Xeo (might be spelling this wrong) but it&#39;s the Vietnamese crepe filled with pork, shrimp, bean sprouts pan fried in an egg crepe. It&#39;s MASSIVE and delicious and comes with lettuce and pickled daikon and carrots and cucumbers. We always ask for rice paper on the side so we can wrap it up (reduce mess and it&#39;s like a spring roll!). Try this dish! 

Another dish we get is Bun Rieu which is this hearty, slightly spicy soup filled with clear, round noodles, tomatoes, meatballs, and crab. It&#39;s filled with flavor and I even drink the soup afterwards (oops sodium overload). 

Bottom line: come here for some traditional, authentic vietnamese cuisine you can&#39;t find in stores like pho 79, 888 etc. You will go home satisfied!"

While the portions were generous I found the pho broth cloudy, lacking in flavor and not very aromatic. The consistency of the noodles was the best part of my bowl: soft and gummy but not soggy.

The presentation of the herb dish was the deal breaker for me. No saw leaf herb, basil and mint leaves tossed together with wanton disregard for pho propriety!

However among the good places, this is as good as it gets in terms of price, tastiness, good customer service, and an overall good meal.

There are many different dishes to choose from, from Pho to rice bowls you can never really go wrong, but the dish that you must get if your party is greater than two is the #160, the platter of the restaurant. Beef egg rolls, chicken, beef, fried shrimp paste, and softshell crab come out with a heaping helping of veggies and wraps, and you wonder to yourself why there aren&#39;t more places selling this food. Every thing on that dish is delicious and if you don&#39;t care for one protein, there are others to choose from.

As a popular place, there is sometimes a line, but the well trained staff is attentive, fast, and will fulfill your order, clean the table, and make sure that the water is never below half a glass. They are all great employees and have made our experience great every single time.

I was very excited to see Vietnamese food and a Vietnamese market. At last, a place that feels a bit like home (San Jose) to me (though it still felt a bit like Westminster in SoCal because of the two story buildings. 

Nevertheless, I felt at home. Because for the first time in two weeks I got to eat Vietnamese food. I took the waitresses recommendation and tried the $20 Dong Khanh special appetizer sampler spring rolls that came with cucumbers, pickled carrots, lettuce, cilantro, noodles, deep fried soft shell crab, egg roll like meat pieces, and various other cuts of meat. It was served with spring roll rice paper wraps and nuoc mam. 

I also tried the canh chua which I thought was nice, sweet, sour and full of fish with no bones (catfish)! I enjoyed the vegetables in them and it was made even better than my own mom&#39;s.

I tried a goi (Vietnamese papaya salad) that came with shrimp and beef. It wasn&#39;t too strong in nuoc mam flavor. It was nice and citrusy. 

I also tried two other stir fry dishes. One was chicken with vegetables and the other had crab. 

Five dishes for five people (with leftovers) ended up being around $140. 

I had a deeply satisfying meal with my family and Dong Khanh is my first glimpse into the feeling of home away from home. 

The decor inside is fancier than other Vietnamese restaurants with padded booth chairs and a nice small aquarium. It can get pretty crowded during Friday around dinner time.

I look forward to coming here with other Vietnamese-foodies who are new to town."

My family sat down in a  booth in a corner, where we received water within less than 5 minutes but then waited nearly 15+ minutes until a waiter/server noticed that no one took our orders.

The menu is reasonably priced and almost everything comes in a large portion, which is good for sharing with young kids who are picky eaters.

Food came out within 5 minutes of placing our orders. Husband and I both chose the rice noodle bowl w/ grilled pork and egg rolls. Quite tasty with lots of fresh vegetables.

I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;re supposed to go to the front counter to pay but we waited for our check for quite awhile until our kids became impatient..

I hadn&#39;t been in a few months and heard they had changed ownership, but we returned and were delighted as usual!! Sooo tasty!

I recomend a 33 (Vietnamese lager) and a #140 (I think). It is a big appetizer (2-5 people big) in which you compose your own &#39;spring&#39; rolls with various meats, fried treats and veggies. Man oh man is this the tasties grub! I love it and if there are any left overs, they reheat well too! 

We have sampled their extensive menu and pretty much everything is amazing! It is super ethnic, but there are descriptions in English and pictures for a lot of dishes too. 

The gold star on top is that it is super affordable! Spend $15 each for a couple of drinks and a huge great meal and feel like you have traveled to an exotic land! Good stuff!"

Yet another reason to trust the reviews on Yelp, because I wouldn&#39;t have even noticed this place if I hadn&#39;t used Yelp to find some delicious Asian food.

We had noodles and a delicious appetizer covered with excellent seafood. The service was attentive and exact. The prices are reasonable and make you wonder why you&#39;d ever go to a chain restaurant again. The only downside is the parking, which is limited. The neighborhood isn&#39;t that great either, if that is something you need in your restaurant experience. But, all and all, it&#39;s a must go for your next craving of Asian food."

I&#39;ve always wanted to try their chow fun (WHY is it so hard to find places in Denver that serve chow fun???) but I can never manage to stray away from ordering the pho. I&#39;ve tried both the chicken and the rare steak pho and think I prefer the steak- it&#39;s always perfectly thin and never fatty. Their broth is good and they are always more than generous with the add-ins like cilantro, sprouts, and jalapenos. Plus, it&#39;s crazy cheap! Only $5.50 for a small bowl, which always manages to fill me up. I&#39;ve also tried the Vietnamese egg rolls and a handful of other appetizers, all of which have been substantial and good. In fact, the only thing I&#39;ve had from here that was disappointing is the avocado boba. I love avocado- and boba- but sweet baby Jesus this was disgusting. The rest of the flavors are fine though.

The service is not what I would call remarkable but it&#39;s better than some other pho places I&#39;ve been to. For example, they actually refill your water and provide you with chopsticks! Revolutionary stuff. 

A reliable spot to come for a cheap and delicious meal."

No one forgot our order three times and overall we had much better service on this second visit. Everything I ordered was solid. Bumping this from 2 to 4 stars. 


Food was pretty good, probably 3.5 stars, and while it takes really bad service to get a bad review from me they hit the mark. 

We ordered using the numbers they have on their menu due to my inability to pronounce Bahn Xeo and other words correctly. Then we don&#39;t see any server for half an hour. We do see everyone else who came in at the same time we did finishing their meals. We grab someone&#39;s attention and they find our server who comes back and he says what did you order again? He brings us a menu and we give him the numbers again. In the next 5 minutes he comes back 2 more times to get our order again. About 10 minutes later we get our Bahn Xeo app and when it arrives he says it&#39;s &#34;worth the wait&#34; like we ordered a deep dish pizza that had to bake for 45 minutes and not a crepe that takes 5 minutes to make. The server is the reason we waited and not the kitchen. Not once did he apologize or even acknowledge he forgot to put in our order for half an hour. 

The icing on the cake is that my lady got the wrong entree on top of the really long wait. As we were running late we didn&#39;t even bother to try and correct it. 

But surely the owners would care. They don&#39;t. The place is busy and runs like a machine. As we pay the bill we tell the female owner/manager up front about our experience and she gives a quick I&#39;m sorry like we had told her we prefer a different type of basil than the one they offer. She swipes our card and we leave. 

I wanted to like this place and I may be back one day but probably not. Bad service every once in a while happens, but owners or managers who don&#39;t give a shit is unforgivable."

The black mushroom and chicken, crispy fish and of course the appetizer platter that lets you make your own spring rolls right a the table.  It comes with a several meats and a variety of veggies and herbs.   But I think I have only had one bad meal here and have been here well over 50 times.

I unfortunately did not have a chance to visit while under the old ownership. A buddy talked it up and upon hearing how I had never been, insisted that we go for lunch. He hadn&#39;t been in a few months and when we walked in he commented on how he didn&#39;t recognize any of the staff. Doing a bit of quick reading here, we find out that the ownership had changed.

Under the new steward the pho broth isn&#39;t as tasty as Pho Duy just down the street. The broth just doesn&#39;t have the same kick to it. Aside from lack of mouth feel, there&#39;s also the missing hint of star anise.

I was however, impressed by the appetizer platter, or &#34;build your own spring roll&#34; dish which was varied and quite delicious.

I&#39;d come back again, but from those I&#39;ve spoken with, it&#39;s not the same as its former self (a shame)."

Okay, now that that&#39;s behind me.  I will have to echo Frances G&#39;s opinion on the carpeting.  I see the Cosby sweater and I also see a little Saved By The Bell in it as well.  Come on, man....  Let&#39;s try to bring this restaurant into the 90&#39;s.  You may as well put the Girbaud logo, or Stussy or even Vuarnet and even that would be an update to the look.  But we&#39;re not here to judge the carpet (oops, too late) we&#39;re here for the Phood.

It&#39;s a cold day in Denver (well, this is relative to the 60-70 degree weather we&#39;ve been having in Dallas) and we get off the plane to find that it&#39;s 15 degrees out.  That&#39;s before windchill.  We get in our stone cold rental cars and get moving and the Yelp search monkey gives us a ton of choices in the airport.  Bzzz.  Nope, we gotta get outta Dodge and find a place to eat away from the airport.  We pick a place out in Arvada since it&#39;s on the outskirts of town and low and behold it&#39;s Dong Khanh!  (yes, it makes me smile every time I even think it).

I&#39;ll start with the good.  The place is pretty clean.  It&#39;s not hole-in-the-wall dirty, at least.  

Okay, okay.. the food.  I got the Tai Nam Gau which is steak, flank and brisket.  First off the brisket is a little too tough for me.  The broth is rather tasty.  Much more flavor than the Pho I&#39;ve gotten in Dallas.  The rest of it was quite good, though the temperature of the soup was a little too cold.  I put the bean sprouts in and they never cooked.  My Vietnamese friend got a signature dish that she said if  it was good, it was the sign of a good Vietnamese restaurant.  If they couldn&#39;t make that dish, then everything else was suspect.  When she took her first bites, she said they made it well and she was impressed.

The place has a good amount of tables but we were there around lunch and quickly realized that they&#39;re spaced a little too close.  It wasn&#39;t particularly cramped while you&#39;re sitting there but it&#39;s a little tight if you need to stand up.

Then we go up to pay and when I say I got the #67 (?) the guy says, okay, that&#39;ll be $4.95 + $2 for the extra noodles.  Uh.. no.  The menu said it was $1 extra for extra noodles.  And he argues with me.  Then I show him the menu and he basically shrugs it off as if it was a typo.  He does charge me properly but he made it seem like I was asking him to comp my food.  Weird."

He&#39;d not had any since being here 4 years ago and was really looking forward to it. I got the vegetarian with tofu; he got the meatball. We split some spring rolls. Spring rolls were typical and good enough. My friend, 6&#39;2&#34; and hungry left 80% of his Pho in the bowl - just couldn&#39;t put one more bite in his mouth. I tasted his and had to agree. The broth tasted like something from Lipton freeze-dried instant soup fame, but worse. My broth was the same, flavorless, weak, pathetic. Years ago, when you got Pho, it came with vegetables stuffed in the bowl along with the meat. His soup was watered down water with mystery-meat slop. There are much better places to get Pho. Don&#39;t waste your time, money or palate on this place."

I had the lamb chomps, which were well cooked and came with a sweet  sauce, a veggie slaw salad, and rice. The portion was good and what I would expect considering the price ($18) and restaurant. Overall, a very satisfying dish.

I also had a Sour Sop boba tea. The flavor was good, but the boba were either mush or frozen. Also, the menu on the table indicates that all boba teas are $4, but when the bill came, it was $5. I was told this was because Sour Sop (and Durian) are more expensive. Fine, I can understand that, but then please correct your menu or tell me ahead of time.

I did not have a single consistent waiter, instead switching between at least 3 different guys. Not a big deal, and most were friendly, but it felt a little impersonal and some of the guys were a little aloof.

Be advised that the restaurant is not in the greatest area. I was confronted by a homeless guy right in front of the restaurant entrance upon leaving. Again, not a big deal, just be aware of it."
saigon-bowl-denver-3,Flora H.,bVthsfeUU3Bd5AeJLqKT-w,"West Hollywood, CA",1,1,0,3252,26,fsGUbU169hcvKdH1dxBNjA,5.0,2011-12-19,"My sister and I were in Denver just for the weekend, and after a weekend of stuffing ourselves mad (thanks to all the great recommendations from yelp! that kept us very full of very good food our whole time there), we opted for something a little bit lighter and decided to go for Vietnamese for our last dinner in the city. We searched yelp! for the highest rated Asian restaurants within 5 miles of downtown, and #1 was Dong Khanh Restaurant. Sold!

As we got closer to the restaurant, we started seeing a lot of Asian-y type restaurants and grocery stores and realized that we were in for a really authentic Vietnamese experience. Having been to Vietnam and had really authentic food before, I was super excited.  The restaurant was located inside of a strip mall, and there was a line pouring out the door (at around 7 pm on a Sunday night).  A large portion of the people inside the restaurant were Asian, which is always a good sign for an Asian restaurant (I&#39;m Asian so let me tell you, that&#39;s something that we look for). But there was a large amount on non-Asian people, which shows just how good this place is that even non-Asians know about it.

Despite the long line, we were seated in about 15 minutes (got to love the efficiency of Asian restaurants!).  The menu is overwhelming and deciding what to order is nearly impossible.  I was so overwhelmed that I deferred to my sister - I simply couldn&#39;t decide. She made great choices (although I am convinced that there wasn&#39;t a bad choice to make):

A soup with a little bit of everything - duck, chicken, fish balls, shrimp.. 
Do-it-yourself spring rolls with chicken

I&#39;ve had a lot of soup in my life, Asian, non-Asian, you name it, and the broth of their soup is probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. It was really flavorful and you didn&#39;t have that feeling like you just needed to add a little pepper, or a little soy sauce, or a little whatever... it was already perfect.

The do-it-yourself springs rolls were also delicious, and really fun! My sister couldn&#39;t believe I had never done it before. They bring out all the ingredients you need to make a vietnamese spring roll - the paper (which you dip in hot water to make soft), the sprouts, the veggies, and the chicken, which was, a-ma-zing. I don&#39;t know HOW they cook their chicken but I wish I did because it was just the right amount of tenderness with a slightly crispy outside... I&#39;m getting hungry just thinking about it.

Like mentioned by others, the portions are HUGE, which is too bad only because it means you can&#39;t order more things to try.  After stuffing ourselves silly (yet again), we were left with about two big styrofoam boxes to take with us. And to give you an idea of just how good the food was, my sister carried the leftovers with her as her carry-on on the plane from Denver to LA. No joke.

And the bill? $20 for both of us.

I also have to call out the amazing SERVICE. One thing that you can&#39;t count on from an Asian restaurant is western style service. You get authentic food, and that usually comes with authentic service, if you know what I mean. But here, they had the whole thing down to a science. My glass of water was constantly being refilled, our order was taken promptly and the food came out just as promptly, and as soon as they saw that we were done eating, they had to-go boxes ready for us.

When I started writing this review, I had given this place four stars, but I&#39;m bumping it up to five. I really don&#39;t have a bad thing to say about it, and it&#39;s the best Vietnamese I&#39;ve had outside of Vietnam. Heck, it might even be as good as the food I had in Vietnam.

We already made plans to go back here next time we are in Denver. Can&#39;t wait!"

I always bring enough friends to share the family-style dinner on the last page, which I simply cannot recommend enough!  The sour soup has a great presentation and truly unique flavor. Everyone I bring always agree that the highlight is the baked fish.  My personal favorite is the shrimp &amp; pork salad, which also is a uniquely refreshing mix of cool and sweet with what I think is house-made fish sauce. Sometimes there&#39;s also jellied fish (&#34;jellyfish&#34; on the menu), which sounds weird but is actually awesome.

Then there are several other dishes that change depending on how many people you have, and you can sometimes substitute other dishes if you want.

Anyway, this place is absolutely amazing vietnamese cuisine at extremely reasonable prices.  Go here with friends!"

The service is always impeccable and friendly. Sometimes there is a wait, but that&#39;s because the food is just THAT GOOD.

Food: Good, we almost always get one of the make your own spring roll platters as it makes for a fun, interactive dining experience.  Another plus about the platters is that they are generally pretty quick about getting them to your table.  

Drinks: Pretty much limited to pilsner style lagers. Since those tend to go well with Vietnamese food, I&#39;m not going to complain.  They also have Boba drinks, including taro, my favorite.

Service:  Usually pretty darn good.  You may be waited on by 5 different people and somehow nothing gets lost in communication.  If it&#39;s really busy they may forget about you but it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to wave someone down there.

Price: 9-15 dollars for most entrees.  The Dong Kanh appetizer platter may be 22 bucks, but it alone can feed 3 people.

Bang for your buck: One of the best in denver

What&#39;s it like?  Raucous atmosphere in a good way.  They often have big groups of people having a fun meal."

But it&#39;s another to simultaneously blown away by their delicious pho with a robust and flavorful broth whilst contemplating if the multicolored carpet that looks like it belongs in an office building circa 1978 was a good idea. Nevertheless, the menu - although extensive and a tad overwhelming - delivered some damn good eats. Based on the large crowd and the lack of open seats, I quickly realized I was not alone when it came to being a fan of Dong Khanh.

First being the Vietnamese egg rolls: Delicious spring rolls wrapped in the rice paper and paired with a deliciously spicy sauce. The second dish to arrive shortly after was the pho entrees, which were in and of themselves to keep your hunger satisfied for hours to come; however the toppings and pho acrutramol that usually accompanies the Vietnamese dish were incredibly generous portions. Almost too much as I felt wasteful to merely make a dent in all the fresh ingredients, but believe you me - I kicked ass in finishing every last bite, slurp, and sip of that giant bowl of soup."

Is it not common sense to bring out all dishes together or within a few minutes of each other?  I&#39;m not going to eat while the person I am with sits there with just a pot of rice in front them.

Souvlaki Sandwich
Gyro Sandwich

I really enjoyed the food here!!! For a Diner that&#39;s open 24/7 I&#39;m pretty sure there is no place that&#39;s as good as Pete&#39;s.... No, actually I&#39;m positive! Everything taste fresh and homemade, even the fries were bomb (I&#39;m a bit of a health nut, but these were too good to pass up). 

Service is great, although very busy at times. The environment is a bit divey and loud, but to be fair, suiting for a place in this location. 

Do try if you&#39;re in Denver!!"

Pete&#39;s takes on a different character at different times of day -- early morning breakfast crowd (people just starting their day, the newspaper readers, families, people who just finished partying).. lunch/dinner crowd (a bit slower but still a tad packed with locals and those on lunch break and enjoying casual dining and then the evening, late night and after hours Pete&#39;s = controlled mayhem!  

Anyway - the breakfast is great, the service is great... everything is run efficiently... the portions are impressive and the prices are very very fair!   Chicken fried steak and eggs, pancakes are my favorite...  and right up with that is the Souvlaki salad or just plain old souvlaki with tzatziki sauce - hands down best bang for your buck and incredibly delicious..... 

Every seat In the house affords you a different experience - sit at the kitchen bar and watch the chefs orchestrate 10s of orders at once and enjoy shooting the breeZe with your neighbor, the booths in the middle are great as well - high traffic great service... my favorite (if you have a bigger party with you) is the giant crescent shaped booth in the back ---- the best for sight seeing and enjoying all that is Pete&#39;s Kitchen!"

I would inject this stuff from Pete&#39;s into my veins and I hate needles nor do I do drugs.. even legal ones but dude. For real. Me vs. Taztziki= defeat in this match up.

The late night scene is energetic and once the bars close, people are still in the mood for a solid meal! Therefore just like everyone else, we sought out one of the most popular late night restaurants in town. Since Pete&#39;s is open 24/7 we were pretty excited to grab a meal well after midnight!

Pete&#39;s Kitchen is located in Downtown Denver on East Colfax Avenue, between Race Street and High Street. You can&#39;t miss the brightly lit neon sign outside with a chef flipping pancakes! There is a private lot behind the restaurant with plenty of parking or you can park along the busy street.

We walked inside well after midnight and couldn&#39;t help but notice just how busy this place was. An armed security guard was socializing with staff and guests throughout the night. Every time people paid their bill, he was always near the cash register to make sure that there weren&#39;t any issues. He wasn&#39;t intimidating at all and I found him to be quite personable.

The restaurant is very small but somehow accommodated guests quite well. It reminded me of a hip record shop with old photos from accomplishments over the years. Large exposed piping reminiscent of Chicago lofts hung above each table. There were two rows of booths, one along the wall and one down the center of the restaurant. You could also sit at the counter on bar stools next to the owner(s) who happened to show up that night.

The menu consists of a lot of breakfast items as well as fried food offerings. Keeping it simple, I chose shrimp and fries. Unfortunately, getting the shrimp grilled instead of fried wasn&#39;t an option. This is an old school diner where waistline conscious people probably wouldn&#39;t dine. However, I was hungry and just wanted to eat!

Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes and we were impressed with the generous serving size. I haven&#39;t seen that much shrimp on one plate in years! They were fried to a crisp with a thick coating of batter! My fries were ok, a little greasy but not too bad. 

I can see why Pete&#39;s is so popular with locals. It&#39;s always open, people are very friendly, and the food is with worth your money. The convenient location is great because it&#39;s away from the bars but still in a busy part of Downtown Denver. So if you want to grab a late night/early morning meal before heading home after a night on the town, Pete&#39;s is perfect for you."

We decided to go to Pete&#39;s Kitchen this morning for breakfast. We haven&#39;t been to Pete&#39;s in quite a while. We were not disappointed.

I had my usual of bacon and eggs, over easy, with wheat toast. The eggs were cooked just right, the potatoes were both crispy and soft. The toast was nicely buttered.  I enjoyed my breakfast, sitting there, enjoying the atmosphere as well. My husband had the same thing, and his was good too.

The interior of Pete&#39;s Kitchen, is your typical diner. It&#39;s comfortable, and inviting, ad it calls you in, to take a load off your feet, and enjoy a good meal.  Conversation is easy, the employees are friendly, the interior is clean (even the restrooms!), and there is parking  in the back and on the side. Bright interior with plenty of windows to look out on to Colfax and watch the rest of the world pass by as you enjoy your meal. 

Pete&#39;s Kitchen is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so it doesn&#39;t matter what your work hours are,  Pete&#39;s Kitchen is there to warm you heart as well as your stomach. The menu is good, with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. You should be able to find something to help fill your needs.

Take care, and Thank you, Pete&#39;s for all of your service and stability, through all these years.  Enjoy!"

An angry customer berated them and yelled at them while no body working at Pete&#39;s said a word to this person. No one asked him to stop and no one asked them to leave.

I&#39;m not from Denver so I&#39;m surprised by how few 24 hours or late night food places there are here because Pete&#39;s Kitchen is one of the few options.
Luckily, our party of 7 didn&#39;t have a wait time. I got the veggie pita, minus the cheese, which was the only potential vegan option. However, you don&#39;t go to a late night place like this and expect tons of vegan options. That being said, I&#39;m surprised that falafel is not an offering, given the Mediterranean influenced menu. My waitress misheard me and thought I asked for my meal with &#34;no pita&#34; instead of &#34;no feta&#34; so my meal was incorrect but she was super sweet and apologized and fixed it. She also was awesome and did separate checks for our party of seven, which I know can be a nuisance at times. My (correct) food tasted ok, the veggies were ehh but the fries were awesome!

Maybe I&#39;ve caught you on a bad night when everyone wasn&#39;t feeling too hot, or this night wasn&#39;t meant to be. It is 4:30am thus far, we dined in around an hour ago. Now, I&#39;m going to review this restaurant based on my knowledge of past experiences in dining, as well as me being as unbiased as I can. Entering it was a little awkward. The counter lady wasn&#39;t my favorite since the entire visit. She was this older lady with blonde wavy hair. She told my party of two, to sit down. She was nonchalant and didn&#39;t bother to get out of her counter to kindly sit us down. Instead we felt lost? We needed to know where exactly where to sit. Loud music was blaring and she had this annoying low voice so we couldn&#39;t hear her at all. We chose to be away from the crowded dining hall- Biggest mistake everywhere. We were completely forgotten about. I understand it was 3:14 A.M, you&#39;re tired and exhausted Melissa, but you completely ditched us, girl. We had to hunt her down about 3 times. She was sweet, but oblivious. That, or she didn&#39;t care. The food was astonishing and it came out in a matter of 10 minutes. After my orange juice was done, no one offered me a refill at all!! But Melissa was quick to hand off our check. Didn&#39;t offer any dessert, more napkins, or refills. I was pretty impatient at this point. She said the chocolate cake would be on her, I felt terrible but later on agreed. Sweet of her, I felt like giving Melissa a second chance and she made our experience a tad bit better. The rest of the atmosphere sucked at Pete&#39;s Kitchen! The workers didn&#39;t have the decency to respect their guests, by coming in and out and filling up the room of tables where we exactly dined at with smoking from cigarettes. It&#39;s unprofessional of them smoking like that in front of us guests. I personally felt disrespected when even Melissa was taking this looooong smoke break. The to go box took forever. 

At the end of the night, we waited and waited and waited again for hunting her down, only to realize there&#39;s no proper communication going on. Turns out, we&#39;re supposed to go up to the counter where we would pay our food. and what do you know: Melissa was sat down in the middle of these two other counter women and again, the bland and straight faces of these women were obnoxious!! I can&#39;t stand that older lady with blonde curly or wavy hair in the black top. Rude as hell. Simply by giving me an under the table smirk and attitude. Melissa was great, but the service needs improvement. Food was 10/10 but the service was so mediocre that I completely forgot about the dining meals. All I can say is that the food made me feel tired, it was heavy in grease and more grease. But it was strangely delicious! Good food but wouldn&#39;t not come again. Simply because of the service."

Not another word was said, we immediately got in the car and drove up to the &#39;Fax.

I would have to say the worst thing about Pete&#39;s is the lack of coordination during busy times. We arrived behind a few other groups, and clustered into the very small vestibule and area around the cash register. This place is TINY, and cramped in all possible aspects, so expect to feel very in-the-way when waiting for a table. No one takes names, so you can&#39;t just put yourself on a list and wait outside; instead, you have to inconvenience every single waiter, waitress, and diner trying to move around the front of the restaurant. Also, if you wait in line, be aware that people still might try to hop it and snag a table being prepared for you, as happened to us. I told E we should just go sit down with the offenders and tell them that although they hadn&#39;t been invited, they were more than welcome to share our table, but E wasn&#39;t feeling particularly gracious (or uppity) so we just waited and waited some more. 

Now let&#39;s get to the great part of this place - the food. Pete&#39;s has the same familiar diner menu as a lot of other greasy spoons, but with a Greek flare. Anyone who knows the city knows that Pete was one of Denver&#39;s biggest restaurant moguls and voices of the Greek community back in his day. Sadly, he passed away a few years ago, but I have fond memories of him trying to pushily sell me asparagus in his grocery store off of Leetsdale. Pete left behind a veritable empire of businesses around town, all with varying degrees of delectability, but the Kitchen is definitely our favorite. We love the hash browns (perfectly crispy), the coffee (not too strong and not too weak), and the rotating spit of gyro meat that sits behind the breakfast counter. And anything you can get with that meat in it is sure to tickle your fancy. My favorite breakfast item has got to be the gyro breakfast sandwich, with scrambled eggs and a huge portion of gyro meat in a warm pita with tzatziki sauce on the side. It also comes with hash browns, and for $8.95, it&#39;s one of the best and most filling breakfast deals in town.

I definitely have the goal of trying Pete&#39;s for something other than breakfast, and I love the fact that I can go there anytime I want thanks to the fact that they&#39;re open 24 hours. 

Although nothing else particularly stands out off the menu from what I&#39;ve eaten over the years, nothing has ever been disappointing either. At the least, it&#39;s been average - and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!! Now please excuse me while I go daydream about gyros..."

Its like I get off work and I have 3 options- Waffle House, which is nowhere close, King Soopers, where I get accused of theft, or a 24 hour gas station.  Really? This is how I get to wind down after a 12+ hour day?

Then, one of my employees told about a 24 hr diner near my place that served hearty portions and tasted pretty good.  So, I did my research, and decided to head out one night after work.  

The first thing I noticed that I appreciated was plenty of free parking- don&#39;t see that often.  The next thing I noticed was you need to put some &#34;oomph&#34; in it when opening the doors- and make sure your face doesn&#39;t get in the way.  I have seen some noggins get whacked when entering!

It is a cozy diner, complete with a heated patio, booths, and a counter.  Before seating yourself, greet the cashier and the old school cash register (don&#39;t worry, they still accept credit).  

My first visit I took my employees recommendation of the breakfast burrito smothered in green chile and cheese.  Trust me, Yelpers posted plenty of pics.  I got mine with the gyro meat.  Oh yea, I forgot to mention when you get seated they give you water.  There is a reason for it.  They either know I just came from work, or they have use a lot of sodium.  I go through 2-3 glasses a visit here, sober. 

The burrito was the bomb, and filling.  However, I usually end up getting a gyro sandwich for dessert.  

And yes, they get disappointed if I don&#39;t get a second entree when I come in!  Then again, I usually come here on an empty stomach. 

During certain times and nights this place does fill up with the drunks, but I have yet to see anything over the top.  

The people are friendly, the food comes out quick, there is a lot of it, and I have yet to throw up after eating it.  Looks like I will keep coming back!"

I think had we not wanted to try a couple other places in town we would have eaten here everyday for every meal during our visit.

Open 24 hours. Lots of diner selections on the menu. Everything from burgers to T-Bone steaks. But let me just say &#34;breakfast burrito&#34;. That is all. Order it every time you go here and go here all the time. $9...with ham, hash browns and a couple of scrambled eggs.They wrap all that in a tortilla and smother it in cheese and American or green chili - get the green. Just do it!!

This is the kind of diner you want on the corner of your street. Quick service, experienced short order cooks, line out the door on Sunday mornings, families and single folks sitting at the counter on the little round stools. 

And don&#39;t leave without getting a shake. When you see $5 for a shake you may pass on it. Don&#39;t. It was ice cream and milk and actual chocolate syrup drizzled down the inside of the glass. Topped with a ton of whipped cream and sprinkles - yes, sprinkles! It was exactly like you want it to be. Old fashioned, calorie filled heaven. Take a date here and share this.

I really would become a regular if I lived in Denver."

I&#39;m not sure why I don&#39;t just go with a 5-star; maybe i hope that I&#39;ll find the perfect diner. After eating at Pete&#39;s early on two days I was in town, I may be in for a long journey. The breakfast menu is perfect. The omelettes (get one with feta) are great, the hashbrowns are great, the bread is great. Super service, amazingly clean, well run, great tables...I could go on and on. Any place that gives me tzatziki to go with my omelette and potatoes has my vote. Forever. Runs about $17 for the omelettes and coffee; maybe a bit high, but worth it."

There is plenty of seating but I liked the counter to watch the cooks whip up those tasty plates. Plenty of street parking. Portions are HUGE. They take credit cards but cash is king. They waitress was amazing - she was swamped but never lost sight of checking in with us and getting what we needed. The only issue I had was with the security guy at the door who kept talking crap about the patrons.

The biscuits were a little hard but edible. The burrito was delicious! I think this is the only place you can get gyro meat in a breakfast burrito.

My partner got the chicken sandwich and besides a little salt being needed, it was good as well. The waitress wasn&#39;t the friendliest and we never got refills on our water. 

The atmosphere is clean and there are several autographs all over the walls, and two tvs to watch while you wait for your food. I just wish the service was better. :("

This place is a Greek breakfast place. But it seemed like the chefs and a lot of the staff spoke Spanish. Came in at around 5 in the morning to get breakfast to go since i had a long day on the road ahead. I seated myself at the counter. There were about a handful of customers eating breakfast at the same time. 

The waitress came up to me shortly after i sat down and offered me some water. I looked through some of the reviews online and noticed that the breakfast burritos were pretty popular. So i decided to try the supreme breakfast platter out. Also was the special of the day so I lucked out!

It was absolutely delicious. It was like a mexican and greek hybrid dish. For $9, the breakfast burrito supreme seemed more like a breakfast enchilada it had two scrambled eggs, ham, gyro meat, sausage, hashbrowns, and green chili gravy. It was also huge!! It was the only thing i ate all day long and it filled me up for dinner.

I didn&#39;t meet the standard, but I was graciously offered a job at the Satire (I declined).  

I&#39;ve eaten almost everything on the menu.  My favorites are the greek salad (omg this is fresh and huge), the lemon chicken soup, the breakfast burrito, pancakes, fresh cut fries, and their cheese steak sandwhich (steak made fresh at the order, I didn&#39;t like the chicken one at all).  I stopped eating meat since then, but almost everything can be made without meat.  A vegan might have a tricky time eating here, but that&#39;s the worst one can say now.  Consistency, efficiency, cleanliness and customer service are all emphasized here.  Sometimes a waitress isn&#39;t meant for it or the cook has worked a long shift, but for the most part everything is above average to excellent.

Servers are always friendly and attentive.  One time I had them screw up a small thing on my order, which I wasn&#39;t even that worried about, yet the cook personally apologized to me, and then corrected his mistake immediately.

I can imagine the scene being different at 2 AM, but alas, those days are long gone.... (sob!).  Anyway...

I walked in and was surprised by how small the restaurant was especially since they have a huge private parking lot that was mostly full.  The restaurant, however, had several open tables as well as space at the counter (who did all those cars in the lot belong to, then??).  In addition to the main section of the restaurant where the counter seating is located, they also have an enclosed patio area with about eight tables, or so.  I sat on the patio, and while not a true open patio (the windows open, I suppose, for a more &#39;outdoor&#39; experience when it&#39;s warmer/cooler, I dunno), it was pleasant out there.

I perused the menu and decided on the &#39;Jimmy&#39;s Special Omelet&#39; (don&#39;t know who Jimmy is, or why there isn&#39;t a Pete&#39;s Special Omelet, but whatever - am I rambling??).  This omelet is filled with bacon, feta, and tomato and comes with potatoes and toast.  My very nice server asked if I wanted toast or pita, and I opted for pita.  The meal came to the table with tzatsiki, but I don&#39;t know if that comes with this dish normally or only if you order the pita.  And I also had iced tea.  The food was pretty good, not great, but good.  The omelet was more like a shell or crepe of egg wrapped around a ton of bacon and feta and a small amount of tomato.  I wouldn&#39;t have minded a little more tomato and a little less feta, but all-in-all, it was pretty tasty.  The hash browns seem more like skillet potatoes than what I&#39;m used to as  hash browns, but were tasty nevertheless.

The restaurant was clean and bustling with business (doesn&#39;t anyone around here work??).  The servers kept the tables bussed as people left so there were no dirty plates or anything sitting around.  My server was great. She was pleasant, friendly, and efficient.  The iced tea was replenished before it was empty.

In a nutshell, I liked it here and will return.  Soon."

Pete&#39;s is a Denver institution that, as I learned this morning, is part of an eight restaurant empire (ok, maybe empire is a bit of an exaggeration, but still damn impressive!) 

The place is small and quirky (it has a non-digital cash register), but has a parking lot which is a huge plus! The coffee is very good and the food is pretty decent. I liked the gyro breakfast sandwich. I didn&#39;t eat the hashbrowns (never do) but my husband says they weren&#39;t that great.  His gyro platter (complete with salad) looked good.

Greek Salad is a good option and enough to share. Traditional hamburger is juicy, basic and good, goes well with a side of crispy fried onion rings. Pancake sandwich is another favorite for late night or breakfast. Mexican burger looks like a mess, but it&#39;s delicious. Top it with extra onions and Pete&#39;s hot sauce makes it another one of my favorites."

If your looking for a late night diner open 24 Hours in Denver go to Tom&#39;s Diner located right down the street from this business on Colfax and Pearl...

I have never IN MY LIFE given a negative review on anyone, anything, or a business, but this food was absolutely disgusting..... 

I ordered the Greek Vegetarian Omelette.. Seems simply nonchalant and EASY to make...

I received that entrée.. Almost immediately, which is beneficial for customer service expectations, BUT then complete and absolute disgust resided within me.

Not only did I receive SEVERELY undercooked eggs, but the feta cheese that was supposed to be in the omelette was literally thrown in there at the last moment, not even melted, crumbled, or anything, but came in the form of literally a block of a slice... 

I mentioned this to my waitress, whom was super helpful, kind, and polite which resulted in a charge of $1 since I had an iced tea... (Which I completely understood.)

I swear if anyone else received what I did, they would cause chaos and complete ridicule towards any and all those staff members.

I HAVE NEVER SENT BACK FOOD FROM A RESTAURANT EVER IN MY LIFE, but once I found the feta cheese was to cover up RAW undercooked eggs (AKA potential Salmonella poisoning) I just signed my name, with a $10 tip, for my complete doll of a waitress, and left.

I have been there several times before, which no complaints before this, but I can say I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN... And I reside within walking distance... 

Even the patrons at the booth next to me said,
&#34;Ummmmmm I want my food cooked extra please, because I DO NOT want my food to look like his (AKA ME) because that is fucking disgusting.&#34;

I&#39;m still in complete and utter disgust, because it was really appalling, especially when I was there by myself....

Wait staff is perfect and understanding, but good service doesn&#39;t make up for unsanitary and potentially deadly food..

If negative stars could be given, Pete&#39;s Kitchen would be about a (-) 20 stars."

Maybe we just ate there on the wrong day...but the food was pretty unexceptional.
I ordered one of the egg speacial/meals (can&#39;t recollect the exact name) it came with two pancakes, eggs, breakfast potatoes, and your choice of meat. The sausage links were fine. I imagine that it&#39;s kind of hard to have terrible sausage links: they are pretty much the standard diner issued sausage links. The breakfast potatoes: lacked flavor, and actually had the taste that old potatoes have that have been cold but brought up to temp: blah. The pancakes: could not cut with a fork: touch and while the flavor was fine, I could not get past the overly tough texture. The eggs: I ordered my eggs scrambled with American cheese and tomatoes. I understand I ordered them with cheese, but the amount of cheese they put in the eggs was....excessive. Basically the eggs just tasted like American cheese and nothing more. 

Pete&#39;s kitchen itself has a pleasant enough ambiance and friendly staff but the food, as stated, was pretty blase diner food."

Chopped steak goes on the grill, onions come standard (but can be left off by request). I love the Chauncey, named after Denver native and basketball star, Chauncey Billups. This particular sandwich includes mushrooms, peppers, provolone and cheese whiz. After the meat has browned, the cheese is layered on top and the bun butterflied overtop. It is then covered for a minute on the grill before being transferred to wax paper. The bread softens but maintains a nice chew, the meat has browned crispy bits, the veggies compliment, and the gooey cheese brings it all together. Tip: Wrap and lift the entire sandwich up by the wax paper--it can be quite daunting!

The 9&#34; sandwich is always plenty big for me (and ought to be for almost $10). French fries and onion rings are crisp. On my last visit, though, Ted&#39;s was pretty busy, and my order of fries wasn&#39;t served until I had finished my sandwich. 

The atmosphere is divey, yet cool, and the staff is always friendly. They also have a handful of decent beers. The tables with board games (like Sorry) add to the ambiance of the place. I will most definitely keep coming back!"

The bread- tastes like I&#39;m in Philly. (I&#39;ve never actually been to philly but my husband tells me the bread at Denver Ted&#39;s is SUPERBLY close to a true Philly cheese steak bread...haha)

The meat- perfectly portioned with the perfect amount of ooey gooey cheese mixed in. 

Do yourself a favor, and get the hot pepper relish mixed in-- GAME CHANGER. The chicken is also SUPER tasty and a nice change up.

I&#39;m a New Jersey native and have had quite a lot of cheesesteaks in my time. Denver Ted&#39;s is far and away the best place in the Denver area if you want a cheesesteak.

The sandwiches are consistently high quality, and you can truly build it out any way you&#39;d like.  Personally I feel the best / most versatile topping they offer is the pepper relish.  It goes good on absolutely everything on the menu (really, I&#39;ve tried it all - this is a scientific conclusion) if you are a fan of a little spicy kick.  They also have a vegetarian friendly option in the &#39;Hello Bello&#39; which features Portobello mushrooms and a nice mix of vegetable toppings, which is just as delicious as their other sandwiches.

One thing Denver Ted&#39;s does exceedingly well is Chicken Cheesesteaks - they&#39;re the only restaurant between here and where I&#39;ve gone on the East Coast that actually does these well.  Which is great if you&#39;re like me and your doctor has recommended you cut back on red meats.  I still go for the steak when I want to spoil myself though.

Everyone on the staff is super friendly and it&#39;s a nice relaxed environment to enjoy a meal."

It didn&#39;t disappoint. I had the baconator and it was cooked to perfection. Not too much grease but just right. By far the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. Staff is friendly and they also serve beer which is always a plus. Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re a cheesesteak fan. I have already been back.
denver-teds-denver,V J.,i3Uk8B6kSXgj6PwSvtRJ-A,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,1,74,KkUWpE6_ixNsesZ5uq3bcg,3.0,2016-06-21,"I ate here the other day and the cheesesteaks were okay, but that&#39;s it.  After reading the reviews, I was excited to try Denver Ted&#39;s since I moved here only a few weeks ago and am searching for the best cheesesteak experience in town. As someone who was born and raised in Philadelphia and used to cook cheesesteaks in two different restaurants there many years ago, I can offer a few suggestions to Denver Ted&#39;s:  
1.  Cook the onions longer - they should be translucent and browning (ours were practically raw). 
2.   A rarely heard complaint, but a legitimate one; not greasy enough.  The cheesesteak is about grease. We always added more to the grill than would occur naturally.  I recommend the same to you (no, this is not health food to be eaten daily). 
3.  When a customer asks for marinara on the side, it shouldn&#39;t&#39; be served ice cold straight from the fridge - heat it up.  
4.  Even when using whiz, serve it with enough cheese to be both seen and tasted - it&#39;s right in the title of the sandwich.  
Not sure if the rolls were Amoroso&#39;s or not, but they were good.  
It&#39;s a shame because with a few minor adjustments, the cheesesteaks here could be soooo good.  Unfortunately, they are just so so as they are currently prepared.  
They can&#39;t help who their neighbors are, but the mentally ill lady across the street screaming obscenities, physically assaulting passers by and flashing her breasts didn&#39;t add anything positive to the dining experience. According to the staff - this is commonplace when she is off her meds. A shame for her and also for her neighbors. The police were there addressing her as we left. 
For a more pleasant and authentic experience, I recommend Famous Philly Cheesesteaks and Beer Garden on Oneida street - they are much closer to the real deal.  But I still have a couple more cheesesteak places to check out before I&#39;m done my quest for the best cheesesteak in Denver.  Unfortunately, that title doesn&#39;t belong to Denver Ted&#39;s."

If you didn&#39;t know it was there, you would walk right by it, even with the small sign that is hanging up on the building.  I&#39;ve lived in the area for a very long time, and didn&#39;t realize it was there. Co-workers went, and told me about it, so I had to try it.

If you like fairly quick food, &#34;older&#34; type rock music, and greasy type food, then this place is for you. Oh, you also need to like Cheez Whiz too. Go see for yourself.

The food is hot, made to order. The wait, well, there really isn&#39;t one, and I think that&#39;s because of it&#39;s location. Like I said, you walk/drive by the place, not realizing that it&#39;s there.

Parking - none, so you will have to park on the street, at least there are no meters.

Seating - two high table tops, with 6 tall stools around each, and 4 or 5 booths. Oh, if you are a tall person, don&#39;t even attempt to sit at one of the booths, you won&#39;t make it. I am only 5&#39;2&#34;, and it was hard getting in and out of the booth.

The only thing I would change is the receipt process.  There is no option for a paper receipt.  You can either opt for an email or text receipt.  I chose text &amp; never received one.

Denver Ted&#39;s displays over a 4 star rating from lots of folks who seem to know lots about Philly Cheese Steaks.

For me, the chewy roll was pleasant, but not distinguished. The finely sliced beef was . . .  well . . . also pleasant, but also not distinguished. And the American cheese whiz was . . . well . . . the American cheese whiz was just friggin&#39; ooey gooey whiz-like.

Maybe I should have spruced things up with some mushrooms or pepper relish, but since I was trying the place out for the pure Cheese Steak experience I figured I&#39;d steer clear of those add-ons this time around.

Color me confused, but giving these sandwiches 4-5 star ratings seems like the reviewers are grading their childhood memories, and not the food itself. So here&#39;s to childhood memories and some OK to pretty good 3 star sandwiches."

I went with the buffalo chicken 9&#34; and she with the philly cheese steak.  We agreed that both sandwiches were flavorful and totally hit the spot for what we were craving that day.  The place is also nicely set up so you can see your food being made fresh right before you.  That being said the kitchen looks very clean and that&#39;s always a good thing when eating out.  The two fellas working that day were very helpful and friendly and made we two newbies to the establishment feel very welcome.

Denver Ted&#39;s definitely made me eat my words. Finally, I have  found the Philly Cheesesteak to satisfy my homesick cravings.  This is the real deal. These guys know how to make a killer cheesesteak.  I went two days in a row due to the fact that I now can&#39;t stay away (just discovered them four days ago). I will probably be back tomorrow. 

After trying cheesesteaks in many major cities (Chicago, Atlanta, NYC) and being disappointed, I gave up on finding the real deal. I am always left disappointed, discouraged, and homesick.  Denver Ted&#39;s was a game-changer.  They know what it takes to make an authentic cheesesteak - from the crispy, yet chewy bread, caramelized onions, pepper relish, and whiz.  They even had the cheesesteak juice. I get so giddy when I take a bite out of a Philly cheesesteak and watch the whiz and steak juice combo combine into the delicious grease that drips on my plate for later fry dipping.  I am gross, I know.  This place serves the real deal.  No Philadelphia cheesesteak imposters here.  I had so much whiz/meat juiciness on my plate that I was smiling from ear to ear.  I also had to bring back my &#34;Philly lean&#34; to avoid the drip from staining my clothes (ahhhh heaven!). 

I can&#39;t recommend this place more. Try it. It is fulfills my cheesesteak fantasies and will soon yours. Now, I just need to find some Amish girls to fulfill my Lancaster Amish pretzel cravings and my life will be complete.  I love you, Denver Ted&#39;s."

Well, after circling around like 5 or 6 times out of the corner of my eye I FINALLY found the joint. If you&#39;re not careful, you can drive right past it. Still, having a good, dive-ey look I figured we were off the a good start.

The grub was very good. The Amoroso rolls were very soft, the meat was cooked just as it should be and it was just greasy enough to make you feel an artery clog as you eat it. A damn good sandwich. Still, the way they applied the Whiz was a little suspect for my liking. I personally like to have to lick my fingers clean of the whiz on my Philly sandwich. Not drowned in whiz, but I don&#39;t want to have to lift pieces of meat to see if there is any actually on there, which was the case with this one. It was on there... but way fuck sparingly. I had to ask for a little side of whiz to add it on myself. The little cup, instead of being a nice gooey pile of cheese heaven was almost like thick butter. It took some effort to get that bad boy mixed in correctly. A minor knock, but a knock none the less in my eyes. I don&#39;t wanna have to go and do any kind of post cook work except inhale my grub. The sandwich prices are a LITTLE more than what I think they should be - again, compared to my now closed mecca of Cheesesteak decadence... - but, again, if the grub is made right, I&#39;ll flip the extra nickle.

Don&#39;t expect much beyond the sandwich here. If you&#39;re looking for more Philly treats like Utz, or Tasty Cakes, we&#39;re SOL. The beer selection - which is apparently a new add on for DT&#39;s - was limited. Very limited. But, I understand they are in the process of growing and doing modifications, so, it wasn&#39;t a deal breaker. 

The one thing that was jacked up was the fucked up temps in this joint. It was a semi-warm and humid-for-Denver kind of day when I went. And, fuck me running, it was like a sauna inside the place. The dude behind the counter echoed these sentiment. He said something that they were in the process of supposedly trying to correct those issues, but it didn&#39;t sound like it would be done anytime soon. So, if you can go on a cool(er) day, I would recommend it then.

All told, not a bad joint. I&#39;ll definitely hit it again before heading to Pat&#39;s to watch the Birds play during football season. So, I recommend it. 

ONE PLUS about this place. It had THE best pennant EVER. I wanted to steal it but.... I held off.   I will post a pic if Yelp will stop acting like a little bitch.

Happy Grubbing!"

I LOVE cheesesteaks and this is by far one of the best I have had in Denver. Not only were the guys working really nice but damn it, the food was just GOOD.

Not a fancy restaurant by any means...divey/hole in the wall type scene but um, were talking cheesesteaks here so I sure as hell don&#39;t plan on dressing up.

Moaning in Public
Before our food arrived, I did my usual thing - talking, talking, talking. After the food arrived, all you could hear was moans of happiness. Talking did not resume until the first half of my 12&#34; was gone. My friend tried, I just ignored him, holding my pointer finger to my mouth in the universal symbol of &#39;shut the hell up.&#39;

The Food
I ate a 12&#34; Ryan - Peppers, mushrooms, onions, Cheez Whiz, and provolone.
My friend ate a 12&#34; mushroom steak with American cheese, no onions (to the no onions thing...No, I don&#39;t know what the hell is wrong with him). ;-)

Food review:  Props to Boris B. for recommending this one.  This cheesesteak was really tasty.  It&#39;s making it hard to decide what my favorite is in town now.  One thing that I liked about this cheesesteak was that it wasn&#39;t as messy as other cheesesteaks can get for me yet it wasn&#39;t dry either.  It was just right.  For dessert, they had one of my favorite lunch time snacks.. rice crispy treat topped with chocolate frosting.  I&#39;m really excited there&#39;s yet another place that serves these (only other 2 places I know of is Garbanzos and Erberts and Gerberts).  It did not disappoint.  Overall, a great experience and will certainly come back.

Service?  No complaints"

The staff is super friendly and accommodating. It&#39;s a good experience from the time you walk in until the time you leave. Even if they are busy, the service is still pretty fast. The quality of the food is excellent for what they charge--prices are very reasonable. Not to mention, it&#39;s on Pearl Street so the location is fantastic. Very cool, calm atmosphere as well.

He offered a full refund but instead I asked that I could come in unannounced and order a replacement meal on the house so that I could have an opportunity to revise my review. On New Years Day my husband, my best friend and I came in and ordered some cheesesteaks. The manager wasn&#39;t in, but just as he promised his cashier was very friendly, took my word and gladly comped my meal. The sandwichs this time were a huge improvement. The meat was seasoned very nicely, the vegetables were cooked beautifully,  and the cheese was gooey with a nice firm bun. The tables have built-in board games which is pretty cool and overall this trip was highly enjoyable. I now understand why this store has such a high rating. It must have been a fluke last time I was in."

Ordered the flautas with pork belly and chicken.  It came with rice, beans, lettuce and tomato, and a roasted jalapeno.  Very delicious.  My boyfriend had the el pastor burrito and their tamarind fountain drink and he thoroughly enjoyed his meal.

The woman behind the counter (owner?) was very friendly, but her English is very limited. I speak no Spanish and neither does my haole boyfriend, but we got it figured it out eventually.  She brought us a free round of roasted jalapenos.  The only downside to this place is that the food can take a long time (it&#39;s made to order) and you have to park at the mercado next door.  Other than that, it&#39;s delicious food and it&#39;s in my neighborhood. Can&#39;t wait to try the breakfast burritos!"

I&#39;ve been craving authentic Mexican food and have generally been disappointed with many &#34;Tex-Mex&#34; restaurants that claim to be Mexican. The women who made our food seemed to be the owners and they were very polite. Don&#39;t go here expecting a 5 star dining experience. It&#39;s kind of a &#34;hole in the wall&#34;-- but those are personally my favorite.

This is a fast food style set up. Order at a counter and wait for your number to be called. 

I ordered the ham breakfast burrito for ($1.99!!!) with a side of the salsa.... Cooked to perfection with a nice spicy bite to it. The salsa really added the extra &#34;umph&#34; to the burrito to make it fantastic. Did I mention they&#39;re $1.99!!?

The only reason I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars is because it took a little longer than it should have seeing as we were the only patrons in the restaurant... Took about 7ish minutes to get our food--and that feels like a lifetime when your blood sugar is low. 

I will DEFINITELY be back soon. Glad I found this little gem."

Every table was full, so we briefly considered eating somewhere else. The waitress assured us it would only be a couple minutes, so we decided to wait. As she said, a few minutes later we were seated, so we were off to a good start. 

I ordered the one of the omelets, and my wife got pigs in a blanket. My omelet was GIGANTIC. The portion was ridiculous. It was a huge plate with half omelet and half hash browns. My meal also came with a side, so my wife got biscuits and gravy. My omelet was very tasty. I was only able to eat about half of it since there was so much food. My wife enjoyed her pigs in a blanket, but it was essentially just a sausage in the middle of a pancake. The biscuits and gravy were ok. Not bad tasting but a little cold. 

The service was excellent. Our food came out very quickly after we ordered, and even though the servers were super busy, they were still able to keep up with the tables. I was even able to get our waitress to plug in my phone as it was dying from too much yelping :)

The restaurant was a little dirty though. Maybe it&#39;s hard to get a lot of serious cleaning done when it was so packed, but my wife noticed a bit of chicken on the floor with ants crawling all over it. The women&#39;s bathroom also lacked a changing table. The mens bathroom had some big black box which would have worked, but it was the mens, so we didn&#39;t know about it until after our babies diaper was already changed."

The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, and if you aren&#39;t carefully looking for it, it&#39;s easy to miss. 

The interior is done in taupe or beige, non-descriptive. The tables are close together, with 8 booths, and 8 tables, total. If you have a baby stroller, you will have to leave it outside, as I&#39;m not sure how you will get it inside.

The menu has breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We were there for breakfast. I had my usual of bacon and eggs (over easy), and wheat toast. My breakfast was good, nothing to brag home about. My husband had the Huevos Rancheros, and he said they were good. My  mother-in-law, had the vegetable omelet (with egg whites), and my father-in-law had the bacon and eggs as well.  It was all good, but again, nothing fancy.

The prices were decent, comparable to today&#39;s prices. Parking in in the large lot, and it&#39;s free, so that&#39;s a plus. The staff is friendly, and you can tell there are regulars that stop in too, which is always good to see.

I don&#39;t think we will go out of our way to go back, but if we are ever in the area, sure, we&#39;ll stop in."

When i got to work to eat the biscuits and gravy was good but when i got to my hash browns, they were not hash browns i got a bunch or mashed up potatoes.

Soooo Really I&#39;d like to give this place a 4.5, but they just haven&#39;t earned a 5 all around, because the first time service was lacking. Not in politeness, but as in speed and checking up on us.  We did though get there like 15 minutes prior to Sunday Closing though by 3am, so understandably, though I&#39;m use to  feeling more or being rushed as opposed to slowness when places are close to closing.  IT seemed like some what of an oxymoron? (rhetorical) I know when I worked in the service industry I couldn&#39;t wait to leave and signed the EO (early out) sheet ASAP!  Ok, so on to my food experience.

One of my Hanai girls said we had to come here cuz she eats hear like 4 days or so out of the week. (works across the street)  And after getting in, literally a minute be4 closing a party 8 came in!  whoa, that made us feel much better!

I&#39;ve been her twice after this day..  I may bump them to 5 star cuz our server did tell me I could go right next door and get a drink.  wink wink...  So I did.

We got a COBB salad to go &amp; one also last night~ really Huge, delcious &amp; enough for 4 people to eat good.

Chick. fried chck. ~ Really good!  I have messed up taste bud&#39;s from tongue piercing&#39;s so I need more salt (preferably Himalayan) and taste is very &#34;relative&#34; is it not.

NY steak w/poached eggs ~ Very onolicious (beyond just delicious in Hawaii&#39;n/pidgeon)  

and well because they are old school and I didn&#39;t get a receipt print out, I couldn&#39;t take a pick. (by then the next door Creed Brewery Liquor was kick-in in)  and We all tasted and shared food and it was like a white chicken Philly cheese steak sandwich.  

So yesterday I just HAD to get me the corn-beef Hash because I wanted it that first time, but got steak because it was heartier! Umm, if you drank what I did, YOU would too!!...lol  I saw natural pics on Yelp from other foodies &amp; they made it look like I couldn&#39;t wait another second to try it! So right after school, I called in my To-go order and although the snow was bad, the Drive for this FOOD was worth every penny!!!!!!!

Corn-beef Hash ~ Was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!. Made from actual meaty natural corn beef &amp; saved 1/2 though it was hard; for my hubby to eat.   

Also I can&#39;t give it a 5 star because when I walked in,  a woman to my right cleaning the 2nd from the right window just looked at me and said nothing. So I walked all the way in and she passed me without acknowledgment no &#34;Hi, Hello or Can I help you?)  I had to stop her as she came out from the back &#34;I&#39;m Lani, with a pick-up order.&#34;  Honestly I shouldn&#39;t even have left a tip, but I&#39;m a softy for service industry.

We came in Saturday night at 7:15 for dinner and they close at 8. We were told we couldn&#39;t have toast because they were closing soon. Well they close at 8 we should have been able to order anything on that menu. The waitress made it a point to let us know they were closing a few different times I thought that was very rude. Also another customer came in a little before closing and our waitress was giving him a hard time about ordering because they were trying to close. I won&#39;t be going back for dinner. If they don&#39;t want to be open until 8 they should not be open for dinner.

It&#39;s not the most good looking place but the service and food will make up for it.  We had the breakfast burrito, huevos ranchero, and a grilled cheese with fries.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his burrito.  The red chili is a bit on the medium side (which I&#39;m a FAN of).  The huevos ranchero was good.  I asked for jalepenos on it since I love my food spicy.  My son loved the fries and I the grilled cheese sandwich,  We will definitely come back."

I had ordered the Mr Egg omelet with pancakes. The omelet looked like mass confusion because of all the green chili on it, it was very filling and could only eat about 1/3 because of the size. The pancakes were very yummy and had that certain sweet pancake smell that put it over the top. The only downside with the pancakes were that I wish it was served with real butter vs a little container of Country Crock. Dad had gotten the corned beef hash, it was served in a shredded beef style vs cut into small cubes, which made it dried out. We were very surprised that it was pretty packed on a weekday around 9am ish. All in all we&#39;d definitely get the pancakes again but a different egg dish."

The place itself is very relaxing and reminds me of the south, the older rustic looks does well and they have a decent bar but not full.

We had the spinach and artichoke dip   which was decent, the chicken pot pie and the mushroom and Brie Burger..all we&#39;re just decent. The Burger was kinda dry the pot pie was not very full after you broke the top bread layer there wasn&#39;t much pot pie at all.

I know it&#39;s difficult to be in the service industry, especially a role that&#39;s customer facing, but you chose this industry to work in, so you have to do your part to not let negative factors effect you.

Unprofessional when you see so many tables dirty and 8 waiters/waitresses talking at the service station AND talking about other patrons calling them &#34;a**h*les&#34;. Why were they called such? Because your staff forgot about their table and they complained? Food was mediocre. No vegetarian entree options. When we left, I could count how many tables were occupied on one hand.

We were seated quickly and they gave us options between their lunch and breakfast menu! We entered at 11, and their breakfast was served until 11:30. I ordered original buttermilk pancakes and oh boy, they were amazing. Dare, I say that I like them more than IHOP my usual breakfast spot. My friends ordered mimosas and grilled chicken with guacamole, mushroom crepes, Benedict eggs and they all loved the food. They were recommending their freshly baked muffins. So my friend ordered a cinnamon spice muffin and I must say those muffins are huge and amazingly fresh!!! It smelled super good and so we all shared the muffin and loved it. Our server was so nice to check up on twice and to add to that the manager also came to check on us!

I found it odd that they placed a large party right in front of the entrance to the dining room.  We were in and out in about 1/2 hours so that was a great plus at that time of day.  

All in all, was a good experience but nothing blew me away."

The restaurant itself was a little dated and could use a little attention and maybe new carpet. Service was friendly, helpful, and fast. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and the kids meals were good (hand breaded chicken, good pancakes). They had to clear a table for use when we got there as it has not been done, but we were seated quickly. Would come back."

A sweet young lady was our waitress, but she was clueless throughout the meal.  I felt bad for her as I assume she had some terrible training.  Many items were forgotten (syrup, bread, and more), one person in our party arrived a little later and intended on ordering an entree but just gave up, drinks were not refilled, etc.  

I ordered the Cobb salad, which was good, but certainly not great.  I asked the waitress if she thought it was going to be ample and was assured that it was very large.  Maybe I expect too much, but there are many restaurants where this $10 salad (approximate from memory) would be considered a small.  

It&#39;s a clean and pleasant place, the sort of place I would take my mom for a slow meal and pick up the bill.  But I wouldn&#39;t come here regularly."

Waiter was not friendly, not interested, wiping his nose with his bare hands and after more than 30 minutes without receiving our food, we notified the manager we were leaving.

It always felt good to sit down with friends and family and just relax knowing that comfort food was its way. 

The last few times I&#39;ve been to a Mimi&#39;s, it just felt old and tired. Like no one really cared about food or customers. Each one I&#39;ve been to over the last couple of years felt like they were hanging on by a thread. Like they were still in business because there is an older generation who still frequents them - oh, wait, I am in that older generation. But, if I am going to pay to have someone cook and serve me a meal, I want it to be a good experience. The last couple of Mimi&#39;s I&#39;ve been to were not comfortable experiences. I think I just made my last visit to a Mimi&#39;s - - unless someone in corporate plugs the holes in this sinking ship.

Food was ok, but just ok. Service? Well, it was a little slow and lacking in a cheerful attitude. They weren&#39;t unfriendly, just sending off vibes of struggling to make it through their shift. 

I used to really like Mimi&#39;s - can they be saved with all the options out there that are trying to make it?"

The food is always very good, and they always have a fresh buy one get one free coupon sitting in my email inbox.

Giving me a coupon for a buy one get one free meal on a regular basis is a sure fire way to get me to come in! Particularly in this location where I often have to come to access to stores across the street. Barnes &amp; Noble, PetSmart, my tanning place, Ross and Target. I end up having to come over here a lot of times, and Mimi&#39;s is a great place to stop in.

Mimi&#39;s does a good job of keeping the menu fresh, which is difficult to do for a chain. They always have wonderful seasonal selections for breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts. I love that the waiters aren&#39;t shy about offering you bloody marys or mimosas first thing in the morning. 
 
The food at Mimi&#39;s is really what puts it over the top. They do a very good job, and have food that you really can&#39;t get at any other chain. My husband enjoys the diner style corned beef hash and eggs for breakfast while I am more experimental and have had the crepes, omelettes and Benedicts. I have yet to have a dish that I did not enjoy at Mimi&#39;s.

So if all of the food is so wonderful, and the location is so convenient, why only four stars? Well as my coworkers pointed out to me, this place does seem to be a little bit of an older crowd. Which could be why it seems that the service is always very slow. The servers are friendly, but they seem to have an expectation that everyone who comes in there is expecting to dine at an incredibly leisurely (read: slow) pace.

So come on in here and if you are in the neighborhood, unless you&#39;re in a big hurry!"

The Grilled Atlantic Salmon was flavorless and overcooked. The au gratin was pretty much layers of almost raw sliced potatoes in a cheesy cream sauce. My son&#39;s dinner was terrible. The side of fruit was dried out and looked like it was about a week old. The service was lackluster.

Not too gooey, nice and warm, just right to share.  I followed that by the eggs Benedict with salmon with potatoes and the muffin was by far one of the most buttery I&#39;ve had with a Benny.  

They also have a children&#39;s menu that was sized just right for the little tyke that was with me.  It was a great meal and an expected treat as the line at the other restaurant was a wait of 30 minutes and we were seated right away.

I ordered something of a sampler platter where I got the bacon and apple waffles, sausage, and they were kind enough to sub potatoes instead of eggs for me.  The bacon apple waffles come three to a plate, about 2 inches in diameter.  They tasted excellent.  The sausage was a little odd tasting, I think part of it was the texture, but I didn&#39;t care for it too much.  The potatoes were small golden spuds halved and boiled, which was different but they were very bland.  The only option for hot sauce was green tabasco which was disappointing.  My lady ordered a bacon avocado omelette.  She more or less enjoyed it but we both found it odd that the folded the egg and laid the bacon, tomato, and avocado on top instead of making it part of the omelette.  

We also ordered mimosas.   The bring you a flute half full of juice and a split of chandon.  She had the mango and I the traditional, the mango was surprisingly good. 

The service was prompt and friendly.  The decor needs to go, it&#39; a little bit of an eyesore looking around, as if there&#39;s no plan of decor just a bunch f stuff thrown all over the walls.

 Mimi&#39;s was actually our second choice for breakfast but it ended up being a pretty good meal."

While we waited our waiter did really say anything to us about the wait, we barley saw her. 

When my good finally did arrive, it was incorrect &amp; had to be sent back. It took about another 15 minutes to come back out.

It was 5:30 PM. they were out of meatloaf, out of bacon. There was almost nothing on the menu anyway I ordered Grilled Atlantic salmon with roasted potatoes. The salmon had no seasoning at all just some bland sauce. The potatoes were no roasted but some sot of potato tots!  greasy and gross! My sister ordered a hamburger well done. It was raw She sent it back and just took it off the tab. It took so long to get it I can&#39;t imagine how long it would have taken to get another. This is the second bad experience but I thought I would give it another try. Never Again!  I would rather go to Micky D&#39;s"

The meal left a fair amount to be desired so I never bothered returning again until recently when a home renovation left me without access to cooking in my kitchen.
I have a well cultivated and traveled palate. One&#39;s expectations sort of sets one up for either disappointment or happy surprise. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything remarkable largely due to the outdated &amp; cluttered decor...which really doesn&#39;t do what comes out of the kitchen justice. (that&#39;s why there&#39;s only 4 stars).
Meals in the AM &amp; PM have been served quickly, graciously (with one minor exception of an &#39;energizer bunny&#39; type who hopped around semi-breathless trying to keep up since there were only two of them for the room), and well plated, seasoned, proportioned, and cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of herbs, fresh sauces, and options. I have been impressed with my experience here.

What amuses me are the reviewers who relegate this establishment as a place for those who are not as sophisticated &amp; discerning a diner as they are - by patronizingly calling it a place for Grandma or those over 70. Don&#39;t pay any attention to them.
Be your own judge.

This is worth a sampling of!"

My friend was already inside chatting with a waitress. As I walked through the front door my shoe snagged on a rug in the entry-way and I sort of tripped. Both my friend and the waitress witnessed me stumble as I entered the restaurant. I expressed to the waitress that the rug was tripping hazard. She immediately stated that she would take care of it right after she seated us. Her tone of voice was shrill, it made me think she was upset because I pointed out a tripping hazard. (Our experience was starting off on the wrong foot). Mimi&#39;s is styled after a New Orleans cafe. The decor is dated but gives a warm home feel. The menu is limited to this same style (with a few exceptions) but I think most people will find something they will like. My friend ordered the poppy seed pancakes, I had a Santa Fe omelet. My friend loved his choice, I wasn&#39;t impressed with mine. The same waitress that &#34;greeted&#34; us was also our server.  She had a foreign accent (maybe German). She turned out to be a very good server and attended to our table just fine. My friend picked up the tab but the prices look to range from fair to a little bit pricey. If you&#39;re looking for a family style restaurant then you will probably like Mimi&#39;s. It has a faux fireplace in the front area where you wait for seating. As we exited the restaurant we noticed the rug was still in same place. I pointed out the tripping hazard to a patron who was entering as I was leaving."

We were seeking good french onion soup and their fried zucchini. The french onion soup was cloudy and warm. Fried Zucchini not even on menu. Caesar salad was heavy on dressing, Fries with club were so-so. The dessert of the triple medley was either too sweet or too salty. Spinach artichoke dip wasn&#39;t much to cheer about. The only good meal was the chicken pot pie and the iced tea. Our server was also all over the board as if he had too much going on even though the restaurant was not crowded at the time.

first of all: the place really needs an overhaul.. it&#39;s looking a bit rundown.

second of all: the staff, while friendly enough, seem super disorganized. i made a reservation for brunch on a saturday. i told the lady over the phone: 3 adults, 2 children. so they sat us at a table set for 8. weird? but okay, there could be worse things to complain about..

enter that moment half of us have our food and the other half do not. some sort of communication breakdown amongst staff, and they brought out a couple of wrong plates. sorry, no one ordered pancakes. the lady who brought them out insisted we ordered them. no, we didn&#39;t, sorry to disappoint you. so while waiting for the issue to get corrected, food on the table was getting cold... 

in all fairness, they didn&#39;t charge us for their mix up. which was a good customer service move.. so i&#39;ll give them that.. but still?!

from the looks of it, mimi&#39;s is sadly becoming one of those suburban chains (ie; olive garden) that got off to a great start but as the years go by, the overall quality continues to fall substantially.

the muffins are still tasty though. please don&#39;t lose that!"

Plus I was anxious to try the new menu.  WRONG!  Saturday afternoon.  I ordered the stuffed French toast.  I will admit it was delicious.  The sausage was the strangest tasting sausage I&#39;ve ever had, plus it was luke warm.  Finished up with scrambled eggs with cheese.  The eggs had a skin on them and were barely warm.  Apparently they were under the heat lamp forever.

DH had the grilled chicken &amp; frites.  The menu description sounded to die for.  NOT.  The only herbs on the chicken was some parsley.  The &#34;frites&#34; left a lot to be desired.  Fries from McD&#39;s would&#39;ve been better.  DH even said we should have gone to KFC for chicken!

Our waiter took great pains to explain he was a pharmacy student &amp; this position was not his &#34;forever&#34; job.  Good thing as he was a lousy waiter.  Spent a lot of time flirting with the 2 ladies seated behind us.  And stroking the lady at the bar.  When he asked if I wanted a box for my uneaten eggs and sausages &amp; was told no, they tasted terrible.  No questions asked.

All in all a huge descent from Mimi&#39;s of old.  We (I) won&#39;t be back period.  And I&#39;ll quit raving about it to friends and family."

Usually, large parties can be a bit overwhelming for the servers, but Mimi&#39;s staff handled us beautifully.  They had about 4 servers working our group, so someone was always available whenever we needed them.
 
I ordered the cobb salad which was average for a cobb salad.  I would have liked a better quality lettuce, rather than iceberg.  The salads come with a muffin, which is a little unusual. I took the muffin back to my husband for dessert and he said it was &#34;alright&#34;. The pasta dishes looked really good and, if I went back, that&#39;s probably what I would try.  But, in general, the menu is large with too many options.  They have a few low calories selections that lists the dishes that are 550 calories or less.  In my opinion, if they list calories for some of the dishes, they should list them for all the dishes."

I was very happy and excited about my choice for lunch.  I ordered a pulled pork half sandwich with French onion soup, I think it was a lunch special.  My girlfriend ordered a Turkey sandwich and onion rings.  For dessert we had the bread pudding and beignets.  Both of our sandwiches were just fine and we had great service.  My French onion soup was wonderful, I am a sucker for soup and French onion is at the top of my list.  They had it just right.

Since we had that gift certificate, we had to fill out the bill and ordered two desserts.  Our bread pudding was the best I may have ever had, really, serious, not kidding.  The beignets were nicely made, still warm served with chocolate, butterscotch and strawberry sauce.  Very tasty, I have had better beignets, but these were still pretty good.

The interior is kind of a mixture of Applebee&#39;s and TGIF.  Mimi&#39;s Cafe is a chain restaurant with a Southern flair, the food and menu is much like the &#34;cafe&#34; in their name, but I did not feel the Southern twist really.  We did feel quite young here, as most everyone else seemed to be retired or of the senior age group.  

I think Mimi&#39;s Cafe is doing a great job.  I&#39;m not so sure I am hooked enough to come here all the time, but I will dine here again if I get another gift certificate, wink, wink."

An 8 year old girl would&#39;ve done better on her &#39;Easy Bake Oven&#39;.

Had their Benedict with crab cakes topped with hollandaise sauce: crab cakes were soggy, very salty, strong fishy taste, no lumps at all just a mass resembling crab; Benedict was the worst I&#39;ve ever had, egg yolk was 90% solid, and hollandaise sauce didn&#39;t taste like nothing."

Today&#39;s visit was during the peak after church time, and while there was a lot of people waiting, we were seated within 15 mins (the quoted time). The food was tasty and the value was good.

It looks like a house made out of Legos from the outside. Several different colors give the exterior a cartoon-ish feel. the inside is huge and broken up into several rooms and a bar. The inside is decorated with all sorts of old-school posters, pieces of art and pictures painted on the walls. The bathrooms were also very clean (at least the men&#39;s). The only peculiar thing I found about the bathroom was that the soap dispensers were so close to the sink counter that it made getting soap difficult. 

You can have breakfast at any time of day here!!! 

I went for a 3-egg omelette with crab and avocado. they had other uncommon ones you can order as well. It came with potatoes that were made perfectly as well as a glass of orange juice, toast and your choice of muffin. Way more food than anyone can handle at once. I took the muffin to work with me. 

My friend had the Reuben sandwich with fries. Huge serving as well. She couldn&#39;t finish it so I got to sample her Reuben. =) 

Our waiter was super courteous and did not keep us waiting for our food or the bill. 

There is a full bar at this place as well. It was a workday so I decided against the lunch time drink. Maybe next time...

This is why that 9 XS outta 10 when my mom flies across the country to visit, and she arrives hungry and potentially cranky, we head right to Mimi&#39;s Cafe. This fixes her up, good as new, gives us a nice place to ease into our visit and eat some really yummy food in a neat environment. 

I dig all the musical instruments they have around as lamps or tables or whatnot. I dig it ....my 9 year old? Thinks it the coolest thing since sliced bread. By the way the actual bread and baked goods at Mimi&#39;s .....excellent, like some sweet little ol&#39; Grannie is on the other side of that kitchen door, checkered apron and all. Anyway the vibe here is a good one and I have never ever had bad service. Quite the opposite, efficient, friendly and helpful. Win, win, win. 

The menu here is ridiculous. It is huge and the variates seem endless. There are great salads to offer folks ( not me) a lighter healthier choice. I don&#39;t usually factor in &#34;health&#34; when dining out but that&#39;s my issue and Mimi&#39;s offers a nice selection for those smart enough to look out for their health. However if you are feeling like a meatloaf or pot pie kinda moment, Mimi&#39;s is soooo for you. I have never been dissatisfied with a meal here. The pastas are delicious and creamy and succulent. The aforementioned meatloaf ??? Well it puts a smile on my gentlemen friend&#39;s face that is usually reserved for our ...umm &#34;alone time&#34; ??? Thanks for stealin&#39; my thunder. Anyhoo, the Albacore Tuna Sandwich ??? OK it makes me smile just like he does. Huge chunks of avocado, whoopee! Melty cheese?? Yes please! Fresh tuna that is as tasty as can be?? Sure! Sometimes the bread is a bit ... scratchy? Perhaps, but if you smash down really hard it will fit in your mouth, trust me on this. The Chicken Corn Chowder is worth punching someone in the eye over. French Onion soup? I have worshiped this dish since early childhood, it is done damn well here. I love me some soup, the flavors, the satisfaction, the slurping, all done to the highest standards at Mimi&#39;s. I am making myself soo hungry ...curses! 

The kids meals are outta sight. Whoever came up with this scheme is a brilliant miracle worker who quite clearly has kids of their own, dozens maybe. They bring out some healthy stuff, fruits and cheerios and snacking stuff to ward off hungry kids going to hell in a hand basket while waiting. Then the meal. Then the Worms In The Mud dessert. This consists of gummie worms, chocolate pudding and Oreo cookie crumbs. There is not a child alive who does not consider this most excellent. 

Pinot Grigio, also quite yummy. I really like it here. I can&#39;t find one thing I don&#39;t like, except the damn economy which keeps me from frequenting such havens as much as I damn well please. Oh well, I have a feeling things will be looking up and off to Mimi&#39;s I shall go. I will even splurge for my beloved soup!"

I remember they used to have a really good Reuben sandwich, so that&#39;s what I ordered. Boy was I wrong! This &#34;West Coast Reuben&#34; that was given to me was a JOKE! 

I was expecting, grilled rye bread, with corn beef and sauerkraut with thousand island dressing. Some of them have melted cheese too. What I got was a cold cut, turkey, gristly ham sandwich with sourdough bread, ground cabbage and no dressing at all! A very dry, bland, wrong, gross, tasteless, over priced, cold sandwich. I filled up on the french fries and took the &#34;sandwich&#34; home to feed to my dogs. 

I won&#39;t be back for another decade or longer, if they&#39;re still in business."

I like going to Mimi&#39;s because of their complimentary bread service that contains a few types of their bread.  The carrot/spice being my favorite.  The time prior, we were told you had to ask for the bread, so we ask for the bread service.  The waitress had a snotty attitude and after longer than it should have been, only brought out one type of bread and it wasn&#39;t carrot.  Sad.  Lunch soon came out so I didn&#39;t bother to inquire about the carrot bread.  Lunch soon came out.  I got the salad and BLT.  I thought there could have been a little more bacon in the sandwich.  Would be better to have the bacon as the main flavor and the lettuce and tomato as supporting flavors.   So, if I can&#39;t get the carrot bread, there&#39;s no reason, in my mind, to go back."

Love em, buy them, use them all with the idea that it&#39;s the thought that counts. Needless to say we received a gift card to Mimi&#39;s for Christmas and decided to give it a go on a recent Sunday morning. 

Surprised I was to find that at 10:30am on Sunday morning there wasn&#39;t a line out the door. My wife and I were quickly seated at a booth that could easily hold five people, but it was fun to spread out a bit. 

The food...just ok. My wife took on the two eggs (whites) with potatoes, ham and bacon as I aimed for the Quiche Lorraine. Can&#39;t really mess up the two eggs and the Quiche Lorraine was better than I expected. I did forget that I had a mimosa with breakfast so that could have altered my opinion, but better for Mimi&#39;s. 

An earlier review said that it appears the focus was on the interior and not the food, which I am in agreement with. The food doesn&#39;t taste as if it was made with top ingredients and lacking much flavor. 

The service, however, was top notch. Our server on this day, Jamia who did a fantastic job. With screaming babies at one table, an elderly couple who had been around for a while and our demanding butts she was tops. 

My take...unless you have a gift card to this place you might want to try somewhere else. The breakfast just isn&#39;t IT."

The Aurora Mall is on our way home and it was about 10pm.  I knew that on a Saturday night one of the establishments here would be open.  We almost wandered over to Chili&#39;s but ended up going to Mimi&#39;s instead as an attempt to try something new.

We walked in and it was dead quiet.  We almost thought they were closed because we stood there for a minute or two without being greeted or seated before wandering in the bar to ask if they were open.  We were then seated promptly, right next to the only other occupied table in the establishment which was a couple that was fighting during our entire meal.  For entertainment, my boyfriend and I started mocking them, repeating them and making fun of them in an attempt to point out how rude &amp; ridiculous they were being.  At least that made it fun.

For an appetizer, we split the chicken, bacon &amp; bleu cheese quesadillas.  They were actually quite filling.  We almost wished we hadn&#39;t ordered an entree&#39;.  Luckily, we had just decided to split a sandwich.  A turkey, pesto, avocado &amp; bacon sandwich that was really tasty!  We ended up only taking a few bites before asking for to-go boxes.  It was also my boyfriend&#39;s birthday so we were offered a free desert.  He choose the mousse trio.  The chocolate was ok, the raspberry and the lemon tasted like merange (sp?) and not like mousse at all.  We didn&#39;t finish the desert.

Besides the really irritating couple we sat next to (why seat us next to the only other occupied table in a empty restaurant?) and the lame desert, it wasn&#39;t bad.  I give it a weak 3 stars.  It&#39;s not so deserving of 2, but it didn&#39;t blow me away.  They also serve breakfast so we decided since it&#39;s so close that we&#39;ll have to come back for breakfast at some point.  I&#39;ll let you Yelper&#39;s know once we do!"

Ugly green tables, plastic chopsticks, scenic paintings of waterfalls and fields on the walls, those red plastic water cups. Does some singular Vietnamese restaurant warehouse exist out there in the world that provides to every single Vietnamese restaurant in existence? What does it mean?!?!?

Anyways, Pho Duy is such a welcome find for me. It was my first bowl of pho since I moved here to Colorado. And coming from a spot like the Bay Area where there&#39;s basically a pho restaurant on every block in certain towns, I was nervous about quality being the same. And thankfully, pho is pho is pho. It tasted so solid. The broth was totally there. Not too salty, and not too thin. Didn&#39;t have to drown my broth in oyster sauce or Sriacha to give it flavor. 

Portion size is a little tight here though. I got myself a small, because back home it&#39;s usually enough to fill be to the brim. Here, the small was more like a cereal bowl. First time I&#39;ve ever had a bowl of pho and stayed hungry at the end of the meal.

Prices are pretty nice here all things considered, especially with these inflated Colorado Asian food prices. $6 a bowl is a deal you can&#39;t beat. Perfect meal for these cold as ice days. If you&#39;ve never had pho, then be sure to check this spot out!"

Sure, it&#39;s in the back corner of the Hoffman Heights strip mall but it&#39;s good pho so  the location doesn&#39;t bother me that much. There is no lack of parking options. 

I&#39;m not sure how my small was only $2 less than a large but if I would have know that I would have gone big. I think a medium would do anyone just about right in terms of food amount. Slurp it up and enjoy.

Located in the historic Hoffman Heights neighborhood of Aurora, Pho Duy use to lie on the outskirts of an industrial park off of I-70 and Peoria.  Despite the suspect surroundings of the previous location, Pho Duy never had a problem packing it in.  On a side note, eminent domain kicked in and confiscated the land for the East Light rail line.
So the new digs in Hoffman Heights is very nice.  It is a newly renovated restaurant with attentive service and good pho.  I mark them down a point for having not so fresh meat, but all in all a pretty decent pho.  I came early and I&#39;m glad I did because it looks like this place gets a heavy lunch crowd.

We came by for a bit of a late lunch, and I think that it was probably one of the owners that ended up taking our order. My coworker ordered the lechon, moros y yuca plate, I ordered the lechon sandwich combo -- so it came with a drink and sweet plantains. After I ordered she regretted not getting plantains, and frankly got to be a bit high maintenance ... order taker/owner tried to explain some options all the while giving her just the right amount of sh*t for being high maintenance (it went over her head) but in the end she got to try a plantain (and I didn&#39;t have to share), so it was all good.

One of the benefits to this little comedy at the register was that our food was out pretty much the minute we sat down at our table. My sandwich was huge -- lots of fragrant pulled pork heaped on a pillowy soft demi loaf of bread.  I thought I might save half for later, but it was so delicious that I just couldn&#39;t stop eating. The plantains were the perfect sweet note to end my meal, too.

I&#39;m regretting that we didn&#39;t try any empanadas, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back.  Frijoles definitely deserves a spot in the regular out-to-lunch rotation."

Pretty much everyone I take there says they love it and then dislike it, but I still go back. I think their palate is not built for it. Cuban cuisne is not Mexican, French or American.

Not mine, but it really is good. I&#39;ve had authentic Cuban food in Florida and Frijoles food is every bit as good - maybe better. 

We&#39;ve been there several times and without fail the staff is great. Quick service and plenty of help with understanding the menu for gringos like me. 

Cuban food is a bit too salty for my palate but this review is for Frijoles specifically, not Cuban food generally. If you like Cuban food, you&#39;ll find Frijoles to be a good representation of the cuisine, and you&#39;ll find it to be very consistent. 

They do a great job creating a nice ambiance in their new dining room - quite a feat for a small box restaurant in the parking lot of a grocery store in a busy part of Lakewood. It really is a nice oasis with good service and authentic cuisine."

I didn&#39;t get to come out and try this recently because I really have no business in the area. Nevertheless, the stars aligned today and I took the opportunity to come in and see what it was all about.

The immediate reaction was bustling and lively. Then within 30 seconds we encountered friendly and welcoming. Then after about five minutes delicious and satisfying. Based on the awesome owners straight out of Miami and authentic as you can ask for i felt like I was at home with people handing me things to try and even customers recommending items while standing in line. The excitement from others was based on everything from the food, the Dolphins game, and the excitement created by our hosts. 

The art of hosting is a challenging one and these guys do it naturally and very well!

The food was delicious. I had a traditional Cuban sandwich consisting of ham, Swiss, signature roast pork, mustard and pickles on pressed Cuban Bread. I added some shoestring fries as well. This was a very good sandwich. The flavors merged to a great a tasty sensation of flavor on the pallet.

Ok enough of the girly musings. The food. Is amazing. I love their Lechon , Moro Y yucca. So far I can&#39;t stay away from it. I&#39;ve been here for lunch and dinner. The portions are great.

That sounds like a winner!

What a terrible disappointment that was... The rice was undercooked and with an overpowering taste of vinegar. The pork was Ok, albeit too watery.  The yuca was the best thing on my plate but it was clearly frozen (I know because of how mushy it was).

I am so proud of myself for choosing Frijoles for our pre-airport lunch! I had never tried Cuban food before and was welcomed with open arms by the owner upon walking into the restaurant. He took the time to explain the menu and helped me to select the Veggie Plate. For only $8.95, I received a giant plate of plantains, rice/black beans, and Cuban potatoes (light and flavorful!), all within minutes after placing my order. I had never tried plantains before and was amazed at their banana-like texture and pineapple-like flavor. Phenomenal! I am definitely going to return to Frijoles the next time I visit the Denver area.

Pro Tip #1: If you order a water make sure to take your cup to the front of the restaurant (near the door) and use the pitcher of fresh lemon water. The water from the soda dispenser is a bit carbonated! 

Pro Tip #2: Come hungry because you are not going to want to stop eating after your first bite!"

Nestled right behind the king soooper it might be a little hard to find if you aren&#39;t sure where to look. 

The higher prices of the sandwiches led me I order a plate and it might be the best decision I made all day.

Ordered the lechon Moro y yuca plate and the portion size is huge. For a hair over 10 bucks with tax, I highly recommend a plate here. The flavor was great on the pork and the rice and beans were a nice combination  with the yuca.

The plate wasn&#39;t the prettiest looking thing but taste is king after all. Will be back here in the future!"

I got the Yelp favorite, lechon, moro y yuca. I called it in, and whoever took my order was efficient, friendly, and made me feel confident that when I got to FCCC, I would be met with the correct order. When I got there, the modest dining area was packed. There was a line at the register to order, so there I stood.

As I stood there, I could see my little to-go order all bagged up, ready to go. But I wasn&#39;t anxious to get it and go. Instead, I enjoyed watching the dude behind the grill fire a few chicken breasts to order. The kitchen behind the closed doors was buzzing with people working hard. It was fun to watch the passion in the kitchen behind this small place.

Then my eyes caught the pastries. I&#39;m gluten free, so I was SOL, but their in-house baked goods looked incredible, and the thought of a Cuban sandwich on fresh bread made there made me wanna just order one and know that I&#39;d suffer for a tasty sandwich for a few days after. Instead, I settled for the house made rice pudding. Maybe a little overpriced, but surprisingly delicious. 

When I got to the register, the line behind me had grown. I grabbed my lechon and pudding and trucked on outta there.

Upon getting it home and opening up the styrofoam package--it all LOOKED bland. Yuca in one corner of the container, pulled pork in another, and black rice and beans in the large section. The smell had been wafting around in my car on the way home, and I knew that even though it looked boring, it likely packed some flavor--and my nose didn&#39;t lie. Holy goodness, this is good stuff. I&#39;m in love.

Next I&#39;m going for the grilled chicken plate. I saw it served up. It looks boring too, but man. If the flavor is there, that&#39;s all that matters. Yep, I&#39;m hooked."

So, it was a no brainer that I had to come check this place out. It isn&#39;t a formal sit down restaurant, but it still maintains a more formal feel than a traditional fast-food one. Also, the food has really good flavor. I would recommend coming to check out this place out. 

On my visit, I had Lechon, Moro, y Yuca. This is basically a plate with pork, rice, black beans, yuca and caramelized onions. I thought it was pretty good. Also, I thought the size was decent for a $10 plate. I really enjoy yuca in general, so I may be a little biased when it comes down to it. But, I thought it was a nice plate that represented simple Latin flavors.

I went with a few other people, but they didn&#39;t seem too down with their plates. One of my friends had gotten the Grilled Skirt Steak. He wasn&#39;t especially happy with his plate because he thought his steak was a little too thin for the price he paid. My other two friends had ordered the Cuban Sandwich Combo. They didn&#39;t really agree with the price of $13.00 for their sandwich. They said they could have made it at home. Although they weren&#39;t completely satisfied with their plates, I was completely satisfied with mine. 

They also had a small baked goods section. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try it at the time, but I would be really interested in returning and trying some of these goods out. All in all, it&#39;s a nice place located outside of Denver. If you are interested in trying new foods, I would recommend you come to check this place out!"

This trip was different since we were not going straight to his house. And I&#39;m sure that a pan con lechon would not last our 1 1/2 week road trip around Utah &amp; CO. 

A quick search on Yelp led us to Frijoles Colorados and we were not disappointed. My husband and I had the place practically to ourselves. It was around 3PM. We ordered a pan con lechon and were able to get vaca frita, even though it was before dinner time.  

Verdict? The food was very good and much better than we expected. The pan con lechon was served on proper Cuban bread and was good albeit very heavy on the mojo. The vaca frita, yeah, fried cow, was very good as well.  

We ordered 2 extra pans con lechon and a Cuban sandwich to go. Ya know, because my brother needed a Cuban fix.  These were promptly inhaled upon arrival, so I see a few road trips in his future. 

I will point out that I found the prices on the full plates to be a much better value than the sandwiches.  I have come to expect prices for Cuban food to be higher anywhere outside of Miami, so I was pretty much prepared for that. However, prices are not crazy high.

The folks here are friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is located right across from the King Sooper&#39;s parking lot. Easy to miss unless you&#39;re actually looking for it."

He also told me all about his grandkids, and introduced me to his son and daughter-in-law, who were right there working behind the counter. It made me miss Miami so damn much! 
The food!!! Totally authentic and delicious. The dude got his favorite, vaca frita. He was born and raised in Miami and when we lived in Detroit I had to hear about how much he missed this dish at least once a week. He was so happy I seriously think I saw him tear up.
I got the special of the day, its been a month or so and I don&#39;t remember what it exactly was. I do remember eating almost the entire, enormous plate!
We got rice and beans and plantains for the little one.

I had the midnight sandwich and it came out hot and delicious. The Cuban sweet Bread was on point, and the pork was excellent, might have benefitted from more mustard but that&#39;s easily fixed.

The food was good and the service was great. The lady taking our order was super nice (5 stars for service). Everyone I went with liked it but didn&#39;t love it.

So why am I not giving it 5 stars? I mean, I don&#39;t really understand what made it so special to others but the chicken was like most chicken I&#39;ve had in my life.

I had a special last time with chicken, rice and beans, plantains, all really good. I&#39;ve also had the pork dish with similar sides. Both are authentic, flavorful.

She let us try the pork she was marinating and it was amazing, I should have ordered that. I got the Cuban sandwich which was really hot, well pressed together, quality meat. Everyone in our group had different orders and loved their food. 
The pricing structure is odd. For 3.25 more you get a soda and 3 sweet plantain wedges, I&#39;m not sure if plantains are expensive but this seemed expensive for a small serving. So a basic sandwich combo cost 12.95 a bit much for it to be a regular lunch stop. But it is quality food so it might not be fair to criticize the price when I really did enjoy the meal."

But it was very difficult... Most places serve Mexican food and  Cuba Cuba is not authentic. I magically stumbled upon this place though and I can say there&#39;s at least one authentic Cuban food place in the Denver area (this is in Lakewood though, FYI). 

The drive stinks but it&#39;s totally worth it. I get lechon, Moro, and plantains EVERY time. Yes it&#39;s like $10 but it&#39;s that same price in Orlando... Our Caribbean food takes a lot more work than people realize, so I&#39;m willing to pay a reasonable price for it. 

No but really... Best Cuban food in the area, sweet service (all of the men are friendly, kind, and personable). Not a lot of seating but I&#39;ve never had trouble finding a spot to sit...

Abundant Cuban decorations with granite tables and a variety of comfy seats to choose from. The bar will soon serve beer and wine. Most important the food remains traditional down home Cuban, no fusion here. They bake their own breads and patries,  the Cubano and Pan con Bistec (Cuban steak sandwich) are as good if not better than the best Miami equivalents. My favorites are fritas (Cuban hamburger), palomilla platter (Cuban steak) and the picadillo con arroz blanco, frijoles coloraos y tostones, (ground beef, red beans pottage, white rice and green plantain) Daily specials compliment the exclusively Cuban menu. Make sure  you save room for dessert, café cubano and home made flan

This is run by a family of transplanted Miami Cubans, 3 generations of restauranteurs that began in the 1950s in Cuba. This is my piece of Cuba in the Front Range, as a Cuban American it serves as my weekly injection of Cubanismo!"

The food was delicious and the service was just as good. From the minute we walked in and they gave us samples of their rice pudding, to answering all our questions when we were ordering, to giving us samples of their signature pork and yuca dish (which was awesome) when they brought out our sandwiches - we couldn&#39;t have asked for a better experience. We ordered the El Cubano and the Pan con Lechon and split - both were amazing. The cubano was perfectly crispy and the tender fall apart pork on the other had a delicious flavor. We were happy we got the combos so that we could try the plantains, they were lightly crisped and sweet, really good. It was a lot of food, we probably could&#39;ve split one sandwich, but it was too good not to finish. If we are ever back in Denver, we will definitely make a point to come back!"

I thought it would be an experience to try Cuban food somewhere other than Miami. We got here rather early at around 11:30am. We were the only ones in the restaurant other than 2 staff members. They were so friendly and very helpful in explaining their menu. We ordered sandwiches and Café con Leche&#39;s, our version of breakfast.

Big pots simmering on the stove and a case with a smattering of baked goods.  

I had the Moro y Yuca platter with their signature pulled pork, rice with black beans, and caramelized onions. The server at the register asked if I wanted the yuca or a substitute, and I asked him, &#34;what would you recommend&#34;.  He said &#34;Yuca of course!&#34;  Good call as it was as soft and delectable as the pulled pork.  Very mild flavors thus I doused the plate with their table hot sauces.

The Vegetarian Platter had the same rice and yuca, but instead of pork had the sweet deep fried plantains which had a nice crispy crunch on the outside.   They brought the wrong rice (white) but graciously replaced the whole platter cheerfully.
The Cuban sandwich had ham and cheese but also roasted pork, and though it looked a bit flat, got glowing reviews from our table.

The lechon was AMAZING, very juicy and so flavorful. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the yuca, but I think that&#39;s just a personal preference. The moro was delicious too and their portions were well worth the $10. Initially I was disappointed, when I opened the take out box I wasn&#39;t impressed. It looks very bland but don&#39;t be fooled, the taste is better than it appears! I will be coming back for their Cubano and cortadito next.

Then why dont you marry it?&#34;.  Fine.  Then call Mrs. Frijoles.  This is some of the best food you will find in Colorado.  And I&#39;m not just saying that because it is run by the most gracious, cutest family on the planet.  I&#39;m saying that because this food is outrageously authentic, it feels like your Cuban grandmother cooked it straight from her kitchen.  we got the pork with black beans and rice and the chicken paella and both were outrageously good.  the portions were gigantic and my husband thought it was so good that he ate the whole plate and was sick he was so stuffed.   

We both agreed the entrees we so good that we must try the dessert and coffee.  and we did. and OMG! the flan with the caramel and crunchy bits on top was THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.  and I had flan 6 weeks straight in Spain.  yea.  that&#39;s how for real this is.

The coffee was delicious as well.  so bold but smooth.  it could definitely turn me into a coffee drinker.  perfect way to finish a meal.  Or start your day!

I don&#39;t live even remotely close to here but I will make special trips for this place....  and take everyone I know here....and maybe propose to it...and run away and marry it..."

Seriously one word description is all that&#39;s needed here folks. I&#39;ve not had tons of Cuban food to compare it to but regardless it was so good.

The hubs and I both got the same thing; the shredded pork with black beans/rice and yucca. This is the signature dish and highlighted in 5280 magazine. 

The pork was juicy and full of flavor while the beans and rice were perfectly cooked. They reminded us of Costa Rican gallo pinto which is totally delicious. You just can&#39;t go wrong with black beans and rice. The yucca was I think boiled. Tasting similar to a potato, it was a really nice compliment to the pork. 

The servings were huge and we ended up eating half and taking the other half for lunch the next day. Everything re-heated nicely which was impressive. 

Absolutely recommend coming here!"

I ordered just a regular El Cubano and really enjoyed it. It takes a while to get your sandwich, but the wait is worth it. The ham and cheese tastes great with the roast pork, and the bread is nice and chewy. I also had the cheese and guava empanada, which was very sweet, but still tasty. It was more of a desert empanada. Frijoles Colorado was the perfect dinner on a rainy weekday night. We&#39;ll be back for sure."

I figured it&#39;s a Cuban restaurant i&#39;ll get the Cuban sandwich. Terrible life decision. 

If it was a $5 sandwich I wouldn&#39;t be able to complain. But it&#39;s $9. And the thing is embarrassing. I don&#39;t know if it was the specific cook? Or if it was because we got it to go? But the thing was thinner than most PB&amp;Js I&#39;ve seen. Minimal amount of ham.. Minuscule amount of pork. Seriously upsetting.

The pizza slices are huge and less than $5 a slice depending on what toppings you get. When I go, I usually order a regular with jalapeños. They do a good job loading up on the topping too. Most of the time, one slice gets me full but if I feel like pigging out, I get a second slice :)

There&#39;s usually street parking available, so when I order at the window and it&#39;s cold out, I just go back to my car and wait for my order to be called. 

Note, if you want to order a whole pizza to go on a weekend night, be ready to wait at least an hour. But the wait is definitely worth it!"

That said, the wait was not really reasonable. We were seated immediately, and ordered one slice of cheese and a full 26&#34; pie. The menu said that greatness takes time, so we were prepared to wait a bit. However, it took us over an hour to get our pizza and our slice. There were people who arrived more than 30 minutes after us who were already getting their food, which is always frustrating to see.

Now, I probably could&#39;ve gotten over the wait, but there was no (and I mean NO) communication from the waitstaff about why the pizza was taking so long (again, a full hour). Our waitress walked by our table and looked at us multiple times, and never mentioned that the pizza would be here soon, or apologized for the long wait, or anything. Eventually, a member of our party went back toward the pizza kitchen, tried for a few minutes to get someones attention, then we were informed that there was about an hour wait for pizzas. I really feel like this should have been mentioned to us when we ordered, so that we could&#39;ve either said that it was okay, or chosen somewhere else to eat. If there&#39;s an hour wait, that is what it is, but I think it&#39;s only fair to customers to tell them about the possible wait beforehand.

 
If our waitress had come by and said something like &#34;hey guys, we have a long wait right now for pizzas, sorry for the inconvenience, it&#39;ll be out in about half an hour&#34;, I still would feel frustrated but it wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal. However, considering we waited over an hour with no communication from staff (and honestly, they were a little rude), left me with a really bad taste in my mouth.

Again, the pizza was SO good. Like really good. But the experience with the wait and the staff means I don&#39;t plan on returning anytime soon."

They estimated our wait time to be 60-75 minutes on a Sunday afternoon but we were seated in 45 minutes. The food was definitely worth the wait! Their biscuit sandwiches are to die for. We got The Franklin which was a biscuit with buttered fried chicken with bacon and cheddar and smothered in gravy and WOW it was very delicious and filling. Just looking at the scrumptious gravy oozing from the sandwich before you take your first bite is already mouthwatering enough. Most of their biscuit sandwiches were a tad under $10 too so you really get a great value for these.

They also have New York style pizza there which was freaking delicious as well! Ended up getting a slice of the Pepperoni and Italian Sausage and they were both winners. The slices are humongous and at $3.50 a pop, you are getting way more than you pay for. Their NY style pizza is up among the very best I&#39;ve ever had.

This place seems like its always super packed so I wouldn&#39;t come here if you are starving. But if you can stand a little wait, you will get an amazing meal. Once you&#39;re in and order, the food comes out pretty fast too so there&#39;s not really an additional wait. Wish there was an Atomic Cowboy here in California!"

The Atomic Cowboy blends a fun, funky atmosphere with solid food and a few noted idiosyncrasies, some good, some not. It was jam packed at the time of our arrival, and rather than hand us a pager, The Atomic Cowboy sent me a text when our table was ready (good idiosyncrasy). 

Once inside, we found that the menu reflects the dual branding. One side is pizzas (by the slice or pie) and salads; the other is biscuit sandwiches, biscuit platters, and sides. Though The Atomic Cowboy is presumably run as one business, the food actually comes from two different kitchens, so if people at your table order from different sides of the menu, you won&#39;t get everything at the same time (bad idiosyncrasy). The service also lagged a bit due to the volume at the time of our visit, but I&#39;ve experienced far worse.

As far as the food is concerned, the pizza slices are huge, and the toppings fresh. I opted for a shrimp and grits biscuit platter, however, and was not disappointed. The shrimp and pancetta were plentiful, and the biscuit added a nice textural contrast.

The pricing here is hard to pin down. The $10.95 I paid for my shrimp and grits was reasonable, filling as it was. However, pizza starts at $3.50 a slice, with 45 or 65 cents for each topping (depending on the topping). This can easily put you at $5 a slice, which would be outrageous if the slices weren&#39;t as big as your head.

The Atomic Cowboy is an interesting concept and worth a visit if you have the time to spare. But if you&#39;re starving or sporting a headache when you walk in, this place will wear you out fast."

We (myself, wife, son), arrived around 5pm on a monday. The evening crowd haven&#39;t poured in yet, so I feel we hit it right. Parking is a challenge, but all great food spots have that issue.

The slices are no joke the size of your head. They are not your average slice, and one slice is enough for one person. Mozzarella sticks were cooked well and recommend them. The slices weren&#39;t extremely oily and have flavor. I could go on for days, but I&#39;ll save it for another time, another review.

Now on to my favorite part... Brunch... The biscuits are to die for. They are crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. The ingredient combinations are incredible- apple butter and sausage and an egg? Yes please! A biscuit cinnamon roll with bacon? Yes a must to share! The cheesy grits? All day!

The Fat Sully&#39;s pizza is good. Damn good. Tell your friends about it and drag them to Denver to try it good. Slices bigger than your head, made to order, and surprisingly inexpensive. We are big eaters, yet two slices makes for a satisfactory meal.

As for the bar itself...it&#39;s a wee bit too fancy for my tastes. There is a large selection of beer on tap, but it can be tough finding ones that taste like beer! PERFECT for beer snobs, not so much for those of us who drink a lot and prefer a lower alcohol content brew. 

As for the service, unlike many other reviewers, I&#39;ve never had a problem. At all. Over numerous visits to both locations. Seated at the bar or the dining room, various times of the day. The bartenders, wait staff, and especially the doormen have been beyond friendly and helpful. 

The atmosphere is nice, a little something for everyone. Sports on the big screens, pool table, board games, and music which is generally considerably better than what you would normally expect. 

Parking  (both locations) is TOUGH! In fact, that might be THE best advantage of living in Colorado Springs...where the hell do you Denverites park?

I highly recommend checking out the Atomic Cowboy. The Colfax location is perfect for pre/postgaming a Bluebird show."

Unfortunately, tonight our pizza was not up to par (by far!!!) and the only option the first bartender and manager gave me was to get another slice after I ate the sub par one. I&#39;m not out to get one over on you...it was a poor quality piece of pizza. Too bad they don&#39;t care what regulars think (or anyone for that matter) and couldn&#39;t offer anything but more food. So disappointing for one of my regular joints. 

Positive: The one star comes for the second bartender that seemed to care we weren&#39;t happy. Thanks for taking an interest in your customer. 

Update: Props to the manager Nate for following up with me and asking more about the experience. He seemed to genuinely want to understand and find ways to prevent in the future. I hope to return and have the good pizza and service I&#39;ve had before."

I&#39;m only reviewing the Denver biscuit company, housed within the atomic cowboy. That said, the pizza joint in the bar also inside were very popular during my visit. 

We have tried to eat here twice prior to this visit and both times the wait was over an hour with a line out the door and around the block. Today we were fortunate enough that the wait was 30 minutes and there was some seating inside so we didn&#39;t have to wait in the cold.

Once we were seated we ordered the Franklin and an order of biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. The Franklin is a biscuit sandwich that has fried chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese and their sausage gravy stuff between two pieces of a biscuit. I&#39;m here to tell you that that was an amazing &#34;sandwich&#34; that I will be back for. The biscuits and gravy were also phenomenal, in fact my daughter said &#34;if you and mom made biscuits and gravy this good I could eat it every day.&#34; We ordered a side of bacon to go with the biscuits and gravy, and I&#39;m here to tell you that the bacon was also out of this world. You can tell that they take pride in their product.

We were more than impressed with the service and the food.

I&#39;d heard about their setup before going here, and thought it was all kinds of confusing, but once you go - you&#39;ll get it.

Two thumbs up for the surprisingly cheap booze! We came in to gorge on some DBC post-Colfax half marathon, and the bloody&#39;s were only $6?! Say what?! I feel like most bloody&#39;s will set you back at least $10 these days so that was a pleasant surprise. They also had some interesting cold coffee-flavored libations that I&#39;m dying to try the next time we go back for brunch.

DELICIOUS, inexpensive pizza with great toppings, quick service, and pretty wide drink selection.  TVs everywhere to catch a game if you&#39;d like, but also a great place to catch up with a friend in a booth or possibly play some pool.

The only downside- last time I went we checked the website first which confirmed they still do happy hours on Fridays.  Once inside the restaurant, some of the menus reflected this, yet our waitress informed us that happy hour no longer was offered on Fridays.  We spoke with a manager who gave us the deal, so all was well- but I&#39;d recommend making sure everything in print be revised before officially changing over your policy. :)"

Their pizza is the best, sure there are people that will probably say this pizza or that pizza is better. That&#39;s bs I say. I love atomic, I have been coming here for years and my opinion of their pie has not changed. Also another thing to note: their beer list...pretty good. They always have some fancy rotating taps which as a beer snob is what I look for. Had a damn good sour there the other day which reminded me of my beer snob days in Oregon. Unless you go to a specialty beer place it&#39;s not easy to find a place that keeps some interesting semi relevant beers on draft, but atomic kind of does! Another thing to note...get the salad! So freaking good. Very refreshing with the pepperoncini and feta...about as refreshing of a salad as possible. Don&#39;t pass this off! Love you atomic"

All other times of the day, Atomic Cowboy has the mother of pizza. Huge huge new York style pies and slices. Fresh ingredients, just the right amount of grease and a crispy crust.

This is also a bar at night. They play the best throwback hip hop and pop music you could ask for. There are pool tables, delicious drinks and cute waiters.

One slice pizza 3.50 + 40 cents each topping. The pizza slice is HUGE so you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. 

I got basil, onion and Canadian bacon on my pizza &amp; thoroughly enjoyed the pizza (perhaps being buzzed also helped make it taste extra yummy). My major complaint is that it took a LONG time to get my food and it took a while to get a waiter to our table. I do love that they open late night thus making it a perfect joint to go to after a night of drinking but I only wish that service was faster.

The artwork is kitschy and amusing, and the layout is open, making it easy to find friends in the evening. The staff has always been attentive, knowledgable about their beer and friendly as well. At some point in the evening they begin to card at the door, but I personally don&#39;t mind since I&#39;m probably coming to have a beer anyway.

As for the food, the slices are HUGE for a very reasonable price, with all the toppings you could ever imagine available. The pizza&#39;s are even bigger (beware ordering the 26&#34;, despite our best efforts with 5 we could not finish one, leftovers for all!) I love that they have artichoke hearts on the toppings menu, as well as a variety of meats and veggies and even cheeses like feta. The beer selection here is also quite good with a wide variety of beers, from local breweries to nationally distributed beers.

This all happened at on a Thursday night after midnight so it&#39;s not like they were supper busy. The manager didn&#39;t seem to care their employees were ignoring customs. I can safely say that atomic has lost a long time repeat customer, but they are probably to cool to care."

Doorman has been rude and power-trippy on a few occasions now and have actually seen other parties deny their customership based solely on his greetings. The pizza was awful the last few times. Can tell it sits around for a while and isn&#39;t fresh, and their attempts to heat it back up w a sprinkle of fresh cheese on top are half-assed to say the least. On various occasions both slice and pie were soggy and rubbery. The entire place is a bar, and they will hassle you if you&#39;re not both eating and drinking. The manager was rude and didn&#39;t seem to care that his pizza was bad or his doorman was driving away customers at the door. The atmosphere is dark, usually w RnB slow jams playing, not very fun. Overall, not a great experience and need to get some employees who work hard and don&#39;t stroke their egos based on old praise from Westword. We get it, you look cool and you&#39;re a bartender at a hip joint so your friends think your cool too, but you work at a pizza place bro. A pizza place.

It was the first place I went out to eat after going gf and was totally nervous because of my love of beer and their great selection.. but the bartender that night was awesome! He shared his personal story about his brother&#39;s food sensitivity and totally eased my mind about relearning how to approach going out to eat; he was incredibly knowledgeable about gluten free beers, and how to make them not taste to bad (because, really, gluten free beers are generally pretty gross), he told me about various ciders that he likes and it really helped.

Whenever I&#39;m craving pizza this is the place I go. I also really appreciate that their kitchen is open so late, because my husband works late and the options for places we can both eat are really limited. Good place."

I would have gone 5 starts except for the fact that my friend got the mushroom and pep slice and while the toppings were very generous, the mushrooms were just ok. I usually like a lot of different toppings on my pizza, but this fine day, in a mildly hungover state, I opted for the plain old pepperoni. It was excellent. Thin crust, lovely crisp, flavorful cheese and pepperoni, just what I was looking for. Our server was nice but rarely easy to find. Drink refills were a bit slow. I would definitely make my way back, probably for a whole pie next time. It takes about 30 min and there just wasn&#39;t time."

After seeing the pizza I wish I&#39;d had room for both, it looks amazing. We went around brunch time on a Saturday, so it was super busy and there was a wait. They provide sidewalk chalk out front so we entertained ourselves (and the children we were with) by drawing very colorful squirrels. 

Once seated inside in a comfortable booth in the back we were met with the decision of pizza or biscuit. Since I can get the most amazing pizza at home I opted for the biscuit, and it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the vegetarian biscuits and gravy (a shiitake mushroom gravy with big chunks of mushroom throughout) I went with a biscuit sandwich--cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato. It was perfection, exactly what I wanted, except I forgot to order the homemade pickles, and will forever regret it. The biscuit itself is the best I&#39;ve ever had, including in the south. It&#39;s fluffy, but chewy, but flakey. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but I&#39;m glad they do!  Biscuit options are pretty endless, and you can design your own decadent plate. Add a fried egg, add cheese, add gravy. Go crazy. You will be very full though, so beware. 

The service was great. We were there with two kids, and our server brought out waters with lids for them in addition to their beverages. Waters without asking for them is always a plus in my book. They also provided a high chair, and the service was very friendly and our server was knowledgeable. I wish Philly had a place with biscuits this good!"

Happy hour is from 4pm to 7pm.  They had $3 slices and 1/2 price beer, wine and well drinks.  My gin and tonic was okay, and was of a decent size.  My cider was bit warm for my taste, but was filled to the brim.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The decor was fun.  The barstools were unusually comfortable.

One complaint, the ID gauntlet I had to run to get inside seemed excessive for 6pm on a Tuesday.  They scanned my driver&#39;s license (something that always feels like and invasion of privacy to me).  They then stamped my hand with a 2 inch by 2 inch block lettered &#34;AC&#34; in black ink.  Removing this stamp the next morning took enough scrubbing that my hand felt a bit raw.  I understand that they are paranoid about the lovely liquor enforcement officers setting them up for a massive fine . . . something that always seems more punitive and revenue gathering than actual public safety in my mind.  However, when you are over 40, and look it, this all seems like a waste of time and bunch of B.S."

Service was SLOOWWWWW and had a bit of attitude.  Maybe our server was just ticked that she had to work on such a fun night.  Maybe she didn&#39;t like us.  Maybe she was just a grump.   But it took forever to get her attention to reorder drinks (we ended up going to the bar twice while she disappeared) and get our check.  

One time during our hour and a half stay did she come check on us.  Never dis she ask if we enjoyed our food (which we did).

The biscuit sandwiches is one of Denver&#39;s best meals.  Fat Sully&#39;s Pizza is every bit as good, although a bit less novel, even when factoring in the Godzilla-sized slices.  Decent enough beer selection.  Fair prices.  Cool decor.  

The only reason I didn&#39;t give AC 6-stars (other than it that being technically impossible) is because the biscuit sandwich will pretty much put you out of commission for the next five hours (assuming you have no self control and must devour the whole thing- like myself).

Their pizza, Fat Sully&#39;s, is delicious and you can get it by the slice. It&#39;s cheap - under $4 for a Sbarro-sized slice. I recommend pairing it with their chipotle ranch sauce. You can either order pizza outside at their window, or sit inside and be served. 

Wednesday nights they have trivia and it&#39;s awesome. They incorporate drinking games into almost each round. The music is always great, and the people watching is the best. It&#39;s a mx of blue-hairs who lived in the neighborhood before it was trendy, hipsters who rock the cut-off jorts, families whose kids stare, bug-eyed at the rest of the clientele, and kickball teams wanting a celebratory beer.

They serve breakfast too, from the Denver Biscuit Company. I&#39;ve had it once and got a pancake/syrup/egg/cheese/sausage sandwich. You have the option of putting your sandwich on a biscuit of pancake. Go with the biscuit. The pancake was a little gritty and was just soaked in syrup.

I really wanted a biscuit and didn&#39;t realize that the Denver Biscuit Company is only open until 2PM each day, but the rest of bar and sister restaurant are open till 2AM.  So, we settled for the pizza from Fat Sully&#39;s, the sister business within the Atomic Cowboy building.  Wow... the pizza slices are HUGE (my friend could hide their head behind her slice).  The slices are good and reasonably priced.  For $4 you get the extra large slice and your choice of toppings for $0.40 each (one slice was enough).  You can pair it with your choice of several good craft beers on draft and make for a decent evening.  The pizza was good, crust was nice and crispy, but wasn&#39;t worth taking a cab from downtown Denver to find this place for pizza.  Maybe if the biscuit place was open, but I digress.  I&#39;ll think about coming back for the biscuits."

Definitely not a southern BBQ place. However, it&#39;s more of a teriyaki rice/noodle bowl place with grilled meats. The food was good, filling portion and about average price for a lunch $7-$10. The staff is friendly and asked how we liked our food. I would avoid the drive through however, seeing the staff is a little limited you could be waiting a bit. 

Definitely worth trying again, little curious if this place is run by the same owner as the rice/noodle bowl establishment that existed in the same location prior to this one and if they just rebranded their name."

The other had a platter that included fried catfish and shrimp, BBQ ribs, BBQ sausage, and BBQ chicken, and had hush puppies and macaroni and cheese on the side.  Oh- and sweet potato pie for desert.  We lived in Louisiana for ten years, and this place stacks up well against any place down there.  Highlights included the potato salad, the ribs, the mac and cheese, and both pies.  One of us thought the catfish was perfect while the other one thought it was a touch too salty.

It&#39;s definitely not a southern BBQ joint (no ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc), it&#39;s more like Asian BBQ.   You can order chicken, pork, beef, combo, or tofu either regular or spicy.  If you order a bowl, it comes with rice.  If you order a plate, it comes with rice and a side.  We tried the cajun potatoes, which were basically giant home fries with a light dusting of cajun seasoning on them. I had the beef and pork.  Both were very good and while the consensus of the table was that the pork was the favorite, I would go back for the beef, personally.  The bourbon sauce is very mild and sweet - I would order spicy next time for sure.  I tried a bite of my friend&#39;s noodle bowl and wish experienced instant regret - it was very flavorful and rich! Shoulda ordered that instead of the rice plate.  Service was great - the owner (?) was very friendly and came out to check on us several times.  The prices are a little steep for what you get - a big helping of rice and about 6 big pieces of meat. For $9, I would expect the drink to be included, but that was an extra $2.  I&#39;m also a little skeptical about how the are going to pull off drive-thru service when our orders took about 10 minutes to come out... and we were the only customers there.

Service was slow at start. Took a bit for anyone to show up to take drink orders as well as restocking chips and salsa. Which, by the way, were really good.

Food was better than most rubber stamp Mexican places and atmosphere was great for outer party of six.

The complimentary tortilla chips were light and crispy, like the ones served at Chevy&#39;s Fresh Mex.  The salsa was good too.

We started with the Guacamole Dip.  It was served in a fried flour tortilla shell on a bed of lettuce and pico de gallo and garnished with queso fresco.  There wasn&#39;t much actual guacamole.

My husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo which included 3 warm tortillas.  His chicken was a little dry.  He had leftovers.

I ordered the Carnitas Street Tacos which were 4 little tacos with plenty of toppings.  The carnitas was a little dry, but the flavor was good.  I liked the Ajuua Green Salsa that came with the entree.

The adults were mostly happy with their meals but the two kids meals were just terrible.  My daughter wanted Cheese Quesadillas and upon receiving them I noticed they were dry and feather light with almost no cheese in them.  I took some filling from my burrito and made her dinner into something that was much more pleasant for her, otherwise she would have been chewing on two very dry tortillas.

My son wanted Ultimate Nachos but because he wanted to omit half the ingredients the lady we were placing the order with suggested we get a kids meal nacho dinner and it would have cheese, meat and sour cream which is exactly what he wanted.  He ended up with a very small container of chips very lightly covered with cheese (that was nearly invisible because at first I thought they forgot the cheese), sour cream but no meat!  I guess they forgot it.  His meal was feather light.  Again, we had to add more to his meal since there was so little to it.

And unfortunately, I ended up with bad stomach cramps from my Super Chimi.  It tasted good but why would I get a stomach ache?  Something went wrong somewhere.  I&#39;ve been cooking for my family for 20 years and neither myself or my family has ever been sick from my cooking.  

The other three adults were happy with their burritos and I didn&#39;t hear anyone else complain about stomach aches so I guess I was the only one.

Overall, not bad but avoid the kids meals, they aren&#39;t worth a $1.  Worst kids meals ever."

I had spinach enchiladas at Ajuua!! last night. The date ordered the Mexican burger, which I thought looked like a burrito, but seemingly contained a ground beef patty. It was somewhat odd in my opinion, but I didn&#39;t taste the date&#39;s food. I think the lime rice that came with my veggie dish was better than the usual rice that I had with the tacos I ordered last time.

Our waitress was all right, not super attentive, but she did ask if I wanted a refill on my water once. 

I do think that for the food quality and portion sizes that it&#39;s a little overpriced; it definitely seems to be less of a value than Tequila&#39;s, which I think tastes better. 

I don&#39;t really like the dark interior of the restaurant, and when we sat at the bar a bit to watch the end of the Cavaliers win on one of the TVs, the bar area smelled funky. Thank goodness I didn&#39;t smell that before I dinner."

I went to eat Mexican food? Truly shocking! 

Okay, here goes my list of things I judge a Mexican place on during my first visit:

1. Green chille: It was good! Nothing special, but good. It had a nice, thick consistancy. 

2. Chile rellano: Very tasty! Crispy and just cheesy enough.

3. Enchilada: I do not remember this enchilada at all. So I guess it was fine.

4. Chips and Salsa: Great chips--they remind me of  the chips at Chili&#39;s, which are cripsy and amazing. The salsa was yummy and perfectly spicy.

5. Margarita: This margarita was whatever. I didn&#39;t hate it and I didn&#39;t love it. I took a sip of my friend&#39;s cucumber marg and it was really unique and tasty. I couldn&#39;t drink a whole one, though.

The service here was bizarre. The waitress came to give us our check and she asked if we wanted it split up and we did. We each got a drink and food and there wasn&#39;t anything complicated about it. She literally fake cried at us about having to do it. I&#39;m not even joking when I say she whined like a little kid who wants something they aren&#39;t getting. Annoying. Then my friend ordered a burrito to go for her hubby (before the check was even brought to us) and we sat there waiting for a long, long time for it. Also annoying.

The waitress did put free sopapillas in our bag because the wait was long, which was nice. 

I&#39;d go here again when I&#39;m hanging out with my Aurora friends, but it didn&#39;t knock my socks off. One thing I really did enjoy was that you can get black beans instead of refried and that makes me happy! Both the refried and black beans were tasty."

I came here with my wife and we started with the Queso Fundido, which tasted wonderful. The only drawback was it was was very thick, we&#39;d have preferred it a bit creamier. 

For the meal, we each had a Medina; Chimichanga and Chalupa, and Smothered Burrito and Enchilada. Both were exceptionally good. The tortillas were homemade and fresh. The meals were delicious.

The service was a little slow, but the dining experience made up for it. All in all, we had a fabulous experience at Ajuua today. We will be coming back next weekend for our daughter&#39;s birthday celebration."

I had a party of 6 at the 14150 E. Iliff Ave  Aurora location on Sunday, 5/15/16. I initially called when I was planning this event to confirm that I was understanding their website special, &#34;Is everything on the Combination page of the menu 25% off on Sunday.&#34; The answer was yes. 
At the restaurant with the menu open to Combinaciones and pointing at it, I asked my waiter who is fluent in English, &#34;Is everything on this page 25% off?&#34;  He said &#34;Yes&#34;. 
I ordered the Relleno Burrito and one of my friends also ordered a dish from that section. When we got the bill, we were charged the full price. I brought it to the waiter&#39;s attention and reminded him of what he told me earlier. He said, No, only those items above that section are 25% off. He refused to give us 25% off. 
I tried to send a message to management on the contact page of their website. The contact page has a section requiring a security code but it doesn&#39;t give you the code. When you click on &#39;send&#39; you get an error message.
So I called the restaurant asking for a manager. Eventually, one got on the phone. I mentioned the problem with the security code. He was quiet for awhile, perhaps he was checking it out, and finally he said, &#34;I don&#39;t know my friend.&#34; Is that the best he can say? 
What would a professional say?  Don&#39;t you think something like this is more appropriate&#34;?  &#34;I didn&#39;t realize that. I&#39;ll be sure to look into it ASAP. In the meantime, is there anything I can help you with?&#34;  But that wasn&#39;t the manager&#39;s style. I asked him how I can contact the owner and he gave me an email address. 
I asked the manager if he is interested in resolving my problem. He gave a half hearted yes and I explained the above. His answer was essentially, despite the fact that I asked twice &#39;everything on this page&#39; and I was told yes, I should have known that the Relleno Burrito is not a combination.  I said it was because traditional burritos are beans and rice and chili relleno is a different meal and you&#39;re combining them, so it&#39;s a combination!  He said no and I said yes. We got into an argument where it sounded to me like he was implying that I&#39;m stupid for not realizing the Relleno Burrito is not a combination. I raised my voice and he threatened to end the call because he didn&#39;t like the sound of my voice.  
I told him that if it&#39;s not reconciled I&#39;ll add my experience to yelp and the manager said it was fine with him. So he is blowing off yelp as well. 
I emailed the owner and haven&#39;t heard back from him. Ajuua rates a real zero."

Very friendly staff met my wife,  our 2 kids, and myself.  Chips and salsa were great (thin and crispy and good veggie flavor in the salsa) and they refilled it happily and quickly. Kids ordered the chicken strips (least &#34;Mexican&#34; thing on the menu,  and chicken enchiladas). The kids liked it just fine.  The wife ordered some tacos and got the steak based on the recommendation of our waitress,and I ordered some lime shrimp tostadas. The shells of her tacos were dark brown and mushy. Plain,  out of the package tortillas would&#39;ve been better.  The steak wasn&#39;t seasoned at all and slightly overcookedsup it was a bit tough.  The tostada was slightly soggy from lime juice and the baby shrimp had little flavor to themselves as I take it the juice from the lime was poured over them and went directly into the tostadas. Dishes-1 star... Service-3.5."

The warm chips and salsa are good. 
Being vegetarians, we had the veg fajitas and poblano pepper stuffed with spinach. 
The portions are enough to feed an army ;)
We loved the fajitas. Yummy !
The stuffed poblano pepper is delicious!
The desserts are not great, just mediocre. 
Our friends who are non vegetarians have also liked the place so I guess it is a place worth checking out."

I wouldn&#39;t recommend however I wouldn&#39;t tell someone not to go. The mediocre food is ok. If you like a big margarita you&#39;ll get it but the mixture is below par. We ordered 2  1 had so much tequila it was like drinking it straight. The other was all syrup couldn&#39;t even taste the alcohol which is rarely possible with tequila...less than impressed. The margaritas are the same price as your entree so for the price they in no way held up their end.

The only issue I&#39;ve had was with the service. The first two times I sat in the dining room and the service was extremely slow. Not just to get the meal served, but to have my order taken, drink refills etc.  The wait staff seems preoccupied or distracted, not sure. 

I gave it another chance last night and sat in the bar thinking it would be quicker. My friend and I waited over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the bartender who was busy with 3 customers at the bar. We chose to have the all you can eat tacos thinking - how long could that take? It was more than 20 minutes to get food and only after we interrupted the bartender to inquire.  On top of it he got the order wrong too (keep in mind it was tacos). We were so hungry we ate it as is. After he realized how long we were there the service improved slightly. He could tell we were a little annoyed. He was quick to bring the check. 

I can understand waiting when the restaurant is busy but that was not the case. The bartender sat at the table next to us with a couple of women swapping stories while we waited 5 feet away. Invisible."

Furthermore, the prices were $2-$3  higher per item when compared to their online menu. You have to pay for your sourcream on your food which is standard fair at all other Mexican restaurants I have frequented . Finally, upon screwing up our order, no effort was made to get the correct order out to us in a timely fashion and no effort to compensate us was made either. Our food was soo late we ended up taking it to-go and my husband shared my meal. The decor was nice and felt like Mexico however ..."

I have been going to the Peoria location for years, it is my all time favorite authentic Mexican food around! I especially love them because I don&#39;t eat pork &amp; their green chilli is vegetarian so for once I can get my food smothered!!! I have always had a WONDERFUL experience at the Peoria location. The staff is always friendly &amp; very helpful!

Now this place ...their food is equally as good as the Peoria location, BUT one of the worst customer service EVER!

First it took forever to get our waitress over,. We could hardly get refills...we felt like we didn&#39;t exist...&amp; when we did it was all wrong! Fist this lady FINALLY came over to refill my friends glass w/ water...&#34;wait&#34; I said &#34;my friend has ice tea&#34; she didn&#39;t care she told me I was wrong &amp; filled it W/ WATER anyway. When my friend came back she was upset but of course it would be another 15-20 min before she came back so my friend quietly sipped her water.

But what really pissed me off was what happened next! My friend used a groupon to pay for our meal. They lady took her phone &amp; disappeared for another 10 min!!!!! WHO DOES THAT??? would you be ok w/ a stranger taking your phone &amp; walking away?

As if that wasn&#39;t bad enough it got better! We said screw it &amp; walked to the bar/cashier area....where my friends phone was laying on the bar counter for ANYONE to walk by &amp; swipe it! A guy (dressed different from the rest of staff) whom I assumed was the manager approached us as we picked up the phone he grabbed it out of my friends hand....my friend asked him why she would walk off w/ her phone like that he replied it was no big deal it was just right here!!!

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service I will NEVER return to this location I&#39;ll stick w/ Peoria location from now on! And if I were you I would too, unless u want to wait forever for the wrong drink &amp; possibly have your phone lost/stolen if your using groupon!

2 STARS OFF FOR HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! 3 stars because Ajuua has the best food everrrrr!!!"

Lovely location. Great Groupon deals that they don&#39;t make you feel ashamed to use. I am rolling up bc sometimes Ajuua! is a 5-star. 

Unfortunately, the food is hit and miss. Traditional Americanized favorites lack flavor. The beef (esp ground) lacks seasoning and &#34;umph&#34;. BUT others like the bacon wrapped jalapeños or seafood dishes are killer. 

I will go again because when they are off, it&#39;s decent. When they are on, it&#39;s fabulous."

I&#39;ve been coming here for years and while the service has never been great, it was fine - polite, prompt, profession. The food is great, no complaints there. 

Unfortunately in the past few months service has taken a serious nose dive. The last three times I&#39;ve come my servers were not at all attentive, letting drinks sit empty, letting food sit under the heat lamps for 15-20 minutes, ignoring or forgetting coupons, and taking FOREVER to collect payment and bring back change.  To add insult to injury it&#39;s obvious why they&#39;re so distracted- they are all sitting at the bar that surrounds the kitchen in full view of the dining room loudly fraternizing with each other instead of paying attention to their customers. I swear I could have walked out the front door without anyone noticing I&#39;d left. 

Ajuua, look at your recent reviews, recognize the problem, and do what it takes to live up to your reputation before your loyal customers get fed up and find somewhere else to go."

My partner in crime had a beer (it&#39;s beer - nothing exciting there) and the chimichanga marina.  He was a happy camper with his food too! 

The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because even though I liked the salsa, I didn&#39;t care for the chips.  They&#39;re the light thin type and I simply don&#39;t like that kind, but other than that all was on point!"

The display of cans told me right away not to expect fresh made food. When we finally got to order first two things we picked we were told weren&#39;t available. Due to open kitchen we could see the cook on the phone and not bothering to end his conversation to cook our food. Started with Mexican pizza which we could have gotten better at taco bell. The tortilla base was over fried to point if being bitter and meat tasted old. My daughter had the taquitos which were far from that. Looked like a chimichanga cut up. Even for a 12 year old it was bland. I had the relleno combination plate that just tasted flat. Salt would do wonders to help the food. The taste reminded me of the cans out for display.

Not even joking. She actually just puked. Her chimichanga tasted like it was marinated with oil. I tried it and agreed.  We returned it and got a burger for her instead. It was small,  and wet with grease.  The cheese looked off color, and clearish in one spot and slimy. The fries tasted like overused cooking oil as well.  I got the steak tacos al carbon.  I wish i would have gotten tacos at del taco instead.  For $9 you don&#39;t even get rice or beans... but you do get green Chile which is so spicy you can barely eat it. This is the worst food I&#39;ve ever purchased.  Absolutely terribleď  The only thing that wasn&#39;t awful was the service,  but I have a feeling they may have put something in her burger given how it only took about 15 minutes before she started barfing her brains out... That and a clearish looking liquid I spotted in the cheese, but didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time.  I wonder if they spit in burger after we returned the chimichanga.  There was also mold growing on a plant at the table.  Definitely ought to be a health code violation. Don&#39;t ever eat here.

We waited 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive; 40 minutes for our food. The waitress had an uncanny ability of overlooking our attempts to attract her attention. 

I ordered the adobado chicken salad. When I saw the cold chicken atop a bed of limp, fetid iceberg shreds, my first thought was, &#34;is this safe to eat?&#34; I ended up pushing the dirty mushrooms and faded tomato slices that framed the plate aside. Not appetizing.

It was my dad&#39;s birthday so they made a huge scene by singing &#34;happy birthday&#34; in Spanish. My dad looked gleeful as he sang along with a gigantic sombrero atop his head. The birthday treat--a gelatinous, lackluster piece of flan--was a nice touch. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I had a bite of my sister&#39;s huevos rancheros, it wasn&#39;t anything remarkable. The fried corn tortilla lining the plate was excessively oily. The beans were fresh out of a can. Mmhmm. 

I do not wish to return."

I had &#39;street tacos&#39; with carnitas, pulled pork.  4, 4 inch soft tacos, it came with a fresh salsa verde, and tasted just enough of off the grill char and cilantro.  

It was a little odd the sopapilla desert came with sauce in a branded bottle, but I don&#39;t care, it was hot, crispy and delicious.

Some of the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had."

Food was prompt, hot, and most importantly, delicious. The marinated chicken in the fajitas was so refreshing as opposed to chain food joints that just throw in chicken scraps withe salt and pepper. As a former chef there were subtle things that made the food stand out and was a welcome difference.
My wife and I live downtown and this place is worth the drive. 
Margarita&#39;s were potent yet fantastic. Staff was friendly and engaging but not overbearing. I&#39;ve eaten at a majority of the Mexican restaurants around town and this place is in my top 5."

What makes me give this 1 star is false advertising. Their website is about $2 an item under what they actually charge. when you question them on it they refuse to meet what the website says. The food is good, but with management that wont admit and fix their mistakes I wouldn&#39;t reccomend it."

I had the street tacos al carbon, which is 4 steak, onion, and tomato tacos on corn tortillas served with lime slices, avocado, and a house green sauce. I love street tacos and these were great! My husband got the Discada, which has chorizo, beef, steak, ham, and i think chicken cooked with onion tomato and peppers and is served with homemade tortillas, and taco toppings. It was also way good! Highly recommend!"

When we walked in, there was quite a line, but the wait time was only quoted as 10-15 minutes. We instead found seats at one of the two bars and settled in.

Chips and salsa were immediately provided. We really enjoyed the salsa as it was fresh and had a good &#39;medium&#39; level of spice. The chips tasted fresh, though quite  few of them hadn&#39;t been fully fried and were chewy.

My husband ordered a house margarita and I ordered a lime margarita with no salt. We received giant glasses and overall they were quite tasty. There was a unique taste that was as though they used fresh orange and lime juice instead of a mix. Definitely a bonus! My drink came with salt despite my request and when we later got our receipt, my drink was a higher price, even though I received the same product as my husband. Noted to ask for a house drink, and not a certain flavor.

Tuesdays are &#39;all you can eat&#39; tacos for $8. An excellent deal as a normal order for 4 is $11, and that excludes rice and beans. I tried the shredded beef and chicken and liked the shredded beef the best. Reminded me of spanish pot roast. The chicken was also a &#39;pulled&#39; style and was very tender. I found a small bone shard in my chicken, which was the only thing that turned me off of it. Rice and our choice of beans were provided and while both were nicely cooked, they were very very salty.

Service was sparse but our waitress was very nice. All staff were running around all night and looked to be in quite a rush. Understandable given the evening and the fact that the restaurant was full and there was a line of people waiting. 

Daily specials and happy hour make this a cheap night out. We&#39;ll return to try other dishes, I just hope the salt level isn&#39;t always that high."

I love the flavors of both and have a healthy respect for both.  I&#39;m not sure what the food at Ajuua is supposed to be! We ate on 3/14/2014

To start--We were seated, and were quickly given chips and salsa--There is a saying, if the salsa has no flavor-Nor will the food.  This should have been our sign.  After receiving the chips and salsa we waited for about 10 minutes with our menu&#39;s to be served. 

The waiter was a little shocked that we were going to order our drinks and food at the same time.  Well, we sat for a long time waiting, of course we were going to do that, we were definitely prepared!  I ordered the Pollo Asado and iced tea.  This came with beans, rice, guacamole, grilled onions, grilled Jalapeno, and of course the chicken fillet.   I was shocked at what I tasted----SO very bland food.  The chicken had no taste.  It had grill marks, it was pure white--Pollo Asado is normally marinaded and soaks up the flavor to have a slight red tint to the meat usually.  There was a little adobo spice on it, but to me it seemed washed off.  The beans tasted like they were right out of a can.  If they weren&#39;t they were cooked to a nice softness, yet there was once again no flavor.  No onion, no jalapeno, well--Yes--NO flavor.. The rice was slightly dry and again, no flavor to it.  I was so disappointed.  I wondered if it was me, and let my gent try it--He was just as disappointed.  The corn tortillas were warmed well, and they were good. That was their one win with me. 

Back to my gentleman--He had Steak Fajita&#39;s, this came with beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, and corn tortillas.  The only bright spot, the corn tortillas.  The rice and beans were very bland.  The steak, was a nice cut, however--it was not seasoned! The onions and peppers were cut in squares?!! That I don&#39;t understand. That is lazy in my book, that they were not cut in strips to make them nicely fold into a tortilla.  AND much to my surprise, it was also served with mushrooms.  I was confused as to if it was Korean stir fry or a true fajita?!  The guacamole was also bland, according to my gent.  I can&#39;t eat it, because I am allergic, so I have to go by his thoughts and review.  He was super disappointed in the food.  

I really wanted this to be a great place. I thought the decor was fun.  They had some interesting sayings in Spanish on the walls.  My gent was explaining them to me, and I found the atmosphere very nice.  The food was not at all good.  This is not a restaurant we will try again. I had hoped to like it!!! I really wanted this to be another go to place for us.  I just can&#39;t do it again..  I have reviewed numerous tex-mex and Mexican rather high. I will stick to those for now, and look for something better in this area."

Poor service and bland food best describe this restaurant. The place is clean, and comfortable, but  the service was poor.  It took a long time for the waiter to come over and take our order.

To our surprise a 16 oz Margarita is full price $16 and another $11.

We went on Saturday after Valentine&#39;s day. We were greeted immediately by the sweet hostess, and directed to a booth upon request. Our waitress was extremely friendly, attentive, professional, polite, and efficient. Our food runner was polite as well and actually greeted us, an often forgotten duty. Overall, the service was near the top of my lists of great service. 6 of 5.

THE RESTAURANT:  I am my no means an super-sized woman, but I honestly have to have a roomy, comfortable booth. The booths at Ajuua are spot on! To my delight, restaurant is decorative with a mixture of fun, history, art, and cheesiness. The restaurant is very clean, and you can watch some of the line cooks prepare your meal. The restrooms are always clean, but I prefer an updated, impeccably squeaky clean bathroom. So I don&#39;t take stars away unless it is not clean, or often unattended. Fortunately, Ajuua seems to keep on top of their restrooms. I usually see this second as I wash my hands before I eat.... And you REALLY should try and remember. HAHA especially if you are sharing your chips and salsa, and if you&#39;re not sharing your chips, you are sharing the door knob and all other people from your day. :) 5 of 5.

THE FOOD: I had the Carne Asada dinner, which I&#39;ve had twice before, cooked medium, and it came that way. My husband had the Carne Asada Ajuua burrito, which he has had twice before, and it was huge, covered in spicy chili sauce, just like he likes. He was delighted to find that they had a spicy option for the sauce. The chips are thin, warm, crispy, and salty. I actually prefer this to the fried corn tortilla that is often a little too thick and hard for my liking. The salsa has a grean tomato, onion, cilantro, chili flavor. Not very spicy, which I&#39;m sure you could get if you asked, but just the right amount for me, maybe too spicy for some. that&#39;s always a hard estimate. I always say people who think table pepper is spicy are a 1 and people who aren&#39;t phased by habaneros are a ten. I am more of a 7, a Thai Chili girl. So I&#39;d say the salsa is on my scale, a 3 or 4, and perfect. The tortillas were fresh, soft and warm, I got half corn, and half flour. Both were house made and delicious. I got my badly craved, grilled onion and jalapeno with my carne asada meal, it may seem small but I am extremely disappointed without these items. The beans were moist and savory, and the rice was flavorful, not too dry or too wet, Just right. I went 8 days ago, and I&#39;ve craved it everyday since. Something I could not say about other sit down Mexican restaurants. 5 of 5.

THE COST: Let&#39;s be honest, unless you are a hard working full grown man, or growing teenage boy, you really could not drink (and really shouldn&#39;t) your 24 ounce water and soda, 1/2 to a full basket of chips and salsa, and an entire dinner here. (Well I probably could because it is so delicious, but i would cry soon after in pain) So I always have leftovers to take home. I like to think of it as two meals for the price of one. You can get a standard dishes for 9-12 dollars, and specialty non-seafood items at 12-15 dollars. For me, huge beverages, complimentary chips &amp; GOOD salsa, and an insanely filling, well prepared meal, this is a deal. We also used a 50% Groupon, and I almost felt guilty at the awesome deal we were getting. 4 of 5.

OVERALL: There are times when I love a good, authentic, taqueria run, but most often than not, I love sitting down, relaxing, and being waited on. I would recommend this for any date night, family night, or even a night out of margaritas. 4.5 Stars for a Mexican-American restaurant? Customer service is the most important to me, after the food."

They dropped off the food for my wife and children but never bothered to bring mine. Ten minutes went by without the waitress even checking in on us to see if all was ok. My wife eventually got up to ask if the food was coming and the waitresses response was &#34;they dropped it off&#34;. They then got defensive about us wanting to leave and canceling my meal. We got to go boxes but still never got mine. Last time they will ever see our money.

There was a line to get seated, but we were seated immediately because there were only two of us.  That&#39;s when things went downhill.  After sitting at the table for 15 minutes, I had to ask the bus boy to get us waters since no one had come to the table yet.  At 25 minutes, I stopped a server to ask if she could take our order.  She seemed apologetic and took our order.  40 minutes later, we still hadn&#39;t received our food, so I asked to speak to a manager.  He apologized, but didn&#39;t seem to care too much about the issues.  I will admit they were busy, but I&#39;ve worked in the industry in the past and there were days we were slammed, but we just overlooked a table. Under no circumstances should it take that long to receive a burrito and chile rellano.  Unrelated to my table, the table next to us sat for 10 or 15 minutes waiting on silverware AFTER they received their food.  I would have to say this is up there as the worst service and poorest run restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to.

The food - The chips and salsa were fantastic.  Everything else was average at best.  They seem to have lots of sauces for the entrees, but maybe they should pare that down and focus on getting food out in a reasonable time frame.  It is unlikely that I return."

We were also returning from prior visits to the restaurant. While we were waiting for our entrees one of the people eating at our table looked over and saw a mouse under another table then there was another on the booth seat. I got up to notify the waitress that we would not be eating there and why, her response was okay. After we left another waitress apologized. We now will never go back to that restaurant."

The enchiladas veracruz were excellent--bursting with fresh seafood flavor. The crab and shrimp mixture was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The black beans were a little on the salty side, but went well with the rice and enchiladas. I tried a bit of my husband&#39;s spinach enchiladas, which were drenched in lime juice but still very tasty. I enjoyed the food so much I ended up eating the entire plate! For dessert we ordered the apple chimi, which we were pleased to discover also came with a side of whipped cream and ice cream. The crust was crisp and flaky and went well with the tender-crisp, cinnamon-infused apple filling. A great way to end a hearty meal!"

We went for dinner on a Friday evening, quite early. Despite the place being relatively empty, it seemed to take forever to get our drinks despite the waitress having taken the order relatively quickly. I kept looking toward the bar area and large clusters of employees were fraternizing and not paying any attention to the customers.

The atmosphere was very meh. It felt almost cafeteria like and the lighting was entirely too bright. A plus for those with kids is that the place is very family friendly. The décor was a hodgepodge of what the previous Italian restaurant appeared to have left behind, along with some Mexican décor. The tables have these gross rubbery tablecloths that stick to your skin, so while the table may not have been dirty, it felt that way. My husband&#39;s fork was dirty, which did not help matters.

I ordered the carne asada and I must say that I was fairly content with my meal. It came with nice, thin, partially-browned flour tortillas that I enjoyed. The rice and beans were typical run of the mill, but my meal was fairly enjoyable overall. My husband&#39;s ground beef burrito--not so much. The beef had no flavor whatsoever and about a third of the way into it, the pooled grease in the beef killed it for him.

Sorry to say that we won&#39;t be returning, but I&#39;m glad we had a Groupon to soften the blow."

It wasn&#39;t edible, it was like a boat made of tamale masa that had been fried in old grease. It was flavorless and dry. It was filled with flavorless dry shredded chicken. The only decent thing on my plate were the black beans. The service was nonexistent. Our server didn&#39;t check on us because she probably knew the food was horrid. I wanted to like this place...what&#39;s it called? Oh, the sound I made when the food came back up."

My experience was not perfect but I thought I had great service with a smile along with some good food.

When I first walked in I noticed the beautiful decorations on the wall.  The decorations were not over done and made it feel like you could have been eating in a spanish courtyard. I give 5 out of 5 for decor.

I was immediately greeted at the door and brought to my table.  Once at my table my drink order was taken immediately.  I did have to wait a couple of minutes longer than I would have liked for my order to be taken, but the waitress was very nice and always had a great smile.  Once my order was taken the food came out very quickly.  My only very small complaint is that she could have given me my check a little sooner. I&#39;ll give the service 4 out of 5.

I thought my food was very good, but there was a little room for improvement.  I can see how other reviews may have said it was bland if you love more hot and spicy Mexican food.  I found all of my food to be fairly mild which was perfect for me as I don&#39;t do very well with a lot of heat.  I thought the chips and salsa were great.  The salsa just had a little bit of heat but not too much and the chips were thin so you could not fill up on them as easily.  

For a main course I had the super chimi.  When it arrived it was super sized.  It was covered with a little bit of green chili.  The green chili was good but they definately could have given me more as it was barely enough to coat my chimichanga,  The rice on the side was average.  The side of lettuce cheese and tomatoes were fresh and tasted good.  The tortilla for the chimichanga tasted good but only the corners were crispy.  I think they definitely could have cooked it more and made it more crispy.  The filling was my favorite part.  When I get chimichangas its usually just beans, rice, and meat.  This one however had fried onions and green peppers which I think was a great touch that made it feel a little more healthy. I had the carnitas and as others have noted the meat was not really spiced that much.  It could have used a little more spice even for someone who doesn&#39;t handle heat that well.  Overall I gave the food 4 out 5.  With a couple of small changes the food could be great."

The negative star rating has nothing at all to do with the food, but everything to do with management and the way things are handled. The food is out of this world every time I go, but this last time we received horrible customer service, and it truly affected us and how we will never go to this location again. 

Ajuua sends coupons to us every month, and we usually keep them on the fridge so we know where they are. This particular time we decided to go on a whim so we grabbed one of the coupons and left. We got there, ordered, ate, but when it came time to the bill- the waitress told us that we could not use the coupon because it was expired. Generally, working in retail, I understand for the most part that someone on that level can&#39;t really do anything about it. We asked for a manager and explained to him that we have two coupons and we simply grabbed the wrong one and asked to make an exception. He said there was absolutely nothing he could do for us and literally suggested that one of us stay at the table and the other DRIVE HOME TO GET THE OTHER COUPON. Are you freaking kidding me? My fiance was so upset and flustered, he told him to charge the full amount to his card and that we would never return, to which the manager replied &#34;Whatever, my friend, you do what you gotta do.&#34; walked off, yelled at his server to take of it and left. 

How unprofessional. We attempted to contact the district manager after finding out that he was the General Manager, but even though their website says &#34;You will hear back from someone within 24 hours&#34;, it&#39;s been a week and still no sign of them contacting us. They have some great mexican food, but there are PLENTY of other restaurants that have just as good food, with way better service. 

Save yourself the grief and eat at another one of their locations."

The last time we went, my hubby went with us. Both hubby and I had some digestive discomfort from the experience.

We ordered the chili con queso, and it was quite bland. The carnitas were very tasty, as well as moist and tender. However, the onions and peppers served with the carnitas were practically raw. A little closer to the flame next time, guys! Please!

Their food is still my absolute favorite. I have tried venturing out to different Mexican restaurants, but alas Ajuua is still at the top of my list. 

On my most recent visit I had the combination plate. Which is a big step as I always seem to order the spinach enchiladas. I had a ground beef enchilada and a California chili relleno.  Both were tasty as usual. I love the flavor of their ground beef. We stopped in early enough to hit happy hour. So we both ordered margaritas. 

This location is not really any different from the other locations, as far as service is concerned. They have some amazing servers, but it is a 50/50 chance I will receive adequate service when I go in. This last time the waiter never came by to refill my water the entire meal. While I did have a margarita, I still like to have water. I overlook any chance of bad service because I love their food. I even dined here for my birthday last year."

Service was decent, we were greeted and seated immediately and our waitress was nice but could have been a little more attentive.  Being a Tuesday, it wasn&#39;t very busy.  

We&#39;re primarily vegetarian (eating meat is a rarity) so that limits our options, but we wanted to try it out because they actually had a dedicated vegetarian section on the menu.  It was all you can eat taco night and for some reason they couldn&#39;t substitute beans for the meat. (first time we&#39;ve had that happen...beans are cheaper than meat right?)  The waitress said we could do guacamole tacos so my husband and son ordered those only to have the manager come back and tell them that they didn&#39;t do those anymore because of the cost.  Ok, no worries, they looked at the menu again and got the vegetarian macho burrito and the California style chile rellenos (crispy).  I got the vegetarian fajitas.  

Chips and salsa were decent, although we felt the salsa was pretty mild, barely any heat.  I ordered some extra spicy salsa and that was pretty good.  They mix habanero sauce into the salsa to give it heat.  It was pretty hot after that which my husband and I enjoyed, my son ate a huge chip full and regretted it shortly thereafter.

My fajitas were ok.  Not the worst I&#39;ve had, and not the best.  I&#39;ve had better in other parts of the country but have yet to find really, really good ones in Colorado.  So my quest for awesome veggie fajitas continues.   The cilantro lime rice that came with them was tasty.  The guacamole left much to be desired and after tasting it, my husband was glad that he didn&#39;t have tacos full of it!  It was brownish and tasted like it was made with older avocados, you know, when they start tasting funky but you can still probably eat them.  The tortillas were your standard premade kind.  I wish I could find a place out here that serves fresh ones that are made in house!

The rellenos were meh.  I&#39;ve only been to once place here (Mexican place in Stapleton) that actually uses roasted poblanos instead of weak canned hatch chiles. The suiza sauce that was on them was tasty and the best part of the meal.  The beans and rice were nothing special.  My husband was rather unimpressed.

My son&#39;s burrito had the same veggie mix in it as my fajitas plus black beans.  It was smothered in red sauce and had melted cheese all over it.  He liked it and could only eat half of it.  It was literally as big as his head.  

We all agreed that it was ok, but not stellar.  I&#39;d probably give it a 2.5 if I had that option.  Considering that I can make better at home, we probably won&#39;t be returning and our quest for a really good local Mexican place that has decent vegetarian options continues."

There we not many people there and we were hoping that was not a bad sign. Well, it wasn&#39;t. Our server was very friendly and checked with us often. 

My husband and I both had combination plates which were both excellent. We loved the fact that you could make your own combination and also pick your ingredients. I had a crispy rellendo and cheese enchilada while my husband had a tamale, burrito and cheese enchilada. We were both very pleased with our selections. One of the best things is that not everything is made with cheddar cheese. What a nice surprise. We were also pleased to find out that the combination plates are discounted on Sunday!

I would definately recommend Ajuua&#39;s for both food and service."

We got there 45 mins to close and they didn&#39;t rush us at all. Asked us how things were and made sure our requested super spicy noodles was made spicy enough as we wanted.
The owners were nice and friendly and the service was great. 

Now on to the food......

I ordered the mixed seafood spicy noodle soup (xtra spicy) and my gf order a dish similar to the black bean noodle sauce without the black bean sauce.  We wanted to try a few things so we also got fried shrimp with a spicy sweet garlic sauce and a appetizer of pork dumplings. 
Everything was on point! Everything is made to order and made fresh. The noodles were on point so we asked the owner and come to find out, the noodles are made in house, fresh every morning. 
Portions are super generous, seafood is no skimpy and they use good quality foods.  You can imagine all that food for three ppl was more than enough. We had lots of leftover to take home. 
They&#39;ve been open for about a year and I&#39;m surprised they don&#39;t have more reviews, but the place is hidden in a shopping center and from the outside you wouldn&#39;t expect all this yummy goodness. 

The only downfall is they don&#39;t open til 11am so for those who want a bowl of hot and spicy soothing soup, you have to wait til lunch. 
Go try them out and make sure you bring your appetite."

I stopped in here for lunch on a Saturday and there were two other tables eating so not a huge wait at all. You walk up to the counter, order then seat yourself and they bring the food to you. They have a self serve bar with onion, lemon and some cabbage mixture comparable to Kim chi. They have hot tea that&#39;s free with kettles that you can fill yourself as well.

I&#39;m fighting a nasty cold so I went with the spicy seafood soup and it was what dreams are made of. The broth was spicy enough to clear up my sinuses due to red chile paste and full of homemade noodles, mussels, crab and fish. I finished half of it then took the rest home to enjoy at a later time. They also have entrees like tempura, fried rice, dumplings, etc. All in all, a great spot, I will definitely be back for more!"

Why the four star?  Feel bad for the owner.  They are trying very hard but so much to learn.  At least food taste decent.

When we arrived, quite skeptical wether to go in or not but felt rude to turn around after staring at the menu for a bit.  After staring at the menu, lady states self serve and stated no tip required.  Ok.  

Menu: noodles with spicy flavor (jambong ) or not (udon).  If you dont like noodles, you can get fried rice options or sushi rolls.   They even have sweet and sour with different protein choices.

Pros: self serve and save few $ on tip.
Cons: too many to list.  Its the Korean mentality of starting new biz. Open it up 1st when its not fully ready and fix as goes.  Hope everyone has lots of patience and give this biz chance to survive ultimately offering  alternate choices to the limited restaurant scene around here.

Food needs to come out faster. Whatever you need to do, do it.
Hot tea...  if you run out of it..  make some more.  No excuses. 

Good luck to you!"

Saturday October 31st 2015.

We wanted to have Dinner at another establishment but that establishment is CLOSED For Halloween!  *SIGH*

THANK GOD, Hororok Mandarin Noodle House is open, and hence we went there.  YES, you order at the counter.  Then seat yourself to where you fancy.  YES, previously this establishment was that establishment that moved and now gone...

This establishment offers, Chinese, Korean dishes and some Sushi Rolls.  That evening we opt to have these items from their Simple Menu :

*  Seafood Fried Rice ($8.95)
*  Shrimp Tempura ($14.95)
*  Chicken with Garlic Sauce @ KanPoongGee LARGE order ($13.95)
*  2 orders of Fountain Drink ($3.90)

YES, it can be a little steep for Dinner, but the Shrimp Tempura, is HUGE.  When we received our order, I found out that the Shrimp Tempura was a little under-cooked and hence I wish they could fry the Shrimp either longer or at a higher temperature.  During our Dinner, we had conversations with the lovely staff, who happens to be the Owner&#39;s Wife.

My Bad, of not asking their names.  They wanted to rectify or make me a NEW Tempura Shrimp dish, but we declined coz we need to hurry to run some errands that evening.

The Highlight for my Dinner was the Seafood Fried Rice.  It comes with Shrimp, some Mussels, and Squid.  Its cooked to the right flavor that I like my kind of Fried Rice should be.  The &#34;white&#34; kind of Fried Rice NOT drenched with Soy Sauce.  Hubs also liked his order of the Chicken With Garlic Sauce.  Hubs order also comes with Rice either Steamed or Fried Rice.  Hubs opt to have Fried Rice with his Main Entrée.

Portions are generous for our taste buds.  We also managed to have leftovers that evening.  You can also get some condiments, at the SELF-SERVICE station up front, at the ordering counter.  It comes with the norm Pickled Radish and Raw Onions, and the &#34;black sauce&#34; that I find it familiar in some other Korean establishments in town.

After our Dinner, we help ourselves with the Barley Tea which is FREE and you are welcome to have refills, from the separate Silver Kettle Pots readily available at the SELF-SERVICE station.

Hororok Mandarin Noodle House has potential to grow.  I am interested to return when the weather gets colder for those SPICY NOODLES that I have been eyeing.  All in all, the service from the Chef-Owner and his wife is indeed welcoming.  We wish them well in their business undertakings especially in this part of Neighborhood, and a welcoming eatery when we are in this Neighborhood.

Furthermore, the parking outside is always busy due to other establishments too.

Oooh, my bad again, maybe I should ask about the 2 different phone numbers about this establishment found in their receipt and their business card which is different.

Their operation hours are as following :

Monday - Saturday : 11 am to 9 pm
Sunday : 12 pm to 9 pm

Solid 3.5 stars in our books.

It looked like exactly the type of place that we love to try, so it was immediately designated, &#34;We&#39;re going there next time we go out for dinner.&#34; It wasn&#39;t long before the call of the noodles beckoned, and we answered. As has been noted, the name &#34;Mandarin Noodle House&#34; is a bit of a misnomer as it is apparently owned and operated by Koreans, and the primary noodles on the menu are Japanese udon. Still, give them points for creativity. Walking in can be momentarily confusing because of the design of the space. Order at the counter, self-serve some condiments, and wait for food to be delivered to the table. Only two of us were dining, and we both tried soup, and both of our soups were absolutely delicious. After the first bite (*slurp*) we had already agreed to return, and that this should become part of the standard restaurant rotation. 

The space was open and clean. The interior was generally non-descript, although not unappealing. The woman working the counter was very friendly, offered assistance several times, and did an excellent job of making us feel welcome and comfortable. 

I will definitely be visiting the Mandarin Noodle House again soon."

Lots of outlets if you need to charge something, and the free Denver airport wifi was working pretty fast in here when I was here.  Since I was doing work, I didn&#39;t sit at the bar but the man bartending there seemed to be having in-depth conversations with the patrons there, giving them travel suggestions, etc.

The only reason I took off a star is for the price - I know I&#39;m in an airport, but there isn&#39;t a glass of wine on the menu that is cheaper than $10.  Mine was on the more inexpensive side at $12, which means that my glass of wine was the same price as my actual meal.

Wine flights are spot on. You get to try 3 for less than the price of most glasses. I believe the flight we tried was and &#39;old world&#39; type that had a dry french, nice albarino and something else, maybe a pinot grigio, I can&#39;t remember. All very good and they fit well together in the flight. 
I had the prosciutto flatbread pizza, while my friend got the classic margharita. Mine was delicious but rather hard to cut and eat especially since there was no sauce to sort of bind it to the crust. 
Our server, Robert, was friendly and helpful, knew all of the answers to our questions. It wasn&#39;t a cheap airport meal (especially considering my single glass cost $13 or $14 compared to the $12 flight) but it&#39;s worth it if you have the time to enjoy it. I did- 8 hour layover. woohoo!"

Which seems to happen a lot recently.. I just discovered this little wine bar in concourse B. Near gate b58 it has an intimate low lit atmosphere with gentle music playing. 

I was greeted promptly and thrilled to see lots of cute little tables with tons of outlets for charging. The menu is so much more than I&#39;d hoped to find in an airport with cheese plates, gourmet salads, stone fire pizzas, and even dessert.

My server was amazingly friendly and completely aware of what I could have that was gluten free. He was so thoughtful and even had the kitchen put extra fruit on the plate since I couldn&#39;t have the bread. While I didn&#39;t talk to the bar tender I could hear how friendly she was and how many travel it&#39;s both her and my server remembered. 

Oh the food.. Fantastic. I had the caprese salad which was perfect. The American cheese platter with fresh honey, pears, apples, a blue, goat, and cheddar cheese was amazing. I enjoyed a napa Cabernet during my layover as well.

Just one of those days.  I had minutes before my flight was going to start boarding and like a beacon, I saw Cru Wine Bar.  

I sat down and was immediately greeted with a smile and a menu.  I didn&#39;t have time to eat, so I asked for a glass of wine instead.  The bartender (I forget his name, and I know they&#39;re not bartenders) helped me narrow down my choices.  I really enjoyed that wine.  He was telling jokes and stories in between recommending wines and was really a delightful person to converse with in general.

Also, he greeted every customer with the same amazing attitude.  It seriously was an instant mood lifter.  5 stars just for the service and thank you, sir, for helping make my day so much better!!"

The question arises: &#34;Beer at New Belgium or classy wine and cheese for an early dinner?&#34; Preference takes precedent, as craft beer and a decent wine menu are two entirely different animals.

Service is quick here, and you will not be disappointed with the quality of preparation. I will say that pricing is not the friendliest of attributes about this high-class institution. Cru definitely errs on simple classiness.

The wine selection does not allow it to rank among the top wine lists of airports across the country, but I do appreciate the environment in which you imbibe in your beverage of choice. Wine bars force you to slow down and take in the experience as a whole, not simply slugging down drinks left and right and scarfing down your airport burger.

This Texas transplant gives way to intimacy in the midst of a hectic pace of life and traveling chaos. Drop in if you want a different tempo in which to kick back in between flights. Just watch your wallet--it is far too easy to chug wine while losing track of prices."

The waitress kept my glass of water full, and she remembered that I didn&#39;t want ice. Little things like this show to me that it&#39;s a good business. They have several hot teas to choose from, only one caffeine free tea, I think. The waitress asked me if I wanted dessert and didn&#39;t treat me any different because of my looks. The prices are a little spendy, but worth it. Some places like this look down on you if you&#39;re not in a suit or fancy dress, but this restaurant was not like that. They were kind, and because of this, I ordered more than I originally intended and stayed a bit. It doesn&#39;t hurt that there are outlets everywhere making it very convenient to recharge your phone. There are tv&#39;s with sports on if you like that sort of thing, but they are inconspicuous and the sound is off which is nice if you don&#39;t like that sort of thing. The bread was delicious. The portion seemed small on the caprese salad, but it was mozzerella cheese stacked on top of tomato slices (with a delicious basil leaf) so the vertical height made it plenty enough for me. The pesto was also wonderful. I don&#39;t have adjectives enough to describe how good this place is.

Sure its cozy, but it is not any destination that you should be traveling out of your way for. 

The food is pretty bland. Nothing really is to die for however, nothing isn&#39;t terrible either. (Turns out is pretty goddamn hard to ruin a burrito or burger) They try to shake things up country club style by adding flair to the menu via fancy french words and marinades buuuuuut lets be real ... those are fancy words for mayo and ketchup. 

Service is legit, the servers are attentive, and do a good job ... but kinda lack any distinctive personality that left an impression.

I will give a thumbs up to the beer selection. Cocktails are poured with a heavy hand (which with my golf scores ... this is a GOOD thing!)   

Also for some reason this place has a knack to just have children running around the place for no reason. I dunno if the parents of Murphy Creek just suck at life or maybe its a golf course thing but it&#39;s pretty frustrating when your trying to watch a game over a cold beer with family.

They must be in their seats eating quietly.  Basically, they can&#39;t be children.  This feels like a slap in the face to those of us that have been going to the Tavern almost weekly.  In a community with so many small children, it seems as if the Tavern is turning away a large portion of their customers to appease a small minority.

I&#39;ve been in the shop for about 20 minutes now. The first few minutes I was waiting for the cashier to comprehend the simple order of the man ahead of me. Then I spent several minutes trying to explain MY simple order to the same cashier. She confessed it was her first day, so ok, I get if you don&#39;t understand the POS. But when I tried to pay with a $20, there was no change in the cash register. The cashier waited for the owner, who was on the phone, to hang up so she could tell her where the change was. Then another wait while the cashier opens the safe. Then another wait as she tries to figure out my change. I paid with $20.14 on a $12.14 bill. Simple arithmetic. A 2nd grader should be able to do that math.

While waiting for my sandwich, 14 minutes so far, I watched the owner have a difficult time taking the order of the person after me. Then they had a sandwich for someone who appeared not to be in the shop. Wasted at least 2 minutes calling out her name when she was clearly not there.

I will support a local business over a corporate business any day. Every time I&#39;ve come in the gal who owns the place is there. I find that to be comforting. It also seems like the place is family run. 

Every time I&#39;ve been in, I have tried a different sandwich. I usually just get a sandwich without chips or fries and my total is around $7. Very reasonable. These subs are seriously loaded up! I think I have found my favorite which is the gobbler (turkey bacon avocado) I read in a few other reviews that the bread could be a little better... I do agree with that, as it is usually a little doughy, and the condiments fall off making for a bit of a messy sandwich. Besides that, I&#39;ve enjoyed every sub I&#39;ve had. 

One of my only concerns is cleanliness of the food prep area, sometimes it seems a little messy."

I couldn&#39;t even finish it after the first bite. The Philly cheese steak was just ok, not authentic like they claim. And the fries tasted like it was fried in old oil, had a bitter taste.

I got excited about the Turkey Gobbler Melt, based solely on Yelp reviews and a couple pictures. While the flavor was good, they have a bread situation that needs to be resolved.  Now, some people might really like their bread, but I found it to be overwhelming.  There was just a LOT of it, and it didn&#39;t squish down at all. It also tended to break apart when I tried to smush it into something I could actually fit into my mouth.

The meatball sandwich was the better of the two, like I said it was pretty good.  The avocado was a great add-on to three steak bomb, but steak sandwiches aren&#39;t really my thing unless they&#39;re REALLY good (and this one didn&#39;t reach that mark).

I got the philly sandwich and the bread was super dry and overall the ingredients weren&#39;t very fresh. Not a very good value either I believe it was $9 for the sandwich only, no drinks or sides.

We perused the menu, I decided on the Italian on a wheat bun (something from my childhood, dad and I always used to split an Italian).  Sam decided on the cheeseburger hoagie.  Also, decided to split an order of large fries to give a thorough Yelp review.

The Italian was good, I was expecting more meat just from experience with other places.  With that said the meat was good and packed the appropriate amount of spice for an Italian Sandwich.  Sam really enjoyed his cheeseburger hoagie, no lack of meat in this one, it was a gargantuan proportion of meat.  He raved about it and said we would definitely be back again.  The fries were nicely cooked and crispy.

The sign above the door touts the restaurant&#39;s 40 years of service to Denver, which is completely believable because it doesn&#39;t look like anything has changed decor-wise in all that time.

More diner than deli, All-V&#39;s offers a large variety of sandwiches.  As I walked in, I saw some folks picking up their orders at the counter.  These subs are huge!  I knew right away a small size would be plenty filling.

I ordered the &#34;Authentic&#34; (as it reads on the menu) Philly cheese steak, which comes with provolone cheese and grilled onions and mushrooms (cheese whiz can be added if you wish; I asked because I thought that might make it &#34;authentic&#34;).  No cheese whiz for me but I added lettuce, tomato, and pickles to my sandwich.  The wheat roll was soft and fresh.  It sort of seemed like more bread than filling but any more filling would have been too much food.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the meat was not dripping with grease. The sandwich had a really good flavor and I would order it again.  I would skip the fries since they&#39;re just your typical frozen fries.  I like the fact that chips are available also.

I think I can see why this place has been around for so long, especially when there were hungry college kids just across the street.  The prices are quite reasonable and the sandwiches are generously portioned.  Next time, I&#39;d like to try a different sandwich and I&#39;ll most likely get it to go."

But, you can choose cold subs like turkey, hot subs like the aforementioned Philly, or even a cheeseburger.

The tables are basically like what you&#39;d sit at in fast food joints, but there are plenty of them so eating in should be no problem.

I had marinara sauce with the steak sandwich.  It was in a word:  delicious.  Honestly, I licked it out of the container they served it in. I got no pride to lose there, it was darn good marinara to go with the sandwich.

I didn&#39;t have any sides, no fries or anything else, so no comments there.  They offered fries, chips and the like.

I suggest All V&#39;s if you are in the neighborhood instead of the Chain, support the locals.  Seems like a cool blue collar place, too.  All the more reason to support.

I&#39;m definitely going back with the hopes of having another sandwich that is even better.  If I do, I&#39;ll upgrade this to a 5-star."

It puts subway to shame! Plus the staff are very friendly and they have very large portions so it&#39;s the most bite for your buck. I&#39;ve been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks, the first time I asked the guy working register what his favorite sandwich was, he said the Avocado Gobbler melt. I was not disappointed the Avocado was to die for, so so good! Next time I tried the Steak Bomb it&#39;s a steak sandwich with marinara sauces. If I didn&#39;t like avocado so much I&#39;d probably say it was better than the Gobbler but it&#39;s a close 2nd. My 3rd and last sub I had was Italian cold cut it was pretty much what I expected but with large portion of vegetables. I can&#39;t wait to go back !"

If you must have a cheese steak, fine, but All-V&#39;s is all about variety, in fact that&#39;s what the name means or so I&#39;m told.  Add chips and a drink, any size you like.  Chicken salad, tuna salad, the Italian, the ham and cheese, the Club, the Turkey, you name it, if it&#39;s in sandwich form All-V&#39;s will probably have it.  They also have French fries, to appease the high school teenagers who use this place as off-campus dinning.  The ingredients are fresh, the service is prompt and you can truly have your order anyway you like.  Pricing is reasonable.

It&#39;s been around for many years which seemed to make it even better, and we saw they have a cheeseburger sub on the menu, see my review for Central Pizza and you will understand my passion for a cheeseburger sub.  Well, we left pretty let down.  The subs were comparable to subway, no joke.  We shared an Italian cold cut, a cheese steak, and cheese fries. The rolls seemed exactly like the ones that are &#34;baked fresh&#34; at Subway. I pulled chunks of bread off and there was no flavor at all.  There needed to be more of the meat on the sub too, especially if the rolls are so big.  The cheese steak wasn&#39;t even close to what a cheese steak should be. The fries were over done and really crispy, to the point that the potato inside was gone.  I prefer my fries soggy so this did not make me a happy camper.

I saw that many have commented on the inside of the shop and the seating. I thought this was actually pretty nice. It reminded me a lot of east coast joints."

There. I said it. It really takes a lot to wow me with a sandwich. For the most part, they taste like disproportionate amounts of lettuce, mayo, mustard and whatever slimy deli meat has been on display for seven hours.

But All V&#39;s. My good god. I had a sandwich here about three weeks ago for the first time and I haven&#39;t been able to stop ever since. They have a turkey, bacon avocado sandwich that make me absolutely joyous. The ingredients are all mixed together well, so that no particular food stands out. Instead, you have delicious combination of meat, avocado and veggies. 

Oh, and they have a whole section of sandwiches with Avocado. Like eight varieties. And they don&#39;t skimp on avocado either. I&#39;m pretty sure you get an entire avocado with each sandwich. I don&#39;t know who their supplier is, but I might pay money to find out since they are the best damned avocados I&#39;ve had since I lived in Peru.

The best part is that the place is only three blocks away from my place, so I can get one of these sandwiches anytime I want. 

Sure, the inside of the place is basically like stepping back to 1960 and the furniture or decor has not been changed or updated since then, but I won&#39;t even remotely let that deter me from getting a sandwich from the one place in Denver that has turned me into a sandwich eater."

There is parking in the back if you turn up the street The College Inn is on; on your right behind the building. The interior is humble but clean. It seems like the booths may have been acquired from another place that went out of business? Comfortable to sit at, though.

Menu is different sandwiches, fries, chips, and sodas. 

First time I had an Italian cold cut sandwich and today I had an &#34;Authentic Philly Cheesesteak&#34;.  They have a bunch of toppings they will include on your sandwich and will run through them if you don&#39;t know the list by heart. They also have some shakers of oil, vinegar, oregano / Italian spice that you can put on your sandwich after it&#39;s ready. They don&#39;t charge extra if you want those toppings, which I think is great. 

Both sandwiches were tasty. 

Their bread is crusty but soft white on the inside. I wouldn&#39;t mind a little more chew or all grain but that&#39;s probably a little silly considering this is a pretty down to earth and yummy sandwich place. 

The Italian cuts were good quality. T

he Philly is not as good as Famous Philly by my house, but still good. The meat seems like it was cooked right there in the shop. I wish they would mix the cheese into the meat and cook the cherry peppers with the meat like they do at Famous.  

I think both small sandwiches I got were under $6. They are enough to fill me just fine.

I really liked the people working both times! Friendly in a small town type way."

Back in the 80&#39;s I used to live in that neighborhood, and went there with a high school friend all the time. One day we were there eating our subs and were so absorbed in the process that we didn&#39;t even notice that the place was being robbed. (It wasn&#39;t nearly as busy back in those days.)

I&#39;ve had everything on their menu over the years, but my absolute favorites are the eggplant parmesan, chicken cordon-bleu, and turkey gobbler.

Damn am I freaking hungry! Why didn&#39;t I eat more at lunch? Did I EAT lunch? Well you ARE in the car alone and could easily stop for whatever you&#39;d like Jenn... Good point, thanks! 

I haven&#39;t been to All V&#39;s in a long time but I clearly remember liking it a lot. So I had made my choice and pulled right into a spot along 8th Ave. Oh I wish I&#39;d walked in just a moment before so the mom with a Brady Bunch sized family hadn&#39;t ordered before me. Dang it!!! My hunger was increasing but wait... this menu is GIGUNDO and I clearly need time to sort it all out! 

Heavens! An entire section for avocado based sandwiches? Burgers, Pastrami, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Omelets, Cold Cuts, All Italia? Holy crud lady take all the time you need. OK, so I go with a plain old cheese steak 6 inch, and a small order of fries... $6.89 not bad. I wait a bit but that&#39;s fair, the two guys behind the counter were clearly working their tails off for the waiting and hungry. 

My sandwich was really good. The cheese was quality, it pulled all apart when I cut it and you could actually taste the &#39;steak &#39; part of it. The bread was nice and fresh and had good texture. I was pleased and have the other half left over. There maybe, possibly, could have been a smidge more of the meat but it&#39;s really not worth fussing over. Their french fries kick some serious potato butt! Square cut, perfectly cooked, crunchy bits of bliss, especially with some ketchup for dipping! Whoo hoo! Some of my favs of all time. 

This place does need a visit from Ty Pennington and his extreme makeover team... and maybe some spring cleaning. It lacks ambiance for sure, and again could be a bit ... cleaner. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a great, little, hole in the wall, maybe you&#39;ve never noticed, but should totally try, cuz the food is super good, kinda place. Seriously. 

p.s. The back of their to go menu has this whole long list of cool stuff like... The greatest mistake? Giving up..... The greatest need? Common sense. It&#39;s pretty cool."

A couple friends and I decided to try out The Crafty Fox as it had good reviews and an impressive beer list. I arrived by myself at 6:30pm, and went upstairs to check out the spot. I was not greeted by anyone, so sat down at a table and waited for a server. After ~10 minutes, I asked a server if I could get a menu. She stated &#34;the upstairs is closed, but *I guess* I can make you my last table.&#34; I told her I didn&#39;t want to inconvenience her, and left to go downstairs.

Right as I got to the first floor my friends had arrived. Again, there was no host, so we sat down at a table among quite a few others that were being served, receiving checks, etc. Two separate servers stopped at the tables directly to the left and right of us, but no one said a word to our table. So we waited. And waited. After 15+ minutes without a word, we got up to leave. On our way out, two of the servers were casually standing against a wall chatting. I said to them &#34;excuse me, I just want you to know that I sat upstairs for 10 minutes without being greeted or served, and my friends and I did the same right in front of you for another 15&#34;. Her response was &#34;Oh, um, this isn&#39;t a seat yourself place. You should have been seated by...&#34; That&#39;s when I pointed to the front area where there is no greeter, host stand, etc. and said &#34;by whom?&#34; She offered us a beer, but at that point it wasn&#39;t worth our time.

I&#39;ve personally never left a restaurant for not being served, but after two tables and 25+ minutes without so much as an acknowledgement of existence, that box was checked.

A closed upstairs (on a Saturday night!), zero service and poor conflict resolution? You&#39;ve got some work to do, Crafty Fox."

Inside the place is great.  A comfortably spacious bar with some very fine beer selections and there is more seating on the patio and upstairs.

I&#39;m kicking myself because I can&#39;t remember the bartenders name.  She was amazing.   She engaged us, joked, laughed, talked beer and restaurants, and overall made this a great experience.

Now, they also have food here.  We had two of their specialty pizzas, the Carnivore and the Foxy Lady.  Both were excellent, the latter surprised me with how much I liked it.  The menu here is small, with a few appetizers and a couple of sandwiches and pizza.  And the smaller the menu, in my experience, the better the place.

I really liked everything about The Crafty Fox, and I will be back soon!

Potentially the rooftop may have been nice, but it was too cold out to really enjoy it. BUT the gluten-free pizza was probably the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had. Plus they have an awesome selection of beer. We really enjoyed two different pizzas. One was a gluten free Baconator.  The other one had spinach artichoke dip on pizza, but I don&#39;t actually remember what the name was. I had a beer from Portland that was decent, but it was more so to get excited for our trip this weekend. I don&#39;t know if I will be back, but I had a pleasant experience."

Came to The Crafty Fox after a quick yelp search for lunch before my flight home and I&#39;m happy I did! I arrived around 11:30am on a Sunday, and lucky me, it was happy hour!! 50 cent wings and $1.50 off 16oz pours of draft beer - SOLD.

FOOD:
Kevin, the bartender/host/server du jour was so great! Super knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap, I sampled several before deciding.

- wings - I tried the ninja hot, which are spicy and it really creeps up on you (like a ninja, lol). The spice combo is from ghost peppers and the Trinidad scorpion peppers. Yummy, but I&#39;mg glad I ordered a second flavor as well. Sweet and sour beer, mildly sweet wing, good choice to cut the kick of spice.
- fries - $2! Crispy and had a light seasoning on them - can&#39;t complain.

SERVICE:
Excellent. Super friendly, but not overwhelmingly so. Good beer recs, lots of cool beers on tap, my kind of place.

VENUE:
Really cool space on a corner, two stories, lots of glass windows, outdoor patio and a ton of TVs to watch various sports games. Park in the lot right behind.

Glad I happened upon this place! Got to try some yummy beers and lucked out with happy hour! Hope they stick around a while."

Ordered a pizza with cheese and pineapple that was good. I can&#39;t rave about it but it certainly wasn&#39;t &#34;ok&#34; either. Just &#34;good.&#34; The crust was thinner than I was expecting but the prices were cheap and our waiter was very nice! It was also really clean too. I would probably go here just for the convenience once a week. Not bad. Not great. Just good.

We had the entire rooftop, a keg and our very own server dedicated to our group who not only helped me decorate but also helped take pictures and timed games... she truly went above and beyond!

We set up a bunch of games plus they had shuffleboard and corn hole. Great views of the city, nice and spacious and the manager Kevin was awesome with assisting us create the vision we wanted for our event. 

Highly recommend this for a group events! Not only did the food arrive right on time, it was delicious and very reasonably priced!"

Downtown is always a pain to get to due to paying for parking and/or trying to find street parking.

They have a small lot here and with so many taps available to choose from and some seriously good pizza.  I read about how their pizza dough is derived from ingredients supplied from local breweries and the crust really is pretty good.  It&#39;s not too dry and has just the right amount of chewiness.  

I sat at the bar and interacted with the bartender often during my stay.  He was pretty helpful in finding some choices for me to try.  The Sharks playoff game was on too and he switched over to the TV near me since he noticed the Sharks hat that I was wearing.

I really hope that this place does well and that people will keep this place in business for many more weeks ahead.  With its slightly remote location, it&#39;s worth the trip to have a great pizza and beer meal without the worries of a trek to downtown."

Honestly i didn&#39;t know that the road off of park avenue to get onto 25 had a name. Friends suggested an early dinner at this place, after a peek at the menu, we were in!

The location is nearly across from the entrance to the 25, but bonus, at a light! There is a small parking lot behind as well as street parking.

There is a nice and cute patio that will see lots of use once it&#39;s not, y&#39;know, winter. Plenty of seating inside and possibly an upstairs.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, i try to stay away from red sauce, and when i asked if the bacon jalapeno pizza - yup, that is what i said, bacon - BACON and jalapenos - yes! - could be made with a different sauce, it was an instant, yes, of course. We discussed which would be better, the white sauce or the pesto, and our server nearly squealed with delight at the idea of a white sauce on this pizza...  so we went with it! We also threw in an order of garlic knots/balls as well. I&#39;d say skip the knots and get a bigger pizza! We were very pleased with the outcome and a little jealous of the wings our table mates had.

Beyond the food - which there is much more for me to try. The beer! So much beer! So many options and you pick your size - just a little or maybe more! So great!

All in all a great addition to the area and i can see many an afternoon here!"

From the busboy who gave us water immediately after we were seated. From our waiter, Anthony, who helped us order and was very cheerful.

+ Patio. Not the best view, but it catches the rays of the sun perfectly for most of the day.
+ Beer selection. Huge. Varied. Prices are OK.
+ Happy Hour. 1500-1800. $1.50 off all 16oz beers. Warning: no discount on 10 oz beers. Drink large.
+ Delicious pizza. Chicken and pesto for us. Thin crust. Sweet, yeasty taste.
+ Background music. Enjoyable and unobtrusive.
+ Walco flatware, medium weight
+ Wi-Fi
+ Website. Has the info you want.

- Pizza prices are a tad high.
- Napkins. Paper. Cloth would be so much better.

That being said, I was mostly disappointed in the experience.  The space is beautiful, the beer list is amazing and the food menu had a lot of potential, but the painfully slow service was what killed our group of seven on Friday.  We came in around 2:30 PM and the place was almost empty yet it took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get our food.  I&#39;m of the opinion that your glass should never be empty, but it happened more than a few times to everyone at the table.  The pizza was pretty good (everyone said the 10&#34; was the perfect individual pizza size) and I really liked the flavor of the Caramelized Onion pizza, I&#39;m just hoping this place gets into a better timing groove as they go.  Still going to root for this place!"

Also a great selection of whiskeys and some other interesting things on the drink list. So just for the drinking this place is five stars.

Then the food. Fantastic bread sticks with a butter spread that was fantastic. My husband said they were the best bread sticks he ever had and I have to agree. Pizza that was pretty much perfect. We each had a small pie and had pieces left over to take home. (They reheated great! Yummy lunch today.) No room for the tasty sounding desert-those will have to be enjoy some other night!

The decore was fun and interesting. We sat by a wall size map of Colorado that made for fun pointing and looking for things. Interesting lighting fixtures that I might use some time.

Finally friendly friendly service. Sarah was our service person and she was smiley and bubbly, laughed with us about several things, and over all was just a delight to work with.

There is an upstairs patio that is opening soon. I am looking forward to setting up there some evening, enjoying the views and the brews!"

The building looks huge from the outside so it&#39;s hard to miss when you get off 25. And they use the space well. Inside the bar is the center piece with a few tables and booths scattered around. They have a small outdoor patio at ground level and an awesome rooftop patio as well. Plenty of parking which is a huge plus for me. 
Their beer list is extensive with some great local and out of state selections on there. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what their rotation will be like. I like to be adventurous with beer so I love it when there is a large and fresh list for me to choose from. I had the blood of a unicorn (yep that&#39;s really the name of a beer, and it was good).
We split a couple of the 10&#34; specialty pizzas. It was definitely enough for two with a little to spare. 
The carnivore was one of our choices. Classic meat heavy pizza that did not dissapoint. Thin crust loaded with pepperoni, sausage, salami, prosciutto and red sauce. It definitely satisfied Jeff&#39;s inner caveman! 
Our second choice was the foxy lady. Thin crust, chicken, black olives, peppers, feta and pesto sauce. I could have shoved the whole darn thing in my face but I was polite and shared with Jeff. I think he was surprised by just how much he liked it. It was delicious!
The service was stellar, friendly bartender who chatted us up but also allowed us to enjoy our midweek date. I can&#39;t wait to come back in the evening or when it&#39;s not as hot as the gates of mordor so we can enjoy the rooftop patio."

I have now been here three times, with the last one being during the Bellingham Tap take over during GABF week. In no way was this place prepared for that crowd. The kitchen was running an hour behind, you needed to erect a flag to get attention at the bar, and the staff was stressing hard. They were so disorganized that it was painful to watch. When I got my calzone, it was the wrong one. The folks next to me waited and waited for food (I was there after they were and I got my food before they did) - in the end they left in a huff. There was no tasting the beers during the takeover - full pours or you were out of luck. I get that in some ways but...not great for people who are trying to sample new beers without getting tanked. But the thing that really stands out to me are the beer prices. I think they&#39;re the highest in Denver. A taster for $4-6?! That&#39;s robbery, people. You&#39;re better off at First Draft where you can serve yourself and pay by the ounce. The food could use some good too - average at best. I really hope this place works out the kinks because I love the space, and the liquor store next door has one of the best beer selections in the city."

They opened up and immediately had a ridiculous tap list and have only gotten crazier offerings on tap. I love this place so much. My only request would be for them to expand their menu. There&#39;s been so many times that I wanted to order something small like chips/salsa or some other small appetizers, but they don&#39;t have anything like that on the menu. Sometimes I just want to sit at the bar and snack on something while drinking amazing beer. Regardless, I have no complaints at all. Their pizza is amazing, and their pizza dough...omg. Made with wort and spent grain from local breweries - amazing idea. I usually order the bacon pizza and ask for the bacon to be cooked a bit longer than usual because the first time it came out a bit chewy (personal preference). 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and sit on the rooftop patio that opened last week! Their bartenders are super knowledgeable about beer and are very friendly/talkative. I love that they offer taster sizes (5oz.) because their taplist is so amazing and I want to order more than one!"

We couldn&#39;t have been more pleased. I&#39;m dinging them .5 stars because I think that the house salad and 14&#34; pizza are slightly over priced. However both are so delicious.

Our server, Anthony, could not have been friendlier nor more helpful. He gave excellent recommendations on beer and pizza. He recommended the Foxy Lady pizza which included chicken, black olives, feta, peppers and pesto. Excellent! The crust was perfectly thin and crisp will a very slight sweetness. The ingredients were thoughtfully laid out - not too little, nor too much. I love this pizza.

Our house salad with honey mustard dressing was a great &#34;starter&#34; - very fresh but a bit over-priced at $7. 

The beer selection is excellent. I love Belgian Ales and I had two that were very different but equally delicious. Happy Hour $1 off is a great deal.

Atmosphere - well, we were there on a 75 degree, March afternoon so the patio was just perfect. The obligatory garage doors separate the inside from the patio. We would however be happy to sit inside on a cooler day as it is very well laid out and very comfortable.

And we got SO EXCITED yesterday when we heard that this place had opened. We got even more excited when we popped on Facebook this morning and saw that they were doing a Wicked Weed tap takeover. What could be better on a day off than sampling a dozen or so amazing brews while working on a tasty pizza? 
Fast forward to now. We are sitting in the dining room. We have already been informed that they are not doing flights. No five-ounce pours. Which is EXTREMELY disappointing. Seems a bit of a shame during a tap takeover. But fine. You got buried the other day, you don&#39;t have enough staff, you&#39;re new. Okay. We can still taste a handful of things and decide on full pours. 
Wait. Scratch that. The waitress has just returned to inform us that the manager has put the kibosh on splashes. So, to be clear, they have 21 Wicked Weed beers on tap, in addition to the already-existing, fairly extensive tap list, averaging at $10 a glass, and we can&#39;t so much as try a smidge before committing. I&#39;m sorry that you are understaffed. That&#39;s not my problem and you just lost my business. Which is a shame. Because the food is... Good. And the beer list is... Great.

We ordered a French onion pizza they had on special, and some French fries. Pro-Tip: put the parm on the fries. It&#39;s amazing! The French onion pizza was tatsy and reminded me of French onion soup for sure. The staff was excellent but i wish these restaurants in Colorado would get with the fountain craft sodas. The place was clean, restrooms included and just a good overall experience for lunch. The waitress was always smiling, that seemed to stick out to me. 4.5 stars easily."

I&#39;ve tried a lot of the food on the menu as I&#39;ve come In with some large parties, and everything is delish (particularly the baconator pizza, breadsticks, chocolate brownie, just to name a few). They carry beer that is extremely unique and hard to get in Colorado - I don&#39;t know how they do it, but it&#39;s truly something that sets them apart from everywhere else in town! It was fun seeing that our favorite WY beer from the GABF was served on draft here! I know that they are currently hiring staff to help with the front of the house, as I don&#39;t think they realized that they would get so much business in their first 2 weeks open!

Most of us had pizza, and it was pretty darn good!  Atmosphere is fantastic, the patio was fun, music was great, and inside would be equally as fun.  Service was a 10 for sure.  Kevin had a lot going on and took care of all 12 of us that showed up at different times and all paid separately.  Will 100% be returning and look forward to trying more things!

I could not wait for this place to open and read the reviews so I was really excited to try it out.  Went to the Crafty Fox on a Saturday afternoon with my sister and her fiance.  When walking in it is very open space and a beautiful space.  It was not very busy for a new restaurant opening on a Saturday in a great location of the city.  We were greeted at the door and got seated at a booth which were wooden seats.  Around the bar were hard seats with no backs.  Not the most comfortable by any means.  I was really excited to try the beer menu which they have a ton a great beers on tap.  And I was really excited to try the menu.  We were told about the ribs which the three of us got as an appetizer, it was 1 rib but did taste well and was really tender like the waitress said it would be.  Then we all ordered a pizza, I ordered a small with white sauce and bacon and pineapple.  The pizza was cold coming out and there was not much cheese or sauce at all on the pizza I feel I bought a pizza crust.  And let&#39;s talk about the price way over priced pizza my ticket was $35 and I had a small pizza (not including the rib) and 3 small 5 oz pours of beer which was overly priced as well.   I just feel another not even sub par pizza joint opened in a great area of the city with a great roof top.  I am just disappointed."

Good prices and decent food but if I pull up again and she&#39;s there I&#39;m leaving.

When my friend suggested we get some pizza and wings I didnt second guess it. The resturant itself was very clean and i loved the layout.  We were greated as soon as we walk in and even the owner stopped by to say hi and see how we were doing. The resturant itself was very clean and a very spacious layout. The food however is a different story. We had ordered the Carnivore Pizza. The pizza was dry and whatever little sauce there was had no flavor. And barely enough cheese/toppings to cover the pizza. Best comparison I can think of is a larger version of the Little Tony Pizzas that you heat up in the microwave.  The wings tasted like they were the ones you would order from a Pizza Delivery shop where they throw it in the microwave.  The fries, well they were fries. I would not recommend this place for food. I would however recommend it for a place to meet up with friends to sit back and enjoy some drinks and enjoy the view and a few basic appetizers."

Great space with awesome and relevant decor.  Awesome patio close to downtown and Coors Field.  This place is super kid-friendly, which is great for me and my 18 month old.  They welcomed us with crayons, and a few baby toys.  It helped to keep her distracted.  Plus, the children&#39;s menu had some great and healthy options to choose from.  The beer list is insane, which pleased my beer snob husband.  So is their whiskey list.  The restaurant features one of the largest beer tap options in the state with a lot of local brews.  The food is really good.  My favorite options are: the Beaconator pizza and the French Onion Soup pizza.  Pizza is a dime a dozen so when I saw these unique options, I was happy.  The white and red chicken sandwich was also tasty, if you are looking for something other than pizza.  Their apps are creative and delicious and so are their desserts.  I especially loved the oatmeal, chocolate chip and raisin cookie.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the service was on par.  Def check this place out."

We had knishes, lamb and beef kebabs; I preferred the lamb over the beef. Their signature sauce seems to be ketchup with herbs. By itself it&#39;s not appetizing but as a dipping sauce it&#39;s very tasty.
The entree portion sizes are generous so I will be back to try the desserts."

But I think the other time, we had some items to go.  But since I forgot about those experiences hence decide to bring Hubs for Dinner here.  Furthermore, it has been awhile since Hubs has any Dinner relating to &#34;Russian Cuisine&#34;.

Friday March 13th 2015, after work we went here for Dinner.  Time was about 18:15hrs ish.  YES, this establishment is tiny.  From what I could recall, we ordered the following items :

*  2 orders of Samsa (Knishes) each was ($3.49) hence it was ($6.98)
*  Stuffed Cabbages (2 pieces) ($5.99)
*  2 orders of Lamb Kebab each was ($11.99) hence it was ($23.98)
*  Gyro with Feta ($8.98)
*  Homemade Fruit Compote ($1.50)
*  Turkish Coffee ($2.00)
*  Russian Tea Cake (1/2 dozen) ($3.50)

We wanted to like this establishment, but it fall shorts in some shape or form.  For one, what&#39;s the deal with &#34;EVERYTHING&#34; with some kind of Ketchup.  Ketchup &#34;dipping sauce&#34;.  Ketchup in some of the orders we had, aka like the Stuffed Cabbage.  The Stuffed Cabbage is drizzled with that &#34;Ketchup Sauce&#34;.  It tasted like those &#34;Cocktail Sauce&#34; when you eat the Cold Shrimp Kind of Sauce.  **SIGH**

YES, some of the food takes awhile especially of the Lamb Kebabs order, in which we don&#39;t mind at all.  THANK GOD FOR THOSE... if NOT, Hubs is unhappy with his Appetizer order of Samsa (Knishes), and Stuffed Cabbages.  Those Stuffed Cabbages are too tiny to be filling.  

Even with the Main Entrees of the Lamb Kebabs, it was slightly too little portion for Hubs appetite, hence Hubs has to order 2 Lamb Kebabs Main Entrée Plates.  The Lamb Kebabs comes with Rice, RAW Finely Sliced Onions, Sauerkraut, Pickles and Homemade Sauce on the Side which tasted &#34;Tomato-ey&#34; aka &#34;Ketchup&#34;.

Though I also have the Samsa (Knishes) as Appetizers, and Gyro with Feta Sandwiches with Rice as my Main Entree.  I am OK with all of what I had.  The Homemade Fruit Compote, I have as beverages was just OK.  Maybe we ordered the wrong items from their Menu.

The highlight of my Dinner was the Russian Tea Cakes.  It reminds me of what my Late Grandma or my Aunt back in Singapore ever make, similar like those &#34;nutty&#34; melt in the mouth kind of cookies.

YES, the Owner and all the staffs are friendly and accommodating.  We are still in search of that WOW factor that this establishment may offer to some from all the GLOWING Reviews but this visit was NOT as Stellar as we are hoping for.  *SAD FACE*

All in all, we wish them well in their business undertakings.  Since we are in time crunch, for the 2nd order of Lamb Kebabs MAIN ENTREE, we decide to pack those in TO GO Boxes.

From their PAPER MENU, they are opened during the following hours :

*  Monday : 1 pm to 8:30pm
*  Tuesday - Saturday : 11:30am to 8:30pm

We love places like this.  It is a hole-in-the-wall, family owned joint that serves food made from the heart.  If we lived in the area, we&#39;d eat here weekly.  We ate way too much for lunch, because we kept wanting to try new things after we&#39;d eat an amazing dish.  Our only complaint is that our stomachs weren&#39;t big enough to continue to try more dishes.

Basically, just order anything off the &#34;Specials List&#34; on the wall and you&#39;ll love this place too."

The potato dumplings were yummy.  Today, though, I ordered the beef kebabs, and, as expected, TOTALLY YUMMY.

It doesn&#39;t hurt that the people who run the place are always kind and personable, and, really...this Russian restaurant always seems packed with Russian customers, so they must be doing things quite right.

I wanted to take a picture of the kebab platter, but I hoovered it up too quickly. Suffice to say, it was freaking delicious.  I don&#39;t know what goes into Russian sauerkraut, but me likey. Also, they pickle their own vegetables, which were delish!

Check out this hole in the wall for some awesome grub and great service!"

Some high points and many not so high - although you easily could be (high that is) because the place is in a pretty sketchy strip mall surrounded by pot shops.  Place is about the size of a postage stamp with zero, and I do mean zero, atmosphere.  You even have to go outside and walk down the way to use a bathroom.  Luckily, they had a few outdoor tables but the view is strictly parking lot.  Nice afternoon though so it wasn&#39;t too bad.

Enough bitchin&#39;!  So, I&#39;m down with little tiny places like this if they have a good attitude, are doing some good cooking so I&#39;ll try anything.  Called before we went to make sure they were open because we&#39;d tried once before and they were on vacation.  Spoke with the very lovely woman (Gulie) who is kind of a one woman band - does the cooking (virtually everything is hers), hostess, and waits the tables.  She&#39;s a doll and was a big help when it came to offering menu suggestions since we didn&#39;t have a clue what we were doing.

The menu is in English and Russian and has some things you will never have heard of and many that are kind of familiar from that part of the world.  Since we were popping our Russian cherry we ordered way too much food - portions are generous and reasonably priced.

Here&#39;s what we tried:

Appetizers - Samsa (aka knishes)  - Diced lamb &amp; beef with onions wrapped in crispy homemade layered dough - fantastic - my favorite thing of the day - $3.49 for one though.  And, Khachapuri -filo dough filled with your choice of beef and potatoes or American &amp; cottage cheese or spinach with feta cheese  We had the later at it was my second favorite thing of the day.  Kind of like spanakopita.  $2.99.

Soup - the Russian couple leaving as we were sitting down recommended the Kharcho - sour soup with lamb, rice &amp; grated walnuts - $3.99 (small).  It was OK - a little on the greasy side for me.  Next time I&#39;m going for the Borscht.

Mains - well, it is a kebab house so we went with the flow.  She had the lamb ($11.99).  Gulie asked her how to cook it - medium turned out very well done and tough as a boot - my least favorite things of the day.  I had the pork which was much better - perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful - $8.99 and I might order it again. The kebab plates are served with really dry hard yellow rice (yech), some interesting allspice infused vinegary cole slaw, and a few slices of dill pickle and tomato.  We threw all caution to the wind and ordered some of their excellent homemade french fries $1.99 - so rare to find &#34;real&#34; fries anymore and these were textbook.  They made the trip worth it.

So, OK overall all.  Not sure I&#39;d make the trip out there again but not sorry to have given them a shot.  Lunch with tip was almost $50 (no booze) though - worth it?  Meh.

P.S.- I should mention that my lady friend became very ill after eating here and said that she went to the E.R. and was diagnosed with food poisoning.  Personally, I ate exactly the same thing that she did (minus the iced tea) and suffered no ill effects so I&#39;m dubious but she did barf all over my car - so there&#39;s that."

I&#39;d never heard of David&#39;s Kebab House until today but I was in the area and hungry. Thank goodness for Yelp or I would never have found this. 

When I pulled up the store was still closed and it was after their posted opening hours. I was disappointed and sat in the parking lot making some calls. Thank goodness I did that because what turned out to be the owner and her son pulled up next to me. 

I gave it a few minutes and then went in wondering if anything would be ready.  I was very warmly greeted and ordered to go. The potato pancakes and mushroom barley soup both sounded good. The owner suggested the eggplant salad too. The whole total came to $13 and was a lot of food. 

I dove into the potato pancakes in my car. Oh my goodness, were they amazing. Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with the perfect amount of seasoning. Once I got to work I went for the mushroom barley soup. It was a tiny bit bland for my taste but still good. The broth was the best. I opened up the eggplant salad and I admit didn&#39;t think it looked too appealing. And then I took a bite and was blown away. There was a little bit of smokiness with a perfect balance of sweet and savory. I cannot wait to eat that again. 

Normally I don&#39;t repeat my restaurants since there are so many to try. But I have already told my husband he has to come back with me!"

Kebab House, whose Tajik owners offer eager customers tastes of many parts of the former Soviet Union.

Why not begin with a tall glass of seasonal fruit drink (Kompot) or pear soda (Dyushes) and a bowl of the Georgian classic Kharcho - beef soup flavored with ground walnuts and sour plum paste? (They do of course also have Ukrainian-style beet soup, or rather, Borshch, if that appeals to you). Another idea to kick off your meal would be the flaky Central Asian pastries known as Samsa, bursting with unctuous ground lamb and minced onions. On the lighter side, the tabbouleh-esque cracked wheat salad called Achik-chuk, or a plate of pickled tomato, cucumber and cabbage have their merits too - and in fact, it might not be a bad idea to begin with something less filling, considering all the main course choices you&#39;re about to contend with! Speaking of which....

Considering the name of the restaurant, it would be a little silly to stop by David&#39;s and not have a kebab or two. These can take as long as twenty minutes to prepare in some cases, but you&#39;ll be glad you waited when you bite into a nice big skewer of pork, chicken, or liver - to name but a few. But no-one would give you the evil eye if you instead chose a little Plov (carrot-studded rice with lamb and, if you like, raisins or chickpeas) or some Khanuma (&#34;lazy ravioli&#34; where dough sheets are layered with meats and veggies, then rolled like a jelly roll and sliced), or even a split, flattened and roasted chicken. But whatever you do, don&#39;t forget to end with dessert, whether it be a bit of baklava, or some nutty teacakes dappled in powdered sugar, or even the Tatar specialty Çäkçäk - a honey-drenched pyramid of fried pastry bits."

The food was excellent. We had potato pancakes, borscht, and beef kebab, and all of it was great. However, I got the lamb khanuma, and it was by far the highlight. I&#39;d never had anything like it, and it was crazy good. Absolutely recommend it. I also had dessert and a beer -- not a single thing disappointed."

Came here with some Russian friends from school and had an amazing time!  Super great prices for the food and the alcoholic beverages, and super friendly service from the owners. 

We tried the beef kebobs, chicken kebobs, potato pancakes, #5 and #7 beers, shrimp dumplings, chicken dumplings, mushroom/veggie soup and also black tea for mom.  

So they recommend if you know what you want, especially the kebobs, to call ahead and order them before coming.  It could take up to 30 mins to cook because the owner lady is the main cook/server.  

The dumplings reminds me a little bit like the Chinese/Taiwanese version without the veggies.  The Chinese version usually have veggies mixed in with the meat but this is just the meat of your choice.  They are really delicious, never had dumplings with sour cream but I heard the Russians love sour cream with everything.  

Potato pancakes were DA BOMB!  It&#39;s like a crispy hash brown but more tasty!  I also really like the sour cream touch but I also like it with ketchup.   The soup was good and light.  Even the kebobs are really light and delicious.  Mom is really picky about her seasonings and most American bought food is too salty for her.... not this place.  She also really like the tea.  The owner brought out some homemade cherries for her to add to her tea, which she really loved. 

This place is a little bit further than my normal hood that I hang out but I will definitely be back.  Especially now I have to go across the street to M&amp;I market to get some cheese cake/curd snacks after my visit. 

Next time I come I want to try their dessert, the food was a nice portion that I did not have anymore room after the food and the beers.  Oh BTW, the #7 was my fav beer, #5 was too light like a Corona, #7 was like an Asian lager with more flavor.  I heard the #8 and 9 were good too, but stronger in taste. 

Apparently the number gets bigger with bigger taste to the beers.  So clever!  Definitely will be back!!"

I also didn&#39;t feel like it was as unhealthy as other dining-out options. I just don&#39;t think I&#39;d find myself craving any of the foods we tried. We didn&#39;t try a couple things we wanted to, though, like the samsa and borscht, so we&#39;ll likely be back. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the samsa, but were told they were out, so the waiter (who may have even been the owner) suggested something called cheburek (I think). We also had the potato pancakes. The cheburek was basically lamb in pancake-like pocket. I&#39;m not a huge fan of lamb, so I&#39;ll reserve my comment. The potato pancakes were tasty, but really tiny. 

For entrees, we had the pork kebabs and the chicken tabaka. Each came with pickled vegetables and a watery, ketchup-like sauce. The pork kebabs were flavorful, though I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d describe them as delicious; they were also pretty fatty. The chicken tabaka (a whole oven-baked half bird, with a garlicky skin) was delicate tasting and delicious. The pickled vegetables are an acquired taste, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve acquired a taste for them. I do think the tomatoes that were served were a tad bit too ripe. 

Others might say the ambiance was lacking -- that the dining area is too quiet, sterile, or small. I liked it, though. It felt like we were eating in the dining room of a little old Russian grandmother."

Had the chicken tabaka (buttery, garlicky, pan-fried chicken.  Awesome).  GF had the potato dumplings and we shared the khachapuri with spinach &amp; feta. Both the dumplings and the sea same-studded phyllo dough were excellent. Nice selection of Russian beer.  Had the #4.  

Everything is handmade in the kitchen. The pickled vegetables are perfectly sour, salty, and taste of real herbs. Order coleslaw?  That&#39;s made to order. Dumplings?  Made in the back from the dough to the filling.   Very accommodating to vegetarians. Just let them know.  Call ahead of you have 6 or more--they&#39;ll thank you for it.

This is crazy good, heartfelt cooking.  Although I&#39;d never eaten these dishes before it tasted like home. That&#39;s something special and I will definitely go back."

The food is amazeballs. Seriously. We started with a spinach and walnut salad, a samsa, and the potato pancakes--they were all lovely. For the main course we ordered a half-order of pilav, the beef dumplings with sour cream. a half-order of beef khanuma and another half-order of lamb khanuma, with a piece of baklava for dessert.

The words &#34;ochen kharasho&#34; (very good) do not even begin to describe it. It was the first Eastern European food that I&#39;d had since I took a trip to Winnipeg in 1990, and it was so worth the trip. The portions are good-sized.

Khanuma was the best thing we had, but the samsa, cheburek, lagman, and especially the plov (be sure to get it with raisins and chickpeas) were all stellar.

Unique uyghur style food, done well, in a mom and pop place (not the most charismatic service to be honest, but who really cares).

First of all, this is a family owned business. The husband, wife, and son combo work all day, seven days a week and do everything themselves. They buy from local Russian grocery stores, and everything is hand made. Do yourself a favor- assuming you don&#39;t have any major dietary concerns, walk right up to the counter and let the owners order for you. You won&#39;t be disappointed and you&#39;ll be shocked how small the bill is for the quality and quantity of food you got.

At this point, after a dozen visits, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve tried literally everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed. Don&#39;t tell my wife&#39;s Polish family, but we are probably just going to start ordering perogi and a few other things from David&#39;s for Christmas dinner instead of slaving away all day in the kitchen.

So I went through the Yelp reviews and decided on this place.  The food was great, and the place was truly special.              

I had the cheese pelmeni and syrniki, he had the potato pancakes and chicken pelmeni.  For dessert, we had this Central Asian specialty which is an egg dough cooked and topped with honey, dried fruits and nuts.  It was all amazing, and all cooked by hand by one of the restaurant&#39;s owners.  And the prices were very reasonable.                    

We talked to the family who owned the place quite a lot throughout our meal, they asked us where we were from and what we did, and told us the origin of every dish on the menu.  People from the region from all over Colorado come to this restaurant (it&#39;s in the heart of Russian Denver for those who don&#39;t know) and it shows.                    

My friend said he hasn&#39;t experienced hospitality like that in years, and I&#39;m inclined to agree."

The food is just like my mother&#39;s cooking- but better(don&#39;t tell my mom that). Borscht, khanuma, kebobs , bread and desserts are all I&#39;ve had so far and all were excellent.

A delicious mash-up reflecting the many ethnic cuisines of travelers on the Silk Road. This very small restaurant seats maybe 15 and offers take-out &amp; catering as well.  The atmosphere is very basic. You are here for the food. The owner/waiter explained the menu and helped us make our selections at the counter. We waitied while his wife worked her marvelous magic in the kitchen. Give it a try. We&#39;ll be back soon.

We were in the neighbor hood and decided to try it. So good. We had the Tabaka, it is freshly cooked so or took a little of time. But sitting in their nice clean dining room was enjoyable. It felt like we were sitting in their home kitchen. The tabaka was crispy, and flavorful. We topped off our meal with a Napoleon. I will be back. No courage necessary to eat here. Gouly is the owner and she should be proud. She called it a hobby. Loved it."

You know the whole, &#34;don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&#34; thing, well, that saying sure rings true for this place. 
On the inside, quite a modest little restaurant where you order at the counter, but what really caught our eye was the cleanliness--absolutely pristine!
Let me get to the food! Perfect potato pancakes with sour cream, borscht, beef and lamb kebabs so tender and flavorful and baklava for dessert. What a lovely change of pace from our usual Saturday fare. My husband and I both agreed it was like a meal from a home kitchen. 
At the end of our meal the owner/cook told us about some of the other dishes they make, and had we not been stuffed to the gills, we would have tried everything she suggested. 
All the more reason to return!"

We tried just about everything.  I felt right at home in this place and the mom who was behind the counter/serving us, was very helpful in finding us the best things to grub up.

A Melting pot of area style foods.  Lots to choose from and like nothing I have ever had.. I enjoyed the education about they types of foods from different areas.  The Chicken kabobs are great!  Borcht soup was different.. but good.

Dumplings are great. Go check it out.  casual deli style interior.
I finally figured out that I don&#39;t like lamb.  I like the Gyro meat mix that is shaved off onto a pita.  I think next time I will try the Gyro and pass on the lamb kabob.

IF the interior was a little nicer, and the kabobs didn&#39;t take so long I would give this place 5 stars."
davids-kebab-house-denver,Noah N.,srrer_hR93tB1ftqqo17Jw,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,0,291,24,jA7VS4amvwJ13JONGZolQw,5.0,2012-01-09,"Davids Kebab House... I happened across this place about a week ago.  It is not easy to see from the street.  I was in the area looking for a former Russian Deli that use the be around there but since closed.  I took note of the location and next time around stopped by and tried it out.  I knew that a Kebab house in a Russian section of town would not be the normal Palestinian/Greek Kebab place.  Thankfully my hunch was correct.

Davids Kebab House is in fact owned by Tajiks.  It is the only place that I have found so far in Denver that serves Tajik style food.  Which Tajik food is a melding of Russian influences with cooking one my find in Turkey.  I use these references so that Americans can picture it.  The menu uses familiar American words to describe other items that are in fact different.  Like kebab instead of shashlik and dumplings instead of the Russian word pelmeni.  But Davids uses the correct spice mixtures unique to those areas.  

The location itself is small and inviting.  It feels like a family run establishment which is exactly what it is.  There is a display case showcasing some of the food and a few tables for which to eat at.  The owner warned me ahead of time that if I wanted a Kebab that it would take 25 mins to cook because he cooked them from raw meat to perfection and there was just no way to rush that unless he half cooked things.  Which he would rather it take time and taste right.  He did say that they take orders over the phone so that when you get there, it would be ready.  I might take him up on that offer.

What did I eat.  Well since I have never been there and I miss eating a lot of this food I ordered A LOT.  My ex was Azeri so I missed a lot of the food she use to cook.  The regions have similar cooking styles due to geographic location and what grows naturally.  

Kharcho soup (sometimes written as harcho) It is a sour based soup with a hint of vinegar cooked with diced lamb meat, rice and grated walnuts.  This had to the be best version of kharcho that I have found in Denver.  Perfectly delightful and spiced just right.  I added a little bit more of chili powder and white vinegar both of which are condiments on the table.  The meat was stewed perfect and just melted in your mouth.  The soup is a little oily but that is how it is supposed to be.  Which only adds to the flavor.  The aroma of the lamb was just so inviting,  I would go back just for this soup alone.

Nutty Spinach Salad - Spinach, cabbage, shaved carrots, toasted almonds, sesame seeds and crushed dry noodles (ramen) mixed in with a vinegar dressing.  It was perfectly balanced.  Crunchy noodles and the sweet after tasted over the vinegar of the almonds.  Well balanced and executed.

Eggplant salad - this one is a little different.  This is not baba ganoosh.  This is a chunky eggplant salad with cooked sweet peppers, tomatoes and red olives.  There was also some cooked red carrot in there too.  Served cold with a side of sliced bread similar to bread I have had at authentic Turkisk places.  Which is not pita but better.   I was so happy to get something authentic and unique for the bread choice.  

Khachapuri - is the Tajik word for phyllo dough pastery.  I got the spinach and feta (nearly the same as spanikopita) and the meat ones.  Both done perfect with a great mixture of spices.

Pilav - traditional rice dish served with chunks of lamb and beef shaved lightly cooked carrot and raisins.  Last time I had this was at a Afghany restaurant in Colorado springs.  I am glad I found it again.  Great simple healthy meal.  Be sure to give this a try.  Its sweet from the raisins and carrot but savory from the spiced mead.  They also used a different grain of rice I am unfamiliar with.  Kind large and fat.  But it was perfectly suited for such a dish.  

Dumplings - Which were actually the Russian version of pelmeni.   I ordered the meat version which comes with a meat ball made from mixed lamb, beef  onion and garlic.  With a side of sour cream.  The meatball itself is wrapped in a noodle and boiled and then briefly pan fried in butter.  If you have not tried it, its always a winner.  Kinda like mini Russian style ravioli.

The deserts were pretty good.  I ordered the Napolean cake.  Which is a phyllo dough cake layered with layers of vanilla pudding filling.  It reminded me of German Bean Schtuck (which is a fond memory from Germany).  There was also something called Chak-Chack which I am going to have to try next time.  

I hope I gave a little window into what this place has to offer.  I know I myself am going to head back for more.  The meal was wonderful and the owners were really great people to talk to.  There are tastes here which are both familiar and accessible to some fare that could be considered exotic.  I know for me, I have been looking for a place that sells stuff just like this and I am thrilled I have found it.

I will be back for more."

I don&#39;t get to eat Russian food very much, so when I found out about this place, I thought I would die of happiness. The owners are very friendly! They told me that the kebabs would take about 25 minutes so if I wanted to order them the next time I should call ahead. Fair enough.

I ordered a bowl of borscht, chicken dumpling soup, potato pancakes, samsas, and the lamb kharchana (spelling?). Don&#39;t hate, I was a hungry girl!

The borscht was Ukrainian style, and served at the perfect temperature. If nothing else, I will go back for the borscht! The potato pancakes were also good, but then again these are pretty basic. I didn&#39;t get to try the chicken dumpling soup, my roommate had it, but she said it was quite tasty!

The lamb dish was excellent - quite filling! The two of us ate half of the order and were both full, although to be honest we could have been full from all of the dishes we ate before trying it.

Anyway, I will definitely be going back here to try more of the dishes. I&#39;m very excited this is close to my house, so I can get borscht whenever I want!!! =)"

My favorite dish is the rice pilaf and of course the shashlik. The owners are always nice and friendly and give me the family feeling that I am used to growing up. If you ever want something different from the traditional dishes that are served in the everyday restaurants, this is the place to go. The owners will go above and beyond to satisfy customers and will even give out recipes to those who are interested in the traditional Tajik/Persian dishes.

The staff here is so friendly and welcoming, and they&#39;ll be very happy to recommend all of their favorites for you to try.  They speak several languages, helpful because this place is right in the middle of the Russian community in Denver.  I&#39;ve made my way through most of the menu at this point, and they do so many things well.  My favorite is the khanuma, which always seems to be on the specials board.  Lucky me!  I get it with lamb but there are several options.  The kebabs take a long time but are well worth it - get the pork ones.  Pilaf was kind of disappointing but that&#39;s the only thing I haven&#39;t loved here.  The khachapuri is excellent off the appetizer menu - I go for the spinach/feta or the potato.  There&#39;s not much seafood on the menu, but the shrimp dumplings are very tasty, filled with ginger and scallions.

There are so many reasons why I gave this place 5 stars, so I will start with a little story and go into list mode. Here it goes!

I planned a Supper Club outing for a Denver Couchsurfing group! I made reservations and was greeted by the cheerful co-owner. She offered us outside seating (because it&#39;s tiny inside the restaurant and we had a large group). We all arrived sunday july 8th at around 6:00. We were offered drinks and the owner/waitress gave many suggestions on Russian alcohol. We ordered appetizers. When she (the owner/waitress) found out we were a Supper club, she gave us great detail on the restaurant, the country of her origin, and preparation of the food (&#34;It&#39;s all made by me from scratch, except the meat!&#34;). She laughed with us and was incredibly pleasant. The food was fantastic and filling! The lamb kebabs were great, but the soups were something to note. The desserts were delicious! The homemade sesame bread was one of my favorites. I actually met David a we paid our check and he is very mild-mannered and kind. 

to break it down:

1) Great food! A large menu with something for everyone (vegetarians particularly). It means so much to me that things are homemade here. As soon as we arrived, she set up the grill and started rice pilaf in anticipation of our orders. Things take a bit of time when they are made from scratch to order, but we truly didn&#39;t wait an extraordinarily long time.

2) Friendly and dutiful owners and staff.

3) Super tiny interior. If it&#39;s not summertime, it may not be best for large groups, but the outside seating is good.

Authentic food here. Much to be learned also, you just have to ask :)"

Tucked away in a strip mall off of Leetsdale, David&#39;s Kebab&#39;s specializes in just the sort of thing to get you warmed up on a cold winter&#39;s day, Russian and Tajk foods. Not being familiar with most of that cuisine, we originally had planned to try the kebabs. The menu proved so interesting, and the counter staff so helpful in educating us on the unfamiliar items, we decided that splitting the special of the the day was just what we needed. Khanuma is billed as steamed Phyllo dumpling stuffed with chopped lamb (or chicken or beef) diced carrot, onion, and potato topped with a tomato vegetable sauce. The herb and veggie dusted dumpling came out steaming on a gorgeous blue painted ceramic plate. Beautiful presentation aside, the dumpling was delicate yet so very filling. I am glad we decided to split this entree! We also tried the chicken soup with the chicken dumplings. The dumplings were tender and fresh made and the broth was exactly what I needed to warm up. I tried one of the dumplings with a little sour cream and WOW-  a delicious creamy flavor bomb!  By the end of the meal our bellies were full, and even though there were so many tempting pastries at the front counter...dessert sadly was not in the cards. I won&#39;t make the mistake next time of not saving room as the russian tea cookies, the brownies, and the napolean all looked liked contenders for my next visit! I can&#39;t wait to go back to try out the kebabs as well as the samsas (kind of like a knish). If you are looking for a new culinary adventure on the Leetsdale corridor try David&#39;s Kebab House!"

Man at 11:40hrs ish, outside this establishment is indeed packed, and the parking outside is full.  Thankfully we managed to get some seat in the Right Wing of this establishment.  If I could recall properly since it was a SUNDAY, some FOOTBALL game is on going and ALL THE TVs inside this establishment are showing all the FOOTBALL Game.

This recent visit was on Sunday January 11th 2015.  FINALLY managed to go to this establishment since Hubs wanted some &#34;AMERICAN&#34; food etc.

Once seated, right away, our server gave us the Menu and our drinks such as Water and Coffee.  This was at 11:54hrs.

From what I could recall we ordered the following items :

*  2 COFFEE ($4.50)
*  1 Egg - Steak - Hashbrown - Toast. ($12.95)
*  2 Pancakes (Shortstack) ($2.95)
*  Seafood COMBO Platter ($16.95)

Our lovely server, if I am NOT mistaken her name is Jazz E.  She is indeed friendly, inviting and accommodating.  She answers all our questions with regards to the Menu etc.  Jazz E, makes sure our drinks are filled up once its empty especially Hubs coffee etc.

We received our food at about 12:20hrs ish.

Hubs opt to have his order of Steak to be Medium Well, and the Toast that he opt for was Sourdough option, while he opt to have his Eggs to be Over Easy.  YES THE Portions is HUGE for some, but I guess there are room for improvement in terms of certain food preparation.

I was slightly disappointed when received my order of Seafood Platter.  YES everything is FRIED, but all the FRIED items are not the &#34;made-fresh&#34; but those FROZEN items, battered then FRIED etc..  aka &#34;ready-made-frozen-battered then FRIED...

YES my Seafood Platter comes with Battered Fish aka Cod, &#34;Maryland Style Crab Cakes&#34; which looks like Croquettes, Breaded Shrimps, small side of Slaw and French Fries.  My order also come with 2 Buttered Toast which was slightly &#34;burnt&#34;.

All in all just OK Brunch/Lunch establishment for us to go.  Maybe when time permits, we can look into Dinner options since there are plenty to choose etc.  Left Fat Boy&#39;s Bar and Grill about 13:10hrs ish.

Can range from a decent dining experience to yelling at a game in the bar. You cannot go out for drinks so cheap anywhere else. And the kitchen being open to 1a.m. is a huge bonus.

After a while the rest of us went to settle our tabs when the NEW waitress presented our separate bills she proceeded to tell us that He had to pay 20$ more dollars on his bill BC the previous waitress didn&#39;t fully close out his tab (and she had, the bill wasn&#39;t itemized when he got his final copy). We tried to speak with the manager who was rude and shrugged with an &#34;OH well attitude too bad buddy&#34;. The major issue is that we spent about $200 for a party of 5. Food, drinks, beers, shots and he couldn&#39;t do better by frequent customers? Then we were upset but finished up and began to leave when the &#34;bouncer&#34; stops us and he and the managers and 2 waitresses say we cant leave until we finished paying the bill. WTH?! THEY ALREADY CHARGED US but slap us in the face by wanting to recharge his card, which they already had on file. So a scene of yelling started bc the &#34;assistant manager&#34; got in his feelings and got really disrespectful.
Not worth the drama. We came to this business BC of emotional attachment not necessarily BC if quality and once you start treating long time customers like crap there is really no reason to return.
A poor way to get &#34;extra&#34; money out of people. A poor way for a manager to react strictly BC of his ego. A horrible way to end an evening. We will not be back . I encourage my 5000+ Facebook friends, and 1000+ twitter followers to BAN this establishment. No need to keep it around.
I&#39;m sure others have had bad experiences and haven&#39;t posted it. I have rarely seen the same wait staff twice which says alot about a business.

I wish I could take that decision back. If a server&#39;s job is to ignore us and smoke cigarettes with the drunks on the patio, then give ours 5 STARS. I wish I could give the place ZERO STARS. We had to get our own menus and probably should have gotten our own refills. We had the &#34;loaded skins&#34;, &#34;Gumbo platter&#34; and the &#34;Monte Cristo&#34;. 

We are not picky by any means and it amazes me that places like this can go on doing business. 

Have you ever seen &#34;Restaurant Impossible&#34; or &#34;Kitchen Nightmares&#34; and thought to yourself, &#34;Hmm, he&#39;s just being critical of the food because it makes for good TV.&#34; Well, I wasn&#39;t on TV and the food and service was trash. The skins were obviously old and microwaved. The Monte Cristo was loaf of bread with a few pieces of meat and cheese shoved in and the Gumbo was a watery, canned mess. Did i forget to mention that the server brought it out to me with the spoon drowned in it? 

It would have been nice if they could keep the drunks from yelling at the top of their lungs too, I never thought that the patrons could be louder than the traffic driving by, but I was wrong. Did I mention at least 2-3 of the loud yelling idiots on the patio were wearing &#34;Fat Boys&#34; t-shirts? 

Now this message goes out to the OWNERS. 

Dear Fat Boy, 
You claim to be the &#34;Home of the Dollar Double&#34; and I scoured the menu and could not find one mention of the Dollar Double. Lord knows our negligent waitress didn&#39;t tell us. Our portion of the bill was 34 dollars. As a fellow business owner, I think it&#39;s good business to refund customers all of their money once they have explained that their experience has been unsatisfactory. At the very least, you could refund our money and we can part ways amicably. I doubt you will be in business very long unless drastic changes are made. You can find me by responding to this review."

That being said, I called Fat Boys today to ask if the Florida vs. Tennessee college football game would be on (my husband and I are huge SEC football fans). The female who answered the phone was unbelievably rude and proceeded to argue with me telling me that Florida was not playing Tennessee today. She told me Florida was playing Ohio State today (who they are not even playing this season). I informed her that I was literally looking at the TV screen playing this exact game and she continued to use condescending language to tell me how wrong I was.

It&#39;s mainly to see a few old friends who live in that neighborhood so we can relax and have a few beers. It serves this purpose quite well. 

The beers are cold, reasonably priced with a decent selection. I&#39;m pretty certain this covers the majority of beer prerequisites. I have always had a pleasant experience with the servers. They are engaging and friendly and I enjoy this from a local bar or anywhere else now that I think about it! 

It has both a bar side and sit down side. Now yes...the bar side DOES have a line of regulars bellied up, VERY possibly getting drunk and watching football like an aforementioned review. Ummmmmmm, it&#39;s a neighborhood sports bar....so if these dudes weren&#39;t here I&#39;d be concerned and Fat Boy&#39;s would probably cease to exist....enough said. 

The sit down side is decent enough for me to bring my daughters regularly and the servers again are really nice and always start up a conversation with them. I like it when people treat them as individuals and not mindless creatures just needing food. I will always award points for this.

 ANYWAY...when we are on this side we ALWAYS order their ribs. Jeez Louise these babies are fabulous. They are huge and so tender they fall off the bone and land in a perfect pile on your plate. The sauce is smokey and sweet and rich and not so blazing spicy you wish you had a fire hose handy. I love these ribs and would drive through fire for them. One thing sometimes they are a touch fatty...but that&#39;s not the end of the world now is it? The orders are HUGE so tread lightly, oh and the wings are pretty darn tasty too. They are a good healthy size and don&#39;t appear to have been recently exhumed from Dinosaur Ridge like some others I&#39;ve seen. 

So this place is what it is, cold beers, friendly service and pretty good bar food. Not the best of the best but a familiar and very happy medium."

Portion control is out of the window here. The BBQ trio basket didn&#39;t come in a basket at all. It was a full plate of food: ribs, chicken, sausage and fries. Not great but ok.

The decor in this sports bar is actually quite dressed up, despite the yellow and red outside appearance. I would seriously consider taking my wife here for a quiet lunch. It&#39;s actually dare I say &#34;romantic&#34; in the dining area.

We go here for one reason and one reason only they have a special where you get 50 wings and not the puny little wings you get at some other places and a pitcher of beer. How can you go wrong, seriously decent wings, beer, sports on the TV and some night they have karaoke so you have built in entertainment! that rivals American idols worst!

I must say, this is an awesome place and I can&#39;t believe it is not more packed.  This place deserves more from its locals. 

Sitting back in the corner of the strip mall, the interior is perfect with a Broncos orange theme paint and booths. A fun, casual, sports bar feel.  There is a small bar top in the back with beer on tap. High top tables, a booth along the wall, bright/roomy, and a whole lot of sports fun.  Televisions throughout playing the big game; there is no bad seat in the house.  Outside on a warm day, they added a fenced patio to relax. 

The wings always taste great and the sauces are tasty, from mild to hot.  The wings and restaurant idea  are similar to the large wing chain, but a local feel.  The fries are basic but seem more homemade than a fast food chain; absolutely delicious with a variety of seasonings to fit anyone&#39;s preference. 

The staff is polite and helpful.  Employees appear to be the same every time I stop in.  Most importantly, the business is clean and a treat to visit.  Staff is prompt to change the trash bag, wipe down tables, etc.  

I would highly recommend this place to others looking for a local spot to hangout on game day, or any other day of the week. This is a good spot to meet friends and relax with wings, beer, and/or sports."

I wanted to give these guys a chance! I ordered take out. I&#39;d have to say I think I was overall disappointed. Positives are these: customer service was good, the wings were ready in a short amount of time for a pick up and the prices aren&#39;t terrible. I bought 10 regular buffalo wings (flaming) and 10 of the extra spicy buffalo wings. Neither were spicy! We had to add hotter sauce to them at home. You&#39;d thing a restaurant who&#39;s main business is wings would make a spicier sauce. The sauce was tasty, a chipotle buffalo medley, but I was disappointed in the lack of heat in the sauce. 

Also, for $1/wing, you can&#39;t throw in a couple slices of carrot or celery? I still have to pay extra for those? Buffalo Wild Wings throws those in there for free and the wings are spicier for a cheaper price..

I do not see myself ordering from here again, as I like spicy wings and these were way too mild."

Super friendly staff. Relatively fast service. The renovated location is great! I only wish they would deliver.

The wings are awesome. Love the variety of flavors and they&#39;re pretty generous with the sauce. The fries are REALLY good. BUT if you have a long drive home, open the box! They get soggy in about 5 minutes in the styrofoam.

Also, the serving sizes on the fries are stupid big. Like one &#34;regular&#34; will serve 2-3 people and that&#39;s what comes with the value meals. So, unless you&#39;re going to spend a few thousand calories, plan on sharing."

OMG! I have been on the search for good wings, and I definitely found them. I got the Golden Flame and Teriyaki wings and a side of Garlic fries. The Golden Flame wings were spicy, but not burn your face hot, the Teriyaki flavor was spot on. A little sweet... A little kick. I could&#39;ve eaten the basket of fries (which is a GENEROUS portion) all by myself. Overall, this place has a relaxed atmosphere and a good mixed crowd. Inside has lots of seating, but everything inside was full at around 8pm on Saturday. We took patio seating which is kind of clumsy, but we found a nice corner and enjoyed the great food and cool weather. I will definitely be visiting regularly!"

There were four of us, and we ended up doing the 30 wing meal. It was more than enough food as it came with 30 wings, a basket of fries, and 3 drinks. We tried one of the mild, a medium, and a hot. They have around 12 different sauces total.. 

The wings were all really tasty. They also were good sized wings, and not the scrawny things you find at some wing shops. The fries were really good as well.

There were a bunch of TVs and some pretty large table, so it would be a good place for a group to go. They also had around 7 or 8 beers on tap and a small bar for those that wanted a drink.

The only thing I would say is to be prepared to wait for your food. Our meal took about 20 minutes to come out, which is a little on the longer side when there were only about 10 patrons in the restaurant, but we weren&#39;t in a hurry, so overall it was an good experience."

They are a medium sauce and has very good flavor. The Honey BBQ and teriyaki are both pretty good. Their wings all are good size as well. If you get the combo it will come with fries. They are good plain or you can order them with buffalo sauce or get a garlic flavor. Either way they hit the spot but eat them fast or they&#39;ll get soggy. The set up ins for is pretty nice and they have tv everywhere. Very friendly service as well.

We only order to-go and service has always been quick and friendly. The food is delicious; the amount of sauce and spice mixed is perfect. Fries can easily get soggy because of the amount of heat trapped inside the container for a take-out order. 

I also wanted to mention that for two different to-go orders we&#39;ve plucked a piece of hair off of the wings. It was really unexpected to have to come across twice as we&#39;ve ordered enough times that it&#39;s never happened before, hence the shock."

I opened them up and was disappointed to see I was missing 20 of the flaming wings. I called the store and was directed towards a manager. They did question why I was calling them after ordering it 2 hours before but I explained what happened and they made it right. Not only made it right but also threw in an extra 10 with the missing 10. That is great customer service and unfortunately not to many businesses left will do that to make the customer happy. Flaming and the golden flame are absolutely delicious. Don&#39;t skip the garlic fries either.

Great wings, great beer, great venue with the tv&#39;s and football. Love the remodel. Awesome being a local business. The reason for 4 stars? Customer service at the front desk could be better. Definitely competes with the other local business down the road."

Got garlic fries, love that they are fresh made fries, not pre-cut frozen fries. The only reason I docked a star was for price. I really don&#39;t think you need to charge upwards of $1.00 per wing when it probably costs you about 10 cents. Other than that we&#39;d come here again. 20 piece wings, 2 drinks and large fries for $25."

We have tried mild to hot, but my favorite is still the namesake - the golden flame.  It is a perfect amount of kick!  Plus the bone in wings are really big and meaty.  Also can&#39;t miss the hand cut garlic Parmesan fries.  They could be a meal in themselves!  

The place isn&#39;t much if you eat in, but they have a couple beers on tap and several TVs playing whatever is on ESPN at the time.  The guys that run it are always friendly and put out a good product.  

I think we get take out or pop over once a week or so, so it is pretty much a staple.  Love it!"

What a ripoff. The wings were not good and the fries were soggy by the time we got home. Which is less than a 2 minute drive. I got the boneless wings and they tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. My husband and a friend got the bone in wings and they didn&#39;t want to finish them because they were so awful. Both usually have ravenous appetites so I know they must have been bad.

The food I&#39;ve had there so far is great though. We&#39;ve gotten boneless wings a couple of times, and they have more meat than most boneless wings you get (which can often be all breading). The Volcano sauce is really hot, I just dipped my finger in it and it was burning me. The medium is still pretty spicy too, but the mild is awesome. It&#39;s still got some spice, but it&#39;s doable for a hot food wimp like myself. 

They&#39;re pretty affordable, and the employees are very friendly. You can get your order to go (they have some awesome party platter deals), or hang out there. The ambience is very sports bar, and it seems like it would be a fun place to hang out and watch a game."

Everything was also cooked fairly accurately when we attended as well. My issues with this place however would probably be the lackluster customer service, the overall price. I felt you get slightly large wings here, but they also cost more. The other issue I would say is that there &#34;GOLDEN FLAME&#34; signatures sauce is a delicious Medium sauce, but other than that I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with their typical out of the bottle tasting sauces for the other wings I ordered. Good to hit every once and a while, but I wouldn&#39;t say that this place just stole my business from anywhere else. Imagine if you will buffalo wild wings, without as many sauce options. Also, This place is tiny and cramped. I DO NOT recommend trying to eat in the establishment at all. If you are smart, call your order in, and pick up and walk out. I really kinda regretted eating there. They had tables, but you could tell they obviously intended for this to be a take out type of establishment."

Meatier wings than many places (Hello Wing Stop, your bony wings really suck!) but not monster sized either.

The minuses - 
The fries were both overdone and underdone as a result of them clumping when they were fried.  This occurs due to hand-cutting the potatoes and not rinsing the starch off of the fries before frying them.  

The sauce, I had the golden flame, was just so-so.  

The fried pickles were absolutely horrible.

Overall, nothing to write home about."

They have a good selection on their menu, mostly fried foods, including jalapeno poppers and seafood items. The garlic fries are good if you want fries, but the wings alone should be enough.

Get an order of 20 and your meal is set.

They had a 10 wings &amp; fries special.  I got 5 teriyaki &amp; 5 golden flame (medium hot) wings.  It came with a baggie of celery and the guy behind the counter hooked me up with bleu cheese &amp; ranch.  I took it home and proceeded to pig out in front of the TV.  The garlic fries were tasty and I dug the wings.  They weren&#39;t the best I&#39;d ever had, but I enjoyed them AND they were pretty big &amp; meaty.

The menu had much more than wings on it.  Just about anything you&#39;d want deep friend was plastered on the giant menu inside.  Cheese sticks, jalapeno poppers, crab cakes, clams, random seafood &amp; a wide variety of other munchies to be enjoyed.  Even though I didn&#39;t get one, I also noticed they had beer on tap for people that were dining in.

They are a little hard to find as they are in the very back corner of the Seven Hills Strip Mall, just down from the Movie Tavern (another of my favorite establishments), but they are definitely worth finding.

Every time I have ordered wings there, I am amazed at the size of the pieces - more like a small drumstick instead of a wing drummet (sp?).

I just stopped in to get the 10 piece wings, medium (Golden Flame sauce). They were very good. Just the way I like chicken wings - fried and then covered with a tasty sauce. That sauce is damn good. 

Since I only had the 10 piece wings, I really can&#39;t say anything about the rest of their food, but if it&#39;s as good as the wings I had today, I&#39;ll be sure to update this review.,

They make some damn good wings, and the people there are awesome. I will be going back."

I got the third spiciest they have(not sure the name). I got 10 wings and garlic fries with a drink for $7.99.  Aside from the fries being to salty I have to say these wings were DAMN good.

First off, when I was getting out of my car the nicest lady engaged me in talk. After talking with her I found out she was the owner! That was a good first sign and things only got better from there!

There were many of us that came and more trickled in during my time there. I felt bad as I feel like we probably overwhelmed the small amount of staff. None of us were in a hurry and instead enjoyed our time hanging out on their patio visiting with friends. I felt that we made them delayed in probably getting the food out (because there were so many of us) to other customers who maybe were more concerned with timing.

The staff didn&#39;t get overwhelmed, did what they could under (likely) a stressful situation. Staff apologized to customers for the delay and told other ordering customers there would be a little delay in their food coming out.   Like I said, we were just there hanging out so we enjoyed our time; none of us in a hurry. 

The ambiance was great (great little patio) as well as the coffee, tea and food (all made to order). The owner also owns Phoenician Kabob next door. Another great place if you haven&#39;t been there! 

We all will be back frequently!"

I had the breakfast burrito added with avocado and chorizo. The eggs were perfectly scrambled. The potatoes weren&#39;t overlooked. Other places I&#39;ve been to cook the potatoes to a mush consistency. 
The peppers were fresh and not over cooked; still got a great snap when I bit down. The added avocado was extremely fresh, too. 
It was served with side of green chile to dip/slather and, I have to say, it was on point. Great spice kick but not overdone. I could put the green chile on an old worn leather shoe and it would taste amazing. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good quick bite. 
The coffee was also damn good."

The coffee is really good, and the middle eastern inspired dishes are a departure from normal breakfast fare. I usually get a few fatayers and a deviled egg on my way to work, and my partner loves their breakfast burritos. I&#39;ve gotten their sandwiches before and they&#39;re pretty good. The owners also own the Phoenician Kabob, which explains the middle-eastern vibe to the place. 

I agree with the prior reviewer though--the location is a little awkward and it&#39;s definitely not the prettiest coffee shop I&#39;ve ever been inside of. If they spent some more money on decor, better display cabinets and more comfy seating (those couches are terrible) they could really get a much better vibe than the cafeteria look it has now, and people would want to spend more time there reading and drinking coffee. I usually grab my food to go since it&#39;s not a place I care to hang around. The people at the counter are all really nice, and the prices are good. A nice neighborhood coffeeshop--just needs a little more love to become a truly unique and outstanding destination."

If you are a snob, or a negative and demanding person, then this isn&#39;t the place for you. (Notice 50 reviews, and 26 of them are 1 star ratings...)

If however, you like a nice, chill, little neighborhood place, that also has dog friendly outdoor seating and a friendly staff - you might actually like this place because you probably have a positive outlook in life.

Sure, the only real view from the picnic tables is Denver Auto Body, and traffic cruising by on Colfax. Probably, the only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5, is the location. This place would be a lot busier if it was in a better spot. So the location isn&#39;t the prettiest, but it IS very convenient. 

That being said, I come here often. I like that fact that its usually on the slower/quieter side. I have seen a surge in business over the past several months, and have jokingly told the staff that if they get any busier I am going to have to find a new coffee shop ;)

Just keep in mind that since it is a smaller place, there is usually only 1-2 people on staff. You will have a short wait if you come in with a group. And if I had to guess, no one working probably cares if you are from Portland, or not!"

I stopped in last week because we were had an hour to kill in Park Hill and what would be better than to take a local Yelp recommendation? So I fired up the app and it led us to Park Hill Hub .  Well... didn&#39;t work out so well.  Park Hill is not really a very warm place, either heat-wise or in its decor, so everyone sat around bundled up in their jackets on this cold day.   And the cheap seating and nondescript interior doesn&#39;t make you want to settle in and sit for a while. They definitely need an interior decoration consult--stat!     

The coffee was OK, at least it was hot and a bottomless cup.  We didn&#39;t get a specialty espresso drink so I can&#39;t say how that would be, but it looked like they were well-equipped.   The food was meh.  There were interesting things on the menu, from middle eastern baked treats and breakfast burritos, but they sound better than they are in actual execution.  And the display of them under saran wrap in a glass case is certainly unappetizing.   I wouldn&#39;t go there if you&#39;re looking for anything but a cup of coffee and a snack."

Then, as if by destiny. I noticed a dessert display inside the Park Hill Hub. I followed the glow of fluorescent lighting and walked into a charming, little cafe. All I can speak for is the cupcake I shared with my husband, but what a cupcake it was! Raspberry Earl Grey, beautifully decorated and delicious. Perhaps not the best cupcake I&#39;ve ever tasted, but several degrees above average. The staff was friendly and welcoming.

Then I remember Park Hill Hub. It meet my needs perfectly- whether I&#39;m a little hungry or a lot hungry. Deviled eggs. Wild rice/fruit salad. Orange bread pastries. And a bomb-ass veggie breakfast burrito. All of the prices feel quite reasonable to me.

Plus, it&#39;s a community-oriented spot which regularly supports non-profit organizations in the city.

Also, they provide bottomless cup of coffee so that&#39;s good too.

This is a wine bar with a decent menu. They have a large selection of cheese and meat. The small plates are more limited, and they also serve entrees, so overall, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call this a tapas place. 

Anyway, we ordered the garlic shrimp and beef tips from the small plates menu and the special, lamb curry, from the entrees. The shrimp are served cocktail style, with a slightly spicy dip. This place comes with 6 good sized shrimp, and they were fine, although not standout. 

The beef tips were really, salty and the meat was a bit dry and tough but they were edible. Both of the previous dishes were served on a little salad that was nicely dressed.

The lamb was actually quite tender, but the curry was over 50% potatoes and didn&#39;t have very much flavor. 

This is more of a wine bar where you can get snacks if you so desire even though Yelp has it listed as a tapas place."

Just like the name indicates, a little neighborhood wine bar that feels like you&#39;re hanging out in a place everyone is welcome.

Wines by the bottle, the glass and cheese for days! I love the ordering system, which reminds me of what you&#39;d use for ordering sushi rolls. Take the tiny golf pencil and indicate how many servings of each you&#39;d like on the list of paper. 

Buffalo mozzarella is always good along with aged cheddar. Add a panini with Brie and it&#39;s a good day.

Everything from atmosphere to staff to company around me was relaxed but intriguing; Light but exciting. The atmosphere is dimly lit, warm, and comfortable. The background of many conversations and laughter was constant. It is appropriately named Neighbor&#39;s... I unexpectedly met several people willing to just say hello or have a full conversation. A single bartender, a single server, and a one-man kitchen guy (I realized later it was the owner!) remained in sight at all times as they maintained an easy, relaxed ability to continuously please all patronage as if they were welcoming people into their home. The food was simply delicate and bold with a wide array of lovely new experiences. Everything was sliced and prepared per order on the spot. Their signature drink was a mouth-watering concoction of blueberry/lemon/mint that I wanted to slam but sipped carefully in order to enjoy every single sip. I went there hungry and came out fulfilled by more than just the food. It was a total experience. Perfect for a date or small group of your favorite people. I left for home a few days later craving Neighbor&#39;s Wine Bar before I left the Denver Airport. Go there! You&#39;ll go back again and again!"

It&#39;s located on a sweet little stretch of goodness in the Park Hill area. I met up with a girlfriend after work on Friday afternoon. We showed up at the perfect time. Only three tables were taken, so we had the benefit of choosing a table outside to enjoy the sunny fall day. 

Neighbors is just that--a place intent on making connections in the community and all becoming each other&#39;s neighbor. Our server was attentive, but didn&#39;t always feel the need to interrupt our conversation when he stopped by the table. Definitely made himself available if we needed him, but he let us enjoy the sunny day. 

Both my friend and I ordered a wine flight. We were there during happy hour, so all glasses and flights were a dollar off. We ordered the fontina dip, along with the Asian crab dip.  Both were great. The cheese dip was greasy, but a perfect complement to the crisp green apples and bread. The crab dip was cold (unexpected), but also a pleasant pairing for our wines.  My husband eventually joined us and ordered an old fashioned cocktail, which came in a martini glass. Ha. He loved that. 

We will be back. Service was great, the place filled up, and we were pleased with the food choices. It&#39;s not a cheap happy hour--be prepared to spend a bit more. But it&#39;s worth it."

The appetizers are great and the cheese list is also nice. Mushroom pate, SO GOOD. Cheese is my weak spot and it came with a little bread and my friend and I on our most recent visit devoured every bite.

Just know that when you come here, even just for a happy hour with a couple of appetizers and two glasses you can run a quick tab up here. $60 to be a little more specific. Would be great if the happy hour deal was a little better but I know I&#39;ll be back because this place has a great environment, great service, and a good wine list with yummy treats."

Two completely different scenes and vibes. Late at night this is a friendly local low key spot to grab a glass of wine or quick bite. Happy hour was a whole different scene, busy, vibrant and rocking. Despite how busy the bar was around 5pm on a weeknight we were given prompt and excellent service. The gentleman I believe was the owner was running around prepping food and serving wine, while still having an opportunity to stop and visit with tables, he recommended an excellent white and even stayed for a minute to chit chat.

From what I found online, Neighbors did not appear to take reservations and we got there at about 6:30-7:00 on a Friday night.  The place is small and was pretty crowded but there did not seem to be any wait.  It&#39;s decorated very nicely and seems to attract a fun crowd but that&#39;s about all I could tell you since we did not make it past the front door!  We were greeted by a hostess (and I use that term loosely) and asked for a table for three for dinner.  Her exact response was that she did not have any space for us and had &#34;no idea how long it will be&#34; before a table opens up.  She did not offer to take our name to put on a list and essentially stood in the doorway, making it very difficult for us to walk in further.  I asked about space at the bar or getting a glass of wine while we waited and, again, she told us there was no space.  At that point, we got tired of having our intelligence insulted by someone lacking any professionalism in doing her job and we walked out.  We went across the street to Tables and had an amazing meal.  We could not have been treated any friendlier by their staff.

I don&#39;t know if this is just bad luck or timing on our part but I did read another review that said the place is &#34;not very neighborly,&#34; so who knows.  In any event, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  It&#39;s too bad because they have a great location and opportunity to create returning customers."

The place is small and I expected more cheese and crackers due to little work space and no traditional kitchen.  But not, a large selection of delicious foods to share.  I would highly recommend the meatballs, nice small sample of homemade yummyness!  The name certainly pours out into the vibe of the place, very later back with neighborhood peeps enjoying a nice cocktail away from the kiddos.

I really want to love the wine bar in my neighborhood, but like a few others have mentioned, the service really depends on the time of day you get there.  I would not go with a big party at peak hours.  It&#39;s going to be a mess and the staff doesn&#39;t deal well with it.  We&#39;ve been in early or late and had a great experience.  When the rush is low, the server and owner are really accommodating.  When they&#39;re slammed they get a bit brusque.  The food is delish, but a bit overpriced.  Anyway, I&#39;m waiting for a brewery or different bar to open in the hood."

The owners aren&#39;t very friendly, so the name isn&#39;t right. The owners are often there, and they add nothing to the experience whatsoever. I&#39;ve been in the restaurant several times, and stopped to speak with them as they&#39;re setting up in the afternoon, but they still don&#39;t remember who I am even by facial recognition.  Not very &#39;Neighbor&#39;ly if you ask me. I&#39;ve attempted to engage them in conversation and they often have a look on their face of &#34;why are you talking to me?&#34;

It&#39;s also expensive.  It&#39;s a small place in the middle of the neighborhood and I can hit a $100 tab and still have to go home to eat. I know there are different levels of restaurants, but we already have the incredible Tables restaurant across the street if I want to experience something of that level.

The food at Neighbors is ok, it&#39;s tapas, but nothing to write home about.  The best thing I can say is that they hire very nice and competent servers.

Thanks for trying, but I&#39;m going to give up on this place and head across to Tables."

Food/drinks - We each had a different wine flight, and then I had an additional glass of wine as well. All the wines were pretty tasty, and the pours were generous, which always makes me happy. Also shared a small cheese/meat plate and some spinach artichoke dip. Both were delicious, albeit a bit overpriced for portion size and quality. Plus, my germ-freak self was having some serious issues with watching everyone who worked there a) put their grubby hands all over the bread without washing their hands, and b) picking at all the food and snacking the entire time we were there.

Atmosphere/service - I think this is where the place really lost some magic for me. It&#39;s an adorable little space that could be very warm/cozy/inviting/fun. The evening we went in, we were two of four people in the bar. It felt a lot like we were crashing a private party being held by the staff and the other couple in the bar... super awkward. Our waitress was friendly enough, but really just seemed to want us to leave.. So we did. 

In conclusion - not a bad place for a glass of wine and some snacks, but don&#39;t expect to settle in for a long, warm, welcome stay..."

A panini with a tiny piece of Prosciutto  on it.  The  prices  need to be  lower or the quality of food and drink higher.  Then it would be Welcome to the Neighborhood!

I sat at the bar and ordered a flight of Spanish wines...and then another glass so that I could REALLY relax :) Even though I wasn&#39;t too hungry, I ordered a meat and cheese plate because all of the ones going out looked oh-so scrumptious. 
Everything was marvelous. There is a diverse selection of wines, but also a full bar if you are looking for something more stiff or prefer beer. The menu seemed to focus mostly on meats and cheeses, so it is more of an appetizer place, but there were a few paninis and salads on the menu as well if you are feeling famished. 
The atmosphere is cozy. The place is small and everything is nice, but doesn&#39;t seem pretentious. The two people working were very helpful and kind. There is a small bar area where you can sit, or there are a few tables inside and a few on the patio. It looks like they have a garage-door style front-facing wall that can be opened on nice days. There were a surprising number of children there, which could have been a drawback for me, but none were screaming, so all was well. If you have kids, though, it seems to be just fine to bring them along.
In total, I spent $40 pre-tip for a flight, a glass of wine and a plate with two cheeses and a meat (I had to bring most of that home with me!). A bit expensive for one person, but I was feeling rather extravagant and it was completely worth it."

Although it wasn&#39;t Solera or Tables &#34;Great&#34;, it was still enjoyable and the atmosphere was very nice.  The owners certainly put a lot of hard work in, fixing up the space - it really needed a facelift.  Neighbors should do well in this location."

I was a regular at Perk Hill, the former long time occupant of the space, and its always been one of my favorite locations for hanging out.  Coffee or wine, doesn&#39;t matter.

The wine selection was nice.  I was celebrating a work victory with a friend so we had bubbly - really nice bubbly!  Our server was very helpful to us in choosing food that would pair nicely with the wine.  We did a cheese selection which was served with some grapes, nuts, bread and crackers and a small plate of sweet and savory crostini. 

 The pairing was perfect but I would like to see a little more quantity in the food.  Right or wrong, I tend to judge quantity of an order in its ability to stand up to my drink.  Generally a one to one should work but this wasn&#39;t quite enough."

The Aurora location is a bit smaller than the Lakewood counterpart, but the decor is just as charming and I would argue that the staff is even friendlier.

Pros:
- lots of margarita choices
- We did the traditional house marg to compare with others we&#39;ve had and it&#39;s flavorful and with a kick
- I&#39;m a paleo eater so Mexican food can be hard to find acceptable but they have a &#34;skinny taco&#34; with lettuce leaves instead of shells.  It was really good.
- big portions!
- cabbage pico de gallo was the best I&#39;ve ever had
- Chips came out warm and crispy
- service was fast and cordial, not a lot of side chi chat
- food came out in a decent amount of time

Cons
- happy hour ends at 5 but they have a coupon on their website 
- this is nit picky but their menu size takes up about half the table. Hard to put it somewhere when you&#39;re done with it and waiting for the order to be placed"

Not much, in my opinion.  He wanted to go to Tequila&#39;s. I had never been there, so of course I am up for trying it out. We first sat at the bar while we waited for a table to open up outside.  The patio is small, so we knew we would have to wait a bit. A Mariachi band played loudly behind us, taking suggestions on what to play. Sauza girls walked around giving out free shots and I did partake in a few of those. We ordered some house margaritas, which were strong and served with friendly smiles. We were seated at a patio table out front and began looking over the large menu. I couldn&#39;t figure out what I wanted.  Everything sounded so good. I decided to go with something I have never had before, the Alambre. Comes with fajita meat chicken and steak or your choice of grilled chicken, asada, al pastor, chorizo or carnitas, onions, bell pepper, mushrooms and fresh pineapple mixed with melted cheese. Served over a bed of rice. I got the grilled chicken and continued drinking my extremely strong margaritas. The food arrived and it was the largest portion of food I have ever been served. IT WAS HUGE!! I seriously could only eat about a 10th of the food.  That is no exaggeration. Great food, but my goodness, the portions do not need to be so large.  Overall, great place! I love it."

Another place I frequent quite often!! I have tried multiple dishes and some different types of tequila (but of course) from their extensive menu and it&#39;s so delicious!!

But seriously, their carne asada and pollo asada is extremely delicious and tender. The portions are quite large for the price, so you are definitely getting a steal of a deal. The salsa and guacamole is fresh, and my fiancé loves the cabbage dip that comes along at no extra charge. We have also had the soups as well, and have yet to be disappointed. My new favorite is the tostadas with the shrimp, pico, and guacamole. The name escapes me at the moment, but you get the point.. 

And the margaritas? Now they know how to make a margarita. I favor the skinny margarita myself, but I have got the toro as well and it&#39;s awesome.

Finally agreed to take it away and not charge after 6 minutes of arguing. Didn&#39;t reorder, probably woulda spit in my food. We eat out a lot and NEVER had this treatment anywhere, not even McDonalds would charge you if you weren&#39;t happy. Complete crap for service and management. Definitely wont be back."

The drinks were hit and miss . I had the jalapeño margarita while my husband had the regular. Neither seems to have any tequila in them.... However when we ordered one to share : get out! Lots of booze in that bad boy. We didn&#39;t finish it.
I liked the food it was all good. The cabbage slaw was really good
Give this place a try"

I&#39;ll start by us getting there, my friend and I couldn&#39;t set a place where to go eat so I was like this place because one- I didn&#39;t remember going here until we pulled up- 2. It was on my bookmarks for some reason. So we get there and I couldn&#39;t figure out if I was a sit yourself place or not. So we stood there and this lady on the back saw us and stared for a good 10 seconds so I asked in Spanish if we could sit ourselves down but she must of not heard us because she disappeared into the back. Finally a server cones over and asks if it&#39;s 2 and I said yes so we finally sit. We get  2 horchatas to drink and wow not tasty at all. They use the soda machine and it must have been running low on the syrup. Should have gotten a margarita instead. Now my food was 3 tacos de asada and a huarache all pastor. The meat all tastes old and chewy but I really was hungry. It was 3pm and I hadn&#39;t had breakfast or lunch at all. My friend had LA carne asada because they didn&#39;t have carne cob Chile. He liked his better than mine I know that. We both agreeded it used to taste better, all of it the food, the waters, the salsa. The server was okay. Checked on us and all. She wasn&#39;t busy though there was only us and one more table. However, I couldn&#39;t stop noticing her Hickey. That&#39;s besides the point though."

I got the veggie fajitas and my boyfriend got the veggie burrito and both dishes employed a frozen veggie mix - because why else would you use celery, carrots, whole mushrooms, and green beans in a Mexican dish?? We had a coupon for buy one entrée, get one half off and they gave us a hard time about using it since the margaritas we ordered were &#34;on special&#34;... a) the coupon had nothing to do with our drinks, and b) the margaritas had WAY too much sour mix and we could barely drink them."

The food certainly doesn&#39;t warrant the rating.  I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo which was overpriced considering it had hardly any chicken in it.  On top of that, they spread the dish out on a large platter so it appears you are getting more food than you actually are.  When I boxed the dish up after eating just a few bites, it looked like any normal portion a restaurant would serve.

Aside from the average food, I found the service to be lacking.  Not only did it take a while to have our order taken, but after we paid...the waitress immediately saw us put the pen down after tipping and she rushed over to pick up the check.  Her statement was that the bussers in the restaurant always throw away the checks so she wanted to get it before they did.  Sounds like an excuse to see how much money she just made."

The customer service is ALWAYS awful.  The wait staff is inattentive and make it obvious they are only there to collect a paycheck.  
This place was a regular for my husband and I, but the exceptionally disappointing service we received today is what will keep us from returning.
My husband and I had lunch here today.  We had finally received our meal, and I had my drink refilled.  It wasn&#39;t until after I had taken a drink that I realized there was a LARGE BOLT in my cup with a sort of white, glue-like substance around it and on the part of the cup it had been touching.  I brought it to the attention of our waitress, and she didn&#39;t seem concerned or apologetic at all.  She took my cup and asked if I wanted another drink.  We were sitting in the booth closest to the kitchen and we could hear her dump it out, along with the bolt.  She didn&#39;t bring it up to anyone until she handed us the check like nothing happened and I asked to speak to the manager.  So she went and found and told him what happened.  He then came to my table.  
I told him that I just wanted to make sure he was aware of the issue.  He told me the ice machine technician had lost the bolt when he was working on the machine the previous day.  
So, the manager KNEW the ice had been &#34;tainted&#34; with a missing piece and didn&#39;t do anything about it.
The manager then told me, &#34;well, I&#39;ll take the drinks off your bill.&#34; He didn&#39;t even apologize for what happened.
I would&#39;ve rather had him do the right thing and taken care of it when it should&#39;ve been taken care of than had the experience I did.
After my husband and I left, I was so angry at the amount the manager obviously did not care.  I mean, I&#39;ll pay for everything I ordered (including drinks), but can I at least leave feeling like they were sorry about it?  Absolutely ridiculous."

Now I do not consume any alcoholic beverages, so I must say that I almost didn&#39;t come here due to the name of the restaurant. However, I read great reviews about the food and authenticity of the establishment, so I decided to come. Good choice. This place is a little gem in Colo. the restaurant itself is quaint and very welcoming and I love the decor.

We were welcomed in with a smile and the waitresses and severs were friendly. The immediately brought out chips and 2 kinds of salsas. The one is a traditional red salsa and the other was with shredded cabbage, cilantro and some other yummy goodness that I&#39;m forgetting right now. Both were so delish! I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and both salsa definitely made me excited about ordering food here. :-) oh and the chips were warm and yummy too!

Tons of choices, but I opted for something simple: carne asada quesadilla. Soooo good! The carne was well seasoned, nicely grilled, moist and tender. So good!! And such huge portions too!! This made 3 meals. Love their food! I&#39;m a fan. Will come back next time I&#39;m in town!"

For one, from the signage and even their business card details, this establishment is named as Tequilas.   So I hope I am writing this review of this establishment or restaurant in which it should be &#34;located&#34;, since its in the same address.  I guess El Tequileno is also Tequilas. *Confused and Puzzled Look*

Was here for a very late lunch on Wednesday Janaury 18th 2012.  Thankfully we are just in time for the lunch specials in which I thought it was a good deal.  Time : 14:30hrs.

When I enter the establishment it seems empty.  I guess it was due to the timing.  I was skeptical, but just go with the flow coz of my friend&#39;s recommendation about this place.  We were seated promptly and given the menu.  Man, this establishment offer alot of stuffs, somehow I dont know what to choose or where to begin with.  

Nevertheless, here was what we ordered :

*  1 side of Guacamole ($3.00)
*  Mojarra ($13.00) ~ G&#39;s order
*  Lunch Special of Tacos Al Carbon ($5.99) My main entree and order
*  Lunch Special Carne Asada ($7.50) C&#39;s order
*  1 side of Roasted Jalapenos ($1.00)
*  Churros ($3.50)
*  Flan ($3.50)

My friend G has been here a couple of times and she likes her order of Mojarra alot since that was what she was raving about this establishment. 

As for C, she is OK for her main entree.  As for me, the Tacos was A-OK.  At least it came out hot.  I think with the Special Lunch menu, it only comes with 2 Tacos.  My order also came with Rice, Beans, Guacamole and Pico De Gallo.  My disappointment was more of the order of Churros.  It was over-fried, in which it turned to be a let down.  BIG BUMMER.  As for the flan, its just A-OK.  Nothing stellar nothing fancy.

The service was good as I must say, but with good service, the food needs to outshine it too, but in this case it does not to my personal opinion.  I would love to return perhaps to the same establishment.  They also have several restaurants in town, such as in Arvada, Lakewood, Evergreen and Golden to name a few.  I wonder if they provide the same menu and I hope my experience would differ when I have the opportunity to dine out with Hubs in the future.

They offered two kinds of salsa one was cabbage and onion and jalapeno based on the other one was your typical red salsa on the mildly spicy side. One in our party ordered fajitas which came with a generous side of rice and beans and the typical sides. There was not much meat, mostly onions and bell peppers, but the taste was good. Another ordered A combination plate with shredded beef tacos and chicken enchilada. The shredded beef was good quality meat, but the tortillas look more like Taco Bell taco shells, than fresh corn tortillas. I noted in some of the pictures that others had enjoyed fresh.   I ordered two chicken  tacos, again served in the Taco Bell type tortilla shells. The chips that came out with the sauces were always served warm and our water glasses were never empty and the staff was attentive, but not overly friendly.   The menu has lots of pictures and the beans look like they had cheese on them, but, my beans were smothered in red sauce,  which I did not enjoy. I don&#39;t like going to places that use Taco Bell type taco shells. I will not be back. We only tried it because there is a very wonderful bicycle store a few doors down. The bathrooms were clean and although the restaurant is small, it was packed, so obviously people like it. It is in a strip mall setting."

I&#39;m not familiar with food in Aurora as I don&#39;t live there but heard recommendations on this place. Unfortunately, it was possibly the worst meal I&#39;ve had in my short 22 years on this planet. There were two positives about the entire experience: fast service and a cheap tab for 5 people who all ordered full sized meals ($45 before a tip). That was the end of the good, now on to the bad.

The food here is sickeningly bad. I ordered cheese and onion enchiladas thinking that that was a &#34;safe&#34; dish to order. The enchilada sauce tasted like the sauce you get in a Chef Boyardee can of ravioli. It was terrible to say the least. My aunt ordered two  different enchiladas and a tamale and they were all covered in the ravioli sauce; she took about two bites of each one before she couldn&#39;t bear to take another bite. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."

The tequila selection is crazy vast, tequila enthusiasts rejoice! The margarita (we got it made with Don Julio) was DELICIOUS and not skimpy on the alcohol. It was not too sweet like most places and was really well made. 

The food (okay, okay so I got a hamburger. In Texas a good Mexican food place makes a crazy good hamburger... I guess not in Colorado?) was...lackluster. My husband got a Mexican dish, some sort of chicken, which was really dry. The menu is so extensive though, it&#39;s HUGE, so I am not surprised that everything is not good. There was potential so I&#39;m sure there are a few items on the menu that are good, unfortunately, we didn&#39;t know what to order.

LONG STORY SHORT, I would have given it two stars, but the margarita saved the day by being amazing. I guess either know what to order or eat after a few margaritas... anything would taste good after throwing one or two of those bad boys back!"

Perfect place to spend time with friends and family. This restaurant on Havana is the best one! We were in Glenwood Springs in the same restaurant and it was absolutely different. Smaller overcooked portions, so so service. 
I wish Havana location restaurant had a huge sign on the road for people to see it, we could hardly find it for the first time and now it is our hidden gem ).

The staff are always friendly and prompt and are very helpful with helping us choose from the diverse menu. I always end up getting the steak fajitas here which always comes out fantastic. The skillet comes out sizzling hot and the portions are huge. I love that they also have free chips and salsa. They make their salsa in house so it always tastes fresh and delicious. I also enjoy their dessert menu, their churros  are excellent. They come out hot and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. This is a great establishment and if you are craving Mexican food I&#39;d go here.

Well, Tequila&#39;s is a restaurant after my own heart and has this amazing entree titled &#34;Fajitas Acapulco.&#34;  Now, this is my heaven -- cheese dip sizzling in a cast iron skillet with tender steak, bell peppers, and caramelized onions.  Tequila&#39;s delivers heaven right to my fat-ass self.  The skillet comes out sizzling with cheese dip bubbling.  The steak is covered in cheese dip.  Covered.  The onions are covered in cheese dip. The peppers are covered in cheese dip.  It may sound pretty gross to the normal person, but to a cheese dip connoisseur like myself, this sounds like my wildest dream come true.  So, 5 stars for this dish that somehow went under my radar until recently.  Also, 5 stars for the waitress always knowing what I am going to order before I order it.  I love this place.

The thing that sucks, is it is kind of hidden in a strip mall. The two things that are good, if you see people of the same race that are eating at a restaurant (i.e. Creole/Cajun people eating at Pappadeaux or an Vietnamese person eating at a Pho restaurant) you can bet the food is good. This place was packed with my Hispanic brethren and I knew immediately it was going to be good and the food was going to be authentic. 

The only thing that concerned me about Tequila&#39;s is I went there with a coupon ($5 off when you purchase $20) I presented the coupon when it was time to pay, my bill was $24 before the tip. I had two margaritas and nachos, they said they would not honor the coupon because the FOOD wasn&#39;t more than $20. I still have the coupon and no where on it does it state these requirements.

Very good salsa on the table that&#39;s delightfully spicy and they also serve a little molocajate (sp?) of pickled cabbage with your chips. Good stuff and I eat too much of it. Very good carnitas. The Chili Verde is mexican style, not Denver/New Mexico style so it&#39;s just sort of &#34;saucy&#34;, not memorable.

They sell a gazillion types of tequila but you don&#39;t get a great deal on them. The margaritas are nicely strong though so it&#39;s a pretty good for drinks spot all the same.

For lunch try the Golden Burrito: Carnitas and Pico inside with guac on top and their Chili Verde."

Jeremy and I were at Tequila&#39;s on Havana last night. We walked into fun mariachi music this time. The band was really well dressed and entertaining, plus the music was good.

I wasn&#39;t super hungry and ordered the ground beef taco salad. I usually get a combination, but knew that would be too much food. Jeremy got a favorite, the carne asada. Of course, we started with chips, spicy salsa, and the cabbage slaw that they serve with their chips and salsa.

Jeremy&#39;s plate was massive. We&#39;ve gotten carne asada for lunch, but the dinner portion is just huge. It does come with a roasted jalapeno. We actually asked the waitress to verify that it was a jalapeno because they always seem spicier at Tequila&#39;s for some reason. Our waitress said that it could be that the cooks roll the jalapeno before cooking it, like the waitress&#39;s mom does, to up the heat, but she said it was indeed a jalapeno.

My salad was huge, too. The lettuce on top hid a ton of meat on the bottom of the fried shell. 

Everything was tasty, as it has been in the past, and we usually use coupons from the back of King Soopers&#39;s receipts for a discount on the second meal. Overall, it&#39;s a good value and great food!"

I&#39;ve only ever order one thing here, but when you find something you like, why risk being disappointed by trying something new?  The Gordo Burrito is not the healthiest thing on the menu... far from it!  But it is AWESOME.  The relleno is absolutely perfect.  It&#39;s crispy, even when wrapped in a burrito with refried beans and smothered with green chile.  Oh, how I love thee.

The food is always pretty stellar and comes out freshly made and hot. I have had everything from the Carne Asade to burritos to enchiladas and am always happy with my choice.

Before your meal, you can snack on fresh chips and salsa, and this weirdly-tasty cabbage salsa/dip that is actually quite good. I&#39;m usually not the biggest fan of cabbage like this, but for some reason the ingredients put into the dish makes it work.

And of course, the margaritas and their tequila selection is pretty great. A nice surprise is their house margarita is actually pretty hefty on the tequila, unlike every other mexican restaurant I know where it is mostly sour mix. You can tell that they actually use fresh lime juice which makes a difference IMHO."

The menu had 3 pages dedicated to alcohol. So who cares for taste when you are drunk right?? All our food was cold, tasteless and soggy. It hard to screw up Mexican food but they did it.

Tried their house marg on the rocks and it was soooooo watery. I would never order it again. My husband had the sangria which was better buy certainly not a real sangria.  It has strawberry daiquiri mix in it for sure. We shared the fajitas for 2--chicken and steak. They were ok. Nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about.

I got the Taco Fajita Salad (basically a tostada) with chicken. The chicken was *heavenly*.  The onions and peppers were good too. And they drizzled a teeny amount of shredded cheese on it to make it even better.

And then there were the churros. Good heavens they were good. Definitely not the frozen sticks you get from Costco--these were homemade and uhhh-MAZING. Especially with the chocolate and whipped cream and honey topping. Ridiculous how good it was. (Just make sure your doctor isn&#39;t watching... I won&#39;t tell if you won&#39;t!)

And maybe the best part: for two entrees, two drinks, and a dessert, we paid just a smidge over $30 for two people! (Yay happy hour margaritas!)

I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the margaritas... Granted, we each got the house margarita blended, so it wasn&#39;t going to be great.... And happy hour ones generally aren&#39;t great either. But I was impressed at the flavor selection-I&#39;ve never seen blackberry as a flavor before!

So overall a GREAT experience!

I always order the Crab Rangoons and Pad Thai! For most of the dishes, you can choose to add chicken, beef, pork or tofu (your choice) or shrimp an extra charge. Another thing is you can choose your spice level! There is mild, medium, hot and Thai hot. I can&#39;t handle spiciness that well so I always choose mild!

Thai Diamond Cafe is located in a tiny strip mall. It is nestled between a liquor store and a tattoo parlor. And no it&#39;s not a scary location.

Walking in to a very busy establishment without a reservation is a crap shoot. We had an early dinner and that probably saved us a lot of grief. 

We were welcomed from afar and a staff approached us and informed us that we can sit wherever we want. I noticed their tasteful decor immediately. Look up the ceiling when you sit down. They made a very boring ceiling really pretty and classy by stenciling their native flower on there.

For our first time here Adam D and I each ordered our own respective favorite dish. He ordered the Padthai and I asked for my old standby Panang Beef. Excellent taste! Awesome ratio of meat to vegetables and the sauce it came with was amazing. Not too watery and not too thick. Nicely seasoned to my medium heat request. I heard the Padthai was also not to be missed!

On a late Friday evening or casual weekday dinner, a quick call and I&#39;m set. 

Thai Diamond has helped to fill that void. Pad Thai, medium spicy, with a side of crab cheese wontons (commonly Crab Rangoon). If you really aren&#39;t a fan of spicy noodle dishes, I recommend asking for the mild version. The fried wontons definitely hit the spot as well. Each one has a light flaky yet crispy coating. 

With a decent portion size at a good price, Thai Diamond delivers on the food aspect. But don&#39;t ask them to deliver to your home. Pick up orders or Dine-in only here. So you might want to consider calling Doordash or a good friend; Otherwise, keep your eyes peeled for the small 3-store shopping strip. Thai Diamond is the one next to the tattoo parlor."

I ordered mine &#34;mild&#34; which was okay, my friend ordered the &#34;medium&#34; and it burned your mouth off, we are from Texas, we know spicy food but it was ridiculous. 

Tried the pork dumplings and they were delicious, one star for that and one for the service which was very friendly. 

The chicken and rice soup was a strange brown color and had SO much garlic, yuck!

Total disappointment for a 25 minute drive. Surely there has to be decent Thai somewhere in the Denver area???? :("

Most entres were $6.96 for lunch or $8.95 for dinner. AND the food was tasty. We ordered the pad Thai and yellow curry mild. The pad Thai was good, but the yellow curry is what we would come back for! We haven&#39;t had rich, perfectly sweet and spicy yellow curry since I moved from Los Angeles. The sauce was thick and full of chicken, carrots, onions and potatoes. The perfect cold weather food. We were stuffed for only $14.95! What a steal! We are definitely coming back and trying more curries!"

After a truly crap day, I just wanted some Thai food, I wanted it quick, I wanted to go home with it, crawl into bed with it, and Netflix and chill with it. Plus, I&#39;d been up since 4am, it was 7pm, and I had yet to eat anything. So, I ordered a lot.

Spring rolls. Pad Thai. Tom Kah.

When I came to pick it up, the tiny strip mall was packed, all with patrons of Thai Diamond. The restaurant itself is small, they cram a lotta tables into the place, and you have to pelvic-thrust into diners as you walk to the back of the house to pick up your food and pay. But I was hungry, tired, didn&#39;t care, and I thrusted with gusto into a few diners. Boom.

The food was hot, and ready when I got there, which was a little bit early. The service was friendly, and they were quick--they know how to work the place.

The food. My spring rolls were fine! I prefer vermicelli noodles in those things as opposed to pad thai style noodles. They were on the small side, and I&#39;ve had better.

The tom kah was delicious. Super thick with sumptuous coconut milk, and great flavor. Lime leaves and lemongrass remained in the soup, which I like.

The pad Thai was good! I really liked it. I&#39;ll definitely come back to try more dishes in the future. Glad it&#39;s so close to the freeway for easy take-out runs."

My father and my boyfriend are both regular patrons, stopping by for lunch a few times a week. The employees know their orders and always make sure they&#39;re taken care of. 

For my boyfriend&#39;s birthday, we decided to celebrate with a group at Thai Diamond. I made a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant is small, but they easily accommodated the 10 of us. They were well organized, service was speedy, there was not a bad meal or a single complaint amongst us. 

I brought along a homemade birthday cake, and they stored it in the back while we ate. From the moment we walked in, everything was timed perfectly and we all ended up having a fantastic time. For service, quality, and consistency, not to mention excellent food, I recommend Thai Diamond. 

P.S.  The Kabocha squash appetizer is delish."

My fiancé and I ordered the spring rolls, shrimp tom yum soup, pad Thai and Singapore noodles. The spring rolls and soup were just okay. The soup was overloaded with onions and didn&#39;t have as much flavor as expected. However, We love spicy food and ordered both entrees in hot. True to description...it was definitely hot. What I liked most is that it wasn&#39;t smothered in peppers and the spice did not mask the other flavors of the dish."

I didn&#39;t know what it was called as the outside just says Thai Cafe and wasn&#39;t particularly inviting. 

I love the quiet unassuming gems and this is a rock star. The hubs and I made a quick dinner date here tonight. We started with the spring rolls. They were warm and very fresh. And delivered in less than five minutes. I think I had chicken in mine and the hubs had shrimp. Regardless it was very tasty and the peanut sauce among the best I&#39;ve tried. 

I had the veggie pad see ew and the hubs got the Singapore noodles. Both were outstanding. The rice noodles were perfectly cooked and the veggies crisp and fresh. The Singapore noodles had a hint of curry which I&#39;ve not had served like that before. Bottom line - delicious."

Pad Thai,  ok,  no peanut sauce.  a bit bland. We did medium spicy,   I had Panang Curry.  It was ok.  I am not used to green beans in my curry.  I didnt really like them.  I had wonton soup.

I drew a deep, resolved breath earlier today as I bravely entered Thai Diamond Cafe without first looking it up online. 

Rarely have I stepped foot in a restaurant that I haven&#39;t pored over the menu on the restaurant&#39;s website, read the first 20 Yelp ratings, or scanned any online reviews from blogs or newspapers, &#34;but here we go,&#34; I said to myself as I valiantly opened the door of the small Thai cafe, knowing I could very well be subjecting myself to a meal that may rival the tattoo parlor next door.

Overcome with determination, I ordered an entree based purely on the menu descriptions. Totally flying blind, you know? What I found was the &#34;diamond in the rough&#34; so to speak. The &#34;rare oasis.&#34; Majesty takes the shape of many forms, in this case majesty was disguised as curry and thai iced tea. 

I was so overcome with elation, I immediately went to the bus stop to steal a fellow RTD patron&#39;s smartphone to start writing this review. SO GOOD."

Of course, this search refers to that of the perfect thai food. More specifically, Pad See Ewe and the ever elusive Curry Puff.

Since the closure of a long gone place in Boulder (I miss you Sawadee) I have been searching everywhere to quell my cravings. Pad See Ewe is common, I can always find it, and I always try it when I find a new place. At times it is pleasant enough, but since the start of my search they have all been disappointments (often times dry, and flavorless). The Curry Puff is a lot less common, and a vegetarian one, lets just say I&#39;ve only ever found two restaurants that have them on the menu. A Curry Puff is a small puff pastry filled with potatoes and spices; not unlike the Indian Samosa.

Enter Thai Diamond into the race. I started here at lunch (their lunch prices seriously cannot be beat). Per usual, I ordered the Pad See Ewe. I nearly passed out after the first bite. The noodles were the true wide rice noodles (the ones where you can&#39;t even find the edges) and they were wonderfully covered in perfectly flavored sauce. No dry noodles to be found, finally! They fill the dish with tofu and fresh broccoli to finish it off. My craving has been fulfilled!

On a subsequent visit, I noticed that their Curry Puff has been changed to be vegetarian (it used to contain chicken). Again, I almost passed out. Could it be that I found the place I have been searching for for so long?! It certainly seems that way! The Curry Puff is a tad bit heavy on the pastry but the spicing of the potatoes on the inside is delicious. It is a must order!

4 stars for amazing food and consistently great service, bumped up to 5 stars for the BEST PAD SEE EWE and vegetarian curry puff!

Vegetarian Rating: 4 stars - tofu or vegetable option for all main dishes, vegetarian curry puff and vegetarian egg rolls."

I found out about Thai Diamond from Yelp and they have some tasty authentic Thai food.  I have ordered their curries, noodles and stir fry entrees and while I&#39;m not partial to the stir fries, I have enjoyed every noodle or curry dish that I&#39;ve tried.

The place is pretty small for the amount of customers they seem to get during lunch time (for good reason b/c the food is great), so if you plan on going here with more than four people I would suggest making it an early lunch (between 11 to 11:30).  I have eaten here during early afternoon when the place is packed and there wasn&#39;t seating for groups of 4+ people so these groups typically didn&#39;t stick around for a table.  Since it&#39;s so small there isn&#39;t a waiting area either.

The spice level of their food seems to be on the mild side.  I&#39;ve been to Thai  places where mild-to-medium was pretty darn hot and was able to clear my sinuses.  But their &#39;hot&#39; is rather mild to me, but still very tasty."

The Pad See Ew with chicken, medium spice is what I get 99.9% of the time.  It&#39;s that good.  I crave it.  It&#39;s sweet, salty, and spicy and makes me happy. :)  My husband and kids order it too.  The waitstaff knows this and doesn&#39;t even ask anymore.  By the way, medium is hot - and I love HOT.  They use a different heat scale here...  Sometimes I will order medium plus, but the times I order hot, I regret it.  It takes away from all the great flavor of the dish because it&#39;s just so hot. 

We get the Tom Kha Gai (sp?) soup pretty often which is perfectly creamy with a good amount of vegetables and chicken.  Watch out for the lemongrass things in there though, pretty sure those aren&#39;t for eating.  Over the years I&#39;ve also tried the curries (I recommend Massaman) and the Royal Chicken, all of which have been delicious.

I logged on to see if they&#39;re open tonight (I remember that they&#39;re closed either on Sundays or Mondays; turns out they&#39;re closed Sundays).

I discovered this place about a year and a half ago, when I was in the area for a licensing exam.  Since I don&#39;t live in Lakewood, I never would have found Thai Diamond otherwise.  I came in for lunch, and found on the menu a dish called Kua Kai, which I&#39;ve only had once before in Las Vegas, and can never find at any other Thai place in Denver.  It was delicious!  If you haven&#39;t had it, it&#39;s worth a visit.

Then, they won Best Thai in Best of Westword, and my dad discovered it for lunch, and brought the rest of the family less than a week later for dinner.  Having a chance to sample more than just the Kua Kai, I can honestly say this is the best Thai food in Denver.  Their Singapore Noodles are delicious, the soups are fantastic, the appetizers are tasty, and the overall price is very reasonable.

One thing to bear in mind, though: I have a very high spice tolerance (I usually opt for Thai hot at most other spots), but they really make it hot.  I can only tolerate medium spicy most of the time.

The place is quiet, and the service is friendly.  The music can be a bit cheesy (I remember hearing a jazz rendition of the Fugees&#39; Killing Me Softly on my first visit), but you don&#39;t really notice it if you&#39;re having a conversation.  Aside from the music, the only gripe I have is that they aren&#39;t open seven days a week.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food."

Oily. Their food is too oily. I got take-out friend rice tonight and there was standing oil in the bottom of the container. I have never had standing oil in a fried rice dish. We had this same problem when eating in the dining room a few weeks ago. Same can be said for the Pad Thai, standing oil on the bottom - both when eaten there and taken home. If you order it with no to little oil, they seem to do a pretty good job but I shouldn&#39;t have to remember to ask. 

Flavor. Normally I am thrilled with the flavors of their dishes. Maybe because my last two experiences have been so oily, the flavors have been diluted. Neither my Pad Thai (mild) nor my husband&#39;s (medium) had any flavor. Fried rice, which is normally so yummy, was blah.

Vegetables. I usually order vegetarian and I LOVE the variety of vegetables I get. Broccoli, onions, green beans, carrots, cabbage are just a few of the veggies I can expect. If it weren&#39;t for all of the extra oil, I would feel like I was eating healthy because of all of the veggies!

Variety. They have a nicely varied menu and you can find something for just about everyone. 

Service. I have found the service to be good. Last time I ate there, the waitress kept the water full and came back to check on us and give us boxes. That said, if you are in a hurry, do yourself a favor and order take-out. Tonight&#39;s order only took about 10 minutes. 

This is our go-to Thai spot in Lakewood so I hope they get the oil slick problem taken care of soon."

Enter in Thai Diamond Cafe.

Right at the corner of Colfax and Kipling, this place is a true hole in the wall in a little building with a tattoo shop and I&#39;m not sure if anything else. There was one other lady eating in the restaurant and thats it so service was super quick--yes! I dig that they have lunch specials on the weekend which means I got a hefty portion of pad thai, crab wonton and soup for under $8. The other table left which meant that all eyes were on my (RIP Tupac) so the food came out quickly. The pad thai was just as it should be--sweet, salty and mouth watering. I left without a dent in my wallet and with my belly happy. 

If I&#39;m over in this area again, I will most definitely stop by!"

I especially like the buddah painting on black velvet. This is our second time here, and we can say the taste is consistently good.

We got the tom ka gai, pad see ew, and a green curry with chicken. The chicken on both the soup and the curry were very tender, and the flavor was excellent. The pad see ew was very good as well. I am docking one star because the vegetables in the curry and soup were cut in large chunks, and I prefer a finer cut. It was not a busy night, so it doesn&#39;t seem the kitchen would be so busy.

We will be back again. Thanks for a good dinner!"

Their Pad Thai is my favorite and the Pad See Ew was out of this world. They had great thai tea and appetizers as well (vegetarian curry puffs, WOOHOO!). 

I&#39;m very picky when it comes to Thai food and I&#39;ve tried just about everywhere I could think to go in Denver. I&#39;ve noticed that thai food is very inconsistent. Some places are good, some are bad. Some places are spicy, some are sweet. The worst part is that sometimes a place will be good and other times it won&#39;t be. Thai Diamond is the exception to the rule. I came here because it was recommended to me by my partner and his family and boy am I glad I did. 

It&#39;s a very small restaurant, located on a not-so-special part of Colfax, smashed next to a liquor store and a tattoo parlor. But it&#39;s absolutely worth the journey. I would travel from ANY part of Denver just for their Pad Thai. 

The portions are not huge, but were plenty to fill me up. And for the price, they were about perfect. It&#39;s fairly inexpensive as far as thai places go, which was an added bonus. And our waitress was super nice. 

If you enjoy Thai food, they you absolutely MUST try Thai Diamond. Seriously. Get in your car right now."

We decided on Thai cuisine and ended up here at Thai Diamond Cafe. 

From the exterior we didn&#39;t think much of it, but the interior was gorgeous. The wooden floors were nice and the decorations put the place together. Everything was nice and clean. 

The cook and I believe owner greeted us right when we entered telling us to enjoy. We definitely did not expect it. 

We ordered the Chicken Satay for the appetizer and boy was it delicious! The chicken was not dry and the sauce was something I&#39;ve never had before, but it was a very great taste. The pickled cucumber and carrot were not too pickled and not too sweet, just right. The presentation was also gorgeous! 

Then we ordered a Pad Thai and another dish that I can&#39;t think of the name of. Both dishes came out hot and had a great presentation. I enjoyed my Pad Thai, bit wishes there was a little more bean sprouts. Other than that the flavors were better than most Pad Thai&#39;s I&#39;ve tried. My boyfriend&#39;s dish was great too! He ranted and raved the entire way home. 


We also had an amazing dessert to end the night. Although, we wish the seasonal dessert was in to try. Everything tasted magnificent. 

I would overall come again because it&#39;s a great place and it&#39;s definitely the only good place near us."

 The pad Thai was so good my boyfriend finished the whole thing. I don&#39;t recommend getting their papaya salad. The shrimp is a good size but it&#39;s not spicy or citiusy enough. I would recommend their Tum Yum soup. It doesn&#39;t taste spicy initially but it will sneak up on you. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. It was tender, big and fresh! I want some as I write this review!  Lastly I would get their pad Kee mow! I loved it! It wasn&#39;t over sauces or too salty. It was even better as left over. Everything was super affordable too!

I&#39;m so glad I did! Both times (this month!) that I have been there, the staff has been incredibly friendly and knowledgable. The food has been delicious both times, as well. All of their curries are gluten-free, and the chicken satay appetizer is also gluten free. I imagine other entrees are as well, but I am a huge fan of curry, so I didn&#39;t ask! The coconut drink has real pieces of coconut in it - make sure to fish them out and eat them! The Thai Tea was probably the best I have had - spiced and creamy.

The restaurant changed owners about 2 years ago (according to one of the workers) and the new owners have been steadily remodeling and improving since then. Looking at pictures posted on Yelp in the past, I can see a lot of the improvements! The dishes look much more attractive than some of the past pictures make them look - the chicken satay, for example, both looks and tastes amazing, unlike the unappetizing picture from early 2012. The inside has also been remodeled, and you can see how much work has been put into the place.

I love going here because everyone is so nice. The food is great - spicy, but only as spicy as you like it - and it comes to the table quickly. The service is prompt. The restaurant is clean and well-kept. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you are getting (it was around $30 for two entrees, an appetizer, and 2 non-alcoholic drinks).

My only complaint is that the fish in the fish tank seem kind of sad - too many fish for such a small tank, and it looked a little like it needed cleaned."

Was here with my good friend, A for the very first time, THURSDAY March 8th 2012 for DINNER after running some errands nearby to this part of the neighborhood.  When we first arrived, we were greeted by a friendly server and was given the menu.  When we arrived, there is another family dining in this establishment.  Time was 19:35hrs ish.

Went thru the menu, so we decide on these :

*  Chicken Satay (4 skewers) ($5.95)
*  Calamari Cafe ($6.95)
*  Tom Yum Kung ($3.95) small bowl
*  Pineapple Fried Rice ($8.95)
*  Beef Pad See Eew ($8.95)
*  Beverages we opt Tea ($2.50) each

I am surprised that once again I encoutered in another Thai establishments, when I ordered the Chicken Satay it comes with toasted breads.  Hmm, is this a norm kind of thing, when ordering Chicken Satay, you ought to eat it with toasted breads too..  Perhaps you can make it into a sandwich or something.  Perhaps the next time around, I shall ask, what are the toasted breads for.

The Calamari Cafe, was tender cuts of camalari fried with batter.   I am still trying to figure out the kind of batter they used.  Perhaps it could be cornmeal of some sort.  Nothing fancy, nothing stellar. 

My friend A, likes her order of Tom Yum Kung and Beef Pad See Eew.  When I get the chance to taste both of her order, I like the Beef Pad See Eew.  Though I so wish it could be spicy to my taste bud.  The Beef Pad See Eew was slightly on a sweet side for my taste bud.

As for my main entree of Pineapple Fried Rice, it was as SPICY as I want it to be, but still it does not WOW me that much.  

The service from Thai Diamond Cafe, is indeed friendly, efficient and prompt.  They have potential to grow and there are indeed room for improvements.  I may return to Thai Diamond Cafe.  For now, its A-OK experience dining in, and with A-OK food with 3 stars.

While we were there many more patrons decide to dine in, and many more, orders to go.  Thai Diamond Cafe also allows a 10% Discount on the next trip, if I were to return with the Menu given to me, that they signed on it.

This establishment may be easily missed if you are not familiar with the area and especially if you were to drive at night.  This is so due to inadequate signage available from the main busy street, where Thai Diamond Cafe is located.  Coz after the dinner, when I took the picture of the frontage of this establishment it just said &#34;Thai Cafe&#34; or &#34;Thai Cafe&#34; signage was lighted up.

Speaking of grains of things, my larb gai salad, which traditionally has ground rice in it to add some crunch, had no crunch at all. Larb also usually has a pretty limey taste, which was absent here. Instead, my larb just seemed like ground white meat chicken with some cilantro leaves on top and some fish sauce drizzled over it. I eat larb salads all over the place and this one ranks near the bottom. 

I also had tom yum goong soup. Again, I would rank this near the bottom. It lacked any sort of pizazz. I ordered it spicy. It was, but not that sour, not that interesting. Just kind of flat. 

I saw plenty of folks dressed in cammo coming in to dine and pick up food. Either a gun club is nearby, or that&#39;s just the demographic, or this Southern California guy was just a fish out of water."

As an appetizer, we shared the A6 Spicy Chicken Spring Rolls. There didn&#39;t seem to be much shredded chicken in them, but the sauce to dip them in was pretty amazing. I detected a hint of barbeque sauce, which would normally be weird, but it went well with the other ingredients in the sauce (soy and Sriracha, I&#39;m guessing). I had the N2 Drunken Noodles, which was good, but, strangely, not as good as I remember it being when my mother ordered it. Perhaps it&#39;s because she ordered it medium in heat, and I ordered it hot. It was indeed HOT -- so hot I couldn&#39;t stop blowing my nose and drinking water. I think it took away from the flavor. My beloved ordered the N3 Pad See Eew (rice noodles with egg, sauce, and broccoli). Despite the fact that he ordered his hot, it had really great flavor with the addition of the egg. 

Since we went at an odd hour, between the usual lunch and dinner times, we were the only ones there again, except for a couple that came in after us and left, and a group that came in at the end. Needless to say, it wasn&#39;t busy. They still forgot my fiancee&#39;s Diet Coke, though, and he had to remind them of it. It was eventually brought out in can, and not removed from our bill. Also, he had to go to the front to ask for more napkins (because we couldn&#39;t stop blowing our noses), and, at times, I ended up drinking his water because mine wasn&#39;t refilled quickly enough. They just seemed kind of apathetic."

The green curry was overly fragrant and thin, though the massaman had a rich and tasty flavor which we all liked. The panang curry was just okay.  We ordered five entrees but were given just enough rice for three people, which was a gyp -- we paid for more rice but didn&#39;t get it.

I am typically hesitant to try Thai restaurants, as I find more often than not in Colorado, the main seasoning they use is sugar :( I have physical therapy down the street from this place and was very hungry after my session. Having never heard of this place, I for some unknown reason (again, bad luck w/Thai in CO), pulled in. So happy I did. I had the Larb with pork, heat level; hot ($7.50). The pork was nice and toothie-not tough, but not overly tenderized- the spicy level of hot was perfect. I like spicy food, so it was great that it made me sweat just a bit, and I felt like I had pouty lips after, but I was able to happily eat every bite. Maybe next time I will order sticky rice to go with, as I am athletic, need the carbs, and this has very little, as it is just minced meat with fish sauce with lime, some onions, lemongrass, cilantro, and some other good stuff, but no rice. The food had no real perceivable sweetness, just very nicely balanced seasoning and a bit on the tangy side, like it is supposed to be. I ordered a chicken green curry with casaba melon to go, heat level; medium($6.95/$8.50). The heat on medium is quit a bit less than hot, I would call it barely spicy, but was still good. The casaba melon was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful texture. The curry sauce, again, was nicely seasoned and not sweet. I will definitely return here!"

The waitress was very welcoming and seated us immediately, granted there was only one other person in the restaurant. The decor is very nice, and inviting. 

We ordered the pad Thai noodles and the green curry. First came our &#34;chicken soup.&#34;   This was like soggy rice in chicken broth. Weird to serve at all, they would be better off with a small salad or just a broth soup! My 3 1/2 year-old son enjoyed it though. 

Our entrées came out in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, I was not wowed by either of them. Maybe I ordered wrong? (The dinner menu was like 4 pages but there were only about 8 lunch options) The pad Thai was very boring. I have heard great reviews from other yelpers but this was not my experience. Rice noodles, a peanut sauce lacking any spiceyness, crunchy peanuts on top, and a few bean sprouts. Really nothing to brag about. The store bought microwave noodle bowl are far better. Sorry. 

The green curry was not what I wanted. I have had awesome green coconut curry and this was not comparable. It was not creamy &amp; the broccoli practically dissolved in your mouth. However this did have a nice spice! The side of rice was very dry and seemed like it had been in the same mold for days. Let down. 

I won&#39;t be returning, since it&#39;s not very close to my house &amp; I was disappointed. I went here based on the excellent reviews. Save your money but sacrifice atmosphere and get carry-out at Star Thai!"

However, when my co-worker who is from Thailand says that the only place she&#39;ll get Thai food from is Thai Diamond Cafe? I pay attention.

Our party of four ordered the following to split:  Fried Kabocha Squash and Satay to start and Kabocha squash red curry, Beef Pad Se Ew and Pad Eggplant for our mains. We ordered the dishes hot. I am glad we did and didn&#39;t order&#34;Thai Hot&#34;. Hot was more than enough spice...and I like my food spicy!

My favorite was the Fried Kabocha Squash! It&#39;s wedges of squash dipped in batter and deep fried and served with a tangy sauce. I probably could have just had that and been a happy camper, but the Pad se Ew was also outstanding and the curry and Pad Eggplant were also tasty. My least favorite was the Chicken Satay, I felt it was rather bland and I won&#39;t order it from there again.

I actually think that Thai Monkey Club is still my favorite as it&#39;s close to where I live and I can get it delivered. However, Thai Diamond Cafe is close to my job and I will definitely return when I need to grab a tasty lunch."

Menu is impressive with A LOT of options...it&#39;s hard to decide! This is by no means a basic deli, this is a gourmet café.  I ordered two sandwiches to go and a Ice tea. As someone who drinks tea often, the ice tea at Olive &amp; Finch is delicious and very fresh.
The inside of this place is adorable, they even have some inside tables facing out towards the lower patio. Really nicely decorated and warm feel to the place, very clean. Good and friendly service.  I did notice they have brunch and they do serve alcohol as well.
Sandwiches are big and delicious, and comes with pickles and chips. Totally worth the price, you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

We went on a Saturday so it was pretty busy but I suppose that&#39;s to be expected during peak brunch time. The space itself it pretty small. I feel like the ordering/waiting process could be a little better organized. If there&#39;s any kind of line you get really cramped in the corner and there&#39;s no good place to wait unless you want to wait outside (a bit of a problem if it&#39;s cold outside). So after we ordered we kind of just awkwardly hovered between tables and they started serving our drinks while we were standing. On one hand nice to have something drink while waiting but at the same time we were holding all our things and trying to balance drinks so definitely wasn&#39;t the most comfortable of situations. Finally, the prices aren&#39;t cheap but on par with other places around (probably average around $10-15 for your main dish). 

On to the food and drink. We actually all ordered the milano. The food was very good. Tasty, plenty of food, great savory flavors that blend well together. The bits of crispy prosciutto was probably the best part. It also comes with real potatoes. I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m not on board with the whole sweet potato phenomenon. I would recommend ordering it on the skillet. Keeps your food warm and crispy and honestly just looks cooler for those instagram photos :P. It comes with either a biscuit, fruit, or a beignet. I chose the beignet and had a taste of the biscuit from my friend. The beignet was awful. It was soft and a bit soggy and cold. The biscuit on the other hand was very good so go with that option. The cafe au lait is good as well. Overall quality of the food was great. I also had their walnut chocolate cookie which I saved and ate later. Really good stuff. Chewy in the middle, crispy on the edges, plenty chocolatey.

Summary: good quality food, would come again, but this place could improve on its service/helpfulness/waiting area and the sad beignet."

Olive &amp; Finch is a safe bet, just in case anyone was wondering.

It&#39;s usually very crowded around the main meal times during the day: 9-10:30 am, 11:3 am - 1 pm. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s best to go between 10:30-11 am in-between if you want to avoid the ordering line and especially if you want to sit inside.

What I like about this cafe is that they have a nice variety on the menu: quiches, sandwiches, baked goods - what one might expect. In addition they offer craft sodas, coffee, and desserts. All of which appear to be made in-house and good sized portions. 

This past visit I ordered the &#34;Bun Me&#34; sandwich, their take on a banh mi. HUGE sandwich and side of chips, I ate one half in the restaurant and took the other to-go for later. 

If you choose to dine in, they even give you *real* sliver ware and a linen napkin. A nice touch and saving Mother Earth at the same time! If it&#39;s not too, too busy there will be someone checking on you to make sure everything tastes OK as well. Oh yeah, and there&#39;s free Wifi, perfect for those of us working on the go.

I&#39;ve never visited in the late afternoon/evening, but it looks like they&#39;re open until 9 pm. That means they serve adult beverages along with an evening meal... I could see how cozy that could get on a chilly winter&#39;s eve. Noted for a future visit!"

Do Well:
1. Food food food - this place had so many hash options for boring people like me but also had pastries and so many other things. Had the Chorizo hash....SO GOOD!

2. Coffee - they had fantastic coffee, got a mocha with almond milk and dark chocolate, so good. 

3. Atmosphere - the feel of the place was very modern and farmhouseish (I know it isn&#39;t a word), good vibe. 

Things to Do Better:
1. Parking can be rough, not really their fault
2. Size of the place and lack of seating created a rushed and ruckus environment at times.

I ordered the Sunrise with a side of potatoes (don&#39;t do that because it&#39;s too much food), and my date ordered the blackened fish sandwich. My meal was amazing.

Lunch and breakfast served all day. I&#39;m a breakfast and brunch girl whom enjoyed firsthand of exquisite gluten free bread -- yes this place has gluten free friendly items, unless you&#39;re a bacon lover like myself. 

There is a lunch rush on most days, especially on a Friday afternoon in lunch time. Parking is actually a breeze. There is 2 Hour parking available in the neighborhood. 
Now: the scenery: very crowded, but fast moving lines. There is a lot of hungry traffic waiting to be fed, but they have a bakery inside with macaroons, cakes, and bread. The whole place is indie style and definitely targeted to most young college and hip kids. I love that they have an additional patio in the front outside. 

We saw the counter and was seated next to the gorgeous plants. The menu all sounds wonderful; lots of protein and healthy sides to accommodate the happy hungry hippos!! 

Blueberry lemonade is one option I chose. I loved the morning Bloody Mary, which was complimenting the celery that was added to it. I decided the Sunrise was going to be perfect for me, and knew what each bite tasted like. I loved how the bites were each balanced and not too obnoxious like other breakfasts I&#39;ve tried in the past. I noticed the bacon was not too greasy and the scrambled eggs were pleasant. Your Sunrise platter may come in a side of biscuits, or fruit salad-- all in your favor in which one you prefer. Grapes, melon and cantaloupe! 

The Basic Breakfast comes with ordinary biscuits, scrambled eggs, bacon and sliced potatoes. Mmmm. There is jelly made out of scratch on the side, but it doesn&#39;t accommodate the fellow bread. 

I certainly tasted the baked biscuit inside The Sunrise. It&#39;s definitely one of the most carefully cooked meals we&#39;ve ever eaten. We have to return and enjoy it once more!"

I stopped in to Olive &amp; Finch on my walk back to downtown as I saw that it got good reviews. During the day, they offer up breakfast options, sandwiches, soups, and salads. I opted for a special since they only appear on rare occasion. I suppose it didn&#39;t matter too much since I don&#39;t live in Denver. I got the hawaiian ahi tuna sandwich. How very interesting. The tuna was very meaty- a good thing. I took the pineapple off since I didn&#39;t think it worked well with the sandwich and it kept sliding around anyway- see ya!

I had the Milano Hash, which sounded amazing, but the egg whites on the sunny side up eggs were only about half set (raw egg whites are not what the chef should be going for), and the dish was so oily that I could only eat about half of it. Seriously, the food was swimming in oil, oozing oil, the potatoes were practically translucent. I&#39;m no health nut, but this was ridiculous. It takes a lot for me to leave potatoes behind, but I barely ate any because of the sheer volume of oil drowning them. It was insane. 

All that being said, the croissant was truly fantastic and the atmosphere was cute. Kind of a farm-to-table, rustic chic vibe. It was a nice place to get brunch, I just wish my oil and raw egg white had come with a side of edible food. 

I&#39;m giving three stars in the hope it was simply an off day."

My friend and I came here at around 11am on a Saturday morning and the wait wasn&#39;t too long. Maybe 15 minutes to order? So you order at the counter, and find seats.. and then they bring out the food to your table. While you wait to order people are leaving, so we didn&#39;t have trouble finding places to sit. 

All their dishes come in its own skillet, and it&#39;s just so cute :) 

I had the DF as hash, which has pulled pork and green chilies.. yummmm. It was very savory and delicious. You can get it as a breakfast burrito as well.. 

I want to come back so I can try everything else on the menu!"

In addition to the chai, the food has been good. The first time I came for breakfast and got the sunrise which was very good. And the second time I came for lunch and got the Cuban sandwich-bread was great but they put too much mustard on it.

I&#39;m a big fan of anything in a skillet, so when we decided to grab breakfast at Olive &amp; Finch, I had a good feeling I wouldn&#39;t be disappointed.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere and feels as if you&#39;re visiting a small cabin.  You walk in and are immediately greeted by a display of pastries and sweets, the smell of coffee, and a menu that&#39;s almost impossible to order from because you&#39;ll want one of everything.

I went for the Milano after seeing the word &#34;prosciutto&#34; with a side of fruit.  Probably should&#39;ve gone with the biscuit for something a little heartier, but oh well.  We also couldn&#39;t resist the mini birthday cake, and I am proud to say that we ate the whole thing before our breakfast arrived...

The skillet looked a bit too small for me at first sight, but it was the perfect amount of food (along with the birthday cake) to fill us up on a Sunday morning.  The only issue I had was my choice of ordering fruit -- It&#39;s a couple pieces of melon which is always just &#34;meh&#34;, especially when you choose it over a flaky biscuit.

Definitely pop in if you&#39;re in the area -- Get a skillet, a pastry, and a biscuit."

My wife and I went for brunch and my expectations were running high, thanks to all the Yelp reviews. I ordered Milano and my wife ordered a farmhouse scramble. Milano was just too greasy.. I like greasy but this was way too greasy that my stomach hurt. Also I wanted my egg over-medium but it was over-easy.. The farmhouse scramble,  as opposed to what one might think and what the description says on the menu, is NOT scrambled egg. Turns out it&#39;s an omelete with caramalized onion with spinach and potato on the side ( check out the pictures ) and the price is $11..
Not worth it.. Very disappointed., 

The place is okay but congested and definitely not stroller friendly..

Ordered The Sunrise ~$10 - 2 sunny side up eggs, over maple bacon, grilled tomatoes, cheese &amp; toasted baguette. The subtle sweetness of the maple &amp; tomatoes balanced out the saltiness of the eggs &amp; cheese. The yummy goo from the egg soaks into the bread perfectly so that it&#39;s not soggy but still maintains that crunchy bite! 

They are pretty generous w the bread, which explains why they have strawberry jam at the table. Bon appetite!

The inside of the restaurant is pretty small and you order at the counter, so the line can get pretty backed up at peak brunch times. The food and drinks are worth the wait!

Their menu is full of beautiful skillet breakfasts (potatoes, eggs, meats, cheeses) and sandwiches. I tried &#34;The Nanners&#34; on gluten free bread and while I liked the brie, fig jam, and arugula, I wasn&#39;t too fond of their GF sandwich bread. I appreciate having the option for sure, but it was too thick and sandy for my liking. I ate my sandwich open-faced and it was still bread overload. Besides that, I can&#39;t wait to try everything on their menu. Every dish I see a waiter bring out looks so gorgeous; beautiful, fresh, and colorful.

They also have great brunchy cocktails, including mimosas made with classic orange juice, grapefruit juice, or blueberry lemonade. I ordered a plain ol&#39; greyhound on my last visit, which always hits the spot for me. Good prices, and I got a free cocktail for wearing a Colorado Rockies shirt on a game day.

I started off with a blueberry lemonade that was wonderfully refreshing and had the Nanners sandwich. Proscuitto and fig is a great combination. The sandwich was sizable and quite satisfying. It came with potato chips and a pickle. My mentor had the basic breakfast and it came with everything, breakfast potatoes, bacon, and toast.

Located in a residential area where the early morning hours see everything from business meetings and grab n&#39; go suits to college kids and post-call folks from a nearby medical center stopping in to relax, Olive &amp; Finch started off a great day of dining in Denver and despite dismissive service from a middle-age barista who had not yet fully woken up the food itself was across-the-board excellent, as too was the charming and rustic look.

European in its styling, part bistro and part market with a focus on wholesome foods made fresh from local ingredients, Olive &amp; Finch is open from 7a-9p daily and with a wide ranging menu diners are encouraged to eat as health conscious or sinful as they please, several diners opting for omelets, wraps or sandwiches while the tune of my order intentionally played out entirely sweet.

Not the sort of place to loosely toss around the term &#34;artisan,&#34; everything possible made or baked on site, it was with a sandwich ordered that four additional items were gathered from jars, counters or cool cases, first bites of the almond croissant showing signs of lightly charred corners, the exterior shattering with soft textures and pure ground almonds filling the laminated layers beneath.

Using large wooden blocks as delivery markers, a coffee station offering several sweeteners and ice water for those eschewing caffeine, it was next that tastes were taken of a tender oatmeal raisin cookie with crisp rimming, the flavor again quite natural as was the slab of peanut butter and chocolate, a cheerful 6&#34; Birthday Cake with Sprinkles incorporating everything that would be expected and simply too cute to resist, though sharing with others would probably be good advice.

Waiting perhaps ten minutes for my entree, several to-go orders intervening including a sizable catering platter that required the work of two staff members to load into a truck, those on a diet or simply watching their carbs probably gave up reading long ago, but for those still on board take it on good advice that the S&#39;more Breakfast Sandwich is worth the time, effort and calories as crisp Ciabatta holds up beautifully to a slick of Cinnamon Butter plus Milk Chocolate and Marshmallow Fluff made in house, even the &#34;daily pastry&#34; served by its side a shining example of craftsmanship as the rich flavors of Buttermilk came in soft layers with sidecars of Honey and Fresh Preserves."

I got the special skillet made with sweet potatoes and kale without the chorizo. The flavors were great, but it needed to be served at a higher temp, as it was luke warm when it got to me.

2.5 stars rounding to 3

Very small in here with super limited seating. Order at the counter and find a seat style. The bakery items (lemon bar) was very good. Enjoyed the blueberry lemonade mimosa and Bloody Mary at brunch. Had the Milano hash and DF hash. My husband liked the DF hash, while I found the Milano hash to be very runny. The potatoes were barely cooked (actual potato chunks not really hash browns) and the moisture must have come from the tomatoes in the dish. 

One quick thought. They let you continue ordering here though there is no where for you to sit. So I asked &#34;are you just going to bring us our food if we&#39;re still standing searching for a place to sit?&#34; I didn&#39;t get a &#34;no&#34; it was more along the lines of &#34;the tables turn fast so you&#39;ll likely find something&#34;. 

Tip: they should hold the line up and prevent people from ordering unless there are places to sit. That would put pressure on the campers to get up, give the new patrons a clean place to sit (we bussed our own spot because we had to snag it like vultures to sit down otherwise we&#39;d have been SOL), and give the kitchen time to make sure the potatoes are cooked on all the dishes.

I doubt we will return unless it&#39;s during off hours on a random weekday."

Meat was real!  And fresh! Taking home to go the Woody which one awards.  Girlfriend said it was really good and I&#39;ll enjoy. 

You have to get the blueberry lemonade! It&#39;s better as a Palmer because it&#39;s sweet but, man, the freshness of the blueberry quenched my thirst!"

When you walk in, you&#39;re welcomed with a case of incredible-looking pastries, cakes, and friendly workers. This place is kind of like Noodles and Company. You decide what you want to order (while being tortured by pastries and yummy looking cafe drinks), pay at the counter, receive a cute block with a letter or number, and someone brings you your food. (The menus are to the left of the pastry case, FYI.)

The Sonoma hash was quickly (10-15 minutes) and elegantly served in a cast iron skillet on a wooden board with my fruit salad side! The potatoes and roasted vegetables were perfectly cooked -- hot and soft with a little bit of crunch. The goat cheese really brought the dish together, though. It blended all of the ingredients very well. The portions looked small when the food first came out, but alas, I only got through half of the dish ... How typical of me. Anyway, the portions seemed perfect for normal people with normal stomachs.

The service was excellent -- everyone was very kind! The interior was really cute -- lots of wood and hipster-DIY-type signs and boards all over.

I do have one thing that bothered me about this place, though: they had pastries and baked goods staring at me as I waited in line to order my food! &#34;Ugh!&#34; to them for making everything look amazing!"
olive-and-finch-denver,T S.,HoFUSbYHYi36gGUeMEKHvg,"Aurora, CO",0,1,0,0,78,3ypNXXSNPvPbepGmX4sRKg,4.0,2016-11-11,"After being disappointed by one too many trendy but no substance restaurants, with reviews that deem them &#34;sssoooo amaaaazing,&#34; I have been avoiding going to brunch. Like, do these people even eat?! Or do they just photograph their food?

Today I took a chance on Olive and Finch, and had my faith in brunching restored. I got the Milano as a skillet and a cup of coffee. And holy cow, the skillet had flavor! So gooey with melted mozzarella, so basilly with pesto, eggs cooked perfectly over medium, and so pretty with the little skillet platter it comes on. The roasted tomatoes provided just enough sweetness and tang, the caramelized onions and mushrooms were just luscious. Of course, the interior is cozy and the staff provided good service. Trying to be healthy so I did not sample the dozens of varieties of baked goods that had me drooling and I will definitely be back for. And the coffee was tasty and the perfect strength, not weak ass IHOP coffee. Plus you get a free refill 

If I had any tips for improvement they would be - - serve better bread rounds with the skillet. Mine were stale and tasteless. Thankfully everything else was stellar and filling so I didn&#39;t need the bread, but if you intend for people to eat it, it should probably be of better quality. Another minor suggestion, I know with all that cheese and pesto and fried potatoes there is bound to be some grease, but the bottom of the skillet really was quite oil filled (I used the stale bread to help soak it up.) Another petty annoyance - -when the woman at the counter asked how I wanted my eggs and I took a moment to consider, she started listing off scrambled, over easy, etc.... I mean, I am a grown woman who has eaten at a restaurant before. There was no rush, no line behind me, it felt condescending and like I was being hurried. Maybe save your egg list for when people ask what kind of egg options you have. 

Really and truly, these are knit-picky things. None of it ruined my experience at all. It was a lovely morning and I will absolutely be back!"

Whenever I work at St Joes I try to go there for lunch, however due to my recent experience I may reconsider my loyalty.  I came for brunch, ordered a sandwich that comes with a side of fruit.  The fruit we mushy and borderline rotten, definitely sat in the fridge uncovered for days!!  I went up to the counter asked a lady if I can have a fresh cup, she gave me attitude, no apology or anything, complete disregard for poor product.  What&#39;s worse, the one she gave me was just as rotten as the first one!!!

My message to the manager of this place is simple: the customer will always give you one chance to recover from a bad experience...I did that, and was treated as a nuisance.  Now, my next step is likely not to return to your business and tell others about my experience."

I expected it to be pretentious and healthy (not the good kind), but I was wrong. Our meal was fresh and had a lot of vegetables as I expected, but the flavors were well developed. I had the Bun Mi which balanced jalapeño spice, fresh cilantro, and an Asian sauce that made me enjoy every bite. The baguette bun was soft and chewy but hearty enough to avoid becoming soggy. My wife had the Woody Wood. The flavors were as complex but more subtle. It was creamy and inspired me to experiment with tarragon in my cooking at home. Also proving me wrong, the atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. The coconut caramel was a good end to a great meal. Both sandwiches were almost $12 but at their size with a side included, they were definitely worth it."

Their menu had quite a few things that sounded good. I ended up with some sort of hash, but my eggs were a tad bit overcooked. I had the blueberry lemonade mimosa and that was delicious. One of my friends had a breakfast sandwich which she really liked. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, no major complaints.

Perhaps my expectations were too high prior to coming here, but I thought the food was just average. Maybe I was also a little thrown off since I was going in expecting a long, slow, sit down brunch. I would be willing to give it another try though."

I was bummed they were out of their &#34;daily pastry,&#34; so I had a blueberry muffin instead. It was... ok.

I got the City French (ham, brie, scrambled eggs, red pepper aioli, on a croissant). There was too much aioli, and it didn&#39;t have much flavor. There was way too much egg on the sandwich. Between that and the ham, the croissant became soggy and doughy. I picked it apart and ate the parts that were... ok.

My friend ordered one of the breakfast skillets. She asked for her eggs over-medium. They were soft and right side up. The rest of it was... ok.

I&#39;d probably try it again, just different items, and maybe earlier in the day."

The interior is up-to-date, with clean lines, blacks, browns, white, and steel. It&#39;s fairly comfortable, with only room for about 35 people to sit down. As we ate our breakfast, the place became crowded, as more people walked in.

They have a nice menu, with enough variety for about everyone. I believe, most of their food is cooked on the premises, which is nice. I had several questions about the bakery items, but their pastry chef was not on the premises, so my specific questions could not be answered, which was a bit disappointing, oh well.

We had the typical breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast. I had the gluten free bread. My husband had regular bread, not the gluten free. We both had coffee. My husband&#39;s meal only had two very small slices of bread (toast), very small. I had 5 slices of gluten free bread (toast). The bacon was good, wish I had asked what brand they use. 

We didn&#39;t get any refills on coffee, which we are use to  when we go to other restaurants. You are not &#34;waited upon,&#34; as other restaurants do. Yes, they bring your plate of food out to you, when you sit down, but that&#39;s that. Maybe you can get refills, but we didn&#39;t ask, and it didn&#39;t seem to be readily available to customers. To be honest, with the amount of people coming in, and the small amount of seating, I felt like we needed to just eat, and get out. 

It was nice, but I&#39;m not sure if we will be back."

It&#39;s easy, casual, fairly priced and most importantly, delicious! You order up front at the counter, they give you a letter and a server takes the food to your table.

The breakfast/brunch menu features an array of skillets (which you can also make into a burrito), sandwiches and soups and salads. My personal favorite is the Sonoma skillet. While the skillets and sandwiches are a must, you&#39;re a FOOL if you don&#39;t get a pastry. I&#39;ve gotten the lemon bar, blueberry bar, birthday cake and macaroons and I was not disappointed - though I will say the birthday cake was a bit heavy for 10 a.m.
Olive &amp; Finch has a full coffee bar, which includes regular drip, Mochas, Macchiatos, Cappuccinos and even Vietnamese coffee, which I definitely recommend if you&#39;re into sweet coffee. If you take your coffee black, I&#39;d avoid it. The only negative thing I have to say about Olive &amp; Finch is that their juices are pretty over-priced for the amount you get. I got a beet juice and kind of wish I just skipped it. 

Check it out if you&#39;re looking for something casual and delicious! You&#39;ll probably see me there."

The place is small. You order at the counter then take a number. There was an uninterested girl taking our order. My boyfriend asked her for an opinion and her answer was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; and then looked back down at the register. She was very unfriendly. 

I ordered the DF. It&#39;s eggs with pulled pork in a skillet. It was swimming in oil. Looked and tasted like vegetable oil. So disgusting. Then my boyfriend got a Cubano sandwich that he  said was mediocre.  He also ordered the blueberry lemonade which was disgustingly sweet. He had to water it down to drink it. 

They forgot to include my fruit salad so I went up to ask for it as all breakfasts either come with a pastry or fruit. I say &#34;isn&#39;t my meal supposed to come with fruit or a pastry&#34; and she says &#34;yeah but you&#39;re gluten free right?&#34; And I say &#34;yes which is why I ordered the fruit&#34; and she goes &#34;oh&#34; and then I say &#34;they didn&#39;t give me any fruit&#34; and she walks away then brings back a bowl of fruit. No apology, super rude and just kind of slow dumb type girl. 

So then the bus girl comes to take our plates and I say &#34;thank you&#34; and she doesn&#39;t even look up. 

THEN we both get super sick. My boyfriends been throwing up for the last hour and that&#39;s the only meal we had today. I&#39;m writing this from the toilet where I&#39;ve been on and off for hours! I called the restaurant to tell them we are sick and the girl says &#34;actually food borne illness doesn&#39;t occur for at least twelve hours&#34;. I say &#34;oh really well we ate at a dinner party last night and no one else got sick and olive and finch is the only meal we ate today&#34; and she&#39;s like &#34;yeah sorry twelve hours&#34; and I&#39;m like &#34;okay weird&#34; and then awkwardly hang up. 

So basically all the employees are unhappy and rude and the food was not good and made us sick."

Everything I have had there has been absolutely delicious - whether it be gluten free or regular. 

I usually have gone later in the evening right before closing time and the gals at the counter have always been super helpful and accommodating. It seems that they have a personal knowledge of the desserts and truly appreciate their opinion! 

A couple of my favorites have been the birthday cake, the gluten free chocolate cake and the gluten free carrot cake. In addition, I have really enjoyed their alfajores - one of my favorite types of cookies. I haven&#39;t had anything that isn&#39;t good here.

I definitely want to come back some time and actually eat a real meal. It just never seems to have been the right time."

That recent visit was on Wednesday January 28th 2015.  Time was about 12:21hrs ish.  Man, because of LUNCH hour, this establishment is packed to the brim!  Hence, both my friend and I decide to order some Desserts TO GO.

From what I could recall we purchased these following items :

*  Double Chocolate Cake ($6.75)
*  Blueberry Cheesecake ($6.25)
*  Lemon Bars ($3.00)
*  Alfajores ($1.25)

My friend like her choice of Alfajores.  As for me, I am OK with the Double Chocolate Cake.  YES, its LOADED with CHOCOLATE that I like, but the cake itself DOES NOT WOW me as much.  Same goes to Hubs when we get the chance to share, the Blueberry Cheesecake and Lemon Bars.  YES, the Blueberry Cheesecake, is in between &#34;light&#34;, NOT too dense in which I prefer &#34;light&#34; cheesecake to begin with.

Hmm..  Now I am torn.  I might return perhaps to have Lunch and from there, perhaps my review might differ.  YES inside is somewhat can be &#34;CRAMPED&#34;, though I cannot deny when weather permits, there are PATIO SEATINGs outside.  The service from the staffs are outstanding!  They deserve 5 stars!

Above anything else, in terms of pricing its &#34;Doable&#34; to some, though some can say, it can be &#34;Pricey&#34; for those SWEET DESSERTS.  All in all, its 3.5 stars in our books.

NOTE TO SELF :  If to return for LUNCH, do come EARLY coz seating inside can be limited.

I was by myself and didn&#39;t want to commit to a busy sit down full service restaurant. The second I looked at the menu, my eyes zeroed in on the Bennett sandwich. It has olive tapenade, spinach, pesto, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and veggies. I appreciated that it wasn&#39;t a salt explosion, especially with the pesto, sun dried tomatoes, and the tapenade. Sometimes those flavors can be overpowering. I got it with gluten free bread--some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. This meal was appreciated by a very hungry and tired traveller who&#39;s going straight to bed after. :)"

We were looking for some place new to have breakfast (On a Sunday at 4PM), and saw that this place had really good reviews and served breakfast all day. Very glad we went in!

The food is amazing! I had the Sunrise, and I enjoyed every bite. It&#39;s a funny thing to say, but the food tasted authentic. Top notch all the way.

We also had some of their desserts and loved them as well.

The best thing about this place though, was that the employees were actually working the entire time.. not on Instagram or on their cellphones... and if they were.. it was out of the view of customers. I think that moreso speaks to customer service these days..but its appreciated.

Will definitely be back soon!"

I&#39;ve dined in for a late breakfast with a girlfriend and her baby and it was just what we were hoping for- a low key vibe with delicious food, and a comfortable environment where it&#39;s easy to hear each other and have a good conversation.

We both ended up ordering the Green Eggs &amp; Sam (I&#39;m a sucker for pesto) and both loved it.  We had the option of a pastry or cup of fruit as a side, and we both chose the cup of fruit.  The pastry case did look quite appetizing though, and one may be in the stars for me in the future.

I also believe it&#39;s important to make a note about the catering.  Olive &amp; Finch was hired to cater a work lunch I attended.  Usually our work lunches are basic, bland, slightly soggy deli sandwiches.  Ick.  Olive &amp; Finch provided a variety of boxed lunches, and I chose a brie sandwich (on the perfect, flour-y roll- you know what I mean?) with some home cooked potato chips and big, soft bakery cookies.  Seriously- a huge step above your typical boxed lunch.

A couple other important notes- you can order curbside pick up if you don&#39;t want to battle the parking situation around 17th Ave and want to take your food to go.  They are also able to make any menu item vegetarian or dairy free if you ask, and can make almost any item gluten free."

The jam jars should come with an attached serving utensil. I&#39;ve seen, on numerous occasions, guests using their already used utensils to dish out jam for themselves.

And a little disclaimer- if you want a burrito made from one of the hashes make sure you specify, also whether you&#39;d prefer fruit or the daily pastry :)


Yum! Enjoy your food!"

Seriously if you&#39;re looking for brunch in Denver look no further. The place is small but has a lot of outside seating. The food is very well platted and the personal skillets give it a nice rustic feel. I recommend getting the Rise and Shine. Nice over easy eggs, arugula, bacon, peppers, garlic aioli all on top of French bread nicely nestled in a small personal cast iron skillet. If you&#39;re into morning alcohol like I am, I also recommend the blueberry lemonade mimosas! Mmm mmm mmm!! Four stars!"

Love the style and ambience of this restaurant. The menu looks appetizing, but I was really disappointed in the food. Maybe my partner and I ordered the wrong dishes? I kept asking myself...why is this not tasting like 4 1/2 stars to me with the high rating of this place on yelp? Why isn&#39;t this tasting like 3 stars to me? 

My partner ordered the chiliquiles special and I ordered Hens Can Crow sandwich. Both had so little flavor...overall I would say the food was bland and uninspiring. 

The chiliquiles were standard black beans, overeasy eggs, and a small portion of pork over a bed of soggy blue tortilla chips. I could have made it at home with less sog.

The Hens Can Crow sandwich was just so bland. The tomato was good and the little bit of pesto was also good...but didn&#39;t elevate the dish enough. I left my half my sandwich at the table. 

The Rise and Shine green juice was delicious but it was $14 for 20 oz. I would expect to pay ten dollars or less. 

With so many good restaurant options, I won&#39;t be back here. I&#39;m so disappointed. :/"

The staff was super helpful and friendly and I love the fact that you order at the counter and then sit down to wait for your food. 

I got a DIY sandwich with turkey on gluten free bread and it was HUGE! The chimichurri sauce is freaking fantastic (spicy!) and that sandwich was delicious. I will definitely be heading back there to try some of the sandwiches they already have on the menu.

I also got a gluten free peanut butter cookie and...YUM. It was very moist and had peanuts in it, couldn&#39;t even tell it wasn&#39;t made with wheat!

The ground beef has lots of flavor! Instead of just browning ground up beef they season this finely ground beef  liberally with traditional Mexican spices.    

I recently had the reasonably priced combination number five which comes with a seasoned beef burrito, a cheese enchilada and i ordered the relleno crispy. Yum!

Had the king cut prime rib, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Added the lobster trail, epic. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were good, not great but tasty. The brussle sprouts were really good. I don&#39;t drink wine, but the wine our waiter suggested and gave us a sample of was out of this world. It was a California Pino and very tasty. They key lime pie, epic. 
Our waiter, Donald, was a true master of his craft. He knew the menu, how everything was made and was all around a great person.

Pre-dinner bread was jalapeño corn bread with honey butter. The bread was sweet, but not overwhelming where you feel like you&#39;re ending your meal; I felt like I was actually working up quite an appetite. For starters, I got a kale salad topped with strawberries, grapes, and pecans, doused with a balsamic vinaigrette. Then I got the 20 oz porterhouse to share, medium rare, with a side of brussel sprouts and pancetta. The edges of the steak were cooked more closely to medium and the bone was medium rare, which is what I was expecting, so it was cooked to my liking. The steak was juicy, flavorful, and just a delight! 

To make our meal even better, our server was extremely friendly and attentive. We had made reservations for 10, but there were only 8 of us. Our server still accommodated and did not make a fuss about it at all. At the end of the meal, she even brought out the cake that I had brought in with lighted candles, which I did not provide, without us even asking her to. 

Great meal, great time. Definitely will be going back again."

Service is decent but I&#39;ve had better. 
My main complaint is the valet. 
I usually valet at dinner but at lunch I park on the street at as $8 at lunch for valet is simply outrageous. They basically make you valet at lunch or hunt you down like a dog and embarrass you in front of clients or whoever your with to get your keys. I couldn&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t address it with me privately vs basically take my keys or tow me. Simply awful customer care. Not sure I&#39;m coming back. Many other nice places to choose."

We split the bone-in Rib Eye Steak. WOW! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! It was cooked to our request. My husband had the mashed potatoes, and I had the baked potato. WOW! All of our food was EXCELLENT! I am so glad we split the Rib Eye Steak. It was way more than enough for two people to split. If you don&#39;t split this, than definitely count on getting two meals out of it, that is, unless you haven&#39;t eaten in several days. 

For starters, we also split a spinach/strawberry/apple salad, which was excellent as well. It was a nice way to start our meal. Nope, no dessert for us, as we were absolutely stuffed. Oh, we did have the complimentary skillet cornbread too, at the start of the meal, before the salad, but only ate half of it. 

Interior - dark (it&#39;s hard to see the menu, and I saw several people using their cell phones to shed some light on their menus), intimate, definitely a place to impress someone, whether that be your significant other-to-be, a potential client, potential in-laws, you get the picture. Elegant, charming, and, well, just IMPRESSIVE! There are booths and individual tables as well. The interior is larger than I first thought. When I walked to the restroom, the restaurant goes on and on, in the back, and there is a large room or two in the back, which can be reserved for larger groups, etc.  Good idea.

Service is WOW! Nothing, absolutely NOTHING, needs to be improved upon in the service area. Management has done a fabulous job with their entire staff.

Parking - use the valet service, as it&#39;s hard to park around there. 

This restaurant is definitely a 5-star, so count on spending some big bucks when you go, but again, it&#39;s so worth it!  Also count on spending time there, meaning at least an hour or so, when you go, so don&#39;t be in a rush. 

I don&#39;t know what else to say, as it was all perfect! IMPRESSIVE!"

Dark wood, low lighting, and most windows/natural light blocked. Perfect for curling up with a whiskey and a steak,  but it felt like an odd juxtaposition to the ball park, blue sky, and warm late summer temperatures just outside. 

The food was delicious and the service was incredibly accommodating. 

To be fair, I am a vegetarian and have nothing to say about their steaks, but the grilled veggies, mashed potatoes, corn bread, and salad I had were delicious."

I loved that they offered  larger portions and smaller portions- perfect for someone like me who likes to eat more smaller meals a day. 
I got the chicken and waffles and it did NOT dissapoint. Not only were the waffles rich in flavor, they give you a trio of dips to dip them in! Enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and savory tooth.

Where have you been all my life? We stopped in late around 9:30pm on a Saturday and got seated right away with no reservations. The restaurant and bar area looked completely full so we got lucky not having to wait for a table. If you are dining earlier in the evening I would suggest making reservations. 

Right as we sat down our waiter came over and asked us about drinks. I ordered a dirty vodka martini and he ordered the IPA our server suggested. There was a little bit of a lag time on drink delivery but no big deal. We decided to order a couple dishes and share as per usual. Started off with the grilled portobello mushroom, this was probably the best mushroom I&#39;ve had to date. An excellent appetizer. Then we shared a wedge salad and they were nice enough to split it up for us. We had the prime rib medium rare, again they split this up for us which is nice. It was cooked perfectly. We were completely stuffed but couldn&#39;t pass up dessert. The b52 cake sounded like a great end to our meal, and believe me it was."

Sat in the bar area and definitely ate great food. My only issue was that it took a while to get drinks and order food. However, I think service was possibly affected because it looked like they had at least 2 large parties in the back room. 

I would definitely recommend it to friends for the food. I had the Seafood Cobb Salad and it came with lots of lobster and shrimp, which was awesome and overall the dish was delicious! I also had the Garden Mule cocktail and I could have drank that for the rest of the night. The cucumbers and blueberries were a nice twist on my favorite drink."

It feels like a small, authentic old school steakhouse. I loved the dark wood and lowly-lit atmosphere. They have a really good happy hour - specialty cocktails are marked down to $7 I believe, glasses of wine are $5ish and pints of their draft beer are $3.50. And the HH food menu is good too - we got an ample cheese plate for around $8-9. Their house-brewed beers are delightful, and taking home a growler will set you back around only $10 including the growler itself. Great deal! The bartenders were professional and helpful as well.

This was a special occasion for us. Our first visit in Denver from family!    I was not impressed with the Yelp reviews but after conferring with other yelpers we decided on this place, and it&#39;s right around the corner from our place so how could it go wrong?

The atmosphere was perfect. Dark wood, dim lighting, intimate booths, bustling but not roudy.  Classic tunes and classic photos on the walls. The service was professionally executed. Drinks were great...try the One Martini!  The standard cornbread was disappointing to say the least...soggy, lacking texture and flavor. Simple good warm bread would&#39;ve been our preference. Wedge salad was ample. Calamari was cooked properly but served with some odd sauces. The Kansas dry aged strip was delicious and on the latgve side. I recommend rare-medium rare. Cheddar mashed could possibly have been the highlight for me. 

This place is pricey and the valet is not complimentary. I recommend the happy hour over the dinner service. Just a better deal. For the price, I just don&#39;t think the quality is here. There are plenty other better high-end restaurants in the area. Sorry guys. I&#39;m being honest. I will be back. Make me change my mind please....I really want to love this place!

Their corn bread was good so we were both expecting fresh, juicy steak.  Unfortunately, both of our steaks were not fresh at all (ended up returning our steak and got salmon).  With the price that they charge... I was expecting way better quality meat than Dennis.  It seems like even Dennis serves fresher meat than here.

The meal was good and of a decent size.  I had a green salad as a starter. My entrée was their nightly special: halibut on a crisp bed of risotto with gazpacho. I especially enjoyed the risotto.  My only complaint was the gazpacho had too much raw garlic and I could taste it hours later.  Grand marinier crème bruleé for dessert.  Nice flavor.  Also, before the entrée was brought out, they gave us complimentary jalapeño corn bread, which my friend brought home. To drink, I had their yummy pale ale. Their rye ale is also pretty good.

Nice all-American, classy steakhouse atmosphere with dim romantic lighting, leather booths, high ceilings, etc.

I also had a member of my party who ordered the sirloin which was severely over cooked. The waitress apologize and said another sirloin would be on the grill. When that sirloin came to the table it was severely under cooked. Basically this steak was grilled and the center was entirely rare.

Funnily enough, I always enjoy ordering fish, especially salmon at steakhouses...they usually know how to sear the outside to seal in the juices &amp; natural flavor without overcooking it, just like cooking a steak. Loved the Citrus salmon (menu description:With haricot verts, citrus glaze, oven roasted orange slices and orange beurre blanc.)...I asked for the sauce on the side.

We had a reservation, but the table wasn&#39;t ready when we arrived.  We all headed to the bar and grabbed a pint of their brews.  I had the Red Ale and was a big fan.  The host of our party is a Bud Light drinker, and they didn&#39;t carry that.  The server suggested the Pilsner.  I really like that.  Can&#39;t stand when people go to a tap house or a brewery and get a cheap watered-down beer like Bud Light.

Anyways..  We got the calamari and the spinach dip as an appetizer.  The calamari was great.  Good texture and the sauce was tasty.  It was a big small for 6 people to share.  Each person got 3-4 rings.  The dip was pretty standard, nothing special.  It came with grilled pita (I think) to dip in it.  I was a fan of that.

I got the 8 ounce filet, medium rare.  It came out medium, oh well.  I&#39;m not that picky.  I opted to not get one of the 4 dressings; I prefer the taste of the steak instead of a sauce.  I got the mashed potatoes on the side.  The potatoes needed either more butter, or some gravy.  They were pretty dry.  Those were the only things my group didn&#39;t finish.

All in all, a good experience."

We were in town for the weekend and this restaurant had been one of my brother&#39;s favorite. It was special occasion for the family since his passing. The restaurant ambiance was spectacular. We were seated immediately as we had a reservation.The service was extremely slow from start to finish. The food wasn&#39;t what we had expected. The special fish of the day wasn&#39;t flavorful. The steaks were okay nothing spectacular for the price. The restaurant was clean, staff was friendly and the location was right in the heart of Denver which made it a great.
I would recommend the restaurant to friends just for the location and ambiance not for the service or food. I don&#39;t think we will return."

Pairs really well with a glass of their Woodford Reserve Bourbon Stout. Usually go before a Rockies game. Nice and filling and at 7.5% abv on the stout it will save you some money inside the park on extra beers. If you don&#39;t like stouts get the Impertinent Pale Ale at about the same ABV. Still goes well with the tenderloin tips.

We were greeted by a kind hostess, who said our reservation wasn&#39;t quite ready (we arrived early), so take a seat at the bar. The bartender did a fine job on drinks, although I asked for a martini with plain olives and she gave me bleu cheese stuffed ones. My husband ordered a Gibson and got a martini with a twist. But it all worked out in the end after some simple fixes. 

We sat down on a nice booth, and could watch the Rockies fans pass by. 

We ordered the pancetta wrapped shrimp and the wedge salad to start. Both were very good. The dressing on the salad wasn&#39;t as good as some others, but still satisfying. 

For the main courses, the four of us chief down on prime rib, New York strip, porterhouse and Rib eye. All were mouth watering good - cooked perfectly, tender, and better with each bite.

I&#39;m not sure I can call myself a true Denver-ite without visiting this downtown staple at least once, so here I go. 

I ordered the catch of the day: Seared Ahi with wild rice.The ahi tuna was a great cut and seared to perfection. Really delicious main course there. 

However the wild rice was misleading. Fresh off a recent visit to Minnesota (the wild rice capital of the country) I was excited and hopeful for a giant black mound of delicious lake fresh rice. What I got was almost entirely white rice with just a couple of black wild rice kernels mixed in. I know wild rice is pricey on its own, so to see them dilute the batch with plain old rice felt cheap for a place like this. 

I also got a cheese plate appetizer which wasn&#39;t all that memorable for my tastes. 

We received excellent service from a very knowledgeable and friendly waitress. Definite high marks there, although at this price point it&#39;s somewhat expected. 

Overall, it was a very good meal with a few complaints. But I couldn&#39;t help leaving with the overwhelming feeling that you&#39;re paying for the location and to say you were there. I&#39;d be back, just without high expectations."

Steaks were cooked well, just not a great meal for the high $$ paid with Mortons and The Keg nearby. 
Service was horrible. Rarely saw the waiter; dropped menus and wanted to take meal order along with drink order. Asked more than once for bread. Saw the waiter again when he dropped dessert menus and check. Four times for a $60 tip, not bad work if u can get it. Busboys came by often."

We made a reservation for 7pm on a Saturday, so I was expecting even a wait with the reservation, but surprisingly we didn&#39;t even get through a single glass of wine before being called to our table. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was exactly what I would expect from a chophouse...dim lighting, intimate and quiet seating. Our server was excellent as well...I forget her name, but super sweet blonde girl from the Midwest.  If her boss is reading this, she deserves a raise!

Now for the highlight of the evening... the FOOD!

For starters we each ordered french onion soup, and split the lobster &amp; asparagus mac as a table. The soup was great, although I&#39;ve never experienced a bad french onion at a good restaurant. The lobster mac however, was out of this world!  Seriously, I am going to be dreaming of this stuff for months!  The sweetness of the lobster and Gruyere was so perfectly balanced with with tanginess of the fontina and asparagus. And as if it couldn&#39;t get any better... bacon. 

For the main course we each ordered our steak of choice. My personal preference is a New York Strip, and I opted for the Stockyards Angus center-cut over the standard. The meat itself was one of the most flavorful and tender steaks that I&#39;ve had, and the chef cooked it to a perfect medium rare. I also selected the Gorgonzola preparation for my steak... If you come here, DO IT.  Holy moly it was good. I also ordered the brussels sprouts as my side and they were buttery and mild, exactly how I like them!

The restaurant also sent me a slice of key lime pie on the house since the evening was a special occasion. Usually restaurants only do this for birthdays and anniversaries so I was very surprised. I was so good that we were able to finish it, even though we were stuffed from our dinners!"

Don&#39;t just think of them for dinner, though, they have one of the best happy hours in town, with fantastic food specials and discounted beer, wine, and martinis (that can be had with hand-stuffed blue cheese olives!).

Their happy hour is a great deal but if want to sit in the bar get their early because it starts at four and fills up quickly. If you prefer a quieter atmosphere ask for a booth in the back. Their creme brulet is very good and Oscar style is to-die! Although you can&#39;t have enough crab. Their cappuccinos could be a bit better because they aren&#39;t served in a traditional cappuccino cup but that is small details compared to the pluses. Their Caesar salad is very fresh and I ALWAYS prefer the lamb as anyone knows that has read my other reviews. If you like martinis try &#34;the geisha&#34; and every beer is worth a try."

I had the sirloin salad and it was great. My friend had the salmon which he raved about. We shared a side of sweet potato fries. For dessert, we shared the brownie.

They brought out this horrible green chile cornbread, bland, tough, and kind of cold. My boyfriend and I both had a steak meal, once again, bland and not even cooked correctly.

For a starter, we decided on the cheese and charcuterie board, proudly placed at the top center of their menu. The meats were delicious but what really shone was the selection of cheeses. In particular, the goat feta was creamy and wonderful. their steak selection was impressive as well, offering a nice varied selection of cuts and several different methods of preparation for each of them. We both decided to get the 12oz NY strip cut, with no special preparations. The steaks were prepared perfectly with just the basic oil/salt/pepper seasoning. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t get a special preparation, because the steak itself was too delicious to eat with anything else on it. Our server Jake was very good as well. He was polite and very knowledgeable when we asked questions about items on the menu. He managed to make someone back in the kitchen like us too, because we were given  some green chile corn bread and our choice of a free dessert! All in all, it was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back. I almost gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 because of the admittedly strange selection of music, but it wasn&#39;t too loud and we had to remind ourselves that it was also a bar/brewery, not just a fancy restaurant. Definitely worth a try if you have a couple bucks to spend and are looking for a good cut of dead animal.

Addendum: Unfortunately we didn&#39;t try the in-house brewed beer and instead opted for a bottle of wine, but we will try the beer next time!"

I love lamb and when I saw grilled lamb chops on the menu, I trusted the chophouse to do them well. I made a bad call. I may have been served three chops, but they were tough and chewy. 

I will tell you the rest of my group who ordered steaks and prime rib were extremely pleased with their meals. The two Prime Rib dinners were both done rare and according to the diners, were mouthwatering tender.  Those who ordered the New York Strip, couldn&#39;t stop raving. Also, the cousin who ordered the Salmon was pleased as well.

I also learned, not to order the traditional baked potato here. It may have been huge, but there was nothing special about it. The special potatoes were the White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes. Everyone else at the table ordered them and could not shovel them fast enough  in to their eager mouths. 

Our table ordered two of the salads and everyone was pleased with their choice. 
We experienced the Chophouse Chop Salad and the traditional Caesar Salad. I will say, the Caesar was probably the best Caesar I have ever had. 

Ambiance and service is top notch. My recommendation is when at a steakhouse, order steak and do not make the mistake I did."

The beer was great, the appetizer was great and I would go back strictly for the beer. When going to a streak house I would expect a ribeye steak to be properly seared. The steak tasted like it was warmed in a microwave, the cut was good but the cooking method was not. Very disappointed in the steak."

Warning: if you come during happy hour aiming to seat two+ people, there is about a 90% chance you&#39;ll have to wait and snipe some seats. The layout is not quite optimized and a number of the bar tables only seat two or three in a pinch. If you are reluctant to be &#34;that guy&#34; - you know, the one who does a lap to see who might be leaving soon and then perches at the end of the bar like some sort of alcoholic vulture - then prepare to go hungry/thirsty. Because &#34;that guy&#34; will totes steal your seat, bro. TOTES.

When you do manage to sit down, things will sail along. The staff is friendly and fast and the happy hour menu has just enough depth to stay interesting after multiple visits. The burger special is hard to beat, but beware: the extra juicy patty has the tendency to saturate the bottom bun. Nobody will judge you for attacking that bad boy with a knife and fork. Calamari also makes the list of good deals, and most of the others are honorable mentions at least.

The beer is...okay. There&#39;s a reason &#34;Chophouse&#34; comes before &#34;Brewery&#34; in the restaurant&#39;s title. To their credit none of the beer I tried was bad, but you won&#39;t find a lot of stand-outs that make you wish they sold growlers of the stuff. I find their bourbon stout to be more robust and complex than most of the other stuff they have on tap, so start there if you like the richer stuff.

The atmosphere is the middle-upper level of ritziness that reminds you it&#39;s also a steak joint, but the giant brewing vats behind the bar bring it back down to earth. 

As a final note to all the faithful/patient who have gotten this far, BE SURE TO CHECK IN. They have a &#34;one free beer with check in&#34; deal that&#39;s unusual-but-welcome for a restaurant of this caliber."

You can get a big juicy hamburger, spicy Gouda mac and cheese, salmon burger, brisket, or fresh grilled chicken. 

I had the Peter Forsburger which came with bacon, mushrooms, cheese and onions. Of course I made it a combo with fries and a drink (which I saved for later because I already had a beer). It took a while to get and when it was delivered they gave me a pile of napkins. The burger was so juicy I needed all of the napkins. The onions and mushrooms were cooked just perfect and the cheese covered the whole burger. The bacon was thick and plentiful. I could barely put it down to drink my beer. This was the best burger I have ever had and the value was ridiculous.  For $12 I was stuffed and I can eat a lot. Someone next to us had the chili fries and they looked and smelled phenomenal. 

The service was great too. When you order they joke around and they chat with you when they deliver your food.  They even came around and asked how it was and if they could make any improvements. There are no improvements to be made, you have one hell of a burger.

I&#39;d been dying to try them for months and if definitely lived up to the hype. I ordered a burger and garlic fries and the meal was on point.

The burger is the best burger I&#39;ve ever had from a food truck. It&#39;s thick and well-seasoned. The bacon and cheese were tremendous and the whole burger worked together.

The fries were good but not as much as the burger. Definitely enjoyable, but I prefer my fries in garlic rather than just lightly coated in it. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauce that came along with it. Was a little strong and citrusy for my taste.

My colleague and I were so impressed we worked to assemble a crowd for their next scheduled appearance at our building. And they didn&#39;t show, even though it was on their calendar. And they didn&#39;t show again and again. And they tend to not show at Civic Center either. 

But it doesn&#39;t matter, because even when I have found them (today, and one day at a different building where they were not scheduled to be) the food has not been great. They say medium-rare, then cook burgers well-done. Still, they somehow serve them cold! A well-done burger served cold on a hot day. I&#39;m not even sure how that is possible. The first fries they had were great. Today&#39;s were fried in oil that was either some strange formulation or quite possibly, rancid.

This place could be great. The concept and menu are excellent. But aside from my first visit the execution is amateur, lazy, or some combination. Barring a turnaround, Hamburghini will only realize its potential in my dreams."
hamburghini-denver,Mackenzie M.,Hv84gNnKKUCv82k1pH4O6w,"Aurora, CO",0,1,0,108,203,7UZXJJ72izyN06NoLCmCgQ,1.0,2016-09-27,"My fiancé and I hired Ronnie and the Hamborghini crew to cater our wedding and we were very excited because we really enjoyed the burgers off of his truck. However, our experience with his service was absolutely abysmal. 

First, we attempted to have him send us a contract and/or a formal proposal so that we could all sign it. What was sent instead was a one line email that said &#34;this is the contract between [us and you- names redacted].&#34; He never sent us anything else after repeated requests on our part to get a contract and/or proposal which is standard across the board as every other caterer we contacted had no issues with giving us either of those items. 

Second, we discussed a price point that my fiancé and I were comfortable with. We discussed a menu that we were also happy with. About a month later (2 weeks prior to our wedding) he stated that the cost was going to be almost double what we had previously discussed. He never stated to us that the menu that we agreed upon was going to be as expensive as he later claimed it would be, which he should have informed us of immediately so that we would have had time to adjust. He also flat out refused to tell us how much each menu item would cost per person and implied that we were not allowed to change the menu. We asked him three separate times for the price of each item per person. We also had to ask multiple times for him to send us the menu we discussed with him only to receive it three weeks after the LAST time we asked for it (not the first). 

Third, he was incredibly rude to our coordinator. He was set to meet myself and our coordinator at the place that we were renting some items from (which my fiancé confirmed the date, time, and location with him), and he never showed up nor did he answer any of my phone calls/text messages. He then proceeded to call my coordinator a crappy business owner because she didn&#39;t call to remind him of the meeting (which, again, my fiancé had previously confirmed with him). So I guess it&#39;s my coordinator&#39;s job to remind him of all of his meetings? He also claimed that she was unavailable to talk to him whenever he contacted her and failed to mention that when he did contact her she was busy working 3 weddings in one weekend. 

Finally, and perhaps most horrendously, he canceled on us ELEVEN DAYS prior to our wedding over TEXT MESSAGE. No phone call or anything. Just a text stating that they were not going to go forward with our wedding and essentially blaming everything on our coordinator.  

I&#39;ve worked in customer service before. I have had poor customer service experiences before as well. I have never, however, had one this bad.  I understand that sometimes the customer is not always right, however, I don&#39;t think that my fiancé and I did anything to warrant the poor service we received from him and his crew. Were his burgers good? Yes. That&#39;s what attracted us to him. Would I recommend him to anyone else looking to have an event catered? Not if they were the last food truck on earth. 

***Update*** He has now threatened us over text message saying to my fiancé &#34;so your the better man but your wife decides to bash us on social media. Mite I remind you that you too have social media [referring to my fiancé&#39;s real estate page]. I suggest you ask her to remove that comment you made. Better be the better man like you say...&#34; 

So I guess now he is going to retaliate against me for sharing our experience on Yelp...which, last time I checked, is a forum for sharing professional experiences, which is exactly what I did. And given the fact that he&#39;s never utilized my fiancé as a real estate agent, anything he has to say about my fiancé on his real estate page will be completely and undeniably not credible. 

***2nd Update***: Ronnie threatened my (now husband) AGAIN over text message and then via phone call and even went as far as to call the real estate brokerage where my husband works and ILLEGALLY MASQUERADED AS A CLIENT of my husbands (which was never the case) and laid false claims about him which never occurred. We had to have our attorney write a cease and desist letter to him because of his continued harassment. No one in their right mind should EVER do business with these people. Ever."

I was the first one to order after they opened, so maybe they left it on the grill a bit longer to get 3 burgers out of the pickup window at once. This was disappointing, but it was not the worst thing in the world.

What is inexcusable is the fact that they left the wax sheet on the slice of cheddar. I bit into it and realized I had this wad of wax paper in my mouth. Not a pleasant experience, and a terrible oversight. After paying $12 for a burger, I&#39;d expect for it to come back to my standards which are not ridiculously high. With these mistakes, I&#39;d sooner go to a 5 guys than go back here.

They were professional enough to offer me another burger when I explained their mishap. This gave one additional redeeming star, but after all that had happened, I just gave the 2nd burger to a colleague because I simply lost my appetite after having a wad of wax paper in my mouth."

Price: Burgers a la carte run around $7-9. As a combo (with a massive amount of fries + drink) add $2-3. I have never, ever been to a food truck spending less than $15 on a drink, a side, and an entree. This is bomb.com.

Taste: Ok, you&#39;re going to a food truck with a burger-specialty and you order a chicken burger? What were you thinking? Well, I was starting to have buyers remorse as my coworkers asked this of me as we waited for our made-to-order burgers. I really wanted not to feel to bloated because I knew I&#39;d be eating like a monster the next day on Spring Break. But I hung in there and got my chicken burger. (It&#39;s called the &#34;Great One&#34; btw). This burger was top notch. Honestly, what scares most people away from this kind of burger is that a chicken patty is ground chicken. Here it is &#34;lightly ground&#34; -- so there&#39;s still a texture of juicy chicken thigh.  It was piled high with super yummy veggies (sprouts, avocado, sliced cucumbers, etc.). Probably the best chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  The bread is thick (which is generally a turn off) but was wonderfully airy and light...and moist. Definitely added to the yumminess.

My only issue was with the wait. 12 minutes for my burger...but then again it&#39;s made to order. I&#39;m sure this would be easily fixed if there were 1 or 2 other line cooks in the truck.  

Overall, awesome. Come back, come back!!!"

Holy crap, this was the best burger I have had in some time. And I eat my fair share of burgers. 

Meat, cooked perfectly, juicy, well seasoned, etc.  Bun, crispy shell, yet fluffy inside where it counts. Pork belly was fantastic. Onion ring was cooked perfect as well. (you would be amazed at how many people destroy onion rings in this state.) 

And finally, the fries. It&#39;s about time that someone cooked fries to perfection. Seasoned just right, not over spiced like most out here. Clean and bright...like how fries were meant to be. 

This will be a truck that I will follow forever."

But in a city full of phenomenal restaurant choices and foodies like myself I must admit I was blown away by Hamborghini!!!

The owner/chef Ronnie Orr personally suggested &#34;The Hab Burger&#34; and a side of sweet potato fries topped with Sriracha mayo. When my order arrived I immediately noticed the fresh bun, thick patty and those sweet potato fries. 

What an amazing blend of flavors and textures in one bite of the burger. The Sriracha mayo was the perfect amount of heat to compliment the sweet and savory fries. 

I would definitely recommend you follow the Hamborghini truck on Facebook to see when it will be in your neighborhood."

When I got in line, we were informed that they weren&#39;t taking anymore orders at that time, as they were overwhelmed. Finally, about 20 minutes later, they started taking orders again. 

I went to order and asked for a burger with bacon and cheese only for my husband. The guy shot me a dirty look. Then I asked for a hamburger patty (since I don&#39;t eat the bun) and in a super rude tone, he told me to go to Burger King if I wanted it my way. I was a little taken aback by that comment. Now, remember, this was at a GYM opening. Most of those people don&#39;t want the bread, as they are doing paleo and/or just don&#39;t want the carbs. He then told me I couldn&#39;t have a plain hamburger patty, cause the burger was already stuffed with cheese. Ok, fine. At that point, I was hungry, so I didn&#39;t care. 

I got my number and then waited about 15 minutes for the food. I gave my husband the number, cause at this point, I didn&#39;t wanna talk to the guy anymore for fear of more nasty comments. Of course, my husband went inside to get a drink and the guy in the truck started to yell out numbers, I didn&#39;t know mine, since I didn&#39;t have it with me. So I asked if that was my order. I got a snippy &#34;WELL, WHERE&#39;S YOUR NUMBER?!&#34; from him. Never in my life have I been treated so rudely before. I was even afraid to ask for ketchup for fear of what other rude comments he would make to me, so I asked my husband to get some for me.

I&#39;ll admit though, the burger was very tasty after I tossed the bun and peeled the cheese off the top. But the attitude I received was unacceptable and downright hurtful. The other people in line behind me were shocked at how mean the guy was. Not only to me, but others as well."

I tried their Salmon burger, which came with fries. The first bite of the burger tasted similar to cold slaw. Maybe one end just had more mayo than the other... nope... the whole thing tasted like cold slaw. Also, the burger was very dry. Their fries were pretty soggy and luke warm. Maybe that&#39;s how their made at the truck or maybe I just got a bad batch of both fries and the burger.

Somewhat disappointed and even more disappointed after reading all the reviews here. I&#39;m not sure how this place got 5 stars and I can definitely see a conflict of interest with some of the reviews. Half of these reviews are probably from friends of this food truck and a lot of these reviews are from users who:
1. do not have a profile pic
2. have 0 yelp friends
3. have only written 1 or 2 reviews."

Thoughts: Really nice blue cheese and buffalo sauce burger. I was hesitant at first because blue cheese burgers can be pretty overwhelming. When I asked how cheesy the burger is, they told me &#34;very&#34; but then followed it up by saying they stuff the cheese in the patty. To me that meant that the cheesiness would be toned down a bit due to being mixed in with the meat. I was right. The blue cheese taste was very mild. The fixings and bun all came together nicely, though it is quite messy. Was not a big fan of the fries though. They sit more on the In n Out spectrum, being more &#34;natural&#34;and soggy rather than fatty and crispy 

-1 star because the burgers take quite a while to come out. I waited 20+ minutes, which i suppose isn&#39;t that bad considering cooking time etc, but I waited to order for a good 5 minutes before even being acknowledged."

I could not wait to get on my lunch break and check them out. I was reading reviews and I had heared they had siracha mayo and so I was bound to get THAT burger. The guy informed me that I had the wrong burger in mind and asked me what my spice level was. I told him that I had eaten the worlds hottest pepper with no problem so je stopped me and said he had just the thing for me. His co worker asked if I like bacon and I promptly replied that I adored it. Few minuets later I had this massive burger that was the best damn burger ive ever had. He told me if I hated it to.let him know and hed hook me up. How cool is that. But I adored it. It was spicy gouda cheese on a huge medium rare burger with avacado and bacon all on what seemed to be a fresh baked bun. I have never recived such amazing customer service... like ever. Ive always been told that word of mouth is best advertisement and let me tell you I would reccomend it to anyone. Theyve earned my permanant buisness. Plus they look like they love what they do and they bump it to some pretty good jams. Im so glad I had the oppurtunity to dine with them and I will surley be back for more. 10/10 100%

I ordered garlic fries as a combo and my friend who was with me nearly ate all of them !!! The fries are to die for. We went back to the truck to rder some more GARLIC FRIES to take home with us..

We were walking around seeing all the trucks at our food truck night in granada hills and then we see the Hamborghini truck. First of all the name was interesting , and I liked how they had their menu off the truck so you don&#39;t feel bad if you don&#39;t order off of them. We got the sweet hangz burger and made it a combo with garlic fries. The burger and fries combo at first glance was amazing, a nice sized burger and good amount of fries. I loved the bun on the burger because it was so soft and held up all the toppings of the burger well. The fries had a garlic aoli and I was hesitant to try because garlic is such an over powering flavor but it was very delicious only thing I would add to the fries would be parm but other then that it was delicious and would be there again (:"

Firstly, I waited more than 20 minutes (they were not busy) but the real problem was the food.  The minced garlic on the fries was burned and very bitter, making the fries inedible.  The burger was NOT cooked medium as ordered, was lukewarm and oddly tasteless, as it was adorned with bacon and cheddar.  I would have spoken with the owner, but when I finally got my food there were customers in line, so it was not the correct time to ask for a refund or complain.  Still, I will not give this truck a second chance!"

The line to order was long, but we didn&#39;t mind waiting. The wait for the food, however, was ridiculous. They use fresh, high quality ingredients, certainly a plus. My burger was fine, but my husband&#39;s was RAW; seared on the outside, but not even rare on the inside. RAW. Totally inedible. Given the wait we&#39;d had to get it in the first place, it wasn&#39;t worth trying to send it back to the grill. Very disappointing."

I am so serious, my boyfriend is a burger fanatic, next time we are out in the valley I am going to surprise him and take him on a lunch truck date, it will blow his mind and be so much fun!

Especially when it&#39;s at a place that prides its self on that brunch staple: BACON! So my partner in crime made reservations for 11:30 am on Saturday and off to the Berkshire we went!

The Drinks: Us girls chose to sip on a couple Berk Bloody. While the $12 price tag was daunting, it was well worth it. We chose to get the jalapeno infused vodka which made it a great mixture of savory, salty, and spicy! Yum! Of course it came garnished with none other than a strip of bacon. It also came with a beer back of 90 Shilling by Odell which was a nice treat! Our boys ordered mixed drinks and local beers which is pretty standard for them.

The Food: My BF and I are pretty big benedict fans. So naturally he ordered the Berkshire Benedict. I ordered the Pulled Pork Benedict. Mine was such a terrific mixture of flavors! It was Pulled pork on what I&#39;m thinking was a bread pudding, with pico de gallo, poached eggs, and a spicy queso. Def a fan! Both came with home fries. While they didn&#39;t have a ton of seasoning; they were fried up perfectly. Our friends ordered a veggie omelette (with a side of bacon, because you know, bacon), and the bacon pancakes. Both looked pretty darn tasty too!

The Service: Our server was patient with us since we were too busy catching up to browse the menu. After taking our drink order and bringing those out; we didn&#39;t see her again until we got our check. A different server brought out our meals and yet another person bused the table. Kinda strange, but not a big deal.

The Space: A little strange. There was more than enough space but it was laid out a little off. I can&#39;t tell if it just wasn&#39;t used well or what. It felt a bit like there was one too many tables to fit them all filled comfortably inside. It was also a bit louder than I anticipated too. They have two decently sized patios on different sides of the building. So when one is sunny, the other is shady. Clever!

I def look forward to my next meal experience here at The Berkshire; whether it&#39;s brunch, lunch, or even dinner! They have a wide range of pork infused fare for even the most picky of diners."

It&#39;s no secret that I love bacon. So when the opportunity presented itself to try a new place with friends for brunch (that wasn&#39;t entirely too far away for everyone!) I made reso&#39;s at The Berkshire.

DRINKS: Despite it&#39;s $12 price tag, the Berkshire Bloody was beyond delicious and HUGE! My favorite part is it comes with a beer back! It was spicy, hot and perfect. The boys ordered local brews and mixed drinks -which seemed to hit the spot.

FOOD: SO good! I love the bacon theme - which i gladly took part in. Although i opted for a veggie heavy omlette, i ordered a side of bacon and was not disappointed. My hubby opted for the bacon pancakes  - which were unique and delicious! Our guests noshed on a variety of Benedict&#39;s, which also looked and tasted great! It did take quite some time to get our food - but i won&#39;t hold that against them!

ATMOSPHERE: Laid back, relaxed, all cool - and just chill. Anyone who is anyone is trying out the food, gathering with family for a brunch or simply coming over for a quick bite after yoga. So many different people, all there for the same purpose! BACON!

SPACE: Kind of small and awkward, but fit everyone just fine. Their patio has room on both sides of the restaurant and seemed to fill up as we ate.

SERVICE: eh. not the best, but not the worst. our server was very nice, friendly and complimentary of the food we ordered, but we rarely saw her. In fact, she only brought our drinks and check - while others delivered our food, filled our water and cleared our plates. I can understand if you&#39;re busy, but Saturday Brunch was far from that - shockingly enough.

Although we noshed for brunch, The Berkshire offers lunch and  dinner options as well! I look forward to my return!"

I come early in the morning, and therefore, I never have any real issues getting seated which is awesome, host/servers are usually all pretty kool people. (Thank you for that)

I&#39;m trying to eat lighter so I ordered the veggie omelet which I&#39;ve had here before. Omelet in the past has always been pretty good. I always have been partial to this plate when dieting because it&#39;s light, healthy, but comes with this AMAZING spinach cream sauce, probably not the healthiest, but damn it taste so good, and makes me feel like I&#39;m not just eating vegetables inside of an omelet. 

Today, I ordered the VEGGIE omelet and was brought a side of PORK GREEN CHILI (the irony) I was then informed that they had made a menu change and that they were no longer offering the spinach cream sauce. KILLED my appetite. Meal was definitely not the same, and left me wanting. The Omelet tasted like egg (not cooked thoroughly enough on the inside) and vegetables. Bland as hell! I had to use my non Veggie Pork green chili just to consume the damn thing. 

My girl however, she ordered the Cheesy tater tots and they were looking incredible, and unhealthy (for me at least) as usual. 

Not sure what the reason was for the &#34;Menu Change&#34;, but &#34;Dammit if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it!&#34;"

We ordered our mimosas and food and sat for 40 minutes waiting patiently-distracted by the mimosas.  Finally, our waited brought out 2/3 of the meals we ordered..okay...they should bring mine out shortly, right? Wrong.  I sat for another 15 minutes while my friends tried to wait but couldn&#39;t due to the 40 minute wait prior for their food.  I asked the manager finally, and he immediately brought out my dish.  The reason I am rating a 3 instead of a 1 is simply because the food was good.  The bacon? Great.  

I had the fritatta, it was small in size but tasty to eat.  Not sure if I would wait an hour again for a meal that didn&#39;t fill my stomach.  

Interested in this place? Maybe wait until they smooth out the dynamics, they have great food but just need the logistics to match.

I stumbled upon this deal one morning after going to the Stapleton Farmer&#39;s Market. I had heard of the Berk, but this was my first time in. After glancing over the menu and not much sounded good because I just wasn&#39;t that hungry, a piece of the menu started to glow! It said Hangover Special... a plate of bacon and a PBR beer for $8. Yes please!!! The bartender was phenomenal and made sitting at the bar a great enjoyment. I sat there staring at the beautiful plate of bacon and all I could think was, why don&#39;t more places have something like this?  It is magical.  Everyone loves bacon, well, except for those crazy vegetarians out there. I was in hog heaven. Get it? Hog heaven? Okay, enough about that.  Go check out the Berk and eat some of their delicious bacon!"

We stumbled across this place because the restaurant we wanted to eat at had a two hour wait. Since that time we&#39;ve been to this place twice now. Both times have been pleasant. The food is fine I don&#39;t have any complaints about it. I wish they had a pancake platter with sides such as hash browns, eggs and a protein. Maybe there is and I just missed it?  The bloody mary that I had was OK. Nothing about it really made it special. Anyone can stick a piece of bacon and a few other groceries in pre-made bloody mary mix.  I had two and didn&#39;t feel a thing, so I have to say it was weak. 

The atmosphere is just like any other hipster spot - typically a younger crowd for brunch. I think they could use some work with seating. We had to wait for a seat when there were open tables. The couple in front of us had to wait as well when there was a two top wide open. 
I think you should try it and decide for yourself. This place is by no means terrible and we will most likely return. Be prepared that the food is a little pricey.

***Update: 10/16/2016***

Third times not the charm! 

After a race this weekend we decided to stop by for Sunday morning brunch. When we arrived there were multiple open tables in the restaurant but again we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. The host asked for our number but my husbands cell phone was dead so the host said he would come out and get us when the table was ready. We waited for about 20 minutes and noticed other people were being called inside (verbally - not through text). My husband went inside only to find out that the host sent a text. My husband reminded him his phone was dead and he told us he would come out and get us. The host laughed and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;  We ended up walking out and going across the street (which I do recommend Etai&#39;s). 

So we&#39;re finished with this place - save your money and go else where. They need a new manager who can staff the place properly - especially on a Sunday morning brunch time.  Wanted to like this place but we just can&#39;t."

We started off with a really long sit at a patio table before anyone came to help us with drinks. Getting the server to come back seemed a real challenge, and the minutes between the courses dragged on for a long time. The Fried Pickles and the Firecracker Shrimp were delivered first,
But we were so starved I didn&#39;t get a photo before we had devoured the dishes. The Pickles are Spears, not Chips as I had assumed. Served with Ranch. The Firecracker Shrimp only came with 3 shrimps stuffed with siracha and bacon wrapped over spinach mushrooms and a sweet sauce. Good textures and flavors blend together really well. The Mac N Cheese Entree was delicious and comes with little bacon chunks throughout the pasta. The Steak Frittes was tough, and seemed overpriced for the quality that came to the table. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin, and was equally disappointed with my plate. My fingerling potatoes, Brussels and creamed corn (which seemed more as a paste or consistency of mashed potatoes) were cold. I bet they would&#39;ve been tasty if served hot. The meat itself, the pork tenderloin, was flavor rich and really tender. We didn&#39;t really have anyone to complain to bc the server was so absent. I did see the manager once, though, coming outside he possibly help the server that may have been overwhelmed. Monday dinner, was it really that busy? Or just spread a little too thin."

We were happy to find this place. The service was attentive and the staff really freindly...skip to our third visit. THEY CHANGED THE MENU. I would love to know why, but all I can say is that the staff is still great, but none of us liked our meals. They changed the kind of steak and the sauce and the frittes were actually more like soggy bland potato wedges, they took the chicken off the menu and my dish was just odd.

I saw another review that said the beet salad was to small to be an entree, but I ordered it as an entree anyway.  D&#39;oh!  It was probably 200-300 calories, and inexplicably flavorless.  In case you are interested in this salad, you should expect about 5 olives and approximately one small beet, chopped into pieces. I don&#39;t think the menu mentions it, but this salad has all three types of beets (Chioga, golden, and red). 
Other food (pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries) were fine, but the pulled pork was not on the top 75% that I have had.

The first thing I noticed is that the room was dark, really dark. I do not know if they envisioned this being a place for an intimate date or something, but given the neighborhood they may want to jazz it up.

I told our server that the ladies room was out of paper towels and by the time my fiend went to the bathroom it still was not restocked.  The server offered us free dessert because our food too forever (if there are more than five tables the kitchen gets in the weeds). But who wants free dessert? Buy us a round of drinks or one of our meals. I appreciate the act of kindness...but then we had to remind our server that it was offered to us and had to wait another 10 minutes...longest brunch ever.

Funky eclectic menu!
Service and food quality you could expect to find at a Denny&#39;s.

Our group of 7 had very high expectations.  Food came out cold and incorrect.  The server was disinterested in service, and never bothered to check back.  It was a really bad experience, and with so many high quality restaurants in the area I hope ownership and management can keep it together."

The pork-themed sports bar serves breakfast lunch and dinner to diners who commonly have a bit of a wait, just to get in the door. 

The bread pudding appetizer mentioned in several reviews is okay, but on the small side. They make decent breakfast cocktails, and the breakfast sandwich I ordered was pretty good. 

Service was good, considering the crowd. Overall a fairly good meal, better than an ihop or egg and i, but not quite up to Denver brunch standards."

The food here is just OK. Their known for their bacon and pork so we had to get the bacon flight, which included 4 different types of bacon: garlic, curry, maple and herb. These were just OK. I would&#39;ve expected the best bacon ever, but the bacon was just a bit too salty. It was cooked perfect and thick though. 

We also got the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños and those were really good. It had some sort of marmalade glaze on top that was sweet and yummy. The bloody Mary&#39;s looked really good but lacked in flavor."

We also traveled from Lakewood to give it a go, so I won&#39;t likely be back anytime real soon given the distance we traveled and the mediocre food/service. BTW, we LOVE BACON.  A lot. So this is mildly disappointing to write. 

We went there with 3 mothers, their children and extended family  on Mother&#39;s Day. Interestingly enough, none of the staff wished any of the moms a happy mother&#39;s day. Obviously that&#39;s not a huge deterrent, but just worth noting. Maybe the staff was just too busy, or maybe they were sick of caring and dealing with large parties of families. I can&#39;t say a that I entirely blame them, but a quick nod to the  mothers would have been a nice touch on mother&#39;s day. 

The food was alright, but not &#34;oh my gawd&#34; amazingly delicious. We had brunch. It was reasonably priced and the portions were large. The moms also were treated to a free mimosa (which my husband asked about after seeing advertised on opentable.com. It was not offered by our server.) That said,  the mimosa was a generous pour  and yummy. The potatoes were really overcooked, but the coffee cake bread pudding was tasty. I liked the fried pickles, as well. The bacon was average. 

Otherwise, food, ambience and service was just decent overall.... It wasn&#39;t awful, just okay."

I started with the chocolate porter. This was the most chocolaty chocolate porter I&#39;ve ever tried. And it&#39;s good!

Then i ordered the bacon wrapped bacon. Very tasty but i don&#39;t think the inside is bacon, more like fatty pork shoulder. Either way, very good. And the bonus is that it&#39;s served with an apple arugula salad that is sweet and tart and really compliments the pork. 

I had the beet salad for an entree. Lots of different color beets. I didn&#39;t care for the toasted hazelnuts. I would have preferred walnuts. And I didn&#39;t really like the weird, skinny plate it was served on. When it came out it looked like an appetizer. But the overall flavor and texture was good.

The food was amazing. We had the bacon flight and cheese board for appetizer. The bacon flight was off the hook. The flavors were expertly paired and the deconstructed BLT was a nice presentation.

Love the quote in the men&#39;s bathroom from Homer Simpson about &#34;a magical animal&#34; that produces bacon, ham AND pork chops.  

The menu looked great and I asked our waitress for a recommendation.  Having just found the cuban sandwich and with the waitress&#39;s recommendation I decided on to try it.  What I received was a very poor meet to bread ratio with heavy mustard.  I was in Havana 3 months ago and experienced an amazing &#34;Cuban&#34; sandwich.  This was a far cry from what I was hoping for.  To say the least I was let down.  There were many other menu items that sounded appealing and I can&#39;t say that I will never go back, but I won&#39;t be making a significant effort to do so.

If I make it back I will be making a B-line for the pork wings.  From the reviews and the sound of it I expect better things.

The concept is very intriguing.  The overall atmosphere is above average.  I can&#39;t say that there was all that much that struck me other than the quote from Home Simpson above the urinal.

Homer: Are you saying you&#39;re never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?
Lisa: No.
Homer: Ham?
Lisa: No.
Homer: Pork chops?
Lisa: Dad, those all come from the same animal.
Homer: Heh heh heh. Ooh, yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, magical animal."

Food was generally under seasoned and the steak was terrible! It was not seared, sort of a gray color and no salt. The tenderloin was too pink, and about 2-3 oz portion. Salmon was very small with the same issues.

I ordered a bowl of tomato soup and a slider. The soup had good flavor but had a weird chunky/saucy texture. 

I normally don&#39;t love blue cheese but the slider tasted good as well. The down side: it was literally the smallest slider I&#39;ve ever seen. I understand that they&#39;re not normal sandwiched sized, but seriously... the SMALLEST slider I&#39;ve EVER seen. It&#39;s the size of your condiment cup...

Also, our service was very slow. I didn&#39;t time how long it took to get our food, but it was longer than average. The table behind us received their food first and got there after us. After the server asked if we were done eating (our plates had been empty for around 15 minutes), he said he would bring us our check. Another 20 minutes goes by before he brought it to us, then another 10 until he picked up our credit cards. 

Overall, the food was okay, but the prices were high for what you received. The experience was not great at all.

What sets this place apart, without a doubt, is the staff. This by no means is a knock on the food- it&#39;s  phenomenal... But the reason I continue to come back here is due to the great relationships I&#39;ve established with the servers and bartenders. They get it. They know their audience and cater to it. 

The Berk has been featured on a few Food Channel promoting their specialty, Bacon!  They mix up their menu on occasion, but I&#39;ve never had a pork chop I didn&#39;t love. 

If you ever stop by, treat yourself to the bacon flight.  On paper it seems a bit pricey for 4 slices of bacon, but trust me, money well spent. And by the way, it&#39;s quite filling.

I&#39;m really trying to get over what I consider to be a bad interaction with who I assume was the manager but I&#39;m struggling to do so.

Arrived on a Monday night at about 7:30 pm with a party of two.  Came in and was chatting with the hostess.  A guy comes up who appears to be the manager, interrupts our conversation &amp; says party of two.  Yes.  You have a reservation?  No.  It&#39;s about 20-30 minute wait unless you want to set outside or at the bar.  Great, we&#39;ll set outside.  Out we go, about 6 tables in a row; one couple at the end of the row by the door that leads outside.  We are guided to the farthest end of the patio and they seat us there in the farthest back corner of the patio.

I order the flight of Sauvignon Blanc wine which is 4 glasses.  The waiter &amp; the manager bring the wine out and one of the glasses clearly has less wine than the other three.  They&#39;re lined up in a row, you can&#39;t miss it.  I jokingly say to the manager, did you forget to fill this one?  He responds, &#34;that looks like two ounces to me, the others are over filled&#34;.  I&#39;ll tell you right now, that&#39;s the wrong answer.  Maybe he&#39;s right but I expect four equally filled glasses.  It was interesting to note the short glass was the only one that was sold exclusively by the bottle.  I&#39;d hypothesis they ran a tad short and didn&#39;t want to open a new bottle of something that is only sold by the bottle.

To complete the story we had a perfectly good meal.  The food was tasty, the prices were probably a few dollars too high for the portion but it was a very serviceable meal.  What I really  loved was a crostini they served me with vanilla bean goat cheese &amp; fresh strawberries that came with the wine flight.  Awesome flavor.

As we were leaving I couldn&#39;t help but comment to my dinner companion we had sat there for 90 minutes &amp; the restaurant was never even close to being full.  We could look through the window and see empty tables all night long so why the heck was there a 20-30 minute wait for an inside table?

My take away is the manager, maybe the owners, are a little too impressed with themselves &amp; their restaurant.  I like pork, it&#39;s a cool concept.  I hate being treated poorly.  I hate overpaying for what I&#39;m receiving.  You&#39;re not doing me a favor by letting me into your restaurant.  Treat me well and I&#39;ll write great reviews &amp; leave 25-30% tips.  Treat me rudely and I&#39;ll never be back unless the food falls into the simply amazing category.  My summary; good food but a bit overpriced.

Both of us were very happy with our choices. When we came for dinner we split the pig wings and a charcuterie plate. The cheese/salami plate was a little on the small side but it was delicious. The pig wings were so good, I ordered more to take home to my husband.

For brunch today, I got an Irish Coffee (very strong) and my roommate and I shared the frittata and the country fried eggs Benedict. We sat outside around 10am, and we were done with all our food and had paid by 10:45. Service was friendly and pretty typical for a good restaurant.

Prices may be a little on the higher side, but I&#39;ve enjoyed all the food I have had there. I outside both times and I felt the atmosphere was pleasant."

He was very impressed with the &#34;well prepared and cooked&#34; burger.  I&#39;ve never heard him use those words to describe a burger.

I think each one was better than the previous...or could it be that by my forth I was in a very happy place :) I ordered the breakfast burrito, which I expected to be run-of-the-mill, but it was great! It was filled to the brim with egg (which I appreciated) and the pork sausage was delicious. It claims to come smothered in green chili, but I found that it was only lightly drizzled, the perfect amount. My friend had the veggie omlet &amp; pancakes, and unfortunately, I thought both of those were run-of-the-mill.

There were tons of children and families, which made my loud &#34;4 mimosa cursing&#34; inappropriate, but it is in Stapleton, so I guess I should have expected that. Overall, this place beat my expectations and I would come back to drink more mimosas."

The food was delicious (lots of bacon for the bacon lover) and our server was incredible. When it came time to pay and leave she let me know that my food had been paid for by the restaurant because it was my birthday, I was very touched and appreciative since this has never happened to me before! The only issue I had was that, I had called to make a reservation a week before but didn&#39;t think to call and confirm the reservation once the date was nearing; although I should have because they did not send me any confirmations. Luckily on the day of my birthday brunch a friend went to the restaurant early and found out that there were no reservations that day, but she was able to get us a table for 20 because it wasn&#39;t busy. Had the place been busy during that time I would have had to wait a long time to get a table for 20 people. I did appreciate that they were kind enough to add more chairs to my table because, as always, extra people showed up without notice. Since they were also so accommodating I gave them back a star, or else I would have only given them four. I do suggest that if you make a reservation here, you should probably confirm it a day or two beforehand."

We got there around 10:30 and there was still ample seating inside the restaurant. 

The servers were EXTREMELY accommodating in terms of putting on the game that we wanted to watch and turning up the volume which is always a plus! They aren&#39;t stingy about returning to your table and filling up your mimosa cup and had a great attitude while doing so... I could imagine a table of drunken young people could get slightly annoying after a few hours.

The food we ordered was delicious-- the buffalo wings are a stand out in my mind when paired with the homemade ranch! They only complaint I had about this place is the fact that we spend about $13 on wings and only got 6 which is outrageous. 

There&#39;s a patio that is GORGEOUS during those pretty Denver mornings and it&#39;s well covered. Can&#39;t wait for summer for this very reason!!

I ordered the BLT Burger with my burger being well done. It came out very pink, the server agreed it wasnt to order and took it back to the kitchen. When my burger came out the second time, it was so hot I had to wait a good 5 minutes before I could take a bite, the bun, lettuce, and tomato were soggy, as if they just popped it in the microwave to heat it up more to my liking. Which is always fun, when youre the last one eating at the table because everyone else is finished. When we got our check the server said he comped our drinks for us because of the mistake, but when we reviewed the bill we were still charged for everything. At this point I didnt question it and just paid the bill. 

Im not a person who looks for discounts or free food because of screw ups, more a person who thinks if you say youre going to do something than do it.

However, the welcome we received was at odds with this whole, laid back message....

&#39;Great food!... &#39;But &#34;schizophrenic service.&#34;
As we entered, Sonya, (think that was her name), made eye contact &amp; greeted us with a huge, blank stare. The subtext of said expression might&#39;ve read: &#34;Yeh, need something?...&#34; 8/
Uhm, it&#39;s a restaurant... &#39;We would like to try some tasty pig? Duh. 
Yeh, it was weird... &#39;Not the first impression I was expecting.

&#39;Not too inviting, just kinda, &#34;Here&#39;s your menu, take a seat.&#34; Are we in the South Orange County part of town?... &#39;There seemed to be a meeting happening in the back room area, adjacent to where we were seated. Maybe that had something to do with the funky, mixed vibe going on... (shrugs) Hence, the overall 3+ Star Rating for &#34;Service.&#34;

Mary-Beth, our waitress eventually warmed up, hence the the extra &#34;plus&#34; to The Berkshire&#39;s &#34;Service Rating.&#34; Overall, Mary-Beth was helpful &amp; informative.

I ordered:
The Bloody Berk ($12) - The best &amp; spiciest Bloody Mary I&#39;ve ever had.
w/a Treehugger Amber Ale beer-back - &#39;Added a great balance to The Bloody Berk. (The ale is made by a local company - Asher Brewing Co.)

Iced Tea ($3.25) - Okay

Food Rating: 5 Stars

Prices aren&#39;t too bad but the $14 Bacon Flight does seem a bit pricey for a piece of garlic, almond, fried banana, strawberry, side salad w/a baguette &amp; four slices of bacon. It&#39;s worth trying but as an item to regularly order, not the best value. Albeit, it&#39;s a very tasty appetizer!

So, if you ever get a chance to drop by, try the Heritage Bacon Flight...
&#39;And The Big Berk Bloody!...
&#39;As well as the Stuffed Wrapped Jalapenos... 
&#39;And... &#39;You get the picture.
(Just be aware that the quality of your service could be as consistent as a flip of a coin.)

I told Mary-Beth that their eclectic menu &amp; creativity reminded me of a very popular, local gastropub here in Orange County.
Chapter One: the Modern Local - http://www.yelp.com/biz/chapter-one-the-modern-local-santa-ana

As we were leaving, Sonya, from when we first arrived was all smiles &amp; friendly... &#39;Like I wrote earlier, schizophrenic. (shugs) Weird. 

Food, great. Service, lukewarm. (After browsing past reviews, surprising that service at such an establishment would be so hit &amp; miss... &#39;Too bad.) That would have to be the major difference between Chapter One &amp; The Berkshire, there is no substitute for great customer service no matter how good the food...
&#39;And especially if you&#39;re spending a couple of dollars on it as well.

Total: $80 for two (Including tip)

My wife and I went for dinner.  We didn&#39;t have reservations so we had to wait about 25 minutes on a Saturday night.  We hung out at the bar and our great service started there.  

We grabbed a menu off the bar and started looking through the drinks.  We both ordered a cocktail and the bartender actually delivered the drinks to us.  It was really nice of her since it was fairly busy and I would have been more than happy to just get it over the counter.

We sipped on our drinks for a bit and the host came and found us and sat us down.  He also offered to transfer our drinks to our table right away.

Our server was nice and was attentive.  We ordered the &#34;Pig Wings&#34; to start.  I ordered the &#34;Pig and Pasta&#34; for my main course and my wife got the &#34;Pork Flat Iron&#34; and substituted the potatoes for cauliflower.

The &#34;Wings&#34; were terrific.  A good amount of heat and a nice tangy sauce coating a generous portion of meat.  My ravioli was perfectly al dente with a luscious sweet potato filling.  The pork belly on top was seasoned perfectly and crispy.  I had a bite of my wife&#39;s dish and the sauce was amazing.  She was very happy with her dish.

We were too full to get dessert but we&#39;ll be back to try some more things on the menu.

As a side note, my wife is very sensitive to gluten because of celiac disease.  I&#39;m happy to report that she felt perfectly fine the next day.  The Berkshire&#39;s gluten-free options seem to be handled very safely."

On my last visit to this establishment we were in a bit of a rush we only had one hour to eat, the hostess assured us that wouldn&#39;t be a problem. It took 15 minutes for us to get our first course (a small salad) and a 25 minute to get our burgers, we ended up having to ask them to just box up our food so we wouldn&#39;t be late for our other plans. Just putting our food in boxes took another 10minutes. 
From our seats at the bar we witnessed the expo chef eating fries picked off plates waiting to be ran to tables. His lack of hygiene discussed us.
When I called the restaurant later that night to notify the GM of our bad experience she blamed the bar tender (the only employ there that seemed to be working, and cared about our problem) for the long wait time. The GM told me she was looking at our receipt and would refund my card (she couldn&#39;t tell from my receipt that I paid cash...)
When we finally opened our boxed food up, it looked as if they had just thrown it in the box missing half of it.
I can&#39;t believe a GM would throw a employ under the bus in such a way, or that a executive chef would allow his kitchen to be so careless about their jobs. In a city with such a booming food scene I&#39;m surprised that The Berkshire has made it this long."

The menu is chock full of bacon themed items, so much so that I couldn&#39;t process all the possibilities. I ended up getting the bacon sampler appetizer (because I had already eaten breakfast before coming here). Four strips of amazing bacon. OK. Three strips of amazing bacon plus one that was pretty good, but not my style. Rosemary just isn&#39;t my favorite spice.

I absolutely will be back many times to try every bacon themed entrée on the menu. Plus, if you give them your email address on their website, you get a free glass of wine. 

The Berkshire is instantly one of my favorite restaurants in Denver."

Instead of sitting in the dining area, we sat at the bar and had a few drinks and an appetizer. Wednesday is ladies night - cheap drinks for the ladies.

My only complaint is that my beer was served in a frosted glass, which is a no-no.  The cold dulls the flavor of the beer and the melted frost waters it down."

Ashley, our server, was super sweet and on point, knew the menu and enjoys the work she does. Not over-attentive or under. Just right. Made great recommendations. We had the bacon-wrapped shrimp and the bacon-wrapped bacon for apps. The shrimp were absolutely magical. WOW. I would say the bacon-wrapped bacon was only a 3 but the shrimp more than compensated. And the salad accompaniments for both were delicious and light. For entrees, we got the scallops and the pork chop and shared. Again, WOW on both counts. Everything was perfectly seasoned, a little heat, a lot of flavor and perfectly cooked. One of our favorite restaurants is Old Major but it&#39;s across town and pricey. The Berkshire&#39;s food is on point with OM, and we left feeling light enough to watch a movie instead of ready to take a nap. 
It wasn&#39;t a perfect experience but for such small reasons, I wouldn&#39;t ping them on it. First, we did have a reservation but still got seated in front of the drink machine, which is pretty under-lit. I was trying to write them a good comment card and literally could not see what I was writing. I would say, especially if people take the time to make a reservation, try to seat them in the main dining area. Not a huge deal- we&#39;re newlyweds and don&#39;t mind dark corners. Haha! 
After leaving, we heard they also have Moscow Mules made with Pickett&#39;s Ginger Beer, which is another favorite beverage of ours. (We had delicious martini&#39;s last night but looking forward to trying the MM&#39;s). 
Thank you for a great night- we are looking forward to return visits and checking out the new spot downtown near Union Station when it opens!"

This place is fair, at best. The bacon flight was delicious, but not well plated or great presentation or anything, and everything else we ate was either fair or just plain not good. My dad did not like the &#34;Pig Wings,&#34; or the &#34;Bacon Phat Fries.&#34; The fries had a balsamic glaze that overpowered the whole dish and made it a sticky mess to eat. Maybe asking for the glaze on the side, or light on the glaze would help?

Lastly, I had the Lobster Mac and Cheese and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t eat it. And I rarely meet a mac and cheese dish that I can&#39;t eat, no matter how full I may be. The cheese was gross and hard and the lobster tasted like it was CANNED or had gone bad or something. Terrible. 

Overall I was thoroughly underwhelmed by this place."

I usually evaluate a restaurant on four scales: atmosphere, service, food, and price... They nailed every one! TLDR; love the cabana feel, slow food revolution, nice people, try the veg plate, prices are just right. For those of you interested in a little more rounded review, here goes: 

Atmosphere - It felt like I was stepping into a different world when I came in here with my husband. We seated ourselves under one of the indoor cabanas, admiring the tropical style and smooth wooden tables. Temperature was comfortably cool, suitable for spicier dishes that were soon to come. Lighting was dark enough for a romantic dinner setting, but light enough to see what you&#39;re doing. 

Service - going to ethnic restaurants requires some knowledge of the native culture. Luckily, we&#39;d been introduced to Ethiopian culture before- its very &#34;warm.&#34; They take their time, and we had been urged before to slowly savor our food, sit and talk for a while- so it wasn&#39;t surprising to me that they took a while to come by and take our order, and didn&#39;t interrupt often so that we could enjoy each other&#39;s company. When our waitress did attend to us, she made sure our waters were filled, and asked us if the food was alright. She was sweet and personable, and kindly dealt with my usual abundance of questions. 

Food - Phenomenal. We ordered the vegetable plate and medium rare kitfo. The injera was tart and plentiful, and no, there are no forks and spoons just given. (Not sure if one could ask, but why bother- try using that injera!) I was blown away by the expert combination of spices, but also highly recommend the veg plate to newcomers to the cuisine. The varied flavors are easy to love, with cauliflower, garbanzo beans, salad greens and more. 

Price - I apologize that I actually dont have the prices, as we ate here a few weeks ago, but I do remember thinking that it was a very good price, especially considering the portion sizes. I honestly had enough food leftover to feed us dinner for another night (what to do with all that leftover injera? Whip up your own dish at home with some tomatoes, onions, garbazo beans, and curry spice in a frying pan, then enjoy!) 

BOSS BONUS - When we finished our excellent meal, we wandered over to the conjoined marketplace to look around. We had the pleasure of running into the owner, Ben, who was immediately interested in our experience. He was also warm and friendly, and shared some advice about how to use some of the spices for sale, including bereberie and mitmita. 

Summary - excellent score all the way around, best for a night when you have some time to sit and relax. This is NOT a fast food place, so take your time! Highly recommend the vegetable plate, and also check out the bathrooms too- very nicely designed. (Seriously you wont be dissapointed.)"

The apparent from the outside is it much. Once inside it is very nice. My wife was hesitant as there was no Dora wat on the menu. My wife ordered the vegetarian platter and I had the beef with jalapeños. The food was excellent the enjara was perfect. The portions were fantastic we took home enough food for another meal. Next-door is an Ethiopian  market. They sell in Enjara as well as lentils and the bebare. We would eat there again without hesitation

The atmosphere is casual and welcoming - nothing fancy. However, the food is outstanding.

We had the vegetable platter, mogne beef tibs and kitfo (rare - otherwise why bother?).
Everything was delicious and high quality - definitely above average. A few things exceeded expectations and will bring me back here again and again. 

First, the injera was unlike any I&#39;ve had before. It appeared to be whole wheat - darker than average in any case - and had a perfect sourdough flavor. The mogne tibs were new to me - a savory, spicy tomato and rosemary sauce that I&#39;ve not tried before. The kitfo was fantastic. I&#39;m a bit of a kitfo connoisseur and I rate this among the best, if not the best, I&#39;ve had. (My bases of comparison are mostly DC and NY.) The beef was very fresh and had a beautiful balance of spices: cardamom, berbere, ?

I look forward to returning."
megenagna-ethiopian-restaurant-aurora,Mark T.,RYIhfaNekKLDuqmwqkVi3g,"Aurora, CO",1,1,0,200,7,MjSnKXKwvNw6SIR3XXadwA,3.0,2015-01-28,"Sharing a space in Aurora with the grocery of the same name, Megenagna Restaurant offers multiple varieties of two dishes which are much loved across the East African nation of Ethiopia. 

Unlike the majority of Ethiopian eateries in town whose owners are members of the Amhara ethnic group, the proprietors of Megenagna belong to the Gurage group from the country&#39;s southwest. And in fact, one of their signature dishes, Kitfo, is Gurage in origin. Besides the most famous iteration (consisting of ground, impeccably fresh raw beef, cottage cheese and mixed greens), Megenagna also offers a completely vegetarian rendition (greens and cheese only) and even a version (Tikur Kitfo) where the beef is stewed. Although usually served with the famed teff-based flatbread called Injera, they sometimes also offer the equally tasty Qocho (bread made from fermented enset [false-banana plant] starch).

Megenagna&#39;s second selection, Tibs, is at times referred to as &#34;Ethiopian-style fajitas&#34; and this is in fact an amazingly accurate description. You can choose from a number of meats (short ribs, rib-eye steak, lamb...), preparations (sliced, cubed, chopped, left-on-the-bone...), and sauces (Awaze [hot pepper], Senafitch [mustard], Niter Kibbeh [clarified butter]...), but no matter what you settle on, the ingredients of your choice will be lovingly combined with onions, tomatoes, jalapeños and a bit of rosemary before the whole thing is skillet-sizzled, culminating in a very memorable meal. It&#39;s a winner, and you can round things off even more nicely with some fresh-roasted coffee and an in-house pastry selection from Omonoia Greek Bakery."

Ok so, the service was a little slow but the place was very busy when I arrived and there was only one woman holding down the fort. The menu was pretty simple so it was easy to make up my mind about what I wanted. Once ordered my food came out in a decent amount of time with plenty of injera. I&#39;ve found at other Ethiopian restaurants sometimes they can be a little lite with the injera so I have to keep asking for more. The portion was enough to take home for dinner the next day. They also serve coke in a glass bottle which I love. This location is a bit of a drive for me but it&#39;s definitely closer than colfax. I can&#39;t wait to return!"

The Awaze Tibs have never disappointed.   Just the right amount of heat, just perfection.

I took my Ethiopian son and his friend for lunch there over Christmas break and my son and I ordered the Tibs and his friend ordered totally off the menu. I still have no clue what he ordered, but it was seriously the best thing I&#39;ve had that wasn&#39;t in Ethiopia.   So, so good.

I stop at the grocery here and there for coffee and injera.   I&#39;m not what I consider a regular, but the cashier always calls out &#34;Hi Kelley&#34; when I walk in.   I always have to look around to see who she&#39;s talking to, because I can&#39;t figure out how her memory is so good.

When we arrived there was only one other occupied table, yet the server had no real interest in serving us. We shrugged it off and tried to be patient, even when she suggested that based on our appearance (see: not Ethiopian) we should order the kifto &#34;medium&#34;, unlike the traditional and highly recommended &#34;rare&#34;. We ordered it rare anyway and enjoyed it (although there was way too much for 2 people).
I&#39;m writing this review the next morning because neither of us are yet feeling quite right. I don&#39;t want to go so far as to say it was food poisoning because neither of us have been violently ill, but we feel less-than-great nevertheless.

When you walk in, you&#39;re hit with this cool, moody ambiance that I really appreciate. The inside is very quaint and dimly lit. But, there is just enough light to be comfortable. The pub atmosphere is very comfortable in my personal opinion. 

Now to the food!! The food seems to be really good here. My date and I both got the chicken pot pie. The portion that you receive is massive. Also, it comes with a side of sauteed potatoes. In terms of taste, the dish felt very homey. 

The next time I come here, I definitely want to try their Beef Wellington. But, I think this is a special item rather than a daily item because our waiter had told us about this dish. It was not on the menu."

I have LOVED this pub  and brought in many new customers. The bald guy who manages the place is always friendly, and the food is good. But when you are there with a female-only table, like today, he made both of us &#34;hug it out&#34; when the third thing we ordered turned out to be off the menu. I really do not want to hug my server, but we let it slide.

Then at the end, he said &#34;Do you ladies want to hear a dirty joke?&#34; I smiled and said &#34;no.&#34; When he said &#34;IT&#39;S REALLY FUNNY&#34; I put on my boss face and said &#34;I ALREADY SAID NO.&#34; 

Oh, the butthurt that ensued. He&#39;s a happily married man with two daughters, he just asked, why I have to be so mean. Conveniently forgetting that I had smiled and said &#34;no&#34; once in a very friendly manner. I tried to explain that it is inappropriate and NOT ON but, no, I&#39;m just a mean bitch. Oh well. Guess I won&#39;t come back, guess I won&#39;t bring in more of my friends.

To start, I don&#39;t understand what this seemingly established place is doing on Metro Airport Avenue in Broomfield in the middle of nowhere.  I guess if you&#39;re looking for a place in that area or work in one of the businesses near by, this would be a place to go (if you didn&#39;t want craft beer at Four Noses).

The bar seating is very limited, and there aren&#39;t too many bar stools...mostly tables.  I like to sit at the bar, so I squeezed in there.  I met up with my English friend, who, you may guess, has been to a few pubs.  I checked with her this morning to see what I was missing.  &#34;Nothing,&#34; she said.

Fish and chips were A-OK, just like this review.  Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, not the worst.  Drinks were good. Service was friendly.  If I were in the area again, would I return?  Yes.

Once it arrived he came by and walked me through each pour. 

Hands down, best Ruben I have EVER had. The bread was toasted perfectly, which kept it from getting soggy, the perfect amount of corn beef, and clearly the sauce and sauerkraut were home made. Simply amazing! 

The atmosphere was amazing, very warm and inviting. A place that you could spend hours sipping scotch enjoying the evening."

We had the Scotch eggs as appetizer, never had that dish before - killer. Then I had a seafood dish in a cream sauce that was, well too good, I could eat about 3 more servings right now thinking about it.

Almost forgot - I never order dessert but my date and I split one, it was some kind of very wet gingerbread/muffin/cake thing with a honey kind of topping - just UNbelievable. And a huge serving, yet I think I ate almost all of it myself. Wow, these people make some great food.

Great selection of beer on tap, wine, etc. Supposedly the meat dishes they offer over the weekends are fantastic, Beef Wellington, etc. So I&#39;ll be going back soon to sample that.

Very friendly service and very very reasonably priced; downtown, these meals would cost twice this much and still be worth it."

I love scotch. 
I love the way it tastes. 
I love the way it warms my belly. 
And if you feel the same way, head to the Hilltop for one of the best scotch collections I&#39;ve seen in any American bar/restaurant. Not only is the selection impressively massive, the prices are better than fair. Chris behind the bar is incredibly knowledge of all the brands and barrels making even a beginner&#39;s trip an enjoyable one. 
I truly wish my company would have me work another two weeks in Westminster so that I could stay in their spacious, comfortable rooms.

Went with the wife and some friends, 5 of us total. Our friends had suggested to go there, although they had never been there either. I missed it on the drive up, had to turn around.  Parked, went inside and was greeted by the waitress and one of the bartenders named Chris. 

Needless to say he was totally a nice guy, knowledgable about his whiskey and very personable.  

It wasn&#39;t crowded at all, the food was good and I honestly had not one complaint. We had an awesome time and it was hands down the best eating experience I&#39;ve had in quite some time.

The wait staff is over worked, so to refill that beverage expect a wait.  It was so bad last time they printed menus that day to outline what they did have, and guess what first think we tried to order they were out of it.  I will keep going back trying to hope it comes back to the place I use to love going to.

 I have yet to have a bad experience here!  The staff is knowledgeable and the food is just as good if not better than my mum use to make.  The staff is friendly, the views of downtown are amazing, and the food if you like traditional English fair is some of the best I have had this side of the pond.

Went in and the place was empty. Sat at the bar and ordered a beer on tap. Was informed they were out. The server was clueless as to recommending a similar brand.

Ordered a cup of clam chowder and the sausage roll. Minutes later she comes back and says they are out of clam chowder. Just stuck with the sausage roll. It was bland sausage wrapped in puff pastry. I had to drench it in HP Sauce.

The menus aren&#39;t as pretty and there&#39;s less quirkiness. Having said that, it&#39;s still great and probably just going through some growing pains and hitches from new management.
The good: More beer on tap and more locally focused, food is still excellent (Try the Reuben! also, try the Steak and Stout Pie!) and the service is still really fun, if not the most attentive. In fairness, they were really busy though.

IF you want quick fast service, go to Mc D&#39;s. I ran across this pub this weekend to my delight. Great quiet atmosphere. Very knowledgeable bar tender on the whiskey. Good selection, and great pie&#39;s. 
We did the Murphy&#39;s and Old Hen beers, tried a flight of whiskey, and enjoyed the Sheppard&#39;s pie and Steak and Stout pie. 
The beer was as it should, the whiskey selection the bar tender choose for us was very good and came with a nice history lesson. The food! YUMM. The Sheppard&#39;s pie you could tell was home cooked, the carrots you could even tell were not from a can like many places do. The Mash on top w/cheese cooked perfectly, great flavor. The Steak and Stout pie had a beautiful and flaky crust and absolutely delish. Now mind you, all in all this meal ran $65, but we&#39;re talking, 2 meals, 2 beers, and 5 shots of Whiskey. So I&#39;m sure if on a budget you can still make it affordable but may have to skip the Whiskey. 
This place was perfect for our evening, the service was great, and again the idea of a nice quaint british pub is to take your time, talk to the person you go with, or to the other bar guests. Recommend 100%."

But the service has dropped a bit. This evening was not too busy, but our server was nowhere to be found after we were served our food. She seemed a bit absent minded but sweet. I never received the catsup for my fries and she was not around to ask. I had to ask multiple times for my iced tea. They need to hire more help or learn to mulritask better.

My group was mostly seniors anyway and after an awkward start, the new waitress said the Chef discovered a new shipment of fish for the Fish &amp; Chips, and, a case of burgers! Amazing.  

It took awhile even with other staff helping; they didn&#39;t seem very organized. There was another big group of diners in the next room, so maybe two large groups at once threw them off.  We didn&#39;t RSVP.  Most of the positive reviews below seem from single and two-person visits.  The fish was battered and fried just right, so hot and crispy I was burning my tongue.  The fries, err, chips, were golden brown and toasty crispy as well. Burgers were reported to be good; they looked great.  However, one gal said the lamb in her Shepard&#39;s Pie seemed baaaad. They replaced it free with a chicken and mushroom pie.

What an amazing whiskey selection. We wound up trying a few at Johnny&#39;s urging (a family member that works there). Will have to try it again by myself soon."

The gravy on the bangers was a bit salty and the potatoes could have been cooked a bit more, but other than that the dish was quite good. The prime rib in the Welshman was amazing. Cooked perfectly to melt in your mouth. We finished the night with creme brûlée, which was very delicious. I would definitely come back to the pub, I just wish our stay at the inn had been better."

The food is the same though.  I decided to celebrate my 20th anniversary of Active Duty Army service with a trip to the British pub.  

For the second time, great food!  I had the &#34;Banger Burger,&#34; which is basically a ground sausage patty on a hamburger bun with a sweet sauce on it.  Delicious!  The fries (&#34;Chips&#34;) were also very good.

The food was great and the service was great, but it was pretty stuffy in there and the tables are a little too tight together for my liking.  That&#39;s the only reason for four stars instead of five.

We got there around 11:30 on Tuesday and there was only one other couple in there.  By the time we left, the table next to us had a table of four.  Tuesday is definitely a good day to go here for lunch, based on our experience today."

The perfect ingredients for a get together with friends or significant other. The Burns Pub offers a very nice and wholesome menu. The manager graciously allowed us to order from the restaurant menu even though it was closed. He gave us a brief history of the pub as well. We had the Windsor (chicken with mushrooms in a wine sauce) - outstanding- and a veggie curry, very well done. Old Speckled Hen on tap! A piece of the British Isles right here in Colorado, at a small airport no less. If I had a plane I&#39;d fly in just to eat here.

I wasn&#39;t sure, but it was close to the event so we went in. The inside is small and has awkward seating, I could see that it was kind of like &#34;Cheers,&#34; where most of the people there were there often.

We sat at a table and the waiter told us (upon hearing that we love curry), that they curry was &#39;amazing&#39;! So, we went for it. We ordered the beef curry over rice. 

Oh. My. Goodness. I can still taste it when I think about it... and not in a good way. It tasted just like chewing on a bullion cube with some salt on top. Just like it. I haven&#39;t done that, but I can imagine that it would taste overly season-y and beefy in the strongest way and that is exactly how this tasted. Oddly enough, we didn&#39;t get any beef in our curry because my son doesn&#39;t love meat chunks, but it tasted more like beef than anything. There was no other flavor involved; beef bullion and salt, the end. 

I didn&#39;t want to pay, but because my son was there I didn&#39;t want to tell them how terrible it was, so we just left. I wouldn&#39;t come back here if it were the zombie apocalypse and they were offering free food and a place to hide."

OK, everyone makes a mistake but c&#39;mon, food is coming out to table seated after us and you don&#39;t check?  Very disappointed in the Bubbles and Squeak. It is suppose to be browned on both sides, but what I got was a (mostly) plate of mashed potatoes and some vegetables (which except for the mushrooms, were very good). Their menu states that Bubbles and Squeak is a &#34;Potato Cabbage Croquete / Seasonal Vegetables / Balsamic Drizzle Add Corned Beef $4&#34;.  Mine in no way resembled a croquete, and the kicker is the bill was $5 for the corned beef!!  They offered me another beer, so sure.  Well, at least don&#39;t sure it in a cracked glass.  omg.

There are a few very simple things that really set Burns Pub apart from other pubs in the area.

In the sake of full disclosure, I became a &#34;Whiskey Club Member&#34; of Burns Pub some time ago solely for the reasons listed below.

First and foremost is the family that runs it. They are great people that truly care about their customer experience. If anything is ever wrong, they will take care of it. There isn&#39;t a huge staff, as it&#39;s a family business. Things move a little slower, and that&#39;s perfectly fine by me. Johnny is always a pleasure. The members are always great for a conversation as well.

Next is the massive collection of whiskeys available. While Burns does serve wines (not my style), several draft beers on nitro and cans/bottles, the whiskey really is the shining star. The primary &#34;bartender&#34; (although, since it&#39;s a family business, he does much more than just tend bar) is Johnny. Johnny knows his whiskeys. Seriously. The whiskey collection here is one of the best in Colorado and probably the best for it&#39;s square footage.

When I go to Burns I usually have to accompany my whiskey with one of their pub food items like chips and curry, pasties or the corned beef sandwich. They corn their own been and make their own sauerkraut. Craziness.

The atmosphere is very much one of a small lodge with a pleasant courtyard and deck. If you have too much to drink, rent a room in the same building. Can&#39;t ask for more!

This is my favorite haunt to grab a few classy drinks, good food and company!"

Tacos DF is located in a strip mall off Parker at the intersection with Leetsdale. As it shares space with several other restaurants/businessea there is ample parking.

The interior is fairly plain with several tables and a few TVs. You order at the counter. While not on the permanent menu I ordered the carnitas which was being offered (perhaps everyday and maybe just Saturdays). The tacos come on corn tortillas but you choose whether to garnish with onions, cilantro, lime and/or salsa (green or red) at the salsa bar.

While quesadillas are on the menu they said they couldn&#39;t make it that night. No problem. I tried a hurrache with al pastor and it was delicious. It is corn fried and then topped with al pastor, cheese sour cream beans and chile. Messy but delicious. 

They don&#39;t have guacamole but the chips were better than almost any other I&#39;ve had at Mexican restaurants. They are crisp and salty without being greasy. 

Tried the large horchata which is big enough for 3-4 people. Not overly sweet with good hints of cinnamon.

If you&#39;re looking to be seen this is not the place. However, if you&#39;re looking for food that is muy delicioso come to Tacos DF."

My husband and I went here because it&#39;s so close to our house and I&#39;ve been craving some authentic mexican food. I figured the name alone was a good sign, as DF stands for &#34;Distrito Federal&#34; aka Mexico City. I was not disappointed! We both decided to order smothered burritos after we saw some being made and they looked amazing. I ordered the pastor, my hubs ordered the asada, and we got jamaica to drink. My husband took one bite of his burrito and said &#34;Wow!&#34; The flavors were delicious, salsa was spicy, and overall we were in heaven. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty typical of taco places. There&#39;s a counter where you order, pay, and pick up your food. The people behind the counter were great, as well. I spoke both Spanish and English with them and they understood both, which is always a bonus for me!

If people say this isn&#39;t authentic, they are wrong. Of course, there&#39;s a lot of different cooking styles in Mexico, but this is straight from central Mexico. So happy to have authentic food :)"

They had good texture on the tortilla, nice flavor and moist beef, but the other tacos I had were not as good. A little bland and rubbery mouthfeel. 

The salsa bar added a nice bite and kick of flavor to the other tacos, but it isn&#39;t enough in this super competitive segment.

Being familiar with the culture I gathered that Tacos DF referred to cuisine indigenous to central Mexico, particularly the area around Mexico City, or the Federal District to be exact.  And, I was correct.  Located in a strip mall on the north side of Parker Road Tacos DF is a nice little hole in the wall place for a quick meal.  In fact, you will order your food through a hole in the wall.  If you aren&#39;t much for ambiance you will be happy here.   Pretty plain dining room area with maybe 25 or so seats, with a adequately stocked salsa/condiment bar.  It&#39;s a great place for authentic ethic food from way south of the border, where unusual parts of the cow, pig or lamb gets used in some tasty combinations.  I am a bit of a wimp, so I opted for a taco plate made from an animal I am culinarily familiar with, the chicken.  It was great!

I don&#39;t think this place even deserves one star I&#39;m forced to give it here. A lady was mopping a floor when I was looking at hours and checking my phone to make sure it&#39;s indeed Friday and they close at 10pm and not 9pm. When a cleaning lady saw me she just turned away from me like I&#39;m some kind of culprit. I knocked on the door, kitchen lady obviously saw me, but chose to make an appearance that she didn&#39;t.

All of this felt very rude. I understand that business can close earlier on a slow day. But, they could have communicate in a nice way that they are closed for a day. It felt extremely disrespectful. And if business treats their customer this way, I have doubt they will take an effort to cook a quality food for the same customer. Stay away. I&#39;m not surprised to read LaTonia&#39;s comment."

The food was good though, I got 3 tacos; beef, pork, and chorizo and my wife got the 3 taquito platter. The tacos were very good, and loaded with meat. The taquitos were also good, I had a few bites and my wife said it was one of the better ones she&#39;s had.

Burrito Smothered, ONLY comes with RICE &amp; Cheese in it.  Hubs like it but a little sad coz there is NO BEANS in the Burrito.  *Hubs Sad Face*  Just OK establishment to have Tacos and Burrito.  Nothing stellar, nothing special to write about.

This recent visit was on Saturday April 12th 2014.  Time was about 19:50hrs ish.  I already had Dinner somewhere else, but Hubs has NOT.  Since Tacos DF is the nearest to where my last appointment were, to this Tacos DF we went.  The server that evening who handled the transaction, and behind the counter at Tacos DF is Maritza.  The Dinner with tax was $18.52.

My husband asked if they could add just a little bit of hot sauce inside his burrito and when we got home his burrito was smothered in the hot sauce inside and out. It was so hot for him his mouth was completely numb and he eats hot things daily. When he called to complain the lady on the phone asked what he wanted and he said a new burrito and the lady on the phone told him &#34;no, you knew how much hot sauce was going to be in there, come get your money but you can&#39;t have another burrito&#34; 
That was very rude, a little bit does not mean smoother my burrito completely in hot sauce. Won&#39;t return due to completely rude customer service."

The price is a bit more than other small taco joints but the service was fast with plenty of seating. Next I will try me some home made chichaaron Gordita.

Tacos were nothing special, had only a single tortilla, and lettuce cost extra. The sope was tough and rubbery around the edge and mushy in the center. All served in a small plastic basket.

&#34;THIS HOLE-IN-THE-WALL WAS RATED BEST IN DENVER IN 2008&#34;

Food: 
What I order as my &#34;usual&#34; when first walking into an unfamiliar Mexican joint to keep things basic is a Chicken Burrito.  Their burrito came to me as a humongous sized meal that was nicely put together with all the fixings.  The good thing about the food here is that the tortillas are homemade and the meat is marinated beforehand.  I&#39;d say the burrito was tasty and that the chicken was cut into small cubes instead of being shredded (the waitress also made sure to &#34;filler up&#34;!)  It was smothered with a green chili sauce and the top of the burrito was decorated with cheese and drawn in a squiggly line (upon opening my box first thing I thought was, &#34;Wow...Kyut!&#34; :)   I did like the fact that there was a little bar where you could help yourself to the different salsas, limes, and jalapenos to compliment your meal.

*The one thing I did not like was biting into the end of the burrito and only tasting rice which means the chicken was not spread out the way it should have been (not to be so &#34;anal&#34; about it but, EVERY bite should be an experience if you ask me!). 

Service: 
The woman who served me was very hospitable and provided good service.  I did start to kind of &#34;wonder&#34; about the food after she continued to say A NUMBER of times, &#34;It&#39;s really good...the food here is really good...!&#34; (and I&#39;m thinking...well, of COURSE you are going to say the food is &#34;really good&#34; since you work here but, let ME be the judge of that! :-) Other than that, she was helpful and explained to me a little bit about the history of the restaurant and how it had been around for seven years to date.

Atmosphere: 
I am somewhat of a &#34;clean freak&#34; and not to say that this place was DIRTY but, it could&#39;ve have used a little bit more cleaning in the back (I noticed food all over different areas of the floor, in the kitchen, and also the appliances could have been wiped down some).  In the front of the cashier area, I noticed also that the white walls had black smudges all of over them.  I was a little put off yet still wanting to give this place a chance as I a took a bite of my very first plate there.  There were a few interesting looking paintings surrounding the restaurant which gives customers something to look at while waiting for their food.

Price:
I paid $6 for a Chicken Burrito yet, I know I&#39;ve paid LESS at other hole-in-the-wall places (around $3 to give a rough estimate).  Tamales range about $1.50 each whereas I do know of places that charge about a buck.

Parking: 
Parking is free and is located right in front of the restaurant within the shopping complex.

MY THOUGHTS?
I would still give my hats off to this place for its humble beginnings and how the owner started off as a food truck (quite impressive!).  You can read more about the history of this place in a news article posted in front of the restaurant.  Other than that...I can&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t come BACK yet, because I am somewhat on a Mexican foodie mission, this place would not be a repeat anytime soon.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Try the Chicken Burrito I guess?"

I get it they were once a taco truck and made it into a restaurant but would it kill them to clean up a little? I came in on a Saturday around 2:30pm ordered my 4 carne asada tacos which were decent. I could tell the meat had been previously cooked and was kind of greasy but I&#39;ll be honest I like greasy tacos from time to time. I suppose I&#39;ll have to come back and try it again but hoping to find less food on the tables and floor. Also props to them for having Mexican Pepsi. Love that stuff!

My first taco was great. My second taco had a LOOOONG hair in it. I probably should have just stopped there but I let them make me another taco in exchange for the hairy one. 

The second taco&#39;s meat was super fatty! WTHeck! I barely ate any of that one and left totally disappointed. I thought with all the reviews and being a Los Angeles native...where you can get yummy tacos 24/7...that I had finally found me a true Mexican spot. BUT NO, NO, NO! 

I don&#39;t like that they use &#39;Mission Taco Shells&#39; either. I wan&#39;t real carne asada with authentic taco shells. 

I will say that the cold bar with all the fresh cut cilantro, onions, etc...was the BOMB dot com. But they only get one star because of the hairy &amp; fatty taco. Darn!!!

My search continues..."

Then as I started to order, a Mexican gentleman walked in front of me and almost pushed my girlfriend out of the way.  He proceeded to order something, and the lady took his order instead of mine.  I walked out before I could even try the food here.  I felt like because I wasn&#39;t Mexican, I was cut and served second.  This was very disappointing and disheartening.

But then once I got home to tear into some delicious street tacos I discover they covered two of the tacos in cheese and lettuce (not what I ordered and its a street taco, not tex-mex), but, hey, maybe it&#39;ll be delicious anyway...

The carne asada was pretty good, not too fatty, great seasoning, overall pretty good.  The green salsa from the taco bar was WAY too week to have on these tacos though.  Two bites into the second taco I come to bone, not a little silver, but a 1 inch by 1/2 inch chunk...  Ok, I figure maybe it was just a fluke, bite three delivers a smaller sliver.  Ok I figure, bad butchering on that one, but same deal in the barbacoa which is supposedly made from lamb instead of pork.

But Tacos DF is fully deserving of five stars, and, yes, you should definitely check it out.

I&#39;ve been here a few times for lunch recently. Each weekday features a different kind of taco on sale for a dollar and a tortada on sale for three dollars. Otherwise, I think tacos and tortadas are $1.75 and $5.99 respectively. Four tacos is plenty lunch for me. With a big cup of water, lunch is less than five bucks. It&#39;s hard to beat that anywhere.

You can watch your food being prepared on the surface grill behind the counter. The meat sizzles on the grill and then its chopped up and slid into warm tortillas. (Don&#39;t you dare ask for lettuce or cheese... this is a Mexican restaurant, not an American restaurant.) Once you get your tacos, head to the topping bar and check out the awesome salsas. I like the least chunky salsa--it&#39;s really spicy!

Tacos DF offers excellent Mexican food at a very reasonable price. Go here! (But only go once because I don&#39;t want it to become too popular!)"

Yes, I am a taco neophyte, unless you count the numerous Taco Bell&#39;s I&#39;ve stuffed down my gullet. Today, I wanted to find a way to combine both a healthy activity with eating. Living near the Tech Center makes it easy to hop on a bike path for a nice ride. Combining Yelp with Google maps found a nice target: Tacos DF is only 4+ miles from my place. Of course, I went too far on the Highline Canal path extending the ride to about 6 1/2 miles.

Tacos DF is in a non-descript strip mall along Parker Road. It is a small shop, with a open window separating the kitchen from the small dining room. Looking at the other patrons, today must have been Menudo day... Looking over the menu I found two choices: Lengua (cow tongue) and Asado. Having grown up eating tongue, I thought I&#39;d try it Mexican style.

The tongue had its requisite sweetness, plus a little salsa from the bar had me thinking of my mom in a whole new light... Not on rye with Pastrami, but grilled, with cheese, lettuce and a little green. The asado was a nice accompaniment. Be aware they cook to order, so it will take 5-10 minutes for your order.

Tacos DF is a winner!"

Also, their service is great. As an example, we ordered some food once right before the power mysteriously went out in the strip mall. Rather than turning us away, they put everything together the best they could without power (the grill was still hot, after all) and then gave us directions on how to microwave our smoothered dishes to melt the cheese as the final touch."

I decided to try the lengua, asada, al pastor tacos.  Unfortunately, they don&#39;t have horchata.  :(

The tacos took a while as mentioned, but were fantastic.  The lengua and asada being my favorite.  I didn&#39;t really like the pork in the al pastor as much due to what felt to me to be a bit of over-fattiness.

Went there because Jason Sheehan of Westword wrote about it twice.

Saturday lunch and the place is busy with many Mexicans and their offspring enjoying the delicious food.

I enjoyed the torta jamon. Exactly what i wanted and met all my expectations.

The recorded music is great! But, then, I love all northern-Mexican music.

This will be a quick, painless and quite positive review:  Here is my recommendation lengua and asada tacos are the way to go. Joints like this have a following, either you are of the Latino background or you simply like a &#34;divey&#34; joint that serves decent food that resembles the background of the cook in the kitchen - note either usually suggests a good place with a decent product.
Tacos are good, Menudo - not so much.

R-r-r-r-r  I veer across two lanes ( I looked before I lept, and there wasn&#39;t anyone there) of Parker Road and into the lot. We were headed for H-Mart before the taqueria sighting but I remembered Sasha S. had told me I needed to check this place out.

Let&#39;s see...  three tables with mexicano customers at them, cool. Tacos and...  alright! a bowl of menudo being devoured. My wife ordered two tacos, an al carbon and an al pastor. I got a small bowl of menudo and a al pastor taco. Looking into the kitchen I see a big stack of... packaged corn tortillas. Bummer. Not freshly made.They have a salsa bar with four different salsas; two reds, a green chile type and an avocado. There&#39;s also limes, onions, cilantro and some pickled jalapenos. Pretty standard stuff, the salsas were not very hot but had decent flavor.
I pick up the menudo at the window and then the tacos a bit after. The menudo is okay, a little bit too dirty smelling but seasoned and cooked okay (rubbery isn&#39;t my favorite texture for menudo but neither is wet toilet paper overcooked either. this was cooked just right) and nothing that tons of onions, cilantro, oregano, a squirt of lime, and some powdered chile (no chili pequin?) won&#39;t correct. I forgot to ask if I could get grilled &#34;pan&#34; bread instead of torts and I wasn&#39;t given a choice of flour or corn but it came with my preferred corn torts anyway so I was okay with it.
The tacos came with lettuce? on the aforementioned packaged tortillas and the meats were pretty good, not as spicy as I prefer and without any of my beloved carmelization. Overall, I think I would make the drive to Colfax where you have more choices and slightly better and cheaper food. But if you&#39;re near here and time is a factor. Here is good enough."

Nice salsa bar.  I get the green salsa, some pico, and definently some chopped onions.  I used to go here once-a-week and spend like $12 each time.

Wanted street tacos and the picture on the menu board had what looked like street tacos unencumbered by lettuce and cheese.
Wish there&#39;d been an old guy in a brown cloak waving me off, &#34;These are not the tacos you&#39;re looking for.&#34;
Walked out with my order only to find that they had coated them with lettuce and cheese.  The al pastor had zero pineapple sweetness to it and tasted more of chili powder than everything else it should have. The asada was decent with the exception of little gristle pieces to occasionally chew on.

This place gets crazy busy on the weekends so my friend and I decided to come here on a Monday night. 

This steakhouse was definitely different from other places I&#39;ve been too. When you enter, you order right up front. Grab a tray and utensils. They will hand you your toast and salad and right by the cash register there are condiments such as dressing to put on your salad. Not sure if they usually do this but since it was slow they gave us our steaks after we sat down. 

I ordered the Sirloin cooked medium rare and my friend ordered the T-Bone cooked medium rare as well. THEY COOKED BOTH OF OUR STEAKS PERFECTLY and I have never had that happen. The steaks were also huge! One thing I recommend is to eat your toast with honey... SO FREAKING GOOD! The service was great as well. 

Definitely will be back!"

Despite the outdated furniture, facilities, bar, etc,  but none of that matters after you have tried their steaks! The cooks have been doing it for years and will prepare your steak to perfection. Each order comes with a baked potatoe or fries, a salad, 2 toasted bread, and you can ask for a grilled jalapeño to spice it up. Over the years, prices have gone up and are now cost just as much as the franchised steakhouses like Texas, Outback. However, it is still worth the drive if you don&#39;t live in Denver to guarantee that your order is made to satisfaction. 

Tip: the porterhouse is their biggest steak and best value. The fried menu items are good too if you&#39;re not feeling steak."

One person I am traveling with to Denver said this is  a must-go-to place, for nostalgia&#39;s sake.  He had not been in this restaurant in over two decades, and had many memorable moments with his friends at this place with his high school buddies.  So today, we went for lunch.

Atmosphere: Definitely a mom-and-pop&#39;s place.  There is nothing new, or dazzling, or any particular feature that stands out in this restaurant.  It is clean, and small, not good for large groups.  There was a TV on the back wall playing a football game, and a deer head placed for decoration.  You walk in, and are immediately in line to order your meal before finding a booth or table to sit.

Food:  The menu is not varied, but if you come to this place, then you would already know you are ordering a steak, or a burger (corn dog and grilled cheese for the little ones, if any traveling with you).  I had ordered a T-bone, rare.  The food was ready quick, as it is cooked in front of you, as soon as you order.  The steak was cooked to exactly how I wanted.  It came along with a small baked potato, small side salad, and a toast.  I also snagged a few roasted jalapeños for my steak.  U With a drink, how can you not beat that for less than $20?  The steak was tender, and cooked as I like it.  Another companion had a cheeseburger, and the beef patty was cooked just right as well.  Her fries were freshly cooked, not sitting under warmer, as you would see in many other restaurants with open kitchens.  

Service:  Not much to brag on, but it was quick and friendly at the register.  Plenty of employees to chat with their regulars in between their cleaning tables and taking orders.

Don&#39;t expect a restaurant with all the frills of lump crab topping with butter blanc, or truffle oil, or etc.  Do expect a good down-to-earth mom and pop&#39;s restaurant with quick service and good steak.  We&#39;ll be back here on our next visit.  Guaranteed.

Wish I hadn&#39;t . Although I love the concept of how the restaurant is set up , the food execution was poor. Ordered a medium rare small filet , the first time it came out it was barely seared to a rare. I debated sending it back and after taking one bite I had to . When it came back it was still stone cold and for a filet it  was super Chewy. I ate the seared outside and left the rest since I didn&#39;t have time to send it back again . I rated this place two stars only because of the friendliness of the bartender even though she didn&#39;t inquire as to why the majority of my steak was still bleeding out on my plate . The prices are excellent but I would rather pay more for an edible meal ."

Completely unpretentious and a great place to sometimes score a few extra bones from the kitchen for your dog at home."

What Columbine is:
-Walk up and order at the counter steak diner
-&#34;All inclusive&#34; pricing (steak, small side salad, choice of potato, toast)
-Divey interior, self-seating, no table service
-Cash ONLY
-Rather unbeatable price for the reasonable steak that you get ($12-20 for complete meals)
-A great place to people watch

What Columbine is not:
-A &#34;full service restaurant&#34; with servers
-A good place for a first date
-Vegetarian friendly

I believe that the large number of five-star ratings reflect the nostalgic quality of this establishment, as well as the quality-to-price ratio that really is impressive. However, if you want a really good steak (as in REALLY good, dry-aged, USDA prime cut of beef), you&#39;ll be willing to pay a steeper price (and do so with plastic). If price is a limiting factor, Columbine is your place to go to keep both your bank account and carnivorous cravings in check."

This is a good place to go for a cheap steak especially for those purists who like nothing on their steak. I was ok with my porterhouse but my wife loved her filet. I guess I like more seasonings on my steak as it seemed to lack salt and flavor for me. Cant beat the price though... Under 40 dollars for both of us. Just a heads up for first timers... There are 2 sides to this restaurant. The side of the restaurant that has the grill is self serve. You order at the grill and pick up at the grill, no waitstaff, no frills.

Their meals have always been good and certainly affordable. However this time I was in a wheelchair having just fractured my leg. Please know this was the hardest place to get into. It is not handicapped accessible.  The main door has not only a step up but also a small left turn when you go in and not negotiable with a chair. So they sent us in through the bar area. However that too has a step and a bad immediate right turn which also can not be negotiated while in the chair. So I had to get out of the chair and helped in on one leg. Could not sit in the chair at the table either since there was no room for the chair and then barely room to put the chair anywhere.  
So while the food is good you would want to reconsider going there if you are not able to walk in on your own"

Friendly service but don&#39;t expect your hand held!  We had a T-bone and New York ordered medium rare.  They were pretty busy at the time so the order took a while.  I wasn&#39;t sure if someone was bringing out our steaks or if I had to get them. As I watched the floor, people were doing a little bit of both.

One of the two men cooking the steaks came out and asked if I was waiting on a New York and T-bone which I confirmed.  Shortly afterwards, I went up to check on the order and they said it was coming up right now.  I am assuming they missed my T-bone and had to cook it on the fly.  The T-bone was cooked well on the loin side and medium on the strip side.  My wife&#39;s New York was well done to the point of being dry. Nice char flavor though and a decent cut of meat...can&#39;t beat the value for the price!  Typical iceberg lettuce salad which was not drained all the way so a little water logged.  Never got our Texas toast but the little baked potato was really good.

Bottom line...go for the value and the nostalgia.  It will not disappoint.  Even with the disappointments, we STILL enjoyed our dinner.  Tempted to give it a 3 star but it lived up to it&#39;s reputation...so 4 stars it is!"

A family business that provides awesome buttery toast, baked potato, salad and steak of all sorts.  Grab some grilled jalapenos to pair with the steak and some honey for the toast. I&#39;d give them 4.5 stars but I&#39;m rounding down because sometimes they overcook the steak. It&#39;s still a great flavor though and definitely preferred compared to Cowbobas.

I shared the porter house with my boyfriend. Between the huge steak and sides, it was plenty of food for the two of us. The meal for two cost $20!

I chose Columbine based on the reviews but when we pulled up to the building, I told my buddies that we could go somewhere else as this was not the type of high-end steakhouse that I had in mind.  My friends wouldn&#39;t hear of changing spots - mostly to give me a hard time - and I am so thankful that we didn&#39;t.

The food was very good for the price and while there was a line, it moved quickly and orderly.  The only think that I would have done differently in the future is realize that they have a lounge next door where we could have enjoyed wine or beer with our dinner.  I ordered the T-bone steak medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.  The meat was tasty and tender - but without any nasty tenderizer falling-apart character.  It was slightly under-seasoned but that was easily rectified with salt &amp; pepper.  My salad was not inspiring or fancy (go somewhere else if you want field greens) but it hit the spot on a weekend that was lacking in vegetable intake.  The potato was also super straight forward but very good with plenty o&#39; butter.

I imagine that you would need to spend double to get better quality than the meal we enjoyed here."

I have a feeling that if Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation ever visited Colorado, this would be his kind of place.  Meat, and lots of it!  A friend of mine drove me here, and looking at the outside, I was thinking, &#34;Um, what kind of hell have you dragged me to?&#34;  Good thing I opened my mind because this is my new favorite steak place.

The steak... oh that steak!  T-bones the size of my head (and if you&#39;ve never met me, I have a big head).  And I devour it, picking it up by the bone to make sure that I get EVERY piece of meat off that bone (I&#39;m a lady, that way).

The salad is plain ole lettuce, with your choice of dressing that&#39;s been sitting out on the bar all day.  The baked potato is simple, but loaded with buttery goodness.  The Texas toast is the perfect side to soak up all that grease and butter.

The service upfront leaves a bit to be desired, but the food comes out more quickly.  If you sit in the lounge area, then you receive waiter service.  It&#39;s a cheap steak place, so no complaints here.

Cash only. Make it rain on that beef!"

We ordered at the counter and navigated things with the help of the friendly cashier.

The steaks were good. I got salad (standard fare of iceberg lettuce and Italian dressing) and a baked potato.

While we finished our meal, we watched a big dolly filled with HUGE pieces of beef being rolled into the kitchen. It was impressive.

When you walk in, you might be put off by the shabby decor, but look past that to the great tasting steaks that are being cooked in front of your face.  

At the cafeteria-style counter, you take a tray and order what you want.  You take your salad and your drink and have a seat to eat your first course while they cook your steak.  You have to watch for them to signal to you that your steak is done.  There are no order numbers and it seems a bit disorganized, but everyone gets their steak. That is all that matters.  Isn&#39;t it?

I ordered a porterhouse.  It was cooked medium (how I like it) and it was the size of my face.  I worried, at first, about the cheap-looking steak knives and their ability to cut.  This was a non-issue.  I could have cut that steak with a butter knife.  There was steak sauce on the table; it wasn&#39;t needed.  The steak was flavorful and delicious. 

I forwent (is that a word?) a dinner at an expensive steak house and came here instead.  For less than $20, I got a beautiful steak that would put some of the more expensive places to shame. At this place, it&#39;s all about the steak!  You should go there."

When I was visiting home this past Christmas, you were on that list of places to go before coming back to California.  Unfortunately, Christmas day was the only day I could have gone to get some of your cheap, juicy, greasy, fatty steak but there was no way I could force you to open just for little old me.  

I FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE because it&#39;s worth the money.  Columbine&#39;s has the cheapest steaks I&#39;ve ever seen AND it comes with a salad with your preferable choice of dressing, texas toast, and a baked potato!!!  You can&#39;t beat that. for I think a 12 oz. for $12.  Prices might have went up but I doubt it went up that much more.  My boyfriend would order the Porterhouse and I think that alone was just $16!!!  As far as the drink, I don&#39;t remember it coming with the meal but I usually get water anyways.

As far as the way it looks, it&#39;s not that appealing.  Heck, this place looks like they&#39;re violating multiple health codes, but I&#39;m sure they keep the place clean enough to serve food.  It&#39;s not the cleanest restaurant, but in a way, the dirty look and feel to Columbine&#39;s is what makes it Columbine&#39;s.  It gives Columbine that character.  Hard to explain but you&#39;ve got to go for yourself.

BRING CASH!!!  CASH ONLY~~~  

If you don&#39;t, they do have an ATM machine on the bar side of Columbine&#39;s, which is more of a sit down area.  I mean, I think it&#39;s even worth eating up the ATM fee just to get Columbine&#39;s because I can&#39;t stop emphasizing that this place is dirt cheap so if you end up getting the porterhouse, you&#39;d only be spending about $21!  

Think it&#39;s too dirty?  Drive down on Federal to Evans and you&#39;ll see a place called Cowboba.  Similar idea except it is a sit down restaurant - much cleaner, and less greasier.  They also sell boba too.  Foods good, but my heart is forever loyal to Columbine&#39;s.

Once inside I was a bit confused as if I should sit or not but it was explained to me that the north side (separated by a wall with a doorway) was for a server while the south side (the one I entered through) was self serve. I chose to be waited on so I went to the other side. The place was 95% full but I  only had to wait long enough for a table to be cleared. I noticed food particles in the booth and on the floor. The server was fast and courteous and didn&#39;t forget a thing. She stopped by to check on us every 6 to 7 min even though she was the only one working the tables. I ordered the T Bone steak med rare and that is how it came to the table. The steak was on par for the price only because I had cut out 1/4 of undesirable pieces. The salad was very bisic in that it looked like the bagged lettuce with flecks of purple and orange in it that you can get from Wal Mart. The baked potato and toasted bread were acceptable sides. Biggest complaint would be the low maintenance of the property inside and out which Coen sides with the moderate cleaning practices.

A few things to know ahead of time:

1) Cash only. Don&#39;t rely on the ATM because it was out of service when we visited.
2) Place your order, pay, and find a place to sit down. There is not much room to maneuver around here, either at the counter or around tables. It&#39;s kind of a one-way loop. They will find you and bring your food, or at least they did when we were there last week.
3) Don&#39;t let the &#34;steakhouse&#34; title fool you. This place is a dive with decent food at a reasonable price. Don&#39;t dress up or you&#39;ll feel silly. You&#39;ve been warned.

My takeaway:
-- Food - 4/5 stars (Don&#39;t get excited about the salad because it&#39;s wilty iceberg lettuce but the steak and potatoes are quite tasty)
-- Atmosphere - 3/5 stars (You&#39;re eating in a real slice of Americana - this place has been around since the 50&#39;s with not much updating)

One Saturday morning gather up a group of cool friends for brunch and head to Atomic Cowboy. Indulge in their delicious bloody marys and chat while perusing their Denver Biscuit Company menu. When you have decided which concoction of flaky goodness should get in your belly, order it! My favorite is the apple butter one but they&#39;re all great. Enjoy your wonderful breakfast (maybe with another bloody or two)

Now, since it is a Saturday and you don&#39;t have anywhere to be, everyone relax and chat and have a few more drinks.

Eventually you guys will realize that you have been there for a hot minute and probably need another nosh. Hey, you&#39;re in luck! By this time Fat Sally&#39;s pizza will be on the docket so this should be your obvious choice for food.

Now keep in mind that not only is the pizza freaking delicious, it&#39;s freaking huge. Personally I&#39;d go with ordering slices. They are fold in half huge slices. You can pick any toppings you&#39;d like. If you are with a big party, go ahead and order the whole pie!

Pizza makes you thirsty and it&#39;s a little late in the day for bloody&#39;s so naturally it&#39;s time for you to peruse the tap list. It&#39;s a big one and well rounded so everyone should be able to find something they like.

Now, after you guys have finished up your wonderful day here, remember to tip generously because the staff is amazing and they deserve it.

Welcome to my last Saturday. Cheers guys, it was amazing! :-)"

They have a few locations in Denver, I visited the one on South Broadway. Great atmosphere, great beer selection and great service. 

Our server was fantastic and I got a couple slices of the Fat Sully&#39;s pizza. Our server said, only get two slices if you are really hungry and he was correct. The slices are huge and one would have been enough. The topping selection was great, the crust was great, the sauce had good flavor and it was not greasy. 

I have also had their biscuits at the Cherry Creek farmers market from the Denver Biscuit Company food truck and those are fantastic as well. 

Highly recommend this place."

The Denver Biscuit company in the morning until 2:00 (3:00 on weekends) serves amazing biscuit concoctions. Then Fat Sully&#39;s kicks in until late. 

Come in, sit down, order the 26&#34; pie with your choice of ingredients  and laugh when it hits the table. It&#39;s not a touristy thing. 

The pizza is like all kidding aside really good and being a transplanted New Yorker I like to think my pizza opinion carries some weight!! 

One down side is they have recently made the side street parking permit only so prepare to go on a treasure hunt searching for a parking space. Add that in to your time factor and be prepared to possibly walk blocks.

Regardless the Atomic Cowboy, parking hell notwithstanding still gets 5 stars hands down!!"

He usually gets the &#34;Big ass slice&#34;, which is pretty big, but also very tasty. The place was packed at 8:00 and it certainly takes a while to get your food, about 30 minutes- totally worth it though.

Came during the day and have never before seen biscuits used as burger buns, but that&#39;s how they use them here, and even though I know it wasn&#39;t good for me, I had to eat the whole thing it was that good.

It was so so tasty. The sausage gravy had big lumps of sausage in and had such a good flavour to it, I could probably have just eaten a biscuit with gravy and it be incredible.

The price is great, the servings are big and the service is top notch. I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t have the chance (or the room in my tummy) to eat any of their pizza, but looking at the size of the Alice&#39;s coming out of the kitchen I would say you certainly get your money&#39;s worth!

Like when there are only two of you and you order a 26&#34; pizza. Stop what you&#39;re doing and really think about that. TWENTY SIX INCHES. It was so big it didn&#39;t fit on the pan. It was so big it didn&#39;t fit in the to-go box. It was BIG. 

Then there&#39;s the 12&#34; gluten free pizza. It was good gluten free pizza, but beware: it was $21. I got three toppings. That&#39;s an expensive pizza. On the plus side, they deliver! I pay big money for people to make things and deliver them to me.

We went for the pizza after hiking all day. I know we did not look the greatest, but service was exceptionally poor, we got 0 refills and it seems as though as soon as we said we weren&#39;t there to drink, the server was rushing us out the door.
The pizza took about 30 minutes to get at 10:00 at night. The pizza was below Pizza Hut quality in my opinion. 
The establishment does have board games which was nice to play while we waited on our food.

The truth is, I have a pizza problem and after I discovered the Atomic Cowboy/Fat Sulley&#39;s Pizza it became worse. It&#39;s close to home and very convenient.
The Atomic Cowboy is actually the name of the bar and there are two places that make the food inside. Fat Sulley&#39;s does the pizza and Denver Biscuit Co. does the biscuit sandwiches/more brunch-ey items. The three combined are amazing! 
The bar has a great selection of local craft brews along with an eclectic drink list. One of my favorites is the Strawberry Rhubarb Mule. 
As for the food, as I said previously the pizza does not disappoint. The slices are HUGE. I learned my lesson when I ordered two and it was basically the size of a medium pizza. They don&#39;t skimp on toppings either. You get a good amount for what you pay. The salad they have is also amazing! It&#39;s so simple, but so good. Their dressings are really yummy, they taste like they are made from scratch. 
Unfortunately, I have not had the biscuit breakfast sandwiches. I am a vegetarian and there it not an option for me as far as that goes. They do have vegetarian gravy for the biscuits and gravy, which I will have to try one of these days. I have had the cinnamon roll and it is big enough to share with three other people. So.good."

They have so many micro brew beers on draft, they switch them out frequently so they are listed on the menu as &#34;seasonal&#34; along with the name of the brewery. 

They have Denver Biscuit Co. food in the morning and Fat Sully&#39;s pizza in the afternoon/evening. The pizza is so good! We shared a slice because they are so big. It is $3.50 for a slice, regular toppings are $0.40 and premium toppings are $0.60.

I enjoy focusing my energy on places that make me and other people smile and I always want to share that! However, this last Saturday I can&#39;t be positive towards my experience and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 
(Looks as though there is another review about this.)

Sparing everyone from all the details, let&#39;s just say several of the staff were not friendly (mainly focusing this comment on the doorman). A friend dropped a beer after being bumped. After trying to make things right, of which included cleaning up the glass on the floor and asking if we could help with anything, the doorman hit us with some rude comments .(&#34;Just cash out and leave.&#34;)

Another friend proceeded to apologize,  of which the doorman told this person, &#34;You have nothing to do with this!&#34;  

I can honestly say I will think twice about hitting this place up next time. I have worked in the restaurant/bar business and there is no reason to treat loyal customers (or any customer)  like this, especially for a spilled beer.

Thank you and I hope my next experience will be more positive."

Bar could have a bit more knowledge of classic cocktails but not going to ding a place like this for something like that. Knowing how to make an old fashioned at a pizza restaurant is what I think earns a place extra points. Gluten free pizza should be available in individual slices since the normal individual pizza slices at this place are about the size of roughly half of their 12&#34; gluten free pizza. If they could add some more options to the pizza toppings like chicken and broccoli that would be awesome too. Always ways places can improve but overall I will be back and Would hands down recommend Atomic Cowboy to anyone."

I go in, it&#39;s mid-day on a Saturday. I&#39;m hungry, I&#39;m ready to have a couple beers and a lunch. I&#39;m ahead of my partner by 15 minutes, which is what I tell the hostess. 

She tells me they can&#39;t seat incomplete parties. Doesn&#39;t offer me a seat at the bar, or on the totally empty patio even though it&#39;s a nice day. Doesn&#39;t even look at whether the tables are empty. Just lets me turn around, walk outside and wait on a bench. Because it&#39;s a rule, you guys. A very important rule. Where would we be without rules? A lawless society, I tell you!

Now, I understand in a busy joint on a busy day. You don&#39;t want someone sitting for a half hour when you can turn that table. I get it too, I wouldn&#39;t show up and demand a table for 6 before anyone else shows up. But come on. There were three, small, empty tables right near the door, and like I said, I told her that my partner would be there in the next 15 minutes or so. My one other person.

So I waited on the bench, my partner showed up, and then, THEN it was cool to seat us at one of the same tables that was still empty from when I first arrived, probably less than ten minutes ago, as it turned out.

Instead of a 2-beer lunch, I had a none beer lunch. Out of spite. 

Why did the hostess have to be such a robot about it? Look, if you&#39;re gonna get in trouble with your manager, just tell me your manager is a hard ass about it, otherwise you&#39;d let me sit. Maybe offer me a glass of water? ASK if I might want to sit at the bar until my partner arrives? Or outside on the currently-deserted patio? Ask me if it&#39;s really going to be fifteen minutes or if it&#39;s more like 30? Maybe do any sort of thing that makes it seem like you&#39;d enjoy having me at your restaurant? Treat me like a human man who wants to buy food things from you instead of a hostile invader who is probably lying about his guest, who is really nineteen people and they&#39;re nineteen hours late.

The incomplete party thing was the most offensive part of the whole ordeal, by the way. I&#39;m the original party animal. All of my fellow diners may not have arrived, but believe me, THE PARTY IS HERE! It doesn&#39;t get more party than this.

I know you&#39;ve got a business to run. But I&#39;ll do some math for you. I knocked a good $10-$12 off my bill because I felt badly treated and because I&#39;m not gonna have a couple beers if I can&#39;t sit down and drink a couple beers at grown-up pace on a Saturday afternoon. What you gained there was...oh yeah. Nothing. No one claimed any of those empty tables. 

Some of the staff here is so super nice, but man, it just sucked to sit out on that bench when I could have been inside with a nice beer."

Breakfast pot pie is awesome but found out it&#39;s changed to seasonal dish only.  The sausage gravy is to die for. Honey glazed bacon is also a real treat.

Great pizza with HUUUUUGE slices at a reasonable price. Pretty solid beer list (though no bargains for craft beer fans here). And amazing biscuits.

They had some breweries on tap that I only to smile at the bar tender and say... &#39;you guys must be special as you have this on tap&#39;. This place literally made me smile by the service and selection of beers, cool decor and creative cocktails for the non beer drinkers. It&#39;s more unique then the bars in the area as the owner of atomic cowboy got fat sullys and Denver biscuit co together to make an awesome little joint you may want to try. They sell slices, full pizza pies and my lady... well she went for the bacon salad for one. On that note they have my vote for a visit if you&#39;re in the area. They have awesome breakfast that is comprised biscuit concoctions that are a true chefs creativity at work.

AC has been one of my favorite spots over the last few years, so when I spotted the Broadway location this past weekend, I knew I had to check it out.

It&#39;s essentially a clone of the original but a wee bit smaller:  plenty of bar space, ample amount of tables, and as always, a killer tap list.  Fat Sully&#39;s Pizza and the Denver Biscuit Company are rockin&#39; it out as well.

I really love this place because you get best of the both worlds. If you&#39;re down for biscuits, they&#39;ve got it and if you&#39;re down for pizza they&#39;ve got that too!

Had a slice of pizza and some wine one night. The pizzas are huge - bigger than my face and soooo good. You pick your toppings and the pizza is out within 10 mins.

First of all, the staff is AWESOME!!  Hannah took excellent care of us, and the manager (Shayla, I think), came over more than once to interact with us.  Their service was above and beyond.

We tried every specialty drink they offered.  The supermosa and the grapefruit caiparosca are excellent.  Others may have not been my taste, but were still mixed well.  The tap list is great too.

That men&#39;s room should not have smelled that clean.  Seriously, it was really clean.  Wow.

It&#39;s set up just like the original, complete with Fat Sully&#39;s and DBC in the same spots.  The bar has a great layout with an upper deck above it.  

We had so much fun here that we stayed for an entire Sunday.  My cousin and I came here about 11:30 and within a couple hours we were joined by a few friends.  We didn&#39;t want to leave.

I walked in at 9:15am and spoke with the host at the front stand, 5&#39;5&#34;, wearing glasses with long red hair in tied up in a bun and he also a had a beard.  Asked him if I could get on the waiting list and told him the size of the group, for some reason he just started off with a bad attitude.  I get that, I worked as a server and a host at restaurants for several years and when you work at a place that gets really busy, you get irritated, I understand, but still, you try to do your best to be nice to your customers, because without your customers, you don&#39;t have a business.  I don&#39;t know how this guys day started, but I don&#39;t feel that the attitude I got was warranted.  So he informed me that it is going to be an hour and a half wait with a lot of attitude coming out of his voice, I stated that would be okay, let&#39;s get on the list.  He told me that my group would also have to be split up into two tables of 6 and 6, again, the attitude was not very pleasant, and I did look at him and told him that we want our group together, so I need him to figure that part out for us, he told me that he did figure it out, and he just told me what the solution was, okay, sorry for asking you to do your job, but hey, I won&#39;t be a jerk to you, it&#39;s not the right thing to do, I accepted the spot on the wait list and waited for my friends outside.  My friends arrive and me and another guy in my group decide to go scope out the restaurant to see if there is a solution to the problem with our sizeable group, as we have both worked in restaurants for good portions of our lives, maybe there is something that they are not seeing that we can help out with.  We look at the floor plan and it&#39;s almost impossible to accommodate a group of our size, so I understand why the front host told us that he could not make that work, the place just isn&#39;t setup for that, but again, the attitude was not warranted.  My friend and I look around a little more and they have a back patio with several tables out there and no one sitting at them.  We thought if we go up to the front and talk to them about the patio area that it would be possible to accommodate our party out there.  This time we spoke with a female with short brown hair, 5&#39;5&#34;, but she didn&#39;t look very happy either.  We presented our idea to her, and she informed us that they do not have enough servers to take our party out there.  We asked her if she wanted to ask a server if they might want to take our table.  In my experience in the restaurant industry, you shouldn&#39;t have your patrons figure out the problem for you, and you never turn away service because you don&#39;t have enough servers.  Not once in my time as a server in any restaurant did I ever see a customer not have their needs met because we had available seating.  So she informed us again that she does not make the policy and procedures and that they do not have enough available servers to take our party back there and the patio is closed.  It was a beautiful summer day and you don&#39;t want to ask any of your staff if they want to take our table, especially since we are all from the service industry, it&#39;s a good size table, the tip in the end is going to be pretty good I would think.  So, we ask for a manager, I was not present for this part and let my friend handle this conversation, I was to frustrated to continue this exchange.  Perhaps I should have stuck around though, because the end result was my friend storming out of the restaurant yelling to all the other patrons waiting that the wait is to long and to take your business somewhere else.  Okay, the end result was really not good, but the pretentious and unnecessarily negative attitude from the get go was not warranted.  I won&#39;t be returning to this establishment ever again and it sucks, cause they make pretty good pizza, but if you are going to treat your customers like that, you have to realize that people, good paying customers, that probably see things from your perspective too and sympathize with your situation, aren&#39;t going to come back, then you are doing something really really wrong.  Sucks, but it&#39;s true.  I hope you guys tighten up your staff to be nicer to your future customers."

Tonight I paid $2.75 to add spinach to my pizza.  All topics were a minimum $2.00 so think twice before you add 2 tiny leaves of basil.  That 12&#34; neapolitan with a few toppings becomes the most expensive pizza you have ever ordered really quickly.  

Next, the beer list is great.  Unfortunately, the minimum $6 price tag is not warranted.  Tonight, an Odell 90 Schill cost me $6!  Buyer beware.  The cost of carrying unique beer is passed on to the customer (note: 90 Schill isn&#39;t even a unique beer).   

I don&#39;t often write reviews, but the expense of this evening warrants a warning to all diners - think twice before eating here, with all the great options you have on s. Broadway, take a chance and eat anywhere but here.

One complaint...ALL of the parking spots in the back (maybe 10 or so) are reserved for Atomic Cowboy staff..HUH??? In this neighborhood street parking is really hard to find so I just don&#39;t get why they wouldn&#39;t provide any parking for customers."

The beer selection is good, the pizza and biscuits are really good too. However, while visiting there this past Saturday with a large group of friends I had a very poor customer service interaction. Now, I will add context by saying I am a former waiter and bartender, so I know how challenging their job can be, but customer service should always be a priority.

A good friend of mine ordered a beer from the bar, and upon turning around from the bar accidentally bumped into someone who was walking by (it was pretty crowded) and dropped her beer on the floor. It was really not a big deal, these types of things happen in crowded bars, right? Wrong. The &#34;Security&#34;, aka Chad-Bro as was later dubbed, came over and made sure to regulate and impose his authority. He very rudely came over and said that our party should leave immediately as he literally began mopping over our feet with the nasty mop without apology. 

Now I know what you&#39;re thinking, we were probably too drunk and deserved it. Well, we weren&#39;t. Most people in our group had had 1-3 beers by this point, not a single one of us were sloppy, especially to the point of needing to be kicked out. When asked for his name, Chad-Bro again rudely brushed us off and continued angrily mopping over our feet. When asked why we needed to leave, Chad-Bro had enough and stared me down as though he were a police officer, and re-iterated himself in a much more bro-ish tone. The stare down was rather comical in retrospect.

I go to South Broadway to escape the &#34;bros&#34;. I enjoy the vibe on Broadway much more than LoDo for that exact reason. Now maybe Chad-Bro was having a tough night, maybe his bro broke his Xbox controller or something, maybe someone was beefing on his sweet hockey flow that he proudly sports, I don&#39;t know. But I do know that there is one thing that trumps all in the service industry. You treat your customers right and with respect, even if they accidentally (and soberly) spill a beer on your floor. It happens, get over it Chad-Bro. I think you&#39;d be a better fit working as &#34;Security&#34; for a bar downtown, or just down the street at Punch Bowl Social. Go be with your people, bro. I hope the owners see this, and seriously question whether or not Chad-Bro is the right fit for the atmosphere you&#39;re trying to create at your otherwise very pleasant bar and restaurant."

I was running a workshop in the Baker neighborhood and was crammed for time, but still wanted a diverse food selection at an affordable price while still showcasing Denver&#39;s food scene. That was theme for the whole weekend. (side note: I dislike local events that highlight the convenient and typical along with chain restaurants). I was upfront about my time sensitive needs and my group was seated quickly. It seemed forever until the waitress came along, so I was looking around, and nervously checking my watch. She finally arrived, well aware of our needs, got our orders quickly. 

Things I discovered:
you can order a biscuit dish without the biscuit
be up front about your needs
ask for separate checks before starting. Life is easier this way
AC can take care of you even when in a rush.
the booths comfortably fit 6
they have cool coffee cups"

We get the biscuit with fried chicken, pickles, and honey and it is unbelievable. It will taste like a mash up of your favorite childhood KFC memory, only not disgusting - delicious! We also get the cinnamon roll which is insane. You have to be in the mood for some seriously heavy food, but it is SO good. 

Also, a few other things worth mentioning. The wine is served in juice glasses. No big deal, but if you are a glassware person it&#39;s something to consider. Be prepared to wait if you&#39;re having dinner. Although it is a fairly sizable restaurant, for some reason the layout has very minimal seating. The beer always tastes to me like there is soap in the glass. And I&#39;m a pretty seasoned beer drinker, so."

We were greeted at the door by an extremely bored looking hostess who pointed at the bar. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes without the bartender making eye contact with us, asking us for a drink or even acknowledging our presence. We watched as she made HERSELF two drinks, and slam things around the bar like she was angry. Then, after trying to get her attention nicely she walked right past us and began chatting with coworkers. It&#39;s one thing to be really busy, but there was maybe 5 customers in the whole restaurant. We walked out of the restaurant never once being acknowledged."

While we were waiting I wanted to grab a beer at the bar. It is the restaurant&#39;s policy to not accept temporary IDs as a warning to all. My old ID was VOID since I was waiting for my CO license in the mail but still had the temp paper CO license to go with it. The manager gave me a free drink for the inconvenience. After that all finished, we got seated and the wait was well worth it. The food was delicious and would definitely return."

Unfortunately, we missed biscuits by about 4 hours (They&#39;re served 8-3 on Saturdays, for those in the know, which we weren&#39;t. Boo!). However, we were quickly cheered by the pizza menu that includes a gluten free option and our server, who was cheerful and helpful in making recommendations. We ended up with a pie that was half pepperoni and half veggie. Hubs is experimenting with making more vegan eating choices and the kitchen was kind enough to leave cheese off half of our pie. We had the 12&#34;, about 4 slices for each, and there wasn&#39;t much left on my side or any left on his. The gluten free crust was good stuff and I&#39;d order it again without the need to sample other versions. Atmosphere was definitely a big change from when Mona&#39;s and Red Canary graced the building, but fitting. Lots of cool welding work, exposed beams, the trademark neon cowboy and funky artwork.

My husband and I  ordered  the catfish sandwich, a biscuit with cheese and vegi gravy, and slice of cheese pizza. The catfish sandwich was good, the vegi gravy was like a shepards pie gravy( not my style) I would prefer it to be a country vegi gravy, my biscuit was not fluffy or soft it was hard and dense, and for the slice of pizza I never received and didn&#39;t want to ask for it bc our waitress seemed like she was bored and in a bad mood. We also ordered a beer, first asked the waitress the prices bc they&#39;re not listed. The one we decided on she said was $3, but on the bill it was $5 (you would think she would correct it or should have checked if she didn&#39;t know the prices). Then to top it off we realized we ordered the beer about 10 mins out from happy hour. You would think that if she would have mentioned this. Not very interested in going again."

I ended up settling for a chicken biscuit sandwich when the Ben Franklin didn&#39;t work out. I wish I had tried one of the sandwiches withOUT the gravy. The biscuits are good, but mine tasted like it was microwaved upon ordering. Fighting words, I know. But this isn&#39;t a complaint... hell it&#39;s a miracle they got these biscuits to rise in Denver in the first place.

Watering down an already watery beer? Also not a huge fan of the fact that you can only order by the slice,  or a full blown 26&#34; pie if you dine in. If they are tossing dough in the back for delivery that is of the more medium sizes, what reason is there not to serve that to your customers who actually come into your establishment.

The neighborhood has been suffering from an overwhelming amount of apathetic, rude, lazy and sometimes downright mean bartenders and waitpersons. The whole, &#34;I&#39;m entitled to be a prick and you should realize that it&#39;s a privilege to be in my bar and have me serving you,&#34; is really getting old. Atomic Cowboy is a breath of fresh air, particularly in this respect.  

I&#39;m relatively easy to please: don&#39;t pad my bill, ask if I want a drink somewhat regularly, act moderately polite, and don&#39;t act like I&#39;m asking you for a fucking kidney when asked to split the bill for a group of people (also, if you&#39;re going to drop the bill on the table and run away before anyone can ask, at least itemize the bill.) Currently AC is one of the few places on South Broadway that accomplishes all of these things. Actually it might be the only place. 

It really would be hard to say enough about how nice and attentive the staff is here. Great decor as well, and drink prices aren&#39;t brutal. 

The only drawback, I guess, is that the place doesn&#39;t really have a party vibe which can be fun sometimes. But that&#39;s splitting hairs. 

Keep it up, AC. And please, Rest of Broadway, take notes."

Our terrible experience started out as soon as we walked through the door. Apparently some of the staff don&#39;t care for mixed-race couples because we were greeted with the most ridiculous glaring we&#39;ve ever experienced in Colorado. Now, we know not everyone is comfortable around people of other races, we just don&#39;t give a shit about the discomfort of a bigot. The hostess was very sweet so we decided to stay and eat.
We eventually got a waitress to take our order and bring our drinks. Slow, but not terrible. But when the drinks were deliversed (by another member of the wait staff) they were unceremoniously placed on the end of the table just as he vanished from sight. Then nothing...for what seemed like an eternity. I thought we might have to launch a rescue mission to find our waitress about 15 minutes after my glass went dry the first time. Then suddenly she appeared and set the plates in front of us. Of course she got the orders mixed up so we traded plates as she asked if everything was alright. Once again she vanished. The food was fair, and hot, nothing spectacular...not that we expected it to be. 
Once again, as I finished my meal, I found myself staring at the bottom of my glass, wishing I could wash down the last bite...and our waitress was nowhere to be found. Another 10 or 15 minutes went by before she finally showed up to ask if we needed anything. I guess she must not have noticed my empty glass, so I asked her if I might have a refill, and I even said please. She said of course, and picked up my glass by the rim and walked away. Good thing I always use a straw. This time she must have remembered her way back because it wasn&#39;t long at all before she brought back my iced tea, with a big slice of lemon on the rim she had fingered a few moments prior. Of course, I had specifically asked for no lemon...
So, finally we stood to leave and walked to the register to pay our bill. When we got there, my girlfriend placed the check and her credit card on the counter and the woman behind the counter picked up her drink, put the straw to her lips and began sipping it, while looking right at us. The look on her face said, &#34;What do you want?&#34; But her mouth said nothing at all. Not a thing. Not even, &#34;how was your meal?&#34; or &#34;was everything alright?&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m so happy to see you survived.&#34; Just silence. She ran my girlfriend&#39;s card and then, without even giving us the paper to sign, placed the ticket in a stack of others under the counter... Unbelievable. 
How in the world this place is still in business is beyond me. If you want to eat here, I have to admit I don&#39;t know why you would, but if you do...hurry. With service like this, they&#39;ll be closing very soon, I&#39;m sure."

The food portions are huge especially considering the prices.  My girl had a breakfast plate with their special potatoes, egg, and about 4-6 pieces of bacon.  Well not just pieces mind you but very long strips of bacon.  She also got a waffle and had more than enough to eat and was able to box a lot of it and have breakfast the next day too.  I had the Mazatlan skillet which had avocado, scrambled egg (my selection but you can have your eggs any way you&#39;d ilke), bacon, and their special potatoes all smothered in green chili and cheese.  My dish also came with 2 pancakes that were so buttery and delicious.  The meal filled us both up but not uncomfortably so like other cafes we&#39;d eaten at of this style.

The nearest establishment to that Asian Market, is Yanna&#39;s Café.  Hence to Yanna&#39;s Café we went.  This recent visit was on Sunday January 18th 2015.  Time was about 13:25rs ish.

From their Simple Menu, in which many items to choose we opt to have the following items :

*  Steak Fajitas Omelet $9.95 with choice of Pancakes
*  Gyro Sandwich with Fries $8.25
*  Coffee

Our lovely server, make sure Hubs Coffee is filled periodically.  Though I cannot deny, the need to train the staff/server better coz she told us, she is new, working at Yanna&#39;s Café.  She came back like twice, coz she was not sure about the Ingredients of certain dishes, that I ask about.

In terms of food, its huge portions.  Hubs is OK with what he had, though I cannot deny, maybe Hubs is too hungry that he finished everything.  The Steak Fajitas Omelet, comes with Onions, Mushrooms, Peppers, Ribeye Strips and Cheddar Cheese.  Well most of the time, Hubs always finished his Brunch/Lunch, unless there are plenty for Leftovers.

Since I already had Brunch with my friends, I ate some of the Fries and Gyro, and even have some Leftovers.  The Gyro is the &#34;standard&#34; kind of Gyro.  Nothing stood out, NOTHING WOW me.  *SIGH*

All in all a Decent Diner, though I would not drive all the way just to have Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch here.  There are many other establishments in town that we would love to explore.

That afternoon our Lunch with tax is $22.  HUGE Portions, Reasonable Pricing!  SCORE!  Left Yanna&#39;s café at about 14:10hrs ish.  Err, maybe Yanna&#39;s Café is located at the the &#34;Edge Line&#34; of Denver and Lakewood.  At the Yanna&#39;s Café website, its indicated its located in Denver Zip Code.  While thru YELP its indicated in Lakewood, CO Zip Code.  Hmm..  Just wondering..

They were able to seat a group of us right away and were so nice and friendly. (Gotta love diners for that reason!) 

The food was just what you&#39;d expect and solid. I was extremely tempted by the schmorgasboard of breakfast burrito offerings, but sadly I did not get one because I&#39;d already done burritos the night before for dinner (with leftovers, at that). But burritos came for others at the table, and they looked amazing! And apparently they tasted that way too. And the portions were huge. Could definitely get 2 meals out of one order- unless you&#39;ve got the right appetite. :) 

I got 2 eggs any style with sausage patties, potatoes, and a side of pancakes. The pancakes were actually really great! They make them so that they&#39;re really crispy on side. It was just the pancake I wanted. 

Next time, I&#39;m going for those breakfast burritos...."

After reading the menu we both decided on breakfast skillets - I had the Yanna&#39;s skillet with bacon, loads of potatoes, onions, cheese and eggs, my workmate had the Greek skillet, pretty much the same with gyro meat instead of bacon. I made the mistake of ordering a side of sausage links - a mistake not because the sausage was bad -quite the opposite - three thick and delicious links of a not-spicy sausage - but because the breakfast skillets were *huge*.

I&#39;m a big guy and can put down a lot of food when I&#39;m hungry, but there&#39;s no way I could eat even 3/4 of this meal - it was the size of my head. 

The restaurant was quite busy - I&#39;m guessing there were customers at maybe 20 tables. Two harried but very pleasant waitresses were serving triple duty, also busing and cashiering. It was day #4 on the job for one of them, and the service understandably got slow. They kept apologizing as they whizzed past our table delivering piping hot piles of goodness to the other patrons. Every meal that passed us looked delicious. Their apologies made us chuckle, as it was perfectly clear that they were working as hard and fast as possible - when service is slow for that reason it&#39;s ridiculous to get upset.

I&#39;ll be sure to return here some day when I&#39;m really, really hungry.

For the adventurous, they have a six-egg breakfast burrito loaded with everything but the kitchen sink and other menu items that are much larger than the very generous skillets."

Not only do they feed you like family, they treat you like family!  My absolute favorite is the Yanna&#39;s skillet, eggs over easy, rye toast.      Sounds like a lot of meat at first, but it is nicely balanced with an abundance of fresh cut veggies.  For me it is two meals.  My 15 yr old sons favorite is the country skillet.

It should reek of cigarette smoke. It should have blue clouds of tobacco hovering at shoulder-level. The interior of this place speaks to a bygone era of endless terrible coffee, chain smoking, and crispy, tasty hash browns. The coffee is fairly gnarly, but fits with the setting, no more chain smoking, and their food is shockingly delicious. 

Order a skillet. It comes sizzling to your table by friendly, efficient servers, all of whom I WISH would call me &#34;hon&#34; (they&#39;re the only ones allowed to call me that. Everyone else who tries to hon me gets a glare.) Presented on a cast iron platter, your food stays hot, the potatoes on the bottom stay crispy, and you&#39;ll discover that everything has that freshly made taste and is packed with flavor. 

California skillet. Seasoned, juicy chicken. Crisptatoes. Swiss cheese. Eggs (over medium, please). Fresh avocado. Fajita veggies. Everything is just so fresh!

Our waitress would come out with plates and never knew what table the food would go to. The owner walked around clearing tables but never once asked any customers how they were doing. When we went to pay the cashier never asked how everything was. So I decided to tell him it took us 30 minutes to order and our food was hard and he didn&#39;t say a single thing back. The waitress standing next to him responded with we are really really really really busy. That is the dumbest thing to ever respond with. I honestly believe they need younger waitresses who could handle the rush and not get overwhelmed with 6 tables. I have been a waitress and that is why I always observe how restaurants work.

The food is fine. My favorite is the mass confusion, which is a couple of biscuits, covered in gravy, bacon and scrambled eggs, with a side of home fries. I wish they wouldn&#39;t put the solid slab of egg between the biscuits and the gravy because it keeps the gravy from soaking into the biscuits, but whatever. The biscuits themselves are somewhat variable, ranging from soft to very dense.

The service is generally ok as well. There was one occasion where our English muffin was toasted without being split in half, so the inside wasn&#39;t crispy. Who does that? When I mentioned it to our waitress, she seemed confused by the notion of not just putting the entire thing in the toaster. Oh, THAT&#39;S who does that. Kids these days. Unfortunately, she wasn&#39;t interested in correcting the problem, either, and we ended up just not eating the muffin. Otherwise the service has been fine, my drink is kept filled and usually even refilled the same beverage I ordered. But not always.

The price is good for the amount of food you get. The restaurant itself is a bit of a throwback, with dated interior and supremely uncomfortable seats. There is usually a group of old men sitting in the corner, talking loudly and watching videos on their phones at top volume. It is disquieting and has caused me to choose other breakfast joints over this one from time to time. I hope all the coffee they drink makes up for the revenue loss they cause.

The search for a great breakfast place in Lakewood continues. Stay tuned."

HOWEVER. When the food came out, my opinion changed. Large portions, home-sliced potatoes, hot and tasty food. For awhile there they were not cutting their (homemade?) English muffins before toasting -- leaving them untoasted on the inside (what???), but we asked for them to slice them and from then on they were great. The food here is GOOD, ya&#39;all. 

But I really do wish they&#39;d tell all those old guys to quiet down a little. I realize they&#39;re regulars, and regulars are cool, but I won&#39;t sit anywhere near them because I can&#39;t hear my husband talk. And if there&#39;s nowhere but near them to sit? I leave.

Don&#39;t expect a modern interior, it is more of a classic style inside, but the cleanliness was impeccable and the ambiance was friendly and inviting. I have two reasons this is not a 5-star review;1) Check the beer expiration dates and the freshness of the wine. One of our party noted the expired beer and I could tell my wine was not recently corked. 2) I love Greek food, however the one thing missing was a solid vegetarian Greek option.

This looks like one of those &#34;have been around forever&#34; breakfast places that holds a special place in your heart because you come in and assume it&#39;s owned by a family of a specific ethnic background (or serious passion of a specific type of food, Greek in this case) AND they serve breakfast all day.

One is large chunks of corned beef mixed with onions and maybe other spices then cooked lightly. If you like that I think Zaidy&#39;s Deli in Cherry is pretty good. The other way, and the one most of us are familiar with, is to grind the corned beef in a meat grinder, mix the meat with small diced cooked potatoes and onion and grill it on a very hot grill. For this second way Yanna&#39;s Cafe is the best I&#39;ve found in the Denver area. 

This is a Greek restaurant in a strip mall on South Sheridan so it&#39;s mixed with a ton of Mexican, Vietnamese, and Chinese restaurants. It is a classic diner with a mix of Greek, Mexican, and American foods. The serving staff are old hands, you can tell by the fact that some customers are addressed by name and asked if they want &#39;the usual.&#39; The prices are just right and the portions are very big.

Since I&#39;m pretty new to Colorado, I wanted to find a place that gave plenty of choices when it came to a menu like I had back home. 

Yanna&#39;s was pretty empty when we went in, at about 10 a.m., so we got quick service. I love gyro&#39;s so I opted to get the Gyro Meat Breakfast, which came with gyro meat, home-style potatoes and eggs. My hubby got chicken souvlaki, which was a chicken dish, eggs and home-style potatoes. We LOVED it. Perfectly cooked, tasted homemade and there was enough portions to take home and have a second meal for dinner. 

Pretty inexpensive for the quality and amount of food. We will for sure be going back next time we are in the area."

Morning rolled around way too early, and a friend and I decided that following a night of debauchery, breakfast was in order.  So we made our way to Yanna&#39;s.  About 8:30 in the morning, no wait at all.  We plunked our booties down and had coffee right in front of us.  Followed by a mimosa to get our base on for the day.  Well made, just a hint of OJ makes the flavor!

The menu was big, and I could have spent an hour trying to decide, but the Greek skillet was suggested and man, I wasn&#39;t disappointed!  Mmmm!  It had a nice balance of flavors, and the scrambled eggs were the best I&#39;ve had.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  Now, bacon is bacon, as far as I&#39;ve ever known.  I don&#39;t know what they do there, but that was beyond bacon.  I&#39;m coming back for that alone!

They have some of the best French fries, made from fresh cut potatoes with the skin on. Their baklava is incredible and not overly sweet.  The breakfast burritos are enormous and certainly enough for two. Their Greek Panini is not to be missed if you love the flavors of gyro, feta, grilled onions, tatziki, and mozzarella wrapped in a delicious panini. Plus it is enormous.

Food review:  Not too much to say here on the food side.  I&#39;ve loved ham and cheese omelets since I was a kid and this place has the best I&#39;ve had in Denver so far.  If I were to make one complaint about the dish, it would be that I wish that the cheese were on the inside of the omelet instead of on top.  But maybe I just need to request it that way next time.  Comes with yummy slice fried potatoes and toast.  Simply a great way to start out a day.  :-)

Service?  No complaints

Other thoughts:  I have so many good memories at this place.  First of all, the atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of what most restaurants are like in my hometown.  Second of all, when I would crash at my friend&#39;s place after a night of drinking, this place was so nice to go to the next morning for hangover recovery.  :-)"

The menu is basic diner food and they seem to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner with a bit of something for everyone.  Sometimes I crave a standard home styled meal and Yanna&#39;s delivers this well.  I had the chop steak dinner which comes with a dinner salad, potato of choice, Texas toast and the vegetable of the day (in this case it was cooked green beans).  I like this kind of diner, the type that caters to working class people where every dollar counts and value for money is important.

It&#39;s HUGE and comes with your choice of toast or pancakes....but you can get pita instead if you just ask.  Another fav is the Greek Breakfast Burrito- same ingredients as the skillet but rolled in a tortilla and smothered with green chili.  YUMMMM.  One of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had!  

I still have yet to return for dinner...mostly because their breakfast food is awesome.  They now have a frequent diner card, that gives you a free meal after 10 visits (they count each person as a visit....so my husband and I only need to go 5 times to earn a free meal!)"

The closing of Harman&#39;s East and Greet brought us here, probably the only positive thing to come out of that tragedy. 
In the year I&#39;ve been in Denver, this is that only place that has plated seafood that tasted genuinely fresh AND was perfectly prepared. I&#39;ve lived coastal for 36 years and have come to expect Denver seafood to just be subpar and overall not worth consuming if it isn&#39;t sushi fresh. Humboldt has given me an alternative to abstaining from seafood until I get home to visit. THANK YOU. 
Hubs had a claim chowder that was better than even found in Seattle - the clams tender and not chewy. His shrimp scampi was also perfectly prepared and my scallops were tender and neither smelled nor tasted like &#39;seafood&#39;  - a sure sign of superior quality and freshness.

The Ceasar salad was huge and so delicious, with a lighter dressing than what I&#39;m used to that had a hint of lime. 

I then ordered the small plate lump crab cake. It presented beautifully with the sherry tomato cream, though the flavor of the cream was a bit strong to me and overtook the flavor of the crab cake. The steak and frites, roast chicken, and salmon ordered by the rest of the table were all perfectly prepared and enjoyed.

Our service was exceptional.

Even though the restaurant was busy, the noise level was not bad. It was nice for our table of six to converse without yelling, which made the experience even nicer."

I&#39;ve definitely had better seasoned and more well put together dishes for a similar price. The types of menu items were also not too impressive. There was a lot of plain old red bird chicken on the menu when I was expecting a wider variety of fish. The drink menu had fair variety. 

Food did come out exceptionally fast, though and the hostess and waitress were nice. The ambience was also pleasant. Overall, I don&#39;t think I would come here again."

I arrived with two others around 7:30p on a Saturday and we were seated right away. It took a while for our server to come around, probably around 15-20 minutes. I actually ended up asking around to see who our server was and had to flag her down. She actually ended up being pretty nice, just s-l-o-w.

We ordered several items off the menu and split them family style. We got the crispy broccoli (9), house salad (7), red bird farm chicken (19), and crispy fish sandwich (15). Everything was delicious. The mushroom risotto that came with the chicken was not too salty, the crispy broccoli was super crispy and had just the right amount of aioli drizzled on top, and the crispy fish sandwich was served with truffle fries (2). The house salad was, well, a house salad. Our food came out in about 15-20 minutes.

For dessert we split a banana cream pie (8) with a scoop of ice cream (2). The pie was out of this world. It wasn&#39;t too sweet and the homemade graham crust was really tasty. I would come back here just for the pie. It was really THAT good.

Would I come back? Ohoho yeah."

We came on a nice Saturday evening and there was no wait to be seated on the patio. The weather was spectacular and the lights made the environment very cozy and inviting.

We started with the Ahi Tuna Poke. It was very flavorful and the right amount of sweet and salty. The sauce they used and the avocado was very fresh. 

My entree was by far the best thing. I ordered the Filet Mignon Diane. My steak was medium and cooked to perfection. It was very tender and savory. It came with truffle potatoe puree, which was heavenly. I&#39;m a big fan of truffle but I realize it is a very distinct flavor and can sometimes be a bit much. These potatoes were perfect though and had just enough hint of truffle without overpowering anything. The mushrooms and sauce blended everything together very nicely. I absolutely loved every bite of this dish."

Do you hope he&#39;ll be different, or do you say to yourself, &#34;why should I waste my time with that person?&#34; and refuse to deal with him? 

I guess the answer&#39;s different in each circumstance, but it&#39;s an important question to consider because all of us mess up sometime and we hope others will give us a second chance. 

Like people, restaurants can screw up, but they too can change. Sometimes the marketplace is too brutal and doesn&#39;t give the place a second chance, but sometimes it does.

This is the story of when giving a restaurant a 3rd chance worked out well for all . . .

I&#39;d been to Humboldt Farm a couple of times before and was unimpressed. The last time I was there they charged me $1.00 to get a slice of bread with their most expensive entrée and the food was not all that great. That was ridiculous and I told myself I&#39;d never go back.

Life, however, sometimes doesn&#39;t give you all the control you might want. I&#39;m on the board of directors of a professional organization and the president recently scheduled a lunch meeting at Humboldt. Miss a few of those meetings and they kick you off the board, so I decided I&#39;d go to lunch at Humboldt even if I wasn&#39;t crazy about the idea.

Bottom line, it was really good. Had a salad and tuna poke and they were both excellent. I couldn&#39;t resist asking the server whether if I wanted some bread I was going to be charged for it. He said, &#34;we never charge for bread.&#34; I just smiled and said thank you.

Apparently Humboldt has changed it&#39;s policy and now I&#39;ve discovered a place that has improved not only in food quality, but also in service.

Rock on, Humboldt. I&#39;m doin&#39; a business lunch there tomorrow and am looking forward to seeing the new you.

Sign me,

We started with the mussels which were classically prepared in a butter wine sauce, followed by the 10oz NY strip steak. My boyfriend had the salmon. For a beverage I had a cucumber mint lemonade which I highly recommend. The ambiance of the restaurant is modern but rustic. I love the gorgeous glass-turquoise kissed bulbed light fixtures that appear to float from the ceiling. The wood tables are gorgeous and the patio is fabulous. The service was attentive but not intrusive- and most importantly friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend! We&#39;ll be back."

Our Server Hope, was exceptional! Gave us great suggestions and is very friendly and personable. The Brunch Menu was mouth-watering.

We shared the crispy broccoli (one of our favorites) and I had a beer and my sister a mimosa. My sister decided on the vegetable medley hash and I chose the crispy fish sandwich. Both were very tasty.

We were so full that just couldn&#39;t think of dessert, but the way Hope described the Banana Cream Pie, was just so yummy sounding, we had to try it.  WOW, so glad we did because it was the best Banana Cream Pie my sister and I have ever eaten!! It was so flavorful and creamy-kind of wanted to get another one so we wouldn&#39;t have to share.

Great lunch with a great dessert for a Saturday afternoon!!"

All the meals were expensive and definitely not an ideal place for this type of consumer.  Fast forward to a couple years ago and enter Humboldt Farm.  They kept an elegant vibe to the place, refined so many dishes, went farm to table and boom!  This is the place we went to a couple weeks ago.

The staff here is professional from beginning to end.  My only complaint was they sat us next to the storage unit so people were walking in and out with chairs and supplies the whole time.  I thought it was cute they would &#34;check up&#34; on us while hauling stuff back and forth.  Yeah, it was a little distracting but our main focus being food was on point.

I ordered a clam chowder and a fish sandwich that came with fries.  Everything was served hot and tasty!  Aside from my usual sushi banter, the seafood was top notch here.  I don&#39;t know if they cuddle with their food or sing to it before they serve it but holy cow it is EXCELLENT!

By the end of our meal, we were happy and full.  I look forward to coming back again and again.  All the other patrons looked happy and many families came through with their kids as well.  This restaurant comes highly recommended! Bon appetite!"

Or something.  

As HH go, there was a great mix of fantastic deals ($1.00 oysters on the half shell; off menu special) and pricey-but-worth-it splurges ($8.00 for a tiny, but impeccable bowl of moules marinières with a rich, almost slightly spicy wine broth).  There was also the elderflower old fashioned.  It&#39;s not often that a drink I&#39;ve been drinking for 20 years, and which has become ubiquitous in the last 9, can surprise me, but the elderflower really freshened up this version.  

However.  

There seem to have been some changes since the reviews raving about the Humboldt burger on HH.  They are offered as sliders now at $4.00 a pop and gone are the $1.00 fries to inevitably order along side. The fries are now &#34;truffle fries&#34; (the truffles are not actually part of the fries, they are assimilated within the aoli that comes with the fries) for $6.00.  

We also ordered a half dozen of the kumanoto oysters, which were not on the HH menu and cost $4.50 each -- they were certainly plump and briny and wonderful, but no more so than the $1.00 special oysters.  We got these after some persistent and undue pressure to order from the regular menu, to which I&#39;m very sorry to say I finally capitulated with this $27.00 purchase.  It was an unneccessary grace note that truly soured my experience, but was only one of a series of mis-steps during the meal.  For example, at one point, two servers had a public tiff in front of the patrons about some misunderstanding.  My server also tried repeatedly to clear plates that were obviously not finished. What a bizarre place."

Last time we had a horrid experience with our waiter--he was to put it frankly, a complete jerk. 
I don&#39;t feel the need to go into the entire experience because the manager (Steve) made up for it above and beyond. 
We will definitely continue to come back because of how awesome he was, also because who doesn&#39;t love $1 oysters on a Sunday? Oh and because he gave us a $50 gift certificate to come back. 

The restaurant itself is also very aesthetically pleasing, nice decor, no harsh light, lots of natural light. It&#39;s clean, open and airy. There&#39;s a cute area that feels like a courtyard. Also the bathrooms are always clean and smell nice. Hostesses are always welcoming as well."

We had the Humboldt Martini- probably one of the best martinis I&#39;ve ever had. It had a truffle salt rim and hand stuffed blue cheese olive! Wow, super flavorful. I also tried the Cucumber Gimlet, it tasted great, but was very weak. 

For food, we tried almost everything on the HH menu! 

The crispy broccoli and Brussel sprouts were both delicious. The broccoli was fried and had a spicy cream sauce on top and the Brussel sprouts were in a savory soy glaze. Very flavorful, I enjoyed eating them together.

The shishito papers were also very flavorful, some were pretty spicy and others were fairly mild.

I wasn&#39;t too excited about the salmon tartare. The flavor profile was just off in my opinion. There was a dill pesto on the salmon which was atop creme fresche and served with homemade potato chips. I just wasn&#39;t big fan and I generally love salmon anything. 

The oysters were fresh and delish!

We were also gifted two delicious dessert because it happened to be both of our Birthdays! The Key lime pie was amazing, tart and creamy with a flavorful gram crust.The molten chocolate cake was also pretty perfect (being chocolate and all)  and what set it apart was the salted caramel ice cream, it was way way more flavorful than most ice creams! Yum.

I also, really enjoyed the ambiance. This place had a really cool style, modern but a little quirky.. very interesting light fixtures and art! The staff was friendly and attentive

The onion jam added a ton of flavor without being too sweet. The crispy broccoli has been amazing everytime I&#39;ve had it and I will likely order it each time I go there. My boyfriend loved the vegetable hash.
At happy hour we got the crispy broccoli, fries and oysters to eat. For drinks we had the 17th St. Mule, Orange is the New Grey and Humbolt Martini. I wanted a Basil Martini, but they had just run out of St. Germain, which was disappointing as it is in 2 of their 6 happy hour cocktails.

I ordered the Humbolt martini, and my husband had the High Fashioned.  Both drinks were okay, but we quickly turned to our standard preferences: beer &amp; wine.

As for the food, we ordered the trout dip to start.  It was delicious.  While I didn&#39;t love the onion jam that accompanied it (I just don&#39;t like a lot of sweet with my savory), my husband thought it was fantastic!  I really liked the dip (minus the jam) with their house-made chips.  It was a great way to start the meal!  

For our entrees, I ordered the ahi with curried lentils and kale, and my husband ordered one of the night&#39;s specials, teriyaki sea bass.  I loved my ahi!  It was perfectly cooked, and though an unusual pairing, it went very well with the curried lentils.  Yum!  My husband, on the other hand, wasn&#39;t pleased with his sea bass.  It was simply overdone.  They were quick to make it right, however.  He ordered the scallops instead, and they were delectable!"

Our server was polite, friendly, all-around cool guy. But waited to put our entrees into the POS and in the time that passed they ran out of the entree of choice for my girlfriend. He was super cool with it, girlfriend didn&#39;t really care, so all in all I thought he handled that hiccup nicely and all was well. He was super slow with refilling waters...but honestly that&#39;s pretty minor. I&#39;m not very bothered by that.

I ordered a steak and was, in the end, disappointed. It was way too lean of a cut of meat, and while it was just a touch overcooked for my tastes, the lack of fat in the cut is really what made it fall. Tender, yeah I guess, juicy, in the middle but the edges were very dry -- but it just wasn&#39;t a great cut. Alas, it happens. My girlfriend had a mix up on her sides, she asked for a sub but they brought the listed side. But our server was very quick to correct the mistake and made it right with us. 

I love the open kitchen, it&#39;s a great space, the oysters were excellent, the cocktails were tremendous. Also those brussels sprouts...absolutely to die for.

In the end, I&#39;ll go back for brunch Oysters, but there wasn&#39;t much calling me back. Just fine, totally doable, but not something I&#39;m going to rave about. I went in with some high expectations, but just felt they weren&#39;t met."

Service overall ended up being stellar like always, but it got off to a rough start...

Upon arrival (Wednesday April 13, 2016 5:15p) I provided my name as I was meeting people, and the server stated something along the lines of &#34;no one here is waiting for anyone that they knew of&#34; -- but this is contrary to what I was told by the person I was meeting... 

I proceeded to seat myself at a hightop near the front to see anyone that walked in the front door... A long time passed, so I asked for someone to serve me a drink. Finally a server came over, I ordered a drink -- right at which time my business meeting  appointment came up to me and said he had been waiting in the back.

We leave the front and go to his seats, only to have a new server ask what I want, and I stated that I had already placed an order and let her know of my order... She seemed a little confused for some reason. Then shortly thereafter our table receives appetizers that we did NOT order -- they quickly took them away -- all of this craziness happened within 20 minutes, all making for a less-than-favorable experience, especially because it made our business meeting start late.

THEN when we received our Tuna Poke appetizer, something arrived that looked *and tasted* more like basic fried rice? I proceeded to give the waitress constructive criticism to share with the chef; she kindly came back advising that she had relayed the comments. It was tasty, but NOT true tuna poke; why was it mixed with rice is a huge question.

Just a bizarre experience, but i&#39;ll be back."

Since Sunday is perfect for patio lounging and $1-oyster-day at Humboldt -- and happy hour starts at 3pm -- it&#39;s pretty much the best of all words on a Sunday afternoon at Humboldt. I&#39;m sure the brunch is also delicious, but I just love the HH menu here too much.

$1 (PREMIUM) OYSTERS ALL SUNDAY
Yes, you heard that right. They&#39;re $1! That&#39;s cheaper than anywhere else in the area (Jax does $1.50 for happy hour, but they don&#39;t even open until dinner). And these aren&#39;t just their happy hour oysters. ALL the oysters must go. So premium oysters are $1. Just note: it&#39;s only while they last, so if you show up after me on a Sunday, sorry! (Yes, I&#39;ll down 4 dozen of these easy. Don&#39;t judge.)

HAPPY HOUR: 3pm-6pm / 7 days a week
- $2-$9 ridiculously good food
- $4 beers
- $4-$6 wines (and the wine is really good)
- $4-$6 cocktails

HAPPY HOUR FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS
- Steak Tartare, $4 (I don&#39;t know what the sauce in it is, but this is seriously one of the best steak tartars I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had a few -- definitely get this over the salmon tartare.)
- Chicken Liver Pate, $5 (I&#39;ve had a lot of these around Denver, too, and this is one of the best. I prefer it over the trout one, but that one is also really good.)
- Crispy Broccoli, $4 (It comes with a pepperoncini aioli and is crispy and delicious. I usually prefer brussel sprouts as my veggie, but the broccoli here is better in my opinion.)
- Humboldt Burger, $9 (This won Westword&#39;s best burger a couple of years ago, and you&#39;ll see why when you try it.)

WINE
I can&#39;t not mention the wine. As a California (Bay Area) transplant, I love wine. I drink a lot of it, and I know my way around it pretty well. So trust me when I say Humboldt has a fantastic selection of affordable, unique wines. I&#39;ve had probably half of the white wines here and have yet to be disappointed.


If you decide to come here on a Sunday, I want an invite!"

Of course it caught our attention immediately, because I think simplicity is key when it comes to a great business. You know, doing a few things extremely well instead of attempting to do a ton with mediocre results. 

We stopped in for lunch, and although it seemed so quiet as we approached (I even said, &#34;are they open!?&#34;), there was a robust lunch crowd inside. I thought the lunch menu was refreshing; short and to the point. A selection of small plates, salads, some burgers and sandwiches, and then a &#34;specials&#34; menu that boasted fresh oysters (woo!), a salmon entree, and an Italian BLT. 

Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu, and we started with the crispy broccoli (flash fried in rice flour) and truffle fries. My mom and Adam shared the soy-sauteed brussel sprouts, which smelled incredible. Then Adam ordered the Italian BLT which he enjoyed (especially the pesto), and mama and I split the salmon salad, which tasted like a pickle in the best way. It had tons of capers and dill, my favorite.

All the food was exceptional, and the &#34;small plates&#34; are actually quite large considering they&#39;re only about $8 each. Plenty to share. The salmon salad was a pretty small portion for $16, I thought, but it was fantastic.

I had a Tuscan blend for $7, Adam a $7 Malbec, and mother went with a $10 Chardonnay. Pretty standard vino prices, I&#39;d say, and generous pours. Our waiter knew the menu backwards and forwards and had solid wine recommendations as well. 

It&#39;s definitely bright and cheery inside -- I loved the light fixtures... like giant glass bubbles floating all around. You can see they have a cute back patio and that the front walls open up like a garage to the front patio, so I&#39;m excited to return on a day meant for soaking up the great outdoors."

We all had wine and cocktails to start and took the waiter&#39;s recommendation on apps. Crispy broccoli and calamari were both delicious and enough to share for four of us. 
I had the short rib and Brussels Sprouts for dinner, both appetizer size which was just perfect for dinner. At the table there were salads, pasta and other nice selections and everyone enjoyed all dishes.
Our group was very engaged in conversation, so we sat and relaxed at the table which was very acceptable. Never felt rushed and our waiter was knowledgeable in all respects. Next time we will make sure to try a dessert or two, although the menu isn&#39;t huge, it has something for everyone."

My boyfriend and I shared the Fernet About It (Green Chartreuse, Fernet Branca, fresh lemon, cava, rosemary sprig), which was slightly disappointing, and not as complex and refreshing as I was hoping for. The wines our friends ordered were fantastic, so I would definitely come back for wine!

The food was delicious. Appetizers came out quickly, though most were not gluten free. The one that was, was the crispy broccoli topped with an amazing grana padano cheesy sauce that would make broccoli haters fans for sure!

My boyfriend and I shared the salmon with potatoes and spinach, along with a side of mushrooms and a sweet potato, bacon, brussels medley. Everything was well-portioned, seasoned and priced well, thought the salmon was slightly overdone for my tastes.

The two birthday girls got two desserts, on the house. 

I would definitely come to try the recommended roasted chicken, as well as the scallops, veggie sides, wine and happy hour (daily 3-6)! Menu seems to change with what&#39;s in season and lots of items are locally sourced."

The restaurant clashes with itself in terms of ambiance. When you walk in there is a full bar with a large screen tv tuned to ESPN. At the same time there is dance music playing at a low volume over the speakers. However, as you proceed further into the restaurant there are quiet tables in the back.

Our waiter was relatively brusque, and did not seem excited that we were there at all. At no point did we see him smile and it felt like he was burdened by the fact that he had to serve us. A positive note about the staff is that we had told them in advance that we were there for a birthday and they came and brought out a delicious chocolate cake for the birthday girl. 

The real reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the food. Contrary to other reviews I have read, I did not enjoy the broccoli appetizer. The broccoli might have been cooked well but the cream sauce on top was too rich and fatty, masking any of the other flavors in the dish. Additionally the sauce caused the broccoli to turn mushy after sitting on the table for a bit. The truffle fries we ordered were perfectly average.

I ordered the Shetland salmon as an entree and this was one of the most confused dishes I have ever eaten. When I read the description I was expecting a nice piece of salmon with some potatoes on the side on a plate. Imagine my surprise when the waiter places a bowl in front of me. On the bottom of the bowl was a liquid that tasted like onion soup, in this &#39;jus&#39; there were some undercooked fingerling potatoes with melted gruyere cheese. On top of this was placed an admittedly perfectly cooked piece of salmon with the skin facing up. I am still confused how I was expected to proceed eating this dish. The way this dish was served made it impossible to cut the fish without either dunking it in the jus or risking the salmon falling off the dish. I am not sure what the idea behind combining jus, gruyere and salmon was, but it was not succesful. Definitely not worth $22. 

The one dish at the table that tasted like fine dining was the seared scallops, they were perfectly cooked, the presentation was impeccable and the sunchoke risotto was tasty."

The bun is perfectly toasted and complements the bacon blend party exquisitely. Crispy golden onion rings and aioli top it all off. Order it medium rare. 

If you&#39;re gonna order a starter, definitely the broccoli without a doubt. We even contemplated ordering a second order.

Very casual and hip atmosphere right on 17th in uptown. They have a patio dining option and bar tables for happy hour with some particularly cool community tables that give off a a very &#34;on the shore vibe.&#34; 

The service was so so because although the food was brought out on time our waiter although friendly, was very passive throughout our meal. Just a minor hiccup on  the overall dining experience. 

They offered a variety of tasty half price appetizers and $1 oysters along with specials on  beers, wine, and cocktails. Decided to go non alcoholic once the waiter mentioned a cucumber mint lemonade that was soo tasty and very refreshing for a hot summer day! 

I&#39;ll go through my favorite appetizers that I recommend:
- They had two types of oysters, tried both, and both were so yummy. Definitely recommend adding the sea salt, lemon, and cocktail sauce as a garnish. 
- The crispy broccoli was awesome! Cooked perfectly and paired with a pepperchini aioli that was so tasty! Definitely recommend! 
- I also suggest the humboldt burger that had an extremely juice patty with caramelized onions and an onion jam that tied the flavor all together so well! 
- Lastly, the mussels that were cooked very well and had a simpler garlic and white sauce that still surprisingly was bursting with flavor. Along with the dish came some of the best bread I have ever had, called Pan de Mie  (very similar to Texas toast), for dipping into the reservoir of scrumptious sauce! 

Everything we had at the restaurant was cooked nearly to perfection, the atmosphere was very nice, and the service was pretty good. All around it was a pretty superb dining experience! I will definitely be coming back to this establishment in the near future!"

Almost $200 for a dinner consisting of great appetizers (They always are!) and disappointing main courses. The trout was dry, boring and not hot. The fingerling potatoes were completely flavorless. Last time the veggie side was carrots that were almost raw and again the main course was barely warm. I had to ask for bread and was told &#34;We don&#39;t offer bread. We do provide it if the customer asks.&#34; I miss the old Strings where I ate happily for many contented years.I may give Humboldt one more try for old times&#39; sake and hope for the best."

I would have never thought this place to be an ideal brunch place but thanks to Groupon, got to experience my favorite meal of the day with tons to spend! Be sure to make a reservation here because like with any other happening spot in Denver this place fills up quickly for brunch. We had $40 to spend and wanting to be productive for the rest of the day, passed on alcoholic drinks. I had a latte and it was delicious and a wonderful start to a perfect experience. They have a peaceful atrium on the side of the restaurant and we sat there so it was pretty quiet and isolated. I started with the brussels sprouts, flash fried with a truffle chile sauce. It was stinky, full of umami and a huge portion (coworkers were not amused by me having it for breakfast in my cubicle the next day). Since I got my salty fix, I went for a sweet breakfast dish which rarely happens.... lemon ricotta pancakes with raspberry compote were perfection and way to be much for my belly at that point. Service was top notch, food was creative with an ideal sized brunch menu and all around, fantastic experience."

Hostess was accommodating - changed from party of 2 to 3 at last minute. Requested a nice corner table. The server seemed new - a little unsure of himself but pleasant. The place is beautiful - love the artwork and exposed bricks. They really need to update the bathroom stalls and re-tile. The stall doors were grey metal like in a public school and the toilet was extremely low (I&#39;m only 5&#39;3&#34;) for adult use.

Cocktails were nice and the pours on wine were decent. My partner got a bunch of sides, which ended up being more than we could eat, and I got the ahi tuna which was excellent.

The oysters were way over priced at $3-5 each, so I skipped.

Overall a nice dining experience. They could have had more fish on the menu, so if you have people in your party who hate fish they should be able to find something nice here.

Decor and atmosphere trendy and great for a date."

I always pass by during my runs and see clientele bustling in and out.  While I figured it was another generic farm to table restaurant, I decided that I&#39;d give it a shot given its proximity to home (2 blocks!).  Shoulda listened to my restaurant spidey sense!!!

Had a reservation for two at 7PM and was promptly seated.  It&#39;s a lot larger than you&#39;d think --- there&#39;s a large front bar, a back dining room, and a semi-outdoor seating area in the wayyyy back.  We were put in this wayyyyy back area.  This spot has a much different ambiance than the rest of the restaurant, and is also slightly cold.  If you do dine here, request in advance to be seated in the main area.

The friday night dinner crowd is also surprising.  The median age is probably 50, yet there is a surprising amount of children.  Feels kind of odd for what I thought to be a hip weekend spot.  Not hating on old folks and kids tho!  

The two of us each had salads, shared the fried broccoli appetizer, and had an entrée each.  Without drinks the total came to $100. 

The fried broccoli is excellent!  The rest of the dishes were not memorable.  The most disappointing thing of all was the vegetarian options (or lack thereof) here.  I&#39;ve attached a picture for their ONLY vegetarian entree offering -- A single poached egg on a small bed of wild rice with some green sprinkles around it --- $18!  Bam, how&#39;s that for profit margin!  While this is a fish spot, I&#39;ve seen stronger vegetarian offerings at steakhouses. I ordered halibut, which was actually quite tasty, but a rather small portion.  Also disappointing was the fact that they ran out of their gnocchi special at 6:45 PM.  

It took over an hour to get our entrées, and I noticed another table (seated 10 minutes after us) that ordered similar amounts of food get their entrees long before ours.  Always irks me when this happens.

At the end the day, it&#39;s not truly not worth coming here for dinner.  The service is rather weak, the offerings not spectacular given the price point.  This may have a great happy hour where the offerings are more reasonably priced and ambiance more lively.  

I would definitely avoid coming here for a full fledged dinner.  You are better off going to The Kitchen, Beast and Bottle, Root Down, or the handful (or should I say army) other farm to table restaurants in Denver."

What I don&#39;t like is servers who walk up to the table and interrupt a conversation as if their question is more important than a guest&#39;s conversation. 

This seems to be a trend industry wide of late even in establishments that would typically be considered &#39;fine dining&#39;. I&#39;m not sure what happened to the professional server who strove to serve the guests needs and remain almost invisible but that seems to have gone away in favor of hipster waiters and waitresses who care more about themselves and being cute/entertaining.

Perhaps it&#39;s a sign of my age but I long for the bygone days of servers who actually served and respected the guest."

We walked in on a snowy Saturday evening without a reservation.  We were able to sit in the dining room but the lounge area looked just as inviting.  Our server was Kim and she was an absolute delight.  She was helpful in offering suggestions and attentive without being overbearing.

We sipped on some super tasty Basil Martinis as we looked over the menu.  One of the evening specials was $1.00 oysters, so obviously I couldn&#39;t resist ordering a half dozen, at least for starters.  Originally, three different types of oysters were offered when the special began but they were down to just one East Coast variety when we arrived.  It must have been my lucky day because I snagged the last few left in the kitchen.  They were a bit small but really delicious and I was sad I couldn&#39;t have any more.  While I was enjoying my oysters, Mr. P was having the Ginger Pork Dumplings.  He liked them but said the sauce was too heavy and overly salty.

We decided to forego entrees so we could sample more of the small plates.  The Crispy Broccoli was interesting.  It was sort of the consistency of tempura but nowhere near as greasy.  I thought the portion was kind of big but maybe I also don&#39;t care to eat that much broccoli all at once.  We also shared the Ahi Ceviche, which my my favorite dish of the evening.  The flavors worked so well together and the beet chips were unique and delicious.  Since it was such a cold night and we were walking to a concert afterwards, I thought some French Onion Soup was in order.  Though the broth was a bit salty, it had a nice flavor.  The cheese was not greasy or stringy and the bread was not overwhelming.

I&#39;d love to come back for happy hour and patio dining.  You definitely haven&#39;t seen the last of me, Humboldt!"

From the Happy Hour menu, we tried:
Humboldt burger: yum!! 
Oysters-Pretty fresh
Fried broccoli: delicious
Salmon tartar and mussels: both good
Brussel sprouts: good but too oily
Kale salad: good (dressing a bit too sweet)

We also got the Tempura calamari appetizer: it was really yummy but not enough calamari for $13.  Too many pieces of veggie and lemon.  There was probably only 6-ish pieces of calamari on the whole plate.  Though the flavor was really good.  Portions are normal HH sizes.  Great service.  Loved our waitress.  We spent about $150 for 4 people with a couple rounds of beers so a bit more expensive than I expected.  Worth checking out once but didn&#39;t blow me away."

We went for our first anniversary and the dinner started out wonderfully! The restaurant itself is a really beautiful space and I love the high ceilings, lighting and decor. It&#39;s a beautiful ambiance.

We got the crispy broccoli and the trout dip to start with, and glasses of wine. If we had stopped there I might have given this spot 5 stars! Both appetizers were delicious and a large amount of food. We couldn&#39;t stop eating the trout dip, a delightful combination of sweet and savory, as it is mixed with some sort of delicious jelly. Our server even brought us extra crackers!

For our main course, we settled on the gnocchi and the salmon.  I have never left a dish completely untouched after two bites, but that&#39;s what I did with the gnocchi. First of all, for an $18 plate of gnocchi I expected for than ten small little gnocchis, but that wasn&#39;t even the problem. The dish had so many bells and whistles and spices and garnishes that it was just too much... It really makes my mouth pucker to even write about it. Thankfully we were full from the appetizers and my husband&#39;s salmon was delicious... That was until his last bite when we discovered a hair.

The reason I hesitated to even post this was because our servers and the manager were incredibly kind - they were so apologetic and embarrassed, and they comped my gnocchi. (Why they didn&#39;t comp the more expensive salmon was interesting but we are not complainers and we really felt badly for them). We also mentioned to the manager that the gnocchi was a very &#34;interesting&#34; dish, and he told us he had the same reaction when his chef proposed it! Which for us begged the question... Then why was it a good idea to add to the menu? 

So overall, we won&#39;t ever be back for dinner. But reading the reviews for happy hour, remembering our yummy appetizers, and being grateful for the kind sever and manager, maybe we will return for a glass of wine and some more trout dip."

Since we were the first couple there, we had a head start looking over the menu. We knew what we wanted for the appetizers but were a bit overwhelmed with what to order for the main dish. All the descriptions sounded delicious and we had a hard time narrowing it down. With the help of yelp reviews and pictures, we were able to choose 2 dishes that we ended up being very satisfied with. (Thank you for your recommendations!)

My boyfriend and I  started off with a half dozen of oysters and steak tartare. The oysters were very fresh and both appetizers were extremely tasty. For the main course, he got the steak and I ordered the whole fried fish. His steak was tender, yet flavorful. My fish was a whole fried sea bass sitting upright on the plate! I loved the unique presentation but what was even better was exceptional taste. The outside was light and crispy, the meat inside was juicy and tender. I could honestly say it was the best fish I have ever had.

I should mention everyone else seemed to enjoy their entrees, but I might have been a little more focused on mine.

After returning this past week, it appears they&#39;ve gotten lazy.  Like, where did the flavor go?  The quality of the mussels was poor and the flavor was lackluster...to say the least.  Seriously, they threw those cheap dried red chili flakes in the broth rather than trying to actually enhance the flavor with culinary skill.  The calamari was over-garnished in an attempt to hide the spongy quality.  As for the main meal, I&#39;d say I&#39;ve gotten better fish quality at the local delicatessens and lunch eateries.  Everything had a strong fish odor and flavor.  Sorry to say, I find this place subpar at their prices. You should get what you pay for after all.

Pros
Atmosphere (I&#39;ll agree with a prior review in the large TV tuned to sports seemed a little out of place)
Crispy broccoli - incredible
Scottish salmon - great cook, enjoyed the mustard

Cons
Filet mignon had zero flavor
Wife&#39;s clam chowder came out cold
Ordered a side of their brussels sprouts, requested to come with the main course. Instead they came awkwardly between appetizer and 5-10 minutes prior to main, were SWIMMING in oil/sauce which was extremely salty."

Had the crispy broccoli and calamari to start, and then my group had to try the two oyster specials they had. I happen to enjoy cold, vinegary slime nuggets and so for the most part, the oysters were enjoyable. To me, that is, and really nobody else. 

Main course - I had plain &#39;ol eggs benedict, and I will say it&#39;s up there with the best benedict I&#39;ve ever had, and I eat a lot of benedict. The potatoes were something magical; perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. I don&#39;t know how they did it, but then again, I burn mac &amp; cheese when I cook. Maybe it&#39;s simple and I&#39;m just ignorantly impressed.

I can&#39;t quite remember what the rest of my group had (this was last September - I&#39;m procrastinating with this review). However, I remember that they very much enjoyed it. We ate until we were that &#39;uncomfortable&#39; kind of full. 

Service was timely and efficient, but almost a little too much so. Our server acted VERY professionally, I guess it&#39;s just a matter of taste that I enjoy servers that are a little more.... unhinged. However, this is not a hit; our server was perfectly friendly and took care of us. 

What ended up sealing the deal was the bottomless mimosas, and the service surrounding it. No questions asked, it was refilled. And refilled. Even after we paid the check, we sat around talking for a bit, and our mimosas were still filled. We were not ignored, we were not glared at for taking up a table. It seemed we were actually encouraged to have a pleasurable experience instead of being another turn-over for the restaurant. That sealed the deal for us. We walked out of that restaurant completely satiated and a little crooked."

Alternating between Chicago and Denver, and dining out almost every night, I think I can tell a good meal when I see,..er....taste one. I read the reviews, was intrigued and decided to visit this, in the former Strings spot. Not being too hungry I thought I would sip a few cocktails and just try a few small plates. I settled on the highly touted crispy broccoli and the sliders.

The broccoli was more like blackened, as in the chef forgot about it, took it out, threw a funky sauce on it and sent it out. Totally not what I was expecting and after a few bites I looked like Tom Hanks in Big after he took his first bite of caviar. OK, then the sliders showed up. Wish they had slid right off the table onto the floor so I could deduct them from the check. They were served on a lackluster bun with an oversized piece of greens, a sauce, bit &#39;o cheese and  grilled onions. Virtually nothing remarkable about them. If you want some GREAT sliders at this price point that includes delicious garlic fries, try them at Shanahans.

There are other things on the small plate menu you could try; maybe I ordered the wrong thing. But I was prepared to be delighted no matter what I ordered, and that was only my Tito&#39;s martini. I&#39;ll go back for a drink and the ambiance - only."

This establishment used to be another name that I have been to, many moons ago and even a YELP ELITE event once was done at this premises.

Now with another NEW NAME, and NEW &#34;vision&#34; of Dining experiences, I thought I would have a nice meal here.  This recent visit was on Wednesday December 3rd 2014 for LUNCH.  Time was about 12:10hrs ish.

WOW, inside looks &#34;Fancy Shmancy&#34;.  At LUNCH hour, man this establishment is packed with other patrons alike.  Does it mean good?  Will it WOW me??  We are ushered to our seats, almost to the back of the establishment near the &#34;PATIO&#34;...

From the Simple Menu we opt for the following items :

*  Crispy Fried Oysters ($17.00)
*  Prince Edward Island Mussels with Garlic Broth ($13.00)
*  Grilled ALL Natural Chicken ($19.00)
*  Lobster Roll ($23.00)
*  Crepe Cake ($8.00)
*  2 orders of Coffee @ $4.00 each, hence it was ($8.00)

The Highlight Dish for me was a tie between the Crispy Fried Goose Point Oysters and Mussels.  Those Crispy Fried Oysters comes with Peppadew Pepper Relish and Old Bay Aioli are SO ADDICTIVE!  I wish I could have more!  The Fried Oysters are fried to perfection and its juicy inside.  The Mussels was OK but I like the BROTH that comes with it.

The Grilled All Natural Chicken, comes with Brown Sugar Butternut Squash,  Brussels Sprouts, White Balsamic Honey and Double Chicken Jus.  But the Chicken tends to be over-cooked and a little too dry for our liking.  Though I cannot deny, my friend like the Brussels Sprouts.

Since we are sharing some of the items, we let our server know and our order is divided into two equal portions per plate.  Then comes with the New England Lobster Roll aka Tom Flanigan&#39;s Maine Lobster with Mayonnaise and Celery.  Such a DISAPPOINTMENT with a CAPITAL D.  Did I just ordered the wrong item.  Oh well.  For ($23.00) LOBSTER ROLL, I except MORE.  I guess I just have to travel back to MAINE to devour all the LOBSTER that I can.  *SIGH*

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the SERVICE itself gets 4 stars alone and our lovely server, her name is OG Emily was indeed stellar!  She answers all our questions and comes to check on us periodically.  Our glass of water is being filled whenever it runs empty.

Then when it comes for DESSERTS, though actually I wanted to go somewhere else, but due to time crunch, we decide to just &#34;settle&#34; on what Humboldt has to offer in their Desserts Menu.  From our server&#39;s recommendation, we opt to have the Crepe Cake.  YES, the Crepe Cake are &#34;thousand&#34; layers of goodness to some, but it was another DISAPPOINTMENT dish, that we ordered, coz, the Crepe Cake tends to be &#34;flavorless&#34; and a little &#34;boring&#34; for our taste bud.  IT DOES NOT WOW us at all.  *DOUBLE SIGH*

Oh well, I guess we ordered the wrong items from the Menu.  I guess perhaps it was an OFF DAY etc.  But with all the HYPE they get from the NEWS and all the attention they receive, Humboldt was just OK in my books.  Left this establishment about 13:40hrs ish.

The longer version:

Humboldt&#39;s happy hour is an excellent deal.  Most beers, wines, and wells are just $4 a pop, and martinis are $6.  This seems like quite a competitive price for a trendier, fancier restaurant.  Appetizers are also priced to sell and quite tasty.  I&#39;m a sucker for well seasoned brussel sprouts, and Humboldt&#39;s, with a chili-truffle glaze hit the spot.  I wanted to lick the remaining sauce out of the bowl, but restrained myself.  The seafood deals are also pretty decent, with a bowl of mussels with bread for $6 and oysters on the half shell for $2 each.

 Now, for dinner.  I ordered the cilantro-lime ahi tuna salad.  Maybe it served me right for ordering a salad, but I was underwhelmed.  It lacked flavor, and I also felt the portion size was on the small side for an entree dinner salad.  My dining partner ordered the burger and loved it.  It did look quite indulgent and delicious, I&#39;ve gotta say.  I did feel like the overall meal was pretty expensive for what we got, though.  Our waiter was polite, but didn&#39;t go above and beyond considering the price.

Moral of the story- I&#39;ll definitely be back for happy hour, but will probably choose to explore a different restaurant on 17th for dinner next time."

The oysters were oustanding and very fresh. There was only one variety, but that was fine since they were tasty. Drinks were good but many times the server sloshed them over the rim while serving causing precious vodka to be lost. We ordered lots of other happy hour menu food and everything was delicious. I will say they were out of quite a few items. There is a nice patio and the place is bright and airy and the service was pretty good. I will be going back. What a find!"

One person had scallops, the other three grouper.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the vegetable accompaniments were delicious -- too often, they&#39;re just limp, tasteless additions for color and filler.  The one off note was our server.

I&#39;ve been looking forward to trying Humboldt for a while and decided the time for a nice upscale dinner was my birthday, if ever. 

The atmosphere is really nice. We arrived at about 6pm on a weeknight and and the restaurant was relatively quiet. By the time we left around 7:30, it was quite a bit busier. One thing I would comment on is that we were seated in the middle of the small tables/boot/chair thing and the next couple that came in was seated directly next to us. The next couple was seated on the other side, despite like 30 empty tables. I hate that. We spent the night trying to block out their conversations. My fault for not asking to take another table.

Our server was great. He was really attentive and friendly, not much more I could ask for there. 

The food was okay. The filet was cook well, but a bit fatty for me and served on a bed of mashed potatoes with too many mushrooms that overwhelmed the flavor of the steak. The scallops were good. Overall, decent food. 

Everything here was solid, but I think I&#39;d probably go for small plates if I was to go back."

We opted for a $25 deal for a bottle of wine and an appetizer (something I wish we had in Boston!) and went with the crispy broccoli. It was almost tempura-like but still very light and complemented well with the aioli. We split the Humboldt burger and brussel sprouts for our entree. The burger was cooked perfectly and the delicious onion jam mixed with the cheddar and crispy onion topping made me wish I had gotten my own burger. As for the brussel sprouts, I would forfeit fries every time to get these roasted chile sprouts again. Definitely worth a meal or two if you&#39;re ever in the area!"

We started with the Calamari, Crispy Broccoli and Butternut Squash Gnocchi as small plates to share between the table. The plates were the perfect size and all three were great with our favorite being the broccoli which was sweet and had a taste that was unexpected but phenomenal.

I had the Filet Mignon Diane and it was spectacular!!

Date of Visit: 9/7/14

Went to Humboldt for an impromptu date night, and WOW, it was a great night. The place has a fun, trendy vibe, with really good energy. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, and the decor was somewhere between hipster and classy (in a good way).

As far as food, it was some of the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. We ordered server&#39;s choice, which ended up being mostly small bites and apps. The House Smoked Trout Dip was odd but tasty (sounds weird, I know, but worth a try!), and the Classic Steak Tartare was outstanding. The Mushroom Gnocchi app was a little over-cheesed and under-seasoned, but the Humboldt Burger easily made up for it. Add to that a pretty solid beer and cocktail list, and this was just an overall great meal.

Looking forward to putting HFFW in the regular rotation!"

We lucked out and got to try the crispy broccoli, calamari and oysters at happy hour prices. The broccoli was just as good as people say. Crispy broccoli with salty cheese?? Yes please!

The oysters were really fresh and I could have made my dinner out of them. 

The main meals were lobster risotto and ahi tuna with noodles. The hubs got the risotto and I was lucky enough to get a few bites. I would go back for this dish alone. Rich, creamy perfection. 

My dish was on par though. The cold soba noodles were cooked just right. I enjoyed all the fresh veggies and the seared tuna was wonderful. I could have used a tad more salt but don&#39;t need it so didn&#39;t ask for it.

I will pass on the brussel sprouts app (greasy, over-charred, salty) and the steak tartare (meat great quality but I swear it was loaded with mayo). The oysters were good and fresh but one pair was definitely shucked brutally leaving infinite shell shards to pick out of my mouth. 

Of all things, their burger was the highlight of the night. Also a little heavy on the mayo&#39;y sauce for my taste but so flavorful that I was in heaven. The mussels were also tasty and the Parisian gnocchi (we didn&#39;t order this but they brought us a plate accidentally - usually my least favorite thing in the world - give me my damn potato!) were actually tasty with an addictive cream and fancy cheese sauce.

Warm interior and lots of seating options - definitely a lot of business&#39;y groups dine here. But plenty of options for more intimate two-tops as well. Not really my &#39;scene&#39; as far as diners are concerned - a little on the bro&#39;wnup, corporate, salon-styled hair side of the spectrum. But nothing too abrasive either.

It drove me absolutely NUTS that they brought out all four of our small plates at almost the exact same time (not enough room on our table, let alone our mouths and palates). But at least the speed was appreciated by our grumbling stomachs (the place was packed and we still never waited for anything).

It seems my main complaint is the &#34;mayo problem&#34; - if they killed the mayo and staggered the food coming out of the kitchen I think I&#39;d be appeased."

Mussels came out lukewarm, but were better after our server took them back to the kitchen to reheat. Sliders looked delicious. Deckle, gnocchi, pork ragu all had favorable reviews.

They were pretty tame, so they weren&#39;t too much  of a distraction, and in the defense of the hostess who sat us she did say that it would be very easy to move us to another table - a courtesy we didn&#39;t take advantage of but appreciated the offer. 

We all ordered martinis - mine was a Hendrick&#39;s dirty with bleu cheese olives and it was delicious. Usually I&#39;ll order my martinis so dirty that they need to go to church on Sunday morning, but I just went with &#34;East Colfax&#34; dirty and it delivered! 

To start we got the garlic bread and crispy broccoli to soak up a little bit of this gin...but not too much ;-) The broccoli was fantastic and came with an aioli drizzled over top that still has my mouth watering. The garlic bread was simple and soaked up the leftover aioli nicely. 

I would always recommend ordering from Humboldt&#39;s nightly feature menu. These tend to be items that receive a little bit more attention from the Chef and require more coordination and execution (from my time spent working in restaurants for 10 years). I ordered the halibut that sat on vegetables, bechamel sauce, and was cooked to PERFECTION. I was very impressed with my fish and its quality. It was truly unlike any other piece of halibut that I have tasted in other &#34;fine dining experiences&#34;. 

I&#39;m a dessert guy so I had to press for the key lime pie which came with a homemade whipped cream and graham cracker crust. YUMMMMMM! I also ordered an Irish coffee with dessert that turned out fantastic - definitely order one of these from the bar if it&#39;s up your alley. 

The main reason I submit 4/5 stars is because of an incident that happened with our server. She was extremely helpful to our table the entire night, but she was a little annoyed with the bachelorette party. I can understand venting a little bit to your tables (which she did), but the venting got to be a bit repetitive. In an effort to please us and accommodate for the loud party, she said that the desserts we ordered were to be comped and taken care of by the restaurant. She comped 1 of the 2. I know, I know, I am complaining about a comped dessert and you want to slap me for this. However, as a patron I expect the server to do what they say they&#39;ll do. I did not say anything because I felt it would be a bit embarrassing to bring this up, but I did notice that it happened. 

Having said all of that, I have been to Humboldt a couple of times now and I always leave in a pleasant state of satisfaction. I think you will too."

I opted for the burger which is AWESOME. This is easily one of the top 5 burgers I have ever eaten. Grass fed beef + pork belly? Yes, please! Top that with some Tillamook cheddar and some delicious onion sauce concoction that somehow created a smoky taste and you&#39;ve got a delectable dish.

The burger came with a choice of Kennebec fries, cole slaw, or farm vegetable. I chose the farm vegetable of garlic asparagus. Wow- so tasty! I&#39;d like to try the fries too  and almost ordered both but glad that I did not because I had a burger without the bun and the crispy onions to keep it gluten free and I was still stuffed for many, many hours after brunch commenced.

Hubs ordered the breakfast sandwich. This comes on a croissant with pork belly, eggs, garlic/onion jam, cheddar, and some delicious roasted potatoes on the side. The pork belly was a tad tough on the sandwich but Hubs acknowledged it was still pure yumminess. 

Service was fantastic. Our server knew his way around the menu and held the kitchen in high regard. He was also nice enough to comp my glass of wine when it caused an allergic reaction! (Let&#39;s hope that was just a fluke for me!) 

We will definitely return to this fantastic eatery. Can&#39;t wait to try what else Humboldt has to offer.
(I noticed the burger is $8 at HH which is 3-6 daily...so we may need to drop by and see what that&#39;s all about.)"

We had the calamari, which I initially was against ordering since it is common to many menus--but this one was delicious, and came with tasty roasted shishito pepper. Had a fish special (Halibut) and salmon...both were fresh and perfectly cooked, with the sides tasting as interesting and rich as the main dish it came with. Waitress was very knowledgeable about wine and gave us a great recommendation. We finished with a chocolate dessert that came with ice cream...not sure exactly which dish because our waitress just brought it as a treat on the house, but it was amazing. We had declined dessert for being &#34;too full&#34; but that dessert disappeared pretty fast! Can&#39;t wait to go back."

Crispy broccoli had no flavor, the Brussels sprouts were literally like oil-soaked crisps, and the calamari was served with salsa, which was bizarre. We take like a third of the blame, but seriously unimpressed and won&#39;t be returning. Had to hide our faces and go next door for a taco :("

It may not have been the strongest dinner, but it was still mighty fine.  I started with a Moscow Mule (only $7, and it was stiff and flavorful).

For my meal, I started with the Crispy Broccoli (Grana Padano, pepperoncini aioli).  I can see why this is a house favorite.  It is a super crispy, very lightly battered, broccoli with a flavorful sauce.  It was so crispy and tasty, it felt more like I was eating awesome broccoli flavored chips or equivalent.  It was my favorite part of the meal.

My main course was Pan Seared Boulder Natural Chicken (Root vegetables hash, double chicken jus).  This was a solid dish and had some moist and tasty chicken.  It lacked a certain &#34;wow&#34; factor.

For dessert, I had to make a choice between two less than wonderful options (in my opinion). I usually do not care for bread pudding, and panna cotta to me is just meh.  So, I had the Buttermilk Panna Cotta (with Tropical fruit and lemon verbena).  I think I would have liked this more without the fruit.  The panna cotta itself had good flavor and texture.  It also had mystery bacon bits (a mystery, because they did not appear in the dish description) on top.  Normally I love bacon, but they did not belong on this dish.  I also think a vegetarian who ordered this would be rudely and unpleasantly surprised.  The tropical fruit also brought too much disruptive textural notes to this dessert.  After a while, I just ate around it.  

The lack of a bread basket, or equivalent item for the table was unfortunate.  The service was very good.  This was between 3 and 4 stars for me, but I am rounding it down to 3."

After scooping up a dozen and a half Voodoo Doughnuts to take home, we looked nearby via Yelp! for a decent place that might have lighter fare.  Humboldt popped up and we decided to give it a try.  We were not disappointed at all.  We stuck with small plates: Shishito Peppers, Brussel Sprouts, Tuna Poke and Calamari. The peppers were nicely roasted and seasoned with soy sauce, sesame seeds and a hint of chili oil. Shishito roulette produced no spicy peppers but they were great nonetheless.  The brussel sprouts were excellent - nice and crispy and full of flavor. The tuna poke was like a big sushi roll without seaweed, served with a puffed rice cracker that was a great complement. Before I mention the Calamari, I have to recognize the Top Notch service.  Our server Michelle(sp?) was Outstanding - engaged, funny, knowledgable and vey accommodating.  Truly an excellent experience.  When the Calamari came out, she looked at it and said &#39;something doesn&#39;t look right, the marinara base is too dark and thick. I&#39;m going to have them mKe another one&#39; - we didn&#39;t know what it was &#39;supposed&#39; to look like, so it would have been easy for her to just let it go.  But she didn&#39;t. She re-ordered it, and then Dennis the manager came by and apologized that we even saw the first one, and then comp&#39;ed us the Calamari.

All in all, a great experience, we ended with Banana Cream pie that was really, REALLY good.  Thanks again to Michelle and Dennis and the Chef for a great experience."

I had my 4 year old daughter with me and she slammed her pinky in the door before coming in. It wasn&#39;t bad at all but she cried and pulled it together to go in.  Once in, we got glares instead of boo-hoos, but I did get a bandaid out of our waitress so she was kind.  So about the food...it was amazing! Definite get the broccoli app like they recommend.

The fried broccoli that we got tasted like potatoes and was highly recommended and fell short of my expectations.  All the foods that were fried were very oily and it seemed as if the oil either wasn&#39;t at the right temperature or the oil was old.  My friend had to send his food back because it was so unappetizing.  I didn&#39;t like my food either but was able to still eat half of it because I was so hungry.  Went here for brunch so it might have just been that brunch chef that day or something.  I would be hard pressed to go back.  Hopefully the dinner menu is better.

About three different people visited our table for several purposes (runners, water, servers, etc) which made communication a little difficult - when we asked about the oyster varieties that were delivered, the runner had not much of an idea as-to how to answer our questions about the varieties (and no one followed up - even though I acknowledged I was a fairly novice oyster-goer at the onset).   Asked for coffee at the end of the meal - received none before the check was delivered.  Small things, oh well. 

We had later reservations (9pm) and were sat almost immediately - the restaurant is very well decorated and strikes a unique balance between upscale eatery and down home kitchen.  

We weren&#39;t aware of a prix fixe meal for V-day (much less pricing) when we made a reservation and not a huge deal, but I was looking to have something specific I&#39;d read about in the restaurant descriptions/reviews (whole crispy fish) and their typical menu was unavailable.  The options were good, safe dishes and obviously catered to mass appeal (red snapper, salmon, beef). 

I enjoyed the open-face lobster ravioli and my wife the soy-glazed salmon on udon noodles - both great selections.  Our server made a wine suggestion over our initial request - we were happy she did!  

The crispy broccoli was amazing and definitely a standout.  You must try it if you visit...

Overall a great visit to what is clearly a very well executed restaurant concept.  A couple quibbles that, for me, made this a four star visit, but still not bad!"

Each time we said thank you there it was followed by silence. The bill came out at 71.90 but after splitting it, we looked at 41.00 each?

We came over on Saturday and it was open, so we popped in for lunch.  Less then an hour after they opened the doors and the place was hopping!  They were moving through the line well and since it was newly open it was nice and shiny. 

Burger and fries where fresh and delicious. The space age Coke machine what the zillion flavors was awesome, as always. All in all it was great!  

We met the owner and he pitched the milkshakes. Apparently they are one of the few locations that have them and they use fresh ingredients, not just ice cream and milk, but fresh strawberries or bananas, or whatever you want!

I LOVE Cheddar&#39;s! I have been going for over 10 years now between Illinois when I was in college, to the Cheddar&#39;s here in Aurora. We have had great service and we have had okay service, however the food is always very tasty and the drinks are fantastic. The best part, the price point! For those that are upset about how long it takes to get their food, keep in mind this is a scratch kitchen. They have several chefs back there and while your food should never come out cold (and I am sorry to those that have experienced this), it may take an extra 5 minutes longer than other chains that are microwave heroes. I also love that the recipes for their most classic dishes has never changed. This makes for great memories when I brought my boyfriend and his family here for the first time. They love it too!

Thanks for the great memories Cheddar&#39;s and please go the extra mile to make sure you continually have good wait staff and also to make sure your servers give a smile and greeting to your guests. I will agree with other posts on here that the girls up front need some more training as it could possibly very well be their first job."

The ambiance is nice, kinda dim, average noise level, staff was friendly, our waiter was good he checked up on us a good amount of times and was very good about filling our drinks. It was fairly busy but we were sat right away. The menu is big with lots of choices. The raspberry tea is delicious. They also had lots of good looking salads and Light dishes. I got the Asian Salad with the dressing on the side and he put all the sauces on the side which was much appreciated. It was very good and full of flavor !! Overall decent experience, I would like to go back to try more."

My favorite days to go is definitely Wednesday&#39;s or Thursday&#39;s during lunch time. They are typically not as busy during that time. 

The service really depends on what area you are sitting in. If you sit at the bar area you typically get your food and drinks faster, since it&#39;s the place to hang out for all of the staff there. They do have Tvs on every wall so if you come by yourself you have something to watch, if they do take a few mins on getting the food out. 

As for the dinning area I never had a good experience sitting there. Both times our server disappeared for long periods of time even though they only had two groups in their section. It took us close to two hrs from the time we walked in the door to be out the door. Since they don&#39;t really care if you have been waiting for your food for almost an hr. Both times my food came out cold. Only reason I didn&#39;t send it back is because I was starving by that time and needed to go back to work. 

I really enjoy the fact that you can get the lunch portion even for dinner and it doesn&#39;t cost an arm and a leg to eat here. They have some good healthy options if you are on a diet. 

*****Also bring a jacket with you. They don&#39;t believe in keeping the place warm and have the A/C on. Which only the managers have access to the thermostat from what we were told."

Not bad, very friendly, attentive too but our meals too 32 minutes to come out and by no means was it a busy time.

Food:
I ordered the catfish, Mac no cheese, and fries overall pretty good but too much breading on the fish but the Mac no cheese was awesome, my date ordered the shrimp and chicken tenders it was really good.

Decourum: 
Very nice setup with plenty of space, really good style and comfortable.

Overall:
Id go back but not a special place to take family or friends."

The waiter had no clue about the menu. He headed back to kitchen three times to see what kind of bread they used on a certain sandwich.
It took 20 minutes to get our appetizer. 
My margarita came with a cup of salt on the side. That&#39;s a first!
Water was spilled all over the table and two phones, we did most of the clean up and had to ASK for a free drink to make up for the snafu!
FYI, they can comp food, but not alcohol. They comped our onion rings.  

The food, was amazing! Literally, saved the lunch! Burger, wrap, salad and pasta! Everyone loved everything! The fresh and tasty meal made the trip worth the while."

After I wrote my Yelp review the general manager had contacted me with his contact information, I have left a voicemail and an email and haven&#39;t heard anything back from the general manager Kent Crites, so I took it upon myself to contact CORPORATE this morning.

Good old fashioned home cooking is the best way to describe the food here. Portion size is pretty big so you will get filled up

The margarita was large but seemed weak. We ordered the queso with beef. It had a huge chunk of burnt cheese. The salad was delicious that came with the fish tacos, however the fish in the tacos were highly salty. The two tacos came on a plate with nothing else, no garnish, seemed elementary. My fried catfish was very good, the southern green beans were bland and the cheese brocolli casserole resembled something from a school cafeteria. Not sure we&#39;d give it another chance."

However, others sitting close to me who ordered much later than I already had their food. The waitress notice this and runs to the kitchen to bring my food out, which was cold. This was sent back to the kitchen, the manager approaches me and indicates he is sorry and wanted to know if he could get me anything. All I replied is my food, as I was hungry. The gentlemen sitting next to me, orders his food, and it arrives within less than 10 minutes nice and hot. My food finally arrives it is hot, however the ribs were tough.

Brought my parents here and they seemed to enjoy it.  I got the buffalo chicken wrap which was pretty good and my mom loves the croissants especially!  There were gnats flying around during our visit which I thought was weird, but I&#39;m not sure how controllable that is, by the restaurant so I didn&#39;t take any stars away because of that.

She had such a &#39;I could give a f....&#39; attitude that I really have no idea why I stayed and gave her my order.

We were one of four guests at the bar at 9 pm on a Saturday. My fiancé and I are both in the industry and would NEVER step foot in a restaurant an hour before closing and felt like we were fine to patronize an hour and a half before they closed. We were treated like complete garbage.

Our &#34;thank yous&#34; were met with a grumble and a &#34;yep&#34;. We got our food to go and had a couple of shots before leaving. My shot was NOT a true pour. No count; I probably got half a shot? My fiancé even noticed. The bartender also used the same glasses we had our previous shot in. That&#39;s ok for some people, including us, but how can you not ask us if we&#39;re ok with that? It was so lazy/rude!

Thank goodness we got our food to go. I couldn&#39;t imagine how he was going to get any of his clean up done with us at his bar far before close! The food was incredibly meh. It was expensive.
