It seems like they need to get a waitress to just serve tables bc there are a lot of different seating areas that need attention. There is ample bar seating and the outside patio is nice - even has a pool table. 

We had some tots and boneless wings as a snack. We had the Siracha chipotle and spicy cranberry - both were good. Standard bar food but good! Bill was reasonably cheap too. 

Nice little place to hang out and chill after a long day."

Ordered the fries - solid &#39;meets expectations&#39; for bar fries!, I got a burger and the man got fish and chips. Perfect batter on fish, my burger had fresh made spicy guac and crispy bacon, cooked perfect to the temp I asked for! Our servers never let the plates pile up or the drinks run out! It was fantastic. Outdoor area was open and had a fire pit and pool table. Inside has large ceilings and was beautifully put together. Very impressed and will be back regularly!"

The upside:
They did a nice job cleaning up the inside and building a good space for drinking beer and watching sports. (Around 14 screens mounted up high and they will have the NFL ticket.) It looks like ownership had deep enough pockets to do a lot of things right.

The downside: 
My calzone came out cold in the middle and had to be sent back. Seems like someone coulda noticed the cheese wasn&#39;t melted. It was also unnecessarily challenging to get someone&#39;s attention when we were ready for the check. 4 people behind the bar, and not one noticed two empty pints and finished meals? Scan the bar! 

I heard another neighbor suggest it was sorta pricey for beers. I can understand that gripe as well: $3 Coors banquet bottles doesn&#39;t seem so &#34;special&#34;... 

Still, they are in their first week. I look forward to watching them figure it out. I&#39;ll update this review after they&#39;ve had some more time to establish themselves and work out the kinks."

Food is smoked elsewhere and then trucked over to be reheated, (might as well buy it at Wal-Mart); rice in my burrito was so badly undercooked I thought I was chewing sand; and a &#34;basket of fries&#34; apparently means &#34;tiny plate with 20 fries&#34; for $5...

I was not impressed with the food at all. The wings were not good. Seems like they were deep-fried, the oil was dripping off, therefore the sauce didn&#39;t stick properly. Not impressed. For the price and amount you get, definitely not a bargain. The service was good, our server did a nice job. Inside looks nice. Loved the large booths. Will come back to give it a go again.

Drove by everyday for years and knew there was a restaurant here but never explored it.

To summarize;

Fresh ingredients, food comes kitchen to table in less than a minute, attentive and friendly wait staff, rotating menu with creative apps and specials. 

The owner has been on-site both times I&#39;ve eaten here  and really makes you feel welcome. Has a feel of a family run Italian restaurant mixed with a gastropub. Most of the people coming in tonight knew all the staff by name.

Recommendations:

1. Duck wings
2. Saracha fried polenta sticks
3. Any pizza on the menu 

The pizza is made from scratch from the dough to the sauce. Margarita pizza is made with San marzzano tomatoes, motzerella and fresh basil. The steak with gorgonzola pizza is also amazing."

We tried to go there before, and we happened to visit on one of the two days they weren&#39;t open, so we&#39;ve been curious ever since. They are not open on Sundays or Monday (I&#39;m pretty sure), but we went last night, and I&#39;m glad we did! It&#39;s a bit pricey, but it&#39;s not overpriced for the quality you get. I had the meatloaf/green beans/mashed potato special, and my husband had the pork chop special with raspberry butter sauce. It&#39;s not as sweet as you&#39;d think, but I think my meatloaf was spectacular. It was moist and awesome. The pork chop was grilled, and it was so moist and perfect!! I also had a pineapple martini, which was super. Plan to spend probably $80 if both of you get one drink, more for more drinks. Everyone was very attentive, and the service was great!!! The ONLY bad thing is that it&#39;s kinda loud in there....we sat at a table towards the front near the bar, and there was a group a few feet away, and I kept having to ask my husband, &#34;huh, what?&#34; 

Sit towards the back, for real.

For dinner my wife had the Salmon and I had the beef medallions and added a lobster tail. Food came very fast. Everything was cooked perfectly and incredibly delicious.

polenta fries (seriously order them, only thing you might crave id a bit more sauce...)


beet salad (ok, this is the most flavorful explosion you might have for a long time - its so good it will be an all time favorite 

today we had the surf&amp;turf - omg this should be a daily item - seafood of shrimp and scallops are flavorful BUT the meat ??? seriously its like butter - you immediately want more of it

we tried several deserts and none disappointed us

For several reasons we like to support local businesses and this is one of it - we have not found a disappointment dish here!

ok, sure there are a few things you like to see improvement in but still its a great yummy place

I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed!

great service, great food, local ingredients and you support CO business

They seated us quickly even offered to make my daughter food before the kitchen even opened so she wouldn&#39;t be hungry. Very attentive staff, checked on us frequently. The food came in quick and it was DELICIOUS. Gourmet food that was definitely affordable. The best meatloaf I have ever had in my life. We are visiting from California and we will most definitely return to twin forks tavern the next time we are in town. I would recommend them to everybody. The staff was amazing and the food was to die for! They earned five stars for sure."

I was a little worried it would be super busy but it wasn&#39;t. We started our meal off with the duck wings which were amazing. I had the Pepperoni and  Mascarpone pizza and my wife had the Beef Tenderloin. Both were very good but I think the favorite was the pizza. The wait staff was extremely nice and I believe either the manager or owner was also working the room and striking up conversations with people. We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area for a concert.

Chose to sit at the bar which turned out very well for us. Our bartender/waiter, Aaron, was extremely helpful on our entree and appetizer selection with impeccable pairing suggestions and articulation of flavor profiles. The Thai chili duck wings were crispy and tender, sweet and spicy. The beef medallions with whiskey peppercorn sauce melt in your mouth and come with the perfect amount of scalloped potatoes and asparagus spears. The fiocchi was to die for. El denti pasta filled with pear and cheese layered onto a bed of walnuts, arugula, and a light cream sauce. The manager even provided a complimentary port to pair with the flourless chocolate cake. Aaron was attentive and conversational without being interruptive. Twin Forks was inviting and unpretentious with an upscale neighborhood feel. Our compliments to Whitney, the chef. Pricing...

I am willing to pay a bit extra for both if they exceed my expectations. Good service to me is a waiter that gets your order correct, delivers your food promptly, and checks on my satisfaction but doesn&#39;t make me feel rushed to finish eating. When eating out, I have a very weird habit of eating all my fries before the entree.  I would consider myself a &#34;French Fry Connoisseur&#34;.  I do still expect the rest of the meal to be tasty but the fries make the meal for me.
 
Parker Garage is a restaurant, and bar in Parker, Colorado that has an automotive garage motif. The first two things I noticed as I walked in were the metal rafters and a large bar.  I ate on the patio during the lunch hour and my waiter seemed to be the only one waiting tables outside. Impressively, the service was very good. The waiter was attentive but not over barring.  I can&#39;t say much about the bar because I am still underage.
 
I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich with fries ($11). The sandwich was sub-par.  It consisted of the ingredients of a burger but instead of a patty is seemed like deli lunch meat. I expected the turkey to be a bit more flavorful.  Although, the French Fries were amazing. The fries were thin cut and cooked to perfection with no burnt edges, salted just enough, and weren&#39;t soggy with grease. I will definitely be back for the fries. The meal was a bit expensive considering the quality of the entree but the fries made up for it"

My husband, baby, and I came in after hitting up Parker Oktoberfest, and we wanted some drinks and desserts. We got the flourless chocolate torte, and when I ordered, we asked our server if he had any ice cream - you know, for the little one. He apologized, said they didn&#39;t have ice cream because of their limited freezer space (they make everything from scratch every day, no need for a freezer). We said that was fine and left it at that.

Here&#39;s where the exceptional part comes in - when he brought back our torte, he had with him a cup of vanilla ice cream from Baskin Robbins! Now that&#39;s some &#39;above and beyond&#39; service! He went down the street to get ice cream for my little one!!!

Things like that are what make me loyal to businesses- I will definitely be back."

I eat a primarily vegan diet and only bring locally, humanely raised, naturally fed animal into my house. I was so excited to see a restaurant like this open in Parker.  I went with 2 friends on a Friday night. One had been there for lunch and really liked it. I had heard nothing but bad reviews from other I know, but they were paying so off I went.

We sat out on the porch, which was nice. The service was good. I ordered a Moscow Mule and had to send it back twice and finally ordered something else. It was the worst mule ever. I don&#39;t know how you can ruin a mule. It&#39;s not rocket science. The food was good, not great. I had the pork chop with a sous vide duck egg on top of a really nice corn salsa. It was good, not great and very pricey. The other girls had the ribeye and lasagna. The one who had the lasagna said it was ok, not great. 

I prepare everything from scratch at my house and use only the best locally raised meats, when I eat meat. It&#39;s way better at my house. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back."

Saturday morning we walked to the store front where no hours were posted (do we really need to use yelp for everything?). We waited until the 11am opening time to find they DO NOT have bloody marys on their menu. After we were seated we were given a small plates menu and told they do not even serve brunch on Saturday. No thanks.

The steak was delivered with only a tinge of pink. The chicken was small and flavorless. If your going to have a limited menu then you better do those items well. The Parker Garage did not. 1st and last visit."

Seems as if this Chef is lacking in experience and palate; far too concerned with &#34;design&#34;. Food has no substance. &#34;Poor attempt at fine dining&#34; as one review said. As all of us locals know;  Parker and Colorado as a whole is turning into a pretentious mess. This restaurant is a prime example of what is happening. Will not be going back to Parker Garage nor will I recommend it. Find the heart of true Colorado and you might have something.

My wife and I with another couple went in one Saturday for dinner. 
Apparently we were a little under dressed for the wait staffs taste. The consented staring at us with the look like we were going to dine and dash. We had just came off ranch. Our wives were a little better dressed than us two guys. All this up in till the check came and they saw how we were paying the bill did their prick aditude instantly went away. 

I guess that&#39;s what happens when elbert county people meet parker people"

Definitely a unique touch. Later, I learned that this place used to be a garage. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s where the name Parker Garage came from. The staff was very helpful. They seated us and asked what we would like to drink. When I turn my head to look at the bar, all you see is an eclectic amount of beer to choose from. Pretty awesome if you&#39;re a beer drinker. After looking at the menu, there are a lot of good choices and the waiter suggested the lobster roll and the lobster bisque. The food came out on time and tasted amazing. The chef happened to come out to talk to us and it was very cool to see where his inspirations came from. He definitely has a true passion for making food. He loves what he&#39;s doing and it definitely shows in the food.

I also had the truffle fries and they are simply amazing (definitely order this when you go here). So good that I had to order some to take home to my girlfriend. She pretty much ate it all even though it wasn&#39;t fresh and was a little soggy after a 40 minute drive. (Yes, we drove 40 minutes to eat here and it was worth it.)

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is really chill with TV&#39;s to catch a game that you might want to watch. 

Pros: Great service. Awesome food. Variety of beers to choose from. Cool location. Unique theme.

Cons: I wish it was closer to me.

Overall: I would recommend this place to anyone."

I was familiar with the costs and was fine with that going in.  I had a burger with cheese and bacon.  16 bucks.  For that price it should have been one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had.  It was good, but not 16 dollars good.  My wife had the chicken carbonara. 20 bucks! Maybe if the pasta was made in house.  Also good.  

My kids had mac&#39;n cheese and a burger.  Also good.  The disappointment came when we waited quite a while for a refill and to be asked if we wanted dessert. The bartender was taking care of us and there weren&#39;t many people inside.  When we finally ordered dessert, we got the feeling like he didn&#39;t want us to.  We ended up ordering the flourless chocolate brownie which was really good!   The creed brûlée on the other hand was so bad we couldn&#39;t eat it.  Great texture, no sugar in the creme...only on top.  Either they are trying to do different, or someone forgot to put the sugar in the custard before cooking it.  We didn&#39;t eat them.  The bartender gladly removed them from our bill.  We also had the poutine for a app, 3 beers and some kids drinks.  Total was 106! No problem if things are spot on!  Otherwise, the price was high.  

We will be back as we live close and feel they truly care about the guest experience.  Small improvements and attention to detail will set this place apart from all others in the area.  Pricey for what we got on this Sunday evening."

The food and our server were OK, not great. My salad comprised of wilted lettuce and overcooked tenderloin. The real bummer came after the dinner... during the hustle &amp; bustle to leave, 4 of us left our souvenir wine glasses on the table. We ran back in 1 minute later and were told by the rude, smug boy (same guy who brought the food out and was standing next to our just cleared table) that our glasses have already been &#39;smashed&#39; and thrown away. He then went over to the left side of the bar to mimic smashing them in the bin with a big grin on his face. I understand not keeping items patrons leave behind forever, but to deliberately smash souvenirs that were left for 60 seconds &amp; be happy about it is just bad business."

Normally I would not write a review because I have worked in the industry in the past and some times it is just a bad day.  But today they are doing the food for the Parker colorado October fest and that served me raw pork then told me it was fine. That could make someone very sick doing this and their attitude is unacceptable.

We have, over the course of our visits, been very impressed with the food, service, and atmosphere.  Service has been friendly and sincere since we first walked in.  Atmosphere is really comfortable and open.  Porch is amazing.  The food has been most surprising in a good way.  Burger is great!  Porch chop was one of the best I&#39;ve ever eaten, and we always get the Brussel
Sprouts as an appetizer.  Nice cocktail menu (beer list could use some work)

So nice to have the tailgate next door.  Both places are perfect for their own market.  Yes this place is on the higher end of cost, but it&#39;s on the higher end of quality in every aspect.  If a $12 burger is something you like to complain about, McDonalds is literally less than 100 meters away!  

So glad that Parker finally has a place like this since Vines was sold and has been AWFUL every time we have been over the last few years.  The awkwardness of elev 5900 left us perplexed every time we ate there.  

This is now our &#34;go to&#34; for a nice relaxing time!  Well done whoever runs the place!"

It was not busy so we were seated right away. Hostess and wait staff were very friendly. The food selection is limited but varied. 

I ordered the Turkey Sandwich and my husband ordered the Cuban Sandwich. My sandwich was very good, however my husbands sandwich arrived ice cold. The outside of his Cuban sandwich was warm and toasted but the meat inside was cold to the touch, like it had just come out of a freezer. We had to send it back and the sandwich was reheated and reserved. Also, the bread choice for the Cuban was very dry and hard to swallow. They do have awesome french fries though. 

We have yet to decide if we will return and give them another chance. We like to eat local when we can but for the price, the food experience was disappointing."

Let&#39;s talk about the place itself.  Very very...plain. Not too fancy but not too casual. For the prices they charge for the food I was just not impressed at all with the atmosphere.  

Drink selection from what I saw was very decent. Didn&#39;t have any wine or look at the wine list so I can&#39;t comment on that. I had several single malt scotches and they had a good selection of those. 

Appetizers, there were three of us so we tried three different ones. Let&#39;s start with the duck tamales...1 out of 5 stars. Lacked any taste and just didn&#39;t do anything for me. Crab and cheese fries dumpling were good but so are the ones at any take out 4 out of 5. The bbq pork belly was pretty good...I&#39;ve had better 3 out of 5. I&#39;m being really critical but for the prices they charged...I should be. 

The entrees ordered were the whole fish (family style), beef tenderloin and seafood pasta. The whole fish was well...wholefish. They never did tell me what kind it was but I think it was a trout. For $40 bucks it was...ok. They filet the fish and brought out the bones with it. I would have preferred hem just to bring out the whole fish...it would have been more moist. The beef tenderloin was as good as anyplace else but it was pricey. Didn&#39;t try the seafood pasta. 

The dessert was very good. I ordered some kind of caramel custard. It was fabulous. One of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The coffee was good but was never offered a warm up on it or a second cup. 

Like I said I will be back to try it out again but for spending over $300 for three people I would want a better experience....I&#39;ll give it one more try."

Football on everywhere like a sports bar but then food much better than a sports bar and prices that don&#39;t fit the place.  Almost to the point of get rid of tvs put table cloths down and be a fine dining restaurant especially for the prices. 

That being said our food was excellent across the board. Cold chicken salad, philly steak, and pulled pork sandwiches are all good enough to come back for.

First off, the service was terrible. It took at least five minutes for a worker to come help us find a menu to look at, and give us our table. After about 15 minutes or so, after we had been seated, a waitress finally came to help us once I got her attention. The water we received truly tasted like lake water. I could almost smell the amount of iron in my glass! Not to mention, there was no ice and the water was overly warm. To make matters worse, the menu was very limited at this time, therefore I ordered the Caesar salad-which was a HUGE mistake. The salad was $14, so my standards were high considering the price. However, the salad was one of the worst salads I&#39;ve ever gotten. It tasted extremely bland, there was not near enough dressing or chicken to come with it. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the restaurant, Parker Garage..."

The lack of people in the restaurant should have been a warning sign.  Ordered the fish and chips for lunch and basically paid $13 for a boatload of fries and an over-battered, over-cooked, fish filet that was about as thick as my pinky finger. Literally, a total of 4 bites of fish for $13. The server asked if I would like something else but I didn&#39;t want to wait another 20-30 minutes.

1) Great layout and decor.  It has a really cool central bar that backs up to an open kitchen.  The tables are long high boys that allow for big parties or shared seating with a friendly stranger.

2) Waitstaff. Really nice and knowledgable.  They accommodate most any request we have thrown their way (BTW, we have been there four times).

3) Booze.  They stock local beers and a few interesting domestic crafts.  Nice, non-intimidating wine list, though I am no vino expert.  We&#39;ve had a great cab and some good pinot.

4) Food.  Their opening appetizers have been my favorite items.  Great pork chop, really good burger, poutine, but the gnocchi was a little overdone.

Like it alot.  Better than expected and worth a visit or five!"

Specifically, the ham and cheese hoagie was warm and loaded with ham.

Our hot food was served cold and our cold food served at room temperature. Plus, the story that it takes 7 minutes to pour a specific beer was either a BS line or a very poor choice of product for a restaurant to serve.
With 4 adults and two under 5 children, it took 15 minutes to get water,25 minutes to get beverage service and 50 minutes to get any food on the table.

The draft I ordered wasn&#39;t cold enough my wife said her wine was okay. We ordered the &#34;poutine&#34; fries app which were in a heavy beef gravy and quite strange. For dinner my wife had the ribeye which she said was decent and I had the tenderloin which was good. However the overriding theme of the menu seems to be &#34;heavy&#34; and &#34;meat&#34;.

Our food, then took a very long time after which the bar tender kept apologizing time and again for the long wait. Finally our food did come but I was exceptionally disappointed with it. I got the Opah, which was mediocre at best. No flavor whatsoever, bland, under cooked, and the rice it came with tasted like it came out of a box.

My husband and I shared the chicken dinner. It&#39;s pricey as sides are aka carte but is also very good. $36 tasty???  Not sure, but very good. We ordered the bacon creamed corn as a side and again, very good. 

The menu is very limited and is very expensive. However, the food coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and what we tried was also very good. 

Service was good, no complaints there. 

I&#39;d love to say we&#39;d come back for dinner but I&#39;m not sure we can justify spending that much for dinner for what we ordered.

The Green chili is perfect! One of those rare items that people screw up or do well... chef knows how to do these WELL!!

For our entree we shared a 32 oz rib eye with a roasted shallots -Madeira reduction. The steak was good however, it was $69 and it honestly wasn&#39;t a $69 steak. 

For dessert I had a goat cheese chocolate cheesecake. This was pretty good, not too rich or overly sweet.

As we are eating, a lady dressed in a skimpy black tank top, painted on jeans, and stilettos came up and asked if we were okay, asked my god mother for her menu. Mind you, she had to stop eating, put her fork down, and move her plate to hand her the menu, no big deal. 

About 5 minutes later, were still eating. The lady comes back and is reaching over my dads food to grab my moms plate that she is finished with (while my dad is still eating), then came back and it happened about 4 more times. By that time my dad was mad and disgusted that this woman was reaching over his plate to grab all of our plates. My father asked her If she was in a hurry for us to leave. She laughed and said &#34;oh no, just trying to clean up a little.&#34; My dad then put his fork down &amp; handed her his unfinished plate. 

This was the worst service I have ever had in my whole life. She was rude and disrespectful to my whole family.

One of the things I love about Parker, is that so many restaurants are owner-operated. We have so much great food in our town, but I was fairly underwhelmed by the Garage. 

We were told not to go by a friend, but we went anyway. My wife and I both ordered appetizers, salads, and steaks. The Colorado Poutin was ok. The green chili was, also, just ok. Our salads were good but our steaks were once again just ok. I make better steaks at home for a fraction of the price. This place is a little spendy for what you get given that it&#39;s only about $10 off of Elway&#39;s or Shannahan&#39;s. 

The service was also mediocre; slow and we often waited for refills. 

At the end of the day, there are better restaurants (like Trapper&#39;s for steaks), and we probably won&#39;t be going back. I hope that this restaurant wises up, lowers their prices a bit, and goes in the direction of gourmet burgers or something along those lines."

Our waitress, the bartender, was friendly and gave great service. We ordered the grilled Brussel sprouts as an app, and they were fantastic! The entrees weren&#39;t amazing but was good. My coworker had the grilled tuna sandwich with fries; I had the shrimp and grits. My portion seemed small for the price but, again, the food was good. Drinks were great and the food arrived in a timely fashion. 

Parking seems to be a challenge in this area (Old Town Parker). I found a spot behind the restaurant on the street, but I suggest giving yourself extra time.

But I was disappointed. I want somewhere I can go every other weekend or a couple times a month. Parker needs something non commercial that is likeable. I thought it was pretty crazy that my fiancé and I spent over $100 on dinner... As we would at Chophouse, or Elways... This was not like either of those. Although the waiter Shane was amazing. The food was just to pricy. Maybe older people in parker can afford that, but parker is a family town as well and I don&#39;t see many families being able to go in and afford the prices. Dessert didn&#39;t pop out to me to much which is my favorite, but the wine selection was great! Maybe they&#39;ll have some changes come along, ill see when I head back in maybe next.."

I was pleasantly surprised by the very interesting menu and the great service. The server explained the farm to table (hope I got that right) concept where much of the food the serve comes from their own 1,100 acre farm/ranch. I had one of the best pork chops I&#39;ve had at a restaurant in a long time. The protein and side combinations are really well thought out. The presentations are also very well done. Price to value was fairly good - not cheap, but certainly not overpriced. Kids menu satisfied my two picky eaters. Look forward to returning."

As far as prices, it is on par with Linger, and Old Major (restaurants that I would compare it favorable to.) It is cheaper then Mizuna, Fruition, and Frasca... Most importantly, it is in Parker, not downtown!!!
What we tried:
Sticky Buns with Pork Belly (Excellent.)
Empanadas (Excellent.)
Lamb Burger (My wife loved this, and I was excited it was only $13, but honestly I would probably recommend something other than a burger at a place like this!)
Filet (Excellent!!!)
We also had a pistachio desert that was very good.

I highly recommend this place!"

She is a vegetarian and is used to having to simply order sides of vegetables at many places to cobble together a meal. I wanted to take her to a place that had good vegetarian entrees as well as items that I and my meat loving partner could enjoy. We had wanted to try the Parker Garage for a while, so after finding that they did have vegetarian entrees, we decided to make a night of it. We were all very glad we did. I had  the Fish and Chips which were exactly what I wanted...CRISPY. The fries and the fish filet were both so crisp and delicious. I&#39;m used to soggy fries and fish that gets soggy from the condensation below it. This was perfect. My partner enjoyed the grass fed filet steak and it came with these delicious looking cheesy potatoes. I kept asking for a bite that never happened because it was too delicious for him to share. Our vegetarian guest loved the gnochi with vegetables in a light sauce. The gnochi were on the small side, but plentiful. Their small size works to their advantage as they don&#39;t just taste like you&#39;re eating mashed potatoes like can happen with the larger ones. 
The restaurant has a tavern style feel and has  been expertly remodeled from a 1916 automotive garage. They even used the old wood from the floors to make some very cool looking barstools. 
They source their ingredients locally and have their own dedicated grass fed beef, chickens and quails among other things. They are even developing their own Waygu beef cattle.
I would definitely recommend the Parker Garage, and we&#39;ll be returning soon so I can get my own filet entree that my partner wouldn&#39;t share with me."

Amazingly inviting and welcoming in every way!! Honestly David Evertz was so welcoming and such a nice guy i could not believe it! All the waiters and waitresses were incredible! There was a manager there from Chicago that was hilarious and soooo welcoming! 

The food:
SPECTACULAR!!!! OMG! Only if you order the mashed potatoes is a HUGE serving! Its amazing this is farm to table food but still amazing portion size! The calamari was spectacular and the artichoke was amazing! Also the Veggie sandwich! GREAT!

The place:
AMAZING! Hands down! I live downtown and honestly I wish they would move right downtown!! Amazing!

I had the pork loin for dinner and everything about it was perfect.  My fiancé had the lamb two ways and it was also amazing.  The only reason I would give 4 stars instead of 5 is for the mussel appetizer.  While the mussels were good, they did have a bit more fishy taste than what my preference would be.  We did eat every last one of them, but they were by far our least favorite item of the night.  

We will definitely be back but will skip the mussels and try one of the salads instead."

They advertise Sunday brunch, but it&#39;s really your choice from only four items. Ordered huevos rancheros and when it came out with poached eggs that were very runny I asked for them to be cooked a bit more. After a bit of pushback from the waiter he took the plate but returned a minute later to say that the chef said I could eat them the way they are or have scrambled eggs. No other option. This is the first time ever that I&#39;ve had a restaurant tell me eat it the way it is whether you like it or not. Completely unacceptable. ZERO stars."

When I have a nice meal the thing I like best is hearing everyone else&#39;s conversation. This place is loud. Terribly so. 

The food is also average at best. Very good presentation. It all looks very pretty, but I am not sure if the person who created the meal tasted any of it. The favors are muted, unlike the ambiance. 

Everything is hipsterific but completely lacking in substance. If you are cooking a steak salad (tenderloin) cook the steak as a single piece and then slice across the grain, served atop the salad with the marveling displayed, don&#39;t chop it and serve it like garden droppings. 

It is expensive. More than it warrants by a large margin. 

Parker really needs some quality food competition. There is plenty of disposable income here, but the food is overall awful."

My birthday.... I reserved the Chef&#39;s table. Lo and behold, the person taking my reservation had to frickin clue. Apparently you have to meet with the Chef to discuss the menu. New one on me, usually it is whatever the Chef wants you to have. I have never had to make &#34;arrangements&#34; before at any Chef table (I am not a rookie with this). I was called on the day of and advised that it was already booked; and since I had not met with the chef, I would not be sitting at the Chef table. One Chef table reservation a night? Double booked and they didn&#39;t see it till the day of...Dang.

We ended up sitting in the &#34;bar&#34; area behind the host stand. They kindly comped us a credit, so we got a bottle of wine. As our meal, for three, we opted to do ALL their appetizers. There were eight on the menu that night. The highlights were the Pork Belly with buns and the roasted Brussel Sprouts. All in all, relatively good, service was decent and without the discount, fairly priced. Beware of MP though, a little higher than other MP in the area for similar meats/seafood. I guess since they comped us a portion of the bill, despite knowing it was my birthday... you get nothing extra or special. Kind of loud, but a lively crowd and staff. Good team work.

Today, brunch. We showed up 7 minutes after opening. Our host wanted to know if we had a reservation, what? The place was practically empty. It took 30 minutes to get coffee (on the dot). Our server had to &#34;wash the cups&#34; since there weren&#39;t any clean ones. WTF? She wasn&#39;t that good/organized or systematic. It should not take 30 minutes to wash cups. From what we could tell, someone did not stay last night to do their side-work or come in early to do it. Also, from the grumblings of the not so pleasant staff, they may have been stiffed on staff, they were disorganized and short-staffed. We got our food about 45 minutes. He had their smothered burrito. I had the french toast with whiskey syrup. Hubby says that a good way to judge a place is the standards. We are in Colorado, so a smothered breakfast burrito is the way to judge it. It was delicious. Huge, meaty, saucy, spicy. They nailed it. The french toast was amateurish. A good french toast should be hot, crispy, crusty with a custardy inside. This tasted like a lightly egged and over-cooked texas toast slice. The bacon was a bit chewy, like it was deep fried. The scrambled eggs were super good. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was fresh eggs or egg product, but they got it right. While we were eating, a couple in a table near us got their Eggs Benedict (another standard that you can judge a restaurant by) and I could see from where I was sitting that the eggs were not cooked properly. The menu says the sous vide the eggs. The process should be similar to poaching, but the whites were gelatinous. While we were waiting for our coffee, another couple walked out and complained tot he host that it was the worst brunch and service they had ever had. The host simply said OK. Explains why he didn&#39;t help the servers with waters or coffee, he is an idiot.

I gave them three stars because of the food, some of it was remarkable, but we won&#39;t be going back anytime soon."

So if I did a search for places to eat in Parker...  What do I get? Chains...  Chains and More  chains..  Now say you just got home from work and wanted a very nice meal after a rough day..  Do you jump back in the car and drive 30 minutes for another chain like...  Mortons or del Frisco?  Heck here&#39;s how I look at it.   Said you made 30 bucks an hour.  (i mean you should....  You live in Parker)  you got that nice 3 car garage.  Life is great but you&#39;d just wish you didn&#39;t have to drive 55 plus miles to have a nice meal.  

Now forget the small hiccups that happens with a new restaurant.  Close your eyes take that 1st bite.  Don&#39;t compare it to anything.  Does it taste good?  Is it perfectly balanced?  Is it dry?  Or better yet.  Have you had better? Or better yet...  It&#39;s been over a week for me and I&#39;m still thinking about the duck,  the fish,  the presentation of the soup,  the steak,  that chicken!

Prior to official dinner time they serve a limited menu of fried foods and alcohol.  This was disappointing the first time we came as we were excited about all the hype around the steaks.

I&#39;m serious about my food and left totally aggravated. Before I get in to tonight&#39;s dinner I would like to review the last time I was in.  We got the bass sashimi app which we have had before and was very good and this time they had chop sticks. My husband had the seafood pasta again which he enjoyed. I had the gnocchi which had nice flavor, but very mushy. My husband thought it was terrible.  I got the torte again which comes with expresso anglaise. Yummy 

Now for tonight... I was looking over the menu and realized for the first time it wasn&#39;t very extensive. Had a difficult time choosing something to eat.  
So We got the bass sashimi- someone didn&#39;t know how to cut the fish. It was a complete hack job and just wasn&#39;t good. They didn&#39;t have chop sticks this time and We didn&#39;t even finish it.  Tonight we split the whole chicken with $7 sides of broccolini and scallion potatoes.  The dish not only looked boring, but nothing was very good.  The chicken was plain just as good as a local diner. The broccolini had no seasoning was slightly over cooked and barely room temp. The potatoes were under seasoned and there was not one scallion in the scallion potatoes.  Go figure.  So, I was so aggravated by this point and decided I was never coming back and I wasn&#39;t even zzz going to get the amazing chocolate torte. But... My husband wanted desert. They were out of their bread pudding which he liked. So we thought he may like the butterscotch custard with chocolate cookies and I got the torte.  Now keep in mind we ordered the deserts for specific ingredients. The butterscotch custard came out with no cookies. When we asked the waitress about them she said they had no more and it was really just a garnish.  My husband didn&#39;t want just the custard he needed to eat something with it.  Now I couldn&#39;t wait to have my last chocolate torte with expresso anglaise.  Guess what!? It was vanilla anglaise!  It would have been nice to be told before hand that the potatoes wouldn&#39;t have scallions, the custard wouldn&#39;t have cookies and they didn&#39;t have expresso anglaise.  We wouldn&#39;t have ordered any of it.  So no more Parker garage and we felt they were our last hope of good food in Parker."

This area isn&#39;t exactly a hotbed of Asian cuisine, especially pho-related.  But I was straight up craving a bowl of pho one evening, and wasn&#39;t feeling the drive to Federal.  I&#39;d seen this place&#39;s sign multiple times, and knew I&#39;d eventually be in.  Finally made it in.

The place was oddly clean.  That isn&#39;t to say most pho places aren&#39;t clean, but let&#39;s be honest... most pho places could use a good scrub down and a heavy dose of bleach.  But Pho 63 was spotless, clean, and well-taken care of.

Staff was nice.  They seated us quickly, offered fast service, were smiling, and took good care of us and our fellow diners at other tables.

The food was pretty solid.  Well, the pho was, as that is all we got.  Mine was chock full of tasty meats, and did well some some spice added.  The broth was unique; I think anise was added?  It was certainly unlike any other pho broth I had ever had, and it took me (both of us) by surprise.  It was a good surprise though!

Cheap, as pho prices usually are.  But the bowl was good-sized, full of meat, and hit the spot.

I do like a beer with my pho, but this place does not serve alcohol.  Bummer!

I&#39;ll still go to Federal Blvd for my top-notch pho, but Pho 63 is a solid option in the area."

No alcohol, but everything else was really good."
pho-63-denver-2,Robert G.,UtGRBq0urSlb_QeklI0IZg,"Parker, CO",1,1,1,102,645,1ewZ4EgvWnjYNXJAUgffUQ,4.0,2015-08-31,"Before starting this review, I should mention that I would say I only know three foods enough to judge critically: tacos, BBQ, and pho... This place had only been open for about week when I visited. 

I had the large combination pho bowl. Personally, I think Pho Duy on Federal has the best pho in Denver so i often use that as a standard. With Pho Duy being a 10/10, I&#39;d rate this bowl about a 7/10. The broth was flavorful and not too salty, but they were a little light on the meat. I was a little confused when they didn&#39;t bring out a plate with bean sprouts, peppers, mint leaves, and limes as typical at pho restaurants. I looked around and this seemed to be the case with all tables. Lastly, the amount of MSG used wasn&#39;t overpowering. No matter where you go, the pho will have some MSG in it, using the right amount is very important. If pho has too much MSG in it, it leaves your tongue feeling numb for hours after eating it. That wasn&#39;t the case here... 

The service wasn&#39;t great. The restaurant had about  8 people in it and it was 20 minutes before I got water and they took my order. It took another 20 minutes to get my bowl of pho. You could tell they were still trying to figure things out because the staff was running around trying to fill orders, which is typical of new restaurants. That aside, everyone was very friendly and everything looked very clean, even the kitchen (you&#39;re able to peek into it from the register). 

I will return in a month or two and have another go at Pho 63 once they get the hang of things. This part of Denver does not have many pho restaurants, especially good ones, so I see big potential here. I sparked a conversation with the waiter and he mentioned that they also deliver!!! This is rare of pho restaurants! If this place can make a good bowl of pho next time I visit, I foresee myself coming here often."

They did a great job in renovating the existing space--it is very open, clean and inviting. The servers were very friendly but a little disorganized--kept coming back to the table to take our order and then would forget certain things. This I definitely attribute to it being a new place.

We ordered the Vietnamese Rolls and the filling was okay, but too pasty. We then ordered the Pho and the meat was a little skimpy and the broth could have been more flavorful.

The regular rolls were good.

I found the prices a little high but will come back in a few months to try it out again."

My husband and I have been here several times, and I love it because the food tastes delicious and is so fresh.  The people are nice too.  I always get the tofu pho and my husband get the traditional beef pho.

Recently, on a Saturday night, we were craving pho and we drove all the way here, even though the myriad of pho restaurants on Federal are substantially closer to my house. This speaks to how much we love this Pho place!"

I can usually tolerate subpar service for good food, but this place&#39;s pho tastes terrible. I know it&#39;s extreme but it&#39;s to the point where I couldn&#39;t take more than two bites. The jerk working as a server was too busy to even check to see if anything was wrong. I even had my hand out when he was handing me change and he puts it down on the table.

The broth is flavorful. The rice noodles have the right amount of chew to them. The steak is sliced thinly and dispersed evenly. I read in earlier reviews that some didn&#39;t get the garnish tray but that&#39;s been done both times I was there. The environment is super clean which I definitely appreciated. The prices are really cheap as well. I usually get a medium and it&#39;s only $7.75 here.

I ordered the rare steak pho and enjoyed it.  While it was nothing out of the ordinary, the broth was well-flavored and there was a good balance of noodles and meat.  I also tasted the beef from the beef noodle bowl and it was very flavorful and tender.  The service was quick and cordial.  The one ding I would give the restaurant would be the prices as I felt they were just a skosh high.  Pho 63 is a solid restaurant that I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend to those looking for good pho east of Federal."

The restaurant itself is in a strip mall and offers very little charm.  Huge ceilings, a couple TV&#39;s, music playing lightly in the back.  Almost felt like you were in a waiting room or a cafeteria.  The place was pretty clean though just not much ambiance.  Our server was very quick, we were immediately seated and brought waters and menus.  The place was almost full, too.  Food came out in 10 or 15 minutes.  I got the vegetable and tofu pho and the husband got one of the beef ones.  We both enjyoed it but added a ton of siracha and were looking for a little more spice.  Great value for the money, and like i said, the waittress was very sweet.  We will be back on another cold night."

I have only had pho a few times in my life, so I&#39;m not an expert, but I really enjoyed this place. I had the chicken, and my husband had the rare steak and flank. We also ordered crabmeat wontons (which seemed to have real crab meat in them...something you don&#39;t see too often anymore).

The place was very clean (it is new), and the staff were great. Very attentive and we were able to put our order in within 5 min or sitting. It wasn&#39;t terribly busy at the time (around 8-10 other people).

I enjoyed it and will try something different the next time. Give this place a try.

I ordered Walnut Shrimp that tasted like old grease and was super bland. The walnuts tasted rancid...NOT FRESH. I was extremely disappointed. Eggs rolls were not fully cooked. The outside was a little crispy and the filling was mushy. My fiancé ordered the Sesame Shrimp and thought it was doughy and lacked flavor. We will NOT comeback.

I LOVE Asian food of all kinds, and I have experienced a lot of different culinary scenarios based on the geographical region I was experiencing it in but also in regards to the the region of China, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines or rather any Asian country the cultural culinary heritage was coming from and in some instances I have had disappointing Asian food before but this was by far the WORST Chinese food I have EVEERR had in my life!!! With a capital yuck!!! First off I simply ordered egg rolls, crab cheese won tons and shrimp pad Thai with extra shrimp. The wontons were flat and squished with zero crab in them and hardly any cream cheese!!! The egg rolls were vegetable egg rolls and the vegetables were squishing out of them as though they were a few days old. The pad Thai was atrocious!!! Under done noodles and salmonella shrimp swimming in a greasy sauce-broth. I called to complain or rather warn them of their food poisoning issue and the manager said,&#34;we receive our fake crab won tons frozen and add cream cheese to fill them up&#34; &#34;you can bring your food back for a 25% refund on your next order&#34;
Well excuse me I will never order from there again and for all those that choose to eat there... Good luck with your bowls. I hope it works out for you! This place is an abomination!!!"

I have been several times to PF changs.This time i wanted to try different , hence went to this place for take out. I ordered chicken low mein noodles and kungpao chicken. Both of them are very BAD to taste.The peanuts are bitter to taste.And added to this after we(myself and my wife) ate few bites, both us developed itching likely from some expired stuff in that food.I threw everything away.

I had come down with the post Comic Con Crud (PCCC) and was too lazy to cook.   I ordered the orange chicken, which actually tasted like oranges rather than some gross sugar laden syrup that some places use.  Their peppery squid was pretty good, not the best in town, but a close second.  The hot and sour soup was great and helped soothe my sore throat and was actually full of onions and bamboo and was very delicious.

We also ordered the Sweet and Sour shrimp, which was the absolute WORST sweet and sour shrimp I have ever eaten. There was about 1 inch of shrimp, to 4 sq inches of soggy batter, since it was served in the sauce. the shrimp was over cooked and chewy. my wife was very upset that she ordered that. The egg drop soup was ok. The crab&amp;cheese wantons had a tiny bit of cream cheese, I saw NO sign of the imitation crab stuff. The Chicken lo mein wasn&#39;t horrible, to me it looked like the noodles were just plain spaghetti noodles.I will not be ordering from this place again mainly because of how horrible the Sweet and Sour Shrimp was and how below average the other items were. The dumplings were the only thing I enjoyed. If you over cook the shrimp, DON&#39;T SERVE IT!!!! and for delivery/to go orders, I&#39; recommend putting the  sauce on the side."

Beer selection is standard until you get to the crafts they have - great selection. But the sleeper here is the BBQ - give the Redbird legs a try. Don&#39;t take my word - it will catch on.

But the real hook is that it is just a friendly comfortable place - he assures me they will have the Ticket and that the Chargers games will be available - although I do want to see Peyton get another one even if I have to get ragged about it - he is what pro sports should be.

Give Shawn and his place a shot - it smacks the corp places! I have only been there a couple of times, no dog in the hunt - just like it!"
the-state-pub-englewood,Steve W.,Ii-X2m9MdtDheJ8hQdgFdQ,"Englewood, CO",1,1,1,4,753,QxquyGYBBSKktQoDSKDHEQ,3.0,2015-08-21,"The State Pub is just a few blocks away from my house. They have food and adult beverages, and they specialize in Colorado products. There&#39;s a large selection of Colorado beer on their menu, but only five beers are on tap. There&#39;s also liquor if that&#39;s your thing.

I took the wife for dinner at the State Pub. We each ordered one of the BBQ baskets, and I ordered a local craft beer before dinner. Service was prompt and very casual. It was friendly enough, but when I enter a new business for the first time, I appreciate a little conversation about the concept, the food, and what makes the business special. We didn&#39;t get that at State Pub, but in their defense, I didn&#39;t initiate that conversation either.

The place has been refreshed since the previous ownership, but I think it could use a little more refreshing. I&#39;m also not a huge fan of the trend of serving beers in mason jars, but that&#39;s a personal peculiarity, so I won&#39;t take points off for that. There were quite a few people in the bar when we got there. This part of Englewood is what I&#39;d call a &#34;working class&#34; area, and State Pub fits that working class demand well.

The food was good, albeit served in plastic baskets with plastic utensils. I suppose you can get away with that if your concept is BBQ. I had the brisket which was moist and tender, but I only got the slightest smokey flavor from it. Still, I enjoyed it more than many of the other dry, overly cooked briskets I&#39;ve had in the past. My wife had the sausage platter which comes with three types of sausage. She liked it, but also noticed a lack of smokey flavor or grill marks.

The sides are where State Pub shines. The house-made potato salad was served fresh and quite cold. The flavors were perfect. My wife had the potato chips which also seem to be made in-house. They were perfectly crispy and salty. The BBQ sauce appears to be made in-house (I would know for sure, but as I mentioned earlier, the staff didn&#39;t hang around to chat about the food). There are three kinds of sauce available. Having tried two out of the three, I can say that I&#39;m confident that the third will be tasty as well.

There are some details to work out for this new business. I&#39;d expect a few of those given how new it is. For starters, you&#39;ve got to make a great effort to make new customers feel welcome and to encourage them to come back. If you&#39;re proud of your food (they seem to be), show that pride by telling the customers about how it&#39;s made. Service will make or break you in the restaurant industry, and there&#39;s no shortage of competition in the bar or the BBQ arena. We found our food to be better than what we had at a nearby competitor, and the prices are competitive (in the $10-$11 range), but there&#39;s still some fine-tuning to be done here.

This new business is worth a visit. If you live in Englewood, it&#39;s a good idea to support local businesses like this one. Indeed, there are &#34;classier&#34; options around, but for a good old fashioned working-class experience with reasonably priced, fresh food, State Pub is worth a trip. Be sure to try the potato salad."

What I liked:
* Interesting selection of local beers in bottles / cans (more on this later)
* The homemade potato chips used in their nachos were really good
* Excellent service, although the staff were clearly bored (there was only one other customer there) and a bit *too* attentive...
* Decent happy hour specials

What I disliked:
* The BBQ served was relatively dry and could stand to be a little bit more flavorful
* The draft beer selection was definitely lacking, though they had a ton of different beers in bottles
* Happy hour drink prices were just ok, but I felt their overall happy hour offering (food and beer) needs to be improved to get me to come there over my usual haunts.

Summary:
This local bar has definite potential. Once they improve their food offerings and expand their draft selections, I think this bar could be really good. Right now, it&#39;s just another spot selling $6 beers and so-so food... If you end up here, do try their chips!"

I would except I don&#39;t plan on ever going their again. 
They have an interesting food menu with a couple of yummy dishes but they make you feel bad for ordering. Why bother offering food if you don&#39;t really want to serve it??
The main bartender, or whatever he is, always seems to either be complaining about his coworkers or bragging about his conquests. No thanks. If you want a cheap drink without being shorted just go down the street to Dubb&#39;s Pub."

The BBQ tasted like refrigerator. Between the 4 of us, we all ordered different combinations of food &amp; tried all of the sauces and none were very good. They all lacked depth of flavor and were downright runny. When the BBQ meat is not very good, a decent sauce is imperative. 

Service was also poor. Couldn&#39;t get anything we needed once the food was delivered because Sean never came back to the table. They use plastic baskets &amp; plastic forks, which didn&#39;t seem appropriate for the price. 

We found out after the fact that Sean, who waited on us, is one of the owners, and were quite surprised. For one thing, he looked like a bum. He was wearing old, dirty clothes &amp; looked like he hadn&#39;t bathed in weeks. He was not at all friendly &amp; acted as though we were putting him out. He was slightly busy, but it wasn&#39;t as though we asked for much &amp; he wasn&#39;t &#34;in the weeds.&#34;  Perhaps it was just inexperience &amp; he was overwhelmed. Or perhaps he was too busy doing shots behind the bar. I would except an owner to be a little more friendly &amp; at least act like he cares if he gets return business or not.

12/19 addendum--
Sean, I most certainly saw your comment. I have only felt the need to make a few reviews in the most extreme of situations. I know other folks who have gone in your bar from time to time &amp; made the same observations as I have. I drive by your bar every single day &amp; I&#39;m not sure which regulars you are referring to, because there are at most 2-3 heads in your bar at various times throughout the day/evening that I drive by. Same thing the couple other times I briefly dropped in before The time I ate at your place. 
Maybe because I am a bit older than you with eons of years&#39; of experience in the service industry, but I don&#39;t see ratty jeans, t-shirts with holes in them, being several days unshaven, &amp; stains on clothes as appropriate wear for an owner, and if you do have the experience that you claim, I expect service when folks dine at your place, not to be ignored. I certainly would&#39;ve voiced my concern when we were there but you were too busy drinking shots behind the bar for that to happen. We never saw you again after you dropped our food off.  Also, Sean, how long have you lived in Englewood, &amp; how many other places in this area do you frequent? I&#39;ve lived here nearly half my life, &amp; strongly disagree that you are one of &#34;the most sober &amp; friendliest bartenders around.&#34;
1/15/16 addendum 
Really, Sean? If you love your business and gladly spend so much time working so hard, why do you constantly complain on social media that you are, &#34; so bored,&#34; &#34;so tired,&#34; and otherwise bitching about your long days? 
Grow up, my friend. Life is hard. A business startup requires nonstop dedication for years. You have a great deal of learning to do. At the time of this writing, I also add that you need to learn how to treat your female bartenders with respect. I have heard you yell, speak to them shortly, and be condescending. You never know who are the eyes and ears in your establishment. Stop being an egotistical dick. You have much to learn."

I discovered Zivix via Instagram and was super excited to try them right then and there! That&#39;s when I discovered they were closed Tuesdays. Well, circumstances brought me there last Friday.

Small bites. Tasty eats. You can access Zivix through Spangalang. Zivix has menus throughout the brewery&#39;s tables and countertops, so you can browse before ordering. We tried their savory hand pie, mac &amp; cheese bites, and the pizza bagel.

The savory hand pie was packed with meat and very tasty. The mustard that came with it was finger-licking good! Attest. The mac bites were another tasty item, though that hot sauce utterly defeated me. The pizza bagel was ok. The shredded basil was a nice touch, but overall, quite ordinary.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and filled us up for the dancing that occurred afterward. Thanks, Zivix!

Hopdoddy is walking distance from the Coors stadium, so my wife and I have a burger here before heading to the game. I ordered the bloody mary, and my wife got the moscow mule. I didn&#39;t really like the beet juice in my bloody mary, but my wife did, so we switched drinks. 

Our burgers arrived just after ordering, so the service was really quick. I got the El Diable burger, and my wife got the blackbean burger. Both were pretty good. My El Diablo was seriously spicy! It had jalapeños, serranos, and habaneros. I opened the burger, and I could see all the peppers piled up. Needless to say, the burger was hot! It was just the way I like it, so I was very pleased. My wifes burger was very good as well, but the flavors together were a little weird. The goat cheese with the black bean burger was a little strange, but still tasty. 

We also ordered the green chile fries with the burgers The fries were shoestring, and were seasoned as well. The dipping sauce was very good, and was enough fries for both of us."

Husband and I came here for two consecutive days after trying it for the first time. I&#39;ve tried the Pablano, Primetime, &amp; Magic Shroom. All were delicious. I generally prefer a more classic taste in a burger so my favorite is probably the Pablano. The Shroom is good if you like pesto but I couldn&#39;t really finish more than half because of the dominance  of the pesto flavor. Primetime is really good. Something about the patty that was really good.. The quality was definitely different (better) . I would probably opt out of the truffle aioli next time though.

It has a good open corner spot in Union Square with a decent amount of room.  I dove straight into the menu and was sold when I saw El Diablo, because I presumed that meant spicy.  My family already had their choices made before sitting down.  The Diablo was good, cooked right and of a decent size.  The fries were good too, but that didn&#39;t matter, because my experienced aunt went ahead and ordered a bowl of green chili queso to dip them in, and after tasting that I&#39;m not sure anything else on the table mattered.  Yowza that&#39;s some damn fine eatin&#39;!

They have a good beer list and it&#39;s stocked with local brews, which I always appreciate.  We were seated immediately, service was prompt, and the patio was comfortable.

Pair that with a juicy burger, a huge pile of fries, and you got yourself the perfect outdoor spot! 

I came on a Sunday evening with the hubs after Oktoberfest and the burger hit all the right spots. It was meaty but juicy, saucy but not messy, and the bun was toasty but not crumbly. The order of fries we got to share looked gigantic but somehow we easily ate them all (don&#39;t judge). My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that the milkshakes were very runny. My red velvet milkshake was more red velvet flavored milk than anything resembling a shake.

Hubs ordered a regular cheese burger (yawn) and then we ordered a large fry. Everything was good. I loved all the toppings on my burger. I wanted the actual burger to be a bit juicier but it still hit the spot for my protein fix. We sat at the bar and the service was great - very friendly. We enjoyed sampling the array of flavored ketchups for our fries. Honey mustard turned out to be the favorite and then the Chipotle. We weren&#39;t so crazy about the BBQ. I love fancy ketchups.

Don&#39;t mind if I do. 

Food itself was solid. Ordered the El Diablo and a friend had the magic shroom burger. Both were very juicy, but the burger itself was a little lacking in texture and flavor. Toppings made up for it, however. The habanero and serrano chilis lit up my mouth for a good 15 minutes. 

Overall, a nice place with great service and good food."

We got the truffle fries and the chile con queso fries, they really were the stand out part of the entire meal. Three different burgers that members of the party tried to order had ingredients that had run out, like the bison. So ask before setting your heart to the Buffalo Bill.

Hopdoddy is a cool little burger joint + bar cranking out a wide variety of signature burgers, sides, and funky drinks. The Magic Shroom (goat cheese, field mushrooms, mayo, basil pesto, red leaf lettuce, white onion, beefsteak tomato) is my go-to burger, but I would not hesitate to try anything on the menu. These are not your cookie cutter burgers; they are consistently flavorful, well-executed, and offer some really fun combos. For your boozy fix, go with the Black Cherry Hard Limeade (gin/vodka, lime, black cherry fizz); an excellent summertime drink!

Their large restaurant has a decent amount of outdoor seating when the weather is nice.

I was able to use the new A Line from DIA to escape the foodservice of the airport and find a cheaper and better option in downtown. I settled in with a spicy buffalo burger and a few local beers. The buffalo was great, although the added spice did not really compliment the natural flavor of the buffalo well. Meats with actual flavor do require special treatment. The fries were thin and crispy and disappeared quickly.

This place is popular for good reason. Their commitment to local and natural ingredients is really nice to see and support."

Oops! Guess it was that good (and I was that thirsty) 

Which leads me to my first pointer- drinks are on point. I got the alcoholic black cherry limeade- superb for a summer night! Margs are awesome too.

As for food, our table ordered the truffle fries. Pretty good, but I would say the serving size is a bit small for what you pay. The aioli it comes with is yummy. For dinner, I got a the Caesar salad- which had onion straws and crunchy chick peas to keep things interesting.

 It was the weekend before St. Patrick&#39;s day so there was a parade and lot&#39;s going on but by 7:00pm food was the most important thing on our minds, and we knew that Union Station had some great restaurants.  We decided on Hopdoddy and were told multiple times by our friend that it was not HOPDADDY,    Located on the Wazee street side of Union Station it was easy to get to and there were no lines but definitely a wait list for those that had large groups.  We opted for a high top and pulled in an extra chair for our party of 5.   

The waitstaff is very friendly and pretty quick to get your order, though we did wait a bit for it to get to us and that did include the drinks.   We weren&#39;t in any hurry so we chalk that up to everything being made to order and fresh.  Amongst the many restaurants that have popped up in the area, this one burger bar can hold its own on fresh, from the meat to the potatoes.    Having ground their own meat to peeling and cutting of the fries to the fresh ingredients in the shake nothing appeared on our table that you would question what was in it.   

I had ordered the Continental Club thinking it would be a club with layered  thin meat more sandwich which it was not, it was a good sized full turkey burger with all the fixings.  I was only able to eat half (and all the bacon off it).  My friends opted for the Classic burgers and all of us were devouring the food within seconds of its delivery.    we did have to wait on some fries as my one friend didn&#39;t realize that they don&#39;t come with the meal and had to order but those came out quickly and all tummies were satisfied!

Now back to my shake, I had not thought I would be getting a shake since it was getting cold out and I had originally been wanting a hot chocolate but just seeing Caramel and Sea Salt Shake on the menu make me smile, it&#39;s kind of my new favorite ice cream.  I don&#39;t drink alcohol so it&#39;s always nice to be somewhere with friends that has alternatives to just colas on the menu.   I will say that the $6 buck seemed steep for a shake but when I got it and after passing it around for everyone to taste I knew that it&#39;s worth the price tag.   It reminded me of growing up and visiting my grandparents in Southern Colorado, they lived in a small town called LaVeta where there was a small Creamery.  My grandpa would treat me to a shake made with fresh creamery ice cream mixed in a shake mixer.  It was a nice memory.   

Good food should help to bring back memories or create new, and should always make you happy.   I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the Special: Strawberry Buttermilk Shake and I might just have the Ahi burger too, yum."

Great burgers, if slightly underwhelming on occasion -- but still pretty great. Good cocktails, limited beer selection, and milkshakes that are so good you&#39;ll swear it wasn&#39;t possible to feel so much guilt while sweating pure ice cream.

It&#39;s really an awesome part of Union Station, and a great burger bar to have downtown. They aren&#39;t over the top burgers, though some come close. And they also aren&#39;t the most amazing burgers you&#39;ve ever had, but they are absolutely worth it, even if they come at downtown prices.

I&#39;m usually not a fan of overworked burgers as they usually have a meatloaf type of taste and lose a certain amount of the &#39;flavor&#39; of the meat.  I&#39;m more a fan less handled, natural burgers.  That said, Hopdoddy is definitely an exception.  It was definitely one of the most flavorful burgers I&#39;ve had in quite a while, but you miss that burger bite with nooks and crannies in the meat.

Had the El-Diablo burger that has habanero and serrano peppers, pepper jack, caramelized onions, salsa, chipotle mayo, lettuce and tomato.  Even with all those flavors and heat, the meat was still the star of the show.  I was really impressed.  The bun/meat ration was perfect though a little small overall.

We had the fries, and a lot of them. A regular order of fries is pretty large.  We got the fries with the green chili queso.  As many people have said in other reviews this would taste awesome on a burger.  Again, the flavors are great and fresh.  I did have this wish that this contained some protein such as chorizo - if it did I would order this as a meal of by itself. yum!

Also tried the Primetime burger with Brie, caramelized onions, arugula, truffle aioli and a steak sauce.  Again, good mix of flavors and the meat is allowed to stand out.  Good, but not as good as the El-Diablo.  I made the better pick ;)

The burgers could be a little bigger for the cost as a burger, fries and drink could run you $12-15.  Appreciate their attention to detail though with respect to the fresh, natural, sustainable ingredients. The flavors definitely come through in their dishes.  

Only issue I have - and this is a nit is that everything about the decor, atmosphere and environment is perfect - almost a little too perfect.  You want it to feel like a local place, but unfortunately it&#39;s on its way to being a bigger chain."

Like I mentioned in my tip, all burgers are $2 off, all beers on draft are $5 (they carry a ton of great local ones), and 4-5 signature drinks for $5 as well. 

I had at seat at the bar and the bartender was immediately friendly and welcoming. I wasn&#39;t sure how it worked, but apparently they switched back to a traditional ordering style rather than their previous confusing method of ordering at the counter and then getting a waiter afterwards. 

My first dilemma was choosing which beer I wanted to go with my burger and the bartender was very informative. He asked me what kind of burger I was thinking of, told me what paired well, even let me sample 5 different ones (generous pours) because I&#39;m terribly indecisive. He was super friendly and very knowledgable about the breweries, profiles of the beers, etc. and helped me make the right decision. 

Food: 

Went for the parmesan truffle fries, which were not the best truffle fries I&#39;ve ever had, but the magic is in the sauce. They give you a mushroom truffle dipping sauce that really makes the fries great, and it was also on the HH menu! 

For my main, I decided on the Magic Shroom Burger because of the Yelp check-in deal. Great news- it stacks with the HH deal so you get a great gourmet burger for just 5 dollars and some change. Flavor-wise, I feel like they focus more on the fixings rather than the meat here. The patty was cooked perfectly per my request, but the flavors more so came from the plentiful mushrooms and goat cheese. You can add some peppers for a kick for no extra cost, however, the habenero and serrano peppers come mixed, so make sure you can handle the heat. Otherwise just go for the jalepenos! 

I heard that they have some great &#34;adult&#34; milkshakes here so I will definitely be back and try them, as well as their other offerings. Just a few steps away from Union Station and service is relatively quick, so if you want to make a quick detour for some good food, I would definitely suggest this place."

The first time I came here and had just the fries, queso and a shake I was blown away. The next time, when I actually had their burger (the bandito, which is their one vegetarian option for a burger) I was a little disappointed by the lack of flavor and the crumbly texture. 

This next thing, i&#39;ll admit, is nitpicky, but we had a group of about 10 people and there was plenty of room to sit us at one table, but we were placed at separate tables which made conversation an issue."

I had the Magic Shroom and my Hubby El Diablo. We had the Green chile con queso fries too. The bread on the burger was soft and buttery yet perfectly crispy on the edges. The meat on the burger was cooked to perfection. The burgers melt in your mouth. The fries were good as well the chile had a good little kick. And the sangrita was a decent cocktail and had unique flavor. The service was on point and made our experience even more wonderful!

I got the El Diablo burger and boy was that an adventure! Normally I can tolerate spicy food without a sweat but this burger was definitely on fire! The waiter said the chilies were in season. Although it was hot, the flavor was still there. Definitely one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had."

First off, I love how they bring the fries before the burger. Definitely get the queso with them. Sounds weird, but is SO good!!! Loved this the best.
The burger was so fresh and delicious. Perfect bun/meat ratio along with toppings. They have a wide variety of specialty burgers to choose from. I kinda wish we had gone with the Primetime as the bartender recommended, but ours was still delicious. They grind their meat daily and bake the buns daily, as well. The buns were awesome. No skimping in ingredients here. Wish we had room for one of their decadent shakes, but the local Colorado beer filled us up. Come to Nashville guys!! Great chain!!"

We stopped by after the Rockies game to have a shake, it&#39;s the Purple Rain shake (the shake formerly known as purple haze) that they&#39;re featuring right now. They have re-named it to the Purple Rain in honor of Prince. When we got to the host&#39;s stand and told them we were only stopping by to have shakes he told us there were a few that they were out of and the Purple Rain was one of them. We were bummed but oh well right? But we were so pleasantly surprised when he presented us with a gift card so that our next shakes were on the house! 

Talk about over and above... I was blown away! We will absolutely be coming back! 

Sometimes it&#39;s the littlest gesture that can really make an impact and Hopdoddy obviously gets that! 

(I should add that we never got upset or threw a fit. Take note, it pays to be nice to people who you are talking to, and sometimes you even get free shakes out of it!)"

If you have never been here, you order and pay near the kitchen and they bring food to your table where you also get assigned a waiter. This is a little weird to me because if you end up getting more food/drink at your table you will have to pay an entirely new bill. Why not pay one time, at the end? Oh well what do I know. Moving on...

To start, I got a side of the Parm Truffle Fries for the table to share. Those were the best damn fries I&#39;ve ever had and I would go back just for those. I think they were only like $6 and you got enough for 3 people. I enjoyed the fries so much I barely could finish half my burger (the Llano Poblano) but NO REGRATS

Check this place out if you want a good bite near Union Station. It&#39;s more pricey than your fast food burger, but the high quality of ingredients is apparent. Highly recommended!"

I had what they call a hemp seed patty, which is a vegetarian patty with various nuts and seeds in it. It doesn&#39;t really taste like a burger and is a bit dense for me, so I didn&#39;t care for it. Next time, I&#39;ll try the ahi tuna burger. However, they have AWESOME green chile queso fries (the queso is served on the side in a cup). I could just eat a big bowl of the queso, like a bowl of broccoli cheese soup, but better! Seriously, like crack. I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since. They have a cute condiment bar and they also offer water and hot tea for free on the bar. Cute place.

The ahi tuna burger is incredible.  The milkshakes are a thing of the past for me, as I found out recently about a cow and goat milk allergy, but they are AMAZING!!  They will mix flavors for you! 

What I got this time: the bison burger as a lettuce wrap without cheese or any sauce &amp; I added avocado.  I apologized for my complicated order but they were super gracious.  It was full of flavor with just the right amount of crisp on the outside to compliment the juiciness on the inside.

We got our own water and refills. Seemed odd. I&#39;m sure they do the order ahead to help ease wait time when there&#39;s a large crowd but it just seemed like they needed to work some kinks out.

The food was great though! I recommend the prime time. The fries were great too. Everything was a little pricey but ingredients were above average so I suppose it was worth it. I wasn&#39;t as wowed as everyone else. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be back"

I&#39;d so rather sit at my table and look the menu over, than stand in line doing it.  Also, the beer selection and pricing is such a disappointment.  $7 for a pretty standard Colorado beer that I could find in any restaurant?  No thanks.

As for the food, it was just okay.  I got the Magic Shroom burger and it was SO rich.  It really needed something to contrast with the beef, mushrooms, goat cheese and basil aioli (that was oozing out of the burger).  We got an order of regular fries and I thought it was so weird that they bring them out right away before your burger gets there.  I did really like the dipping sauce options though and the chipotle ketchup was our favorite.  Overall, this place just isn&#39;t worth the price.  There are way better burgers to be had in Denver."

So the burger is good and the fries are decent. The prices though.... it should have three $$$.
It&#39;s definitely pricey and the fries don&#39;t come with the burger, which is kinda cheap. The truffle fries are super pricey too. Especially if you are one person getting food for lunch.

So I&#39;d say go ahead and eat there. It&#39;s decent, but be ready to spend at least $10-15, probably $20 on one burger and fries."

This establishment suffers from a confusing mix of fast-food and restaurant service paradigms.  Table numbers. Waiting in line. Pseudo-waitstaff. Who do I tip and when?  Where do I get water?  Did I do something wrong?  Is this Qdoba or Denny&#39;s? I wonder if the employees tire of seeing confused patrons standing anxiously at the front of the restaurant looking about for help. 

The burger, promised to be medium-well, was rebelliously medium. Volumes of grease soaked the bottom bun, my hands, and my face.  The price of the burger with side was unwarranted for any establishment that requires a queue.

The atmosphere is the opposite of comfortable and authentic. It&#39;s a cookie cutter corporate masquerade, a cuckoo among its established neighbours.  This is an urban Panda Express for trend followers who don&#39;t understand service or cuisine. 

The one positive is that the staff are kind, helpful, and downright attractive urbanites (hipsters). I appreciated their hand holding as I stumbled through this social experiment.

The burgers have a lot of flavors and is a good sized portion. I personally liked the ahi tuna and classic burgers. I thought the ahi tuna burger was unique and creative and tasted pretty good. Their truffle fries are also really good - either as a side or as a starter.

Of course, you have to try their shake if you have room for dessert. I&#39;ve had the Lemon Olive Oil Biscotti, Caramel &amp; Sea Salt, and Nutella &amp; Chocolate Pretzel. All of these flavors have been really good (although very very sweet). I really enjoy the lemon olive oil biscotti shake because it is refreshing and not as sweet as the other ones I&#39;ve tried.

I&#39;ve known Mehdi, for a little over a year, and was anxious to try Persian food, I&#39;ve already become VERY passionate about, as it&#39;s what we are served at the Senior Day Care I attend. I enjoyed Koobideh Kebab, sprinkling Sumak on the beef, after savoring a lovely mushroom soup. Marcel, my friend, tried the Joojeh Kebab and truly enjoyed it. We treated ourselves to the Persian Pistachio Rose Ice Cream w/chopped Pistachio pieces sprinkled, on top. It was cool, creamy, and wonderfully refreshing. The perfect end to our perfect lunch. I&#39;d recommend Surena to anyone who appreciates authentic Persian food, or would like to experience this exotic, healthy, and delectable food. You won&#39;t be disappointed. 

The restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated, elegantly. Everything is pristine and I imagine it would fit in, perfectly in an upscale New York or Los Angeles restaurant area.

We had 2 apps to share between 5 of us. One was an eggplant dip served with flatbread and the other was like fried rice cooked into a slab, crunchy on the bottom and topped with some tasty toppings. 

I had the lamb kabob and there around the table had other types of kabobs. Everything we tried was fantastic. We also had dessert, I had a delicious rose water ice cream and one person had a pastry thing drenched in honey which was apparently a bit too much honey. The complimentary tea that comes with dessert was great too, can&#39;t buy it here but they import it."

It wasn&#39;t too busy when we arrived to this restaurant around 11:30?

They have lunch specials for $10 and it includes this absolutely delicious mushroom soup. If you like mushrooms and if you like soup, you&#39;re going to really enjoy their soup...just a fair warning. I ended up ordering the Koobideh Kabob lunch menu. The normal portion includes 2 skewers which is way more than I could eat in one sitting. After we ordered, it did take a little bit of time for our food to arrive, but I was not disappointed by my first bite. The Koobideh was very well seasoned and had great flavors every bite I took. It wasn&#39;t over cooked at all and the meat was very tender. The rice was well cooked also (you&#39;d be surprised at some restaurants under cooking their rice). They included some butter on our plate so I added it to the rice and it was extra tasty. I don&#39;t care what anyone says! Butter makes everything better.

I ordered the kabob wrap and that came with lettuce and special bread instead of the rice. The ground sirloin kabob had lots of flavor. The peppers were pretty hot for a wimp like me. My favorite was the soup. It was so creamy and I love mushrooms! The only other mushroom soup I have had is Campbell&#39;s cream of mushroom and obviously this soup beat Campbell&#39;s hands down.

I first went here for lunch with one of my more adventurous friends. I&#39;ve never really eaten this type of food, but I can find something I like anywhere I go and am always up for something new and different. You definitely need to try their Tah-Dig appetizer. It&#39;s some sort of stew served over this crispy rice &#34;cake&#34;- so delicious and borderline craveable!! Their lunch portions are HUGE and a great deal at $10. We each tried a different meat and I really, really liked their rice that came alongside mine (koobideh kabob). Her salad was pretty meh alongside her kabob wrap. But the soup that comes with their lunch specials was super flavorful and delicious. I like the charred tomatoes and peppers they serve with the meals as well. My friend also tried the Doogh drink, and it was really different- a little too off-putting sour/bubbly for us but definitely glad to have tried it.

After eating here for lunch, I observed this would make for great takeout just due to the nature of the food. So a couple weeks after my first meal here, I dropped back in for a takeout dinner for me and hubby. Since I knew how huge their lunch portions were, I ordered one dinner entree for us to share (which is seriously double the lunch portion) plus the tah-dig appetizer and it was the perfect amount of food. He really enjoyed it and I was happy to see the flavors and quality was just as good as takeout. 

Both times, the staff here was incredibly friendly. They were happy to share suggestions and explain the food to us which I really appreciate, and need, when I&#39;m out trying something totally new.

I will definitely be back, in fact as I&#39;m typing this I&#39;m craving it again!"

In the beginning the place was a 5 stars restaurant no ifs and buts about it. My mom is a 70+ Persian living in LA &amp; she is very critical of Persian restaurant&#39;s food/service. She was visiting late April early May and we came here twice. She had nothing but nice things to say about the food, service and the place.

Food quality has changed since then. I noticed the Kobideh was slightly weaker/off starting in June. My last visit was Wednesday July 27, and the Kobideh was the worst I ever ate here, it was border line. The Barg was average. I asked my server (she is Persian &amp; worked there since opening) if they have changed cooks or maybe the butcher... she told me no everything/everyone is the same and no changes. This confused me a bit. If everything is the same why is the food quality going downhill...

When they first opened they had nice table cloth on their tables. Now they have glass on their table tops. The glass makes it easier to clean and setup but is not as nice as table cloth. On one occasion the salt &amp; pepper shakers on the table were not clean &amp; were greasy. Persian or not five star restaurant have good quality food consistently... not just on the Friday/Saturday nights. Also, pay attention to little things, how hard is it to wipe clean the salt shaker while setting up the table...

The place is not inexpensive to say the least. Soltani is $22 &amp; it does not come with a salad or anything. Most starters are $6, so with a salad or yogurt plus a soft drink you are looking at $30 before tax and tip. I&#39;m not stingy, I don&#39;t mind paying whatever just as long as I&#39;m happy/satisfied with what I am receiving.

Main thing I want is good quality food consistently and they have not been consistent, this is very disappointing. The photos I&#39;m posting where taken back in May and all was good then."

The hubs and I came here with our international food group. We started with the crispy basmati rice app with half and half on the stew selection. The rice was fabulous and the stews were reminiscent of Indian dal and paneer. 

I moved on to the chicken thigh skewer with the bayberry rice. The chicken was very flavorful but still juicy. The hubs went with the lamb shank with the dill/Lima bean rice. I wasn&#39;t as much of a fan of the flavors but the lamb fell off the bone. 

Dessert was baklava. I love baklava but this one was over powered by rose water. I just don&#39;t like roses or hints of in any dessert I eat. I did try a bite of the ice cream and it was the same rose flavor. I&#39;ll come back for the savory!"

To me, the most appropriate beverage to begin a Persian meal has always been the very effervescent yogurt soda called Doogh Mashky, and Surena&#39;s rendition will have your palate primed in no time for the dishes that are about to come next. Speaking of which - you can never go wrong with their daily soup selection, whether it turns out to be barley-based [Aash-e-Jow], or more noodle-rific [Aash-e-Reshteh].

And for you eggplant fans out there, it&#39;s time to turn that frown upside down, because Surena has a knockout appetizer [Kashk-e-Bademjan] that slow-roasts it before mixing it with whey and just a hint of mint! I know everything&#39;s already sounding wonderful but trust me, this is just the beginning... hope you have room!

A lunch entree that&#39;s always appealed to me at Surena is the tongue [Zaban] sandwich, with hunks of juicy meat in mushroom-tarragon sauce, sided with cool veggies. The sandwich is served open-faced on top of chewy lavash bread so that diners can arrange everything to their liking before rolling it all up. But their rotation of beef stews is certainly worthy of mention too, whether the co-star is potato [Gheimeh Cibzamini], braised celery [Khoresht-e-Karafs]... well, you get the idea. If poultry sounds more pleasing, you might also enjoy a moist, marinated Cornish hen [Joojeh Kabab]. But don&#39;t forget to save a little space for dessert, whether it&#39;s a bit of baklava, the chewy-creamy Bastani (saffron/rosewater ice-cream) or a pastry selection (yes, the Bamieh are the little round ones and the Zoolbia are the squiggly ones). Salamati, and enjoy your meal!"

The appetizers are filled with vegetarian dishes but I can&#39;t say the same for entrees. Two appetizers and a kabob entree must suffice for 2 ppl.

Before writing this review, I will preface it by stating that my wife (who is Persian) and I just moved from the Bay Area, and we are used to amazing Persian food. We ordered Mast-o-moosir (yoghurt), joojeh chicken and salmon.  The salmon was terrible--it was extremely dry such that my wife only ate half of it.  The bread for the yoghurt was awful; we are used to fresh bread (from the stone oven) in Persian restaurants but this one had bread that looked like it came straight out of a bag from CostCo. The salad was iceberg lettuce and it too was not appetizing. The best part of the meal was my diet Coke!  

As I sit here writing this, I feel gross; I will definitely NOT return!"

Denver area is really short on such food. The ambiance is good, clean, owners and help are friendly. Could use some music. My soltani was pretty good. Joojeh kabab was very nice. The ghormeh sabzi was with beef. That is just wrong. It must be lamb shank. I hope they change that part.
Also, need some more spices in appetizers: feta cheese with lavash and radish, more saffron in rice, etc.
I am not complaining, just hoping"

The server a young man was not very accommodating nor concerned with me or my friend. She is a vegetarian so she got an appetizer which has flat bread, cheese, walnuts, and a salad mix, I cant remember the name but we did not enjoy the plate at all and did not eat it. The salad was just too strong for our taste. When we told the server he asked if he could try the salad which we said ok to and then he just said sorry you didn&#39;t like it. I got the koobideh (spelling) and ground chicken kabob plate and it was amazing and pricing was also right at only $14 for a huge plate. Our experience was saved thanks to the owner whom came over and checked up on us and told the waiter to remove the appetizer from our bill.

The koobideh arrived on a huge bed of basmati rice with a pat of optional butter. (I&#39;m kind of a rice addict as well.) and grilled  peppers and tomatoes. Perfectly seasoned (IMHO) and juicy.

They did a great job remodeling it into a Modern Sanctuary.  It was a very serene and soothing feeling decor.  I wish that things had continued with that first impression.

Friendliness:  So, we got off to a bit of a bumpy start at Surena.  When we walked in the Hostess was going to seat us in the middle.  I have a problem having my back exposed, something that I feel Zoroastrians originally from Iran might have an understanding of, but hey, whatever. We asked if we could sit in a booth.  Everywhere else the request is graciously accommodated, NOT at Surena.  She informed us that none were available and that it would be a while.  We asked to wait and she tried to push us to a table in the middle again.  She had a bit of an attitude problem and that doesn&#39;t mix well with first impressions. She then offered us seats on the Patio or in a Private Room.  I was fine with Patio seating.  She then told us there wasn&#39;t any Patio seating available. Then WHY Offer it?  By this time I was really irritated and ready to leave, but my husband assured me that the food was good. Then one of the Half Circle booths opened up and we asked to sit there.  She then told us that was seating for five even though we could clearly see that the other two Half Circle booths were occupied with a family of FOUR and a group of FOUR men respectively. It was really disappointing, because I was so excited to try this place.  It just looked Legit and Authentic.  When my husband and I lived in the DC and San Diego areas, we got the BEST Persian food and to date we haven&#39;t found a place that even remotely compares in the Denver area.  Finally she begrudgingly prepared the Half Circle booth and we were seated.  

After we were seated her attitude seemed changed a little, but I observed her complaining to another wait person about us-well to be fair, probably just me as she was eyeballing and gesturing in my general direction.  Again, I was just ready to leave.  

Overall NOT a good first impression of the &#39;Persian Friendliness&#39; that they tout themselves with on their website.   When the subject of Surena comes up again with my husband, I will most likely steer him across the street to Sahara where the food is superiorly delicious and the service is friendly and welcoming.  It&#39;s not the same, it&#39;s not Persian Cuisine, It&#39;s Moroccan, but they have fabulous Lamb Shanks and Eggplant Dishes.  And their Pita and Hummus is Very Very good. Or maybe I will steer him back to Ariana Kabob, an Afghani Restaurant that we enjoy.  Good Food.  Very nice people.  

The Food:

Appetizers:  

Mast O Moosir: This is a Thick Yogurt with Shallots. We enjoy it and this was an average good, but could have been a bit more flavorful.  We also had the Kashk Bademjan, a Roasted Eggplant Dish.  This was my favorite of the two appetizers.  The Eggplant has a very smoky flavor and paired very nicely with the mint sauce and I am assuming Feta cheese and yogurt sauce.  The Lavash bread they were served with both is an un-levened flat bread, very thin, and fairly good when served warm.  We ordered more and the second round came out cold and it was clear that it is probably not made in house.

Main Courses:  

Vegetable Kabob:  Served with Basmati rice.  This is a nice mixture of Grilled Zucchini, Bell Peppers, Eggplant and Roasted Roma Tomatoes on the Side.  There was a nice Smokey Flavor to the Kabob Veggies and overall it was spiced very well, but had a little more char than normal.

Koobideh Combination:  Both the Beef and Chicken Koobideh were well seasoned, but a tad bit on the dry side. The rice was just rice and nothing special.  Served with Roasted Tomatoes.  I have to say Persian Style Roasted Tomatoes are one of my very favorite things.  

Mahicheh (Lamb Shanks):  These were supposed to be served with Potatoes and Carrots, but there were no Potatoes or Carrots.  That being said, the Lamb just fell off the bone and was very very tender, well seasoned and delicious served with Baghali Polo-Saffron Dill Rice and Fava Beans. The rice was a little on the dry side, but tasted good.

Dessert:  

Persian Ice Cream:  Very Good.  A llight, not overly sweet Pistachio Ice Cream with Rosewater and Saffron.  I love the Eastern and Middle Eastern ways of combining Saffron and Rose Water!  YUMM!  TRY IT!!!  Very Reminiscent of the Kulfi we got at Ghokul Chat in Hyderabad, Telengana, India, but not nearly as heavy.

Zoolbia and Bamieh:  This was very nice especially paired with the Persian Ice Cream, the Fried Dough pieces were kind of like a short Churro sat on top of a Jalebi like deep fried sweet that was drenched in Honey.  

Get the Complimentary tea, It&#39;s a very nice smooth Black Tea with well rounded Tanins and is a nice complement to the Dessert. And I really liked their version of Doogh.  This was Dill based not Cumin Based.  I am accustomed to the Cumin Variety.  The Dill was a nice surprise."

It is a beautifully decorated restaurant which serves fine Persian cuisine including tasty kabobs (both beef and chicken), signature stews such as Ghormeh Sabzi and Gheimeh, and a very nice vegetarian/vegan entree.

Portions are generous as there has yet to be a time that we didn&#39;t end up taking half of our food home. 

The wait staff is outstanding! They are attentive, kind and responsive.  Like any other restaurant, there are times that they get very busy and the food may take a little longer, but what sit-down restaurant doesn&#39;t?

I strongly recommend Surena to those who seek to try delectable, exotic and flavorful Persian cuisine."

Had the beef soltani the first time. Kubideh was great but the barg/fillet was exceptional. Had joojeh kabob the second time and it was also incredible. 

Also recommend the Persian ice cream here. 

The atmosphere is classy and elegant, the service without faults. 

I look forward to returning and trying the various khoresht/stews they have as well."

It is beautifully decorated, offers great service and has a staff who genuinely thank you for coming back to their restaurant. Now let&#39;s talk about the food. Delicious and yummy can not adequately describe their food. I finish eating there and I can&#39;t wait until I&#39;m back again. The food makes you want to sing. Yes, it&#39;s that good. I ate the beef tongue which was so tender that it cuts easily with your fork. The tarragon sauce is light yet full of flavor. We ordered the zesty vegetables as a side and the yogurt with cucumbers. I don&#39;t know how their yogurt is so creamy but you just want more. We&#39;ve also tasted the marinated Cornish Hens, Braised Beef as well as their Lamb all outstanding! Each dish full of flavor and spot on with their spicing. You cannot miss this gem. If you live in the metro Denver area drive south you won&#39;t regret it.

Usually they don&#39;t stand a chance but this place is absolutely on par the couple times I&#39;ve eaten there. And the staff/management are very gracious and nice.

Second time I went, was a mess. First of all, they were out of Ghormeh Sabzi on a Friday at 6:30pm. So I was forced to choose something else. I chose the Soltani Kabob. Our food took forever to come and when it did, my barg was some cheap sirloin looking thing or some lamb. This is 2016. If the type of meat isn&#39;t specified, Soltani is suppose to be a skewer of filet mignon and a skewer of koobideh when you charge $8 more than your Koobideh Kabob and $5 more than your Barg Kabob and $7 more than your Chicken Barg (well at least at high end Persian restaurants I&#39;ve been to in other states and in Iran). 

It wasn&#39;t a big deal till what seemed like the owner came and insulted me in farsi. I speak and understand farsi, I guess he didn&#39;t know that. 

And how deceiving is it to describe what type of meat you use in every dish in detail except for the Barg Kabob and Soltani Kabob. If your soltani isn&#39;t filet mignon and koobideh, then how do you justify a $5 more price increase then your Barg Kabob and $8 more than your Koobideh Kabob? If it&#39;s one Koobideh Kabob and one Barg Kabob from your menu, then pice averages out to $15.5, not $22. And I&#39;m pretty sure the &#39;King&#39;s favorite&#39; would be filet mignon. Barg can be chicken, lamb, or beef. But when you charge $5 more than your other barg entree, it must be filet mignon unless you&#39;re tying to scam people. Maybe you should specify on your menu what type of fillet it is. You specify everywhere else in great detail what type of meat is used. And don&#39;t charge $17 for 2 skewers of barg, and $14 for 2 skewers of koobideh and then $22 for 1 skewer of barg (which is not filet mignon) and 1 skewer of koobideh. If you don&#39;t want to make it filet mignon, drop the price to $15.5 ($7 for a koobideh and $8.50 for a barg, according to your menu). Don&#39;t try to scam people and then insult them when you give them sub-par meat. I really don&#39;t care about the price at all. But it&#39;s obvious when you aren&#39;t transparent on the meat you use in the barg and soltani, but you are extremely transparent in the meat you use in every single other dish (you even state chicken thigh, cornish hen, chicken breast, ground boneless chicken breast... sirloin beef, ground sirloin beef, chunks of beef) that you are apparently being deceitful. Sorry I know quality meat and quality food. 

Thanks for insulting me and for average Persian food instead of &#39;Persian hospitality&#39; being your &#39;promises to&#39; me and &#39;quality food and a great atmosphere&#39;."

I don&#39;t enjoy writing reviews like this but it is all true.  I can&#39;t remember ever hearing the phrase &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; so many times during one restaurant meal.  When we arrived at 4:00 the lone waitress was with one of the 2 occupied tables and said from across the room &#34;I&#39;m sorry I will be right with you&#34;.  After a few minutes we were seated at a table with plate glass covering the tablecloth (cheesy) and asked if we would like something to drink.  Yes please, 2 arak with water and ice.  &#34;I&#39;m sorry we are out of arak&#34;.  Can we see the wine list?  Sure, we have pinot grigio, chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon. OK, we&#39;ll have a bottle of pinot noir and some mirza ghasemi and panir sabzi.  &#34;i&#39;m sorry we are out of fresh herbs for the panir.  OK, We&#39;ll have the lamb kabobs medium rare.  &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we are out of lamb kabobs but we have some lamb chops&#34;.  OK, we&#39;ll have the lamb chops medium rare with zereshk polo.   The wine delivered was Barefoot pinot noir ($6 retail), the bland mirza ghasemi came with a nice paper thin lavash.  After a while our waitress came to the table and said (you guessed it) &#34;i&#39;m sorry the lamb is taking so long but that is because the chops are bone in&#34;.  That makes me chuckle just thinking about it.  Just then another couple came in and she said &#34;I&#39;m sorry I will be right with you we are having a rush right now&#34;.  All 4 tables.  When the lamb arrived it was a generous portion of medium well chops and a huge mound of bland rice with a skimpy addition of zereshk.  The charred tomato and peppers were delicious.  When she came back to check on us I mentioned that it was an interesting version of medium rare but we would take the leftovers with us.  After cooking professionally for over 20 years and seeing the movie Waiting  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmzGaSQYznA   
I am reluctant to send food back for a replacement especially when the kitchen is in the middle of a big rush.  The manager came over and agreed they were overdone and brought us a take out container of maast-o khiyar as a consolation prize.  On to desert.  We ordered Persian ice cream, zoolbia barmieh and some Arabic coffee.  &#34;I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t make Arabic coffee&#34;.  The ice cream was the best thing we ate there however if you plan to have it order it with your entree because it was so hard it must have been dipped in liquid nitrogen bowl and all.  The fried pastries were room temperature and the syrup had little flavoring.  When the bill came I noticed the wine was billed as chardonnay for $25.  I thought that was a bit steep for such a cheap wine.  &#34;I&#39;m sorry, the pinot noir is not in our system yet&#34;. The price was reduced to $20 (still a rip off).  This place has a lot of potential but you can&#39;t do business from an empty cart.

Sorry we went."

The Carlito is cooked when you order it.  Served on a fresh torta roll with tender and perfectly-seasoned carnitas.  My husband and I always split one large sandwich.  Half is just right for me when I&#39;m famished.

When you walk into the store, a quaint and charming ambiance feels the air. It feels real and authentic as they have described in their name! Definitely one of the better torta serving latin restaurants in Denver! The chefs are hospitable and friendly! 

Parking is available in the back if you can&#39;t find a meter.

PS: The Pablo is especially good for Hawaiian Pizza lovers!"

There is a small little lot (free parking) right behind this tiny eatery in the back in case you do not find parking (metered) on the street (free after 6 pm). 

My husband and I came by here last Thursday (9-17) for a late dinner. Around 8:15 pm, we saw a few patrons eating at the little counter and employees cooking up some meat and vegetables on their stove top griddle. After browsing the menu, we decided upon:

By the way, I just want to mention that each torta comes spread with mayonnaise, beans, avocado slices, tomato slices and grilled onions. You can also choose between your choice of the following to add to your sandwich: jalapeno pepper, chipotle sauce, avocado serrano sauce and jalapeno jelly. 

Miguel Torta, $7.75 prior to tax- My husband decided to order this torta which comes with steak, egg and cheese. This torta came already cut in half and was more than enough for one person to eat and feel satisfied. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The creaminess of the mayo and avocado really went well with everything that is stuffed in this large sandwich, making each bite better than the last. 

Enrique Torta, $7.75 prior to tax- I opted for a vegetarian torta (I know that isn&#39;t traditional, but I am fan of vegetarian food options and believe me, I did not feel like I was missing meat) that comes with egg, cactus, queso panela cheese, crushed red peppers and another type of cheese. This sandwich was really good. Just like the Miguel, this sandwich was also cut in half. I only had half of my sandwich and saved the other half to be consumed 2 days later (which still tasted really good). I liked the red peppers and cactus, as it gave it a really nice added flavor and texture. The avocado, mayo and smashed beans really complemented all of the ingredients. 

------------------------
(Total= $16.74 including tax, prior to tip)

With Yelp Check In, you get a free cucumber lemonade. I thought it was okay, but felt it needed to be sweeter. But my husband liked it and found it to be refreshing. 

Wait time for our sandwiches was not that long. Seating is quite limited here, probably can fit about 10 people. But just be aware that there is no public restrooms. 

So if you are looking for something really filling to eat for lunch or dinner, then Torta Grill should fit the bill. Food is pretty affordable and is really good (messy, but good).

Would definitely order food from here again if I was ever in Denver again."

A friend (a GI doc, actually, which will be funny later) recommended it to me. So while hubs and I were waiting for a show at the Ogden, we ran up here to try it out. 

He had the Carlito, and it was as good as promised. I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but also not a huge meat eater, so I went with the Enrique with chipotle sauce, which had such interesting toppings as catcus and and egg. It was DELICIOUS! Seriously the best meal I&#39;d had all month (and that&#39;s even comparing it to some $$$ restaurants). A little greasier than I would have wanted, but a delicious, and interesting blend of flavors. And thanks to the little gift from the Yelp! check-in coupon, we were able to try the Cucumber Lemonade for free. It was refreshing, but sweet, and really good. 

Why the three stars? Fast forward to me getting home at midnight after the show (dinner was at 8). My stomach started cramping up. I tried a pepto bismol (probably outdated, because I almost never have to take stuff like that). Didn&#39;t work. By 1AM, I was puking my guts out. I slept on my bathroom floor until 5AM. It was bad news bears from both ends. Hubs fared better than me, but his stomach was still upset as evidenced by the smells escaping from him. (Have you completely lost your appetite now?). I was the DD and didn&#39;t have anything to drink at the concert, so perhaps some beer helped partially disabled the germs in his stomach. 

But you guys...it was SO good! Just because someone didn&#39;t wash their hands after going to the bathroom, I paid for it all night. Even so, I&#39;m going to trust these good reviews, and give them another shot some day. I&#39;ll be looking for their sanitation score the next time I come in though. Good hand hygiene is imperative!!"

A place called torta grill, I expected to have at least a couple traditional tortas on the menu. Unfortunately,  they are all over the top combinations of tortas. I am sure for some people this is a fantastic menu with a twist on a torta, for me it was too much.

The staff is friendly and the tiny place has a cool atmosphere. I thought it was a tad pricey for a torta place but they do have more options of things to put on your torta and a cool selection of speciality tortas and combinations. Expect to wait a while. They make everything fresh (so it&#39;s pretty good once you get it) but it can take 15 minutes or so.

Skip it if you&#39;re looking for a basic torta but definitely hit this place up if you are up for being a little more adventurous with your torta and trying something new!"

They are a two-person show. One mans the cash register, the other cooks. Everything they made was fresh, greasy, and hot! I had a chicken sandwich with pineapple, BBQ sauce, and more. It was great!

The only negative to this place is the space itself. It&#39;s really small - there are high-top counter seats for 5-6 people and that&#39;s it. Because they cook right in front of you it is HOT in there. It&#39;s nothing fancy, but their food is great!"

An why is it when I go to most mexican places all they have is coke, and maybe jarritos? the juice and lemonade here freshly made washes down the thick carnes very well.

the ingredients are great too, but special mention to the way they lightly fry the bread to perfection. really makes the sandwich.

It is a little hard to find initially as it is tucked away in the corner. The store is small and exactly what I would want to find for authentic tortas. 

My choice for the day was the Enrique which is their veggie option. Cactus, cheese, re fried beans and avocado sandwiched between soft bread? Sign me up for more. I inhaled it. The flavors went so well together and I would definitely go back for more. 

I washed the whole thing down with a cucumber lemonade which even the small size was too big for me to finish. The only complaint was the drink was served in styrofoam which is an environmental nightmare."

All of them are cooking the same exact thing. So I was really excited to read all the wonderful reviews of Torta Grill. Hubs and I decided to have a very low key birthday dinner for him Saturday night. Turned out to be a little full still from our afternoon festivities that we skipped Torta and made plans to go Sunday during the Broncos game. Turns out they are closed on Sunday. Bummer. Okay let&#39;s get delivery for dinner on Monday after work! 

It&#39;s Monday, yeah we&#39;re excited for Torta! We both choose the hector, different sauces so we could split them. I go to place delivery online but I am wary because when I came back to look at the menu I noticed a review suggesting that they say they deliver but they really don&#39;t. So I was a little skeptical. I did some digging and realize they don&#39;t deliver past 5PM, but their website does allow you to order delivery after 5. So that&#39;s a poor customer experience. And it was hard to find the right times. We decided to just pick up the food, which was a painless easy experience. 

Fast forward, 20 hours later and my husband was sick all night and is still ill. I&#39;m fine and we ate exactly the same thing. And btw the food was totally delicious. It was so good. I think so solid clean up and maybe proper temperature checking might be just what they need! I am always the one to get sick too so if my husband is sick, you know something is wrong. 

The sickness and confusion about time open and delivery on their website is why I&#39;m giving them 3 stars. I will definitely try again though to see if anything changes."

They aren&#39;t a fast food joint so don&#39;t expect blazing speed but it is worth the wait. I tried the hector torta and it was pretty legit. Who doesn&#39;t like breakfast in a sandwich?

I ordered the Juan Torta which is steak, pork and cheese. They had other sandwiches which had all kinds of stuff in it but I felt like something more simple. I also asked for the pickled jalapenos and chipotle sauce on the side which went extremely well. The sandwich came with lots of fixings such as guac, refried beans, tomatoes, onions and mayo which made for a very satisfying albeit messy sandwich. I wished the bread was toasted more so that it could hold up to all the sauce and condiments.
It was a bit of a wait for the torta even though I was the only one there, but it was worth it.

I also had the cucumber lemonade which was very tasty and refreshing. The small size was actually pretty big.

The place is really small and only had a handful of stools. Luckily it was a late lunch so it wasn&#39;t busy so had a seat right at the window which offers an entertaining view of the all characters on Colfax Street which is sketchy but fascinating -- there was a dumpster fire across the street with some kind of commotion by the transients hanging around by the bus stop. They all dispersed when the police and firemen arrived to put it out.

The Pablo sandwich was sweet and tangy (couldn&#39;t figure out the ingredient) but was just right for a satisfying bite to eat.  Also ordered the tamale (nothing out of the ordinary) and a quesadilla (cheese, onion, avacado, chicken) was definitely not typical.  Their homemade red sauce (chipotle?) was amazing!  Definitely will be back to quench that spicy/tangy craving!"

Specializing in Mexican sandwiches (Tortas) they also serve tamales, fruit juices, and if you&#39;re in the mood, a whole coconut! All their sandwiches are by first names. My husband had the Jose: ham, chorizo, egg, and cheese. I ordered the Miguel: steak, egg, and cheese.  All tortas come with avocado, refried beans, tomatoes, onions, and mayo (unless you request otherwise). 

The tortas are rather large, I was starving and only ate half, my husband was happy to finish it though. They&#39;re also delicious, and so stuffed I was worried the bread would fall apart. It courageously held on, but I recommend getting a fork. 

Also, there was a Yelp coupon for a free cucumber lemonade with purchase of a torta. I&#39;m glad I redeemed it, very refreshing!  As if I needed another reason to love Yelp.

The only seating is at a bar at the window or in front of the kitchen. We got there right before a lunch rush, food was out quickly and the staff is super friendly! Check them out when you&#39;re in the area!"

  I love the sandwiches here.  The Pedro is my usual pick with spicy hotdog and milanesa steak done with beans and avocado on a crispy torta roll.  Dang.  Oh and don&#39;t forget to try their chipotle salsa to spice up the sandwich.  I get that and some jalapenos just for character.
The food here is great but the juices will keep you coming in often.  I like the cucumber lemonade, it will be on your favorite list this summer too I bet.  
The spot is privately owned and operated which just adds to my great experience here."

Over the past 9+ months, every single time I have called to order delivery, they have told me they do not deliver. There is only one other review on yelp that I saw for Torta Grill that mentions this.
This past weekend I placed an order through Eat 24, thinking that if they had a listing with Eat 24, it must mean they started deliveries again. Nope! Eat 24 called me 45 minutes after I placed the order to tell me that Torta Grill wouldn&#39;t respond to their emails or phone calls, and they refunded me my money. I&#39;ve got a refund on my bank statement to prove it.
Torta Grill, your food (in the few amount of times I actually ever received it) was delicious, but if you won&#39;t honor your delivery orders, stop telling everyone you offer delivery services."

While I don&#39;t have the ability to tell if it&#39;s authentic, it certainly is better than an (Americanized) Cuban Pressed Sandwich or the (Americanized) Panini! One thing I don&#39;t understand is why our favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurants don&#39;t usually offer this delicious sandwich. Does it really have to be a dedicated business?

I loved everything about my sandwich &#34;The Hector&#34; (Chicken, Eggs, Chorizo, Cheese), especially the eggs were scrambled just the way I prefer - with visible whites and yolks! I expected the bun to be tougher but it really wasn&#39;t, which was better that way. I swear the bread itself has flavors, mmmm!

&#34;The Carlito&#34; (Homemade Carnitas and Green Sauce, Cheese) was my boyfriend&#39;s pick and it&#39;s very tasty too, but sans the eggs, it felt less &#34;juicy&#34; and fragrant. I was so grateful it&#39;s not breaded steak because I&#39;m not ready for that yet, maybe one of these days...

We also tried one of each of the tamales. The green one is definitely better than the red, as the latter was too dry. I&#39;ve had better tamales elsewhere so I&#39;m going to be skipping these next time around.

We&#39;ve heard so much about Torta Grill&#39;s fruit juices and not surprisingly, the strawberry lives up to its praise (and it comes in a huge cup even for a &#34;regular&#34; size, can&#39;t imagine how big &#34;big&#34; is!). But don&#39;t expect fresh squeezed or pressed juices, they&#39;re pre-made and might&#39;ve been diluted with water/ice, but still good and taste real.

The dudes that work there were all very nice and they&#39;re fast at cooking the food. One kid who speaks fluent English and was obviously in charge that day let us use the Yelp check-in special (one free Cucumber Lemonade) on top of redeeming a voucher. Now I don&#39;t have to come in just so I could use up my saved reward, I&#39;ll just come in because the food&#39;s so amazing!

One drawback is the place does smell like pee (!) but it&#39;s because of the back alley and you know what I mean. Don&#39;t let that stall you though, at least you get to enjoy free parking because of that back alley! I&#39;m reluctant to even take off half a star for this great grub joint!"

I ordered the Carlito which is the original carnitas torta. The great thing about this place is that you watch them make your torta right in front of you. From grilling the bread to searing the steak it&#39;s all done in front of you. I got a side of the chipotle sauce, which was delicious, but I actually found that my sandwich didn&#39;t need it, it had great flavor, especially with the serrano avocados!

I used the check-in for the free cucumber lemonade, sadly...didn&#39;t love it. (But I rarely drink soft drinks/sugary drinks so it could just be me)

On the downside....don&#39;t be in a hurry here. It took over 15 minutes from the time I walked in until I got my to-go order. It was great to see my food made fresh, just not the speediest of places to go. Overall, a great torta for $8."

I love this place, and I feel that it&#39;s hard to go wrong with Hispanic flavors and it&#39;s also hard to go wrong with sandwiches. These people nailed my wishes exactly.

The menu is easy to decipher and ordering is a snap. Sandwiches are made to order, so expect to wait 5-10 minutes for it. All sandwiches come with avocado, tomato, light mayo and onion. You also get the option to add spice if you want; I always get Serrano avocado sauce. My sandwich I believe is the Arturo - eggs, cheese, pork loin and ham.

If you want fast casual food that&#39;s actually worth the money, swing by Torta Grill. It&#39;ll definitely be worth your while."

Torta Grill is small. It is the kind of place that you are almost expected to take the food to go.  Think about a long counter with some bar stools and a few bar stools against the wall facing Colfax.  That is it.   No tables. . .the place is way to small for tables.

The food though, is awesome. . at least the Tortas. Don&#39;t expect a lot of sides (just potato chips). .but the sandwich will do you.  I&#39;ve tried a few variations and everyone of them hits the spot.  Plus you can ask for some chipotle sauce to add to it on your own. . and that just nails the coffin shut

Both times I&#39;ve gone they had/honored a yelp coupon for a free Cucumber lemonade (The perfect sweet/not to sweet match to the Tortas). . .and both times I asked for refills &#34;normally not&#34; then I note I want water. . and they just refill it. . .so . . maybe no refills?

The menu is diverse, and delicious, you have to trust the selections and just dive in for one of the tortas. I loved mine, thought it stayed together really well while eating it which was a nice bonus. On top of the tasty food, the horchata was excellent and the large drink size is quite large.

It&#39;s not really authentic, but it&#39;s not really unauthentic either. It&#39;s just Denver&#39;s own interpretation of an idea not unlike Kings Of Leon&#39;s take on arena rock. Or Chance The Rapper&#39;s take on hip hop. It all belongs to the overarching genre of &#34;rock&#34; and &#34;hip hop&#34; respectively, however it sounds nothing like Bruce Springsteen or Wu Tang Clan. But is that any reason to write them off as hacks or frauds? No way, Jose. 

That said, welcome to Torta Grill. They keep it simple - a handful of different house specials, a couple of tasty sides, and some delicious juice drinks - that&#39;s it. One guy takes your order, another grills up your sandwiches, and you&#39;ve got quite the tasty fast casual Mexican operation.

I went with the Hector (chicken, eggs, chorizo, cheese). All sandwiches also come loaded with refried beans, avocado, tomato, onions, and mayo. As you might imagine, it was a perfectly indulgent calorie bomb in the middle of the day. Greasy, meaty, savory - it&#39;s a winning combo.

I&#39;d been trying to get a fellow torta lover to come with me and explore it, and showing her the ratings and the # of reviews averaging it an extremely yummy place to eat; but they always had an excuse and didn&#39;t want to go.  So I resolved to explore it myself the first chance I got - which finally arrived yesterday.

Stephen and Ardeni are wonderful owners that are easy to talk to and truly care that you are happy with their tortas.  I was eyeballing the menu posted in their window from the outside, and another person came out and offered me a to-go menu to take with me.  Helpful!  It was a tough call, but I finally narrowed it down to 2 options and headed inside.

The establishment is pretty small -- you could maybe fit 20-30 people around the inverted &#34;L&#34; of space around the counter - if they didn&#39;t mind being close to each other.  But the place does have a charming air about it.  There is a definite &#34;Dia De Los Muertos&#34; vibe in the place, in a wonderful mural on the wall, the skeleton marionette hanging near where you&#39;d place your order, and 4 very artistic and beautiful skull masks on the side of the grill/oven hanging over the cashier&#39;s head.  It could easily double as a small HQ for OIngo Boingo fan clubs.  They also gave me, gratis, a small cup of their cucumber lemonade.  Tasty and refreshing and just the thing you&#39;d wanna suck down when it&#39;s 95 outside.

As regretful as I was not to be able to eat there, I a) just wasn&#39;t hungry enough at that point, and b) was rushing all over on a tight timetable yesterday, so I had to take my foil-wrapped torta to go.  It was a tough call but I finally settled on the Arturo (pork loin, ham, eggs and cheese).  I finally made it home about 45 minutes later, unwrapped the torta and put half of it in the microwave for 20 seconds.  *So. Delicious*.  I can see why this place is neck and neck with Las Tortas now.  They do not have any TV up like at Las Tortas, so there are no Mexican music videos playing...which is a nice change of pace if you want to eat someplace quieter or actually converse with someone.

We&#39;re truly blessed in this city to have so many amazing dining establishments; Torta Grill is a crown gem among them.  I can&#39;t wait to get back here and try some other options. :)"

Both sandwiches were incredible!  The flavor, the texture, the portion size, everything was just right.  It&#39;s a little messy, but it tastes so good that you won&#39;t care.  This is the perfect place to go for something a little different.  I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

The Torta Grill popped up as a highly-rated option. And I was super excited to get some Mexican food. So we hiked over (since it&#39;s Denver) and eventually reached the store. The place was empty which made me kind of weary of trusting Yelp reviews. But we kept going anyway. The Illini game was on TV so that was cool too (actually, I don&#39;t really care about sports, but I&#39;m obligated to show loyalty to my alma mater). 

I ordered the Torta Grill Especial and my free drink with check in. We waited a bit and saw them prepping and cooking the meats in front of us which was really cool. They kept adding meat to mine and by the time it was done, it was a monster of a torta that looked like it was dripping deliciousness. 

I honestly didn&#39;t think it would fit in my mouth. But it did. And it was delicious. And that&#39;s what she said. Honestly, I think I blacked out from how good this torta was. And I kept thinking about how I wanted to come back hungover so that I could just drown my misery in food.

Regulars come in and he knows exactly what they want. I let him know that I had been disappointed with the tortas I&#39;ve been getting lately. I told him that I drove all the way from near the airport just for this...boy was it worth it. I usually order to go, but something told me to have a seat and stick around for a few. 

I ordered a favorite, the carnitas torta and also a pollo torta (for hubby later...if it makes it that far!) with that, I got a chicken tamale and a cucumber lemonade. Wow, am I glad I traveled for this. Great service and food. I will be back! As Steve says, &#34;Not bad for a white boy!&#34;

Denver&#39;s best place to try Pupusas.
Does have a very limited inside counter area to sit and enjoy your food on site. Local take away or just plan ahead and eat it there at one of their picnic style tables on the &#34;patio&#34; -- (meaning a small fenced off part of the parking lot)

I realize this place is a little lacking in atmosphere, but that kind of makes me love it more.  It&#39;s small, busy, always crowded, most of the seating is outside, orders can take a while, and only if your lucky is there an employee who can speak English.  Don&#39;t let any of that keep you away because I haven&#39;t even mentioned the food.

The menu is short and to the point; tacos, papusas, tortas, burritos and a couple other random offerings.  There is no fancy salsa bar, but they make several different kinds (all delicious and spicy) and seems everything on the menu is paired with the appropriate salsa, which they include.  Also, homemade horchata.

I have never had anything I didn&#39;t like.  But, what I really drive all that way for is the BEST tacos Al Pastor in Denver (IMO) and some really great papusas.  

They no longer have Lengua on the menu, which is kind of sad.

Oh yeah, and two of us left full and happy for under $12"

I would give 5 stars and more for food but 1 star for service. I called them and placed an order for Papusas and got there after 20 minutes and food was not ready.

We tried the Revueltas and Chorizo y queso, they were both good, but the Chorizo one was the fav.  Their papusa sauce was more flavorful and zesty than most I&#39;ve had and their red hot sauce was lightly smoky and very very spicy, a little goes a long way.  Tacos were good but a little bit dry, they def needed a little salsa to go down.  The strip of pineapple included for the pastor was a nice touch.  

They do brisk business and the wait area is tiny.  there are a few stools along the narrow counter but this is def a take out rather than dine in place."

This isn&#39;t your typical sit down restaurant, as it consists of a walk up window catering to take-away orders. There is a small bar with about 4 stools if you prefer to eat it there.

I couldn&#39;t pass on the al pastor which come shaved off the vertical spit Mexican style. We sampled tacos, a torta and pupusas with the al pastor. My favorite was the torta, but the tacos were also very good. The pupusas were hot and fresh served with a slaw and red sauce. They were not my favorite, and the red sauce was very disappointing. However I should note that I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of these little stuffed pancake-like treats. The horchata was spot-on delicious though.

This was our first time here and we got 2 burritos and a papusa. We have never tried a papusa before so we only ordered 1 papusa con pollo (chicken). It was sooooo good!!! I recommend eating it with the coleslaw and salsa, they all go together really well. I will definitely be eating plenty more of these! The burrito was also really good. The meat was flavorful, the burrito was packed full of stuff. The insides were evenly distributed so that you had a little bit of everything in every bite.

In winter there is only a 4 seat counter to eat at. So really take away only. Also the area is, we shall say a little depressed.  We came at night, and you may want to go for lunch instead. Staff do not speak much in the way of English, which is fine.  I had attempted asking if the counter lady, had a favorite meat. She grabbed another lady cooking, and she said the steak or pork. I don&#39;t think asada, and pollo sound anything a like, and I never mentioned the bird the whole time we were there, then got made my order of two carne asada pupasa&#39;s as chicken, still they were the best thing we ate. We also got 3 burritos, 2 carnitas, and one lingua. The ratio of meat to everything else was meager. The carnitas were in no way crispy. Honestly I was expecting way more, considering the near perfect review. Items came with 2 salsas the red one just tasted like bland tomato, the green one was quite good. It took some time to get our to go, so don&#39;t go here expecting to exit fast. The food is probably better than Taco Mex, but that has an eat in area, and a salsa bar.  It was great value, and maybe I will try again in  for a lunch in summer? I would eat the tacos and pupusa&#39;s next time, skip the burritos."

The line was out the door meaning it must be good. We only got 2 papusas, but they took roughly 30 minutes to make and were super, super good and a great deal (maybe $2.50 for one?). Served with slaw and some green and red sauce (all of which were OK).

Next time we went was this past Saturday. No line this time. We each ordered two papusas with carne y queso. We also got the Jarritos drinks. Our whole meal was probably about $12-$13 for two dollars. Awesome deal. The papusas were great, but when I put the slaw on them.. I didn&#39;t like the taste so much. Also, this time around they gave us 3 different sauces (2 red, 1 green), which was great because we had more dipping variety. We wanted extra cheese in the papusas, but the lady behind the register said the papusas would explode? They have extra queso for the papusas on the menu, though.....

I like the outside patio because it is right on Colfax and you can see the true E. Colfax neighborhood hanging out. For me, it is a nice culture shock (even though it&#39;s only a few miles down from me). It&#39;s also very cheap. I want to try the tacos here or something else."

I waited a while for my two raja Papusas with beans and rice. When I got them they were cheesy crispy happy on a plate. The cabbage slaw was tangy and perfect with the tomato sauce and papusa. The beans and rice were also perfect and my absolute favorite kind of rice.

I also got a papusa.  The papusas they make FRESH. Like the dough, putting all the stuff in the dough, and cooking it, and it takes a while.  Like 20-30 minutes.  Tacos take 3-5 minutes.  If I knew that I would not have gotten a papusa.  &#39;&#39;

I got the papusa because I like to say the word.  I can hardly believe there is a food called papusa.  You can say it all sing-songy: Can I have a pap-u-sa?  Mi Quero un Papusa. It was yummy.  All doughy and warm,  tastes just like Mexican love.  Its comfort food, for sure.  

For the other gringos: A papusa (I think) is like a fat pancake of dough with stuff in the dough, like meat or cheese, then they cook it on the grill.  Like a savory fat pancake tortilla with stuff in it.  Like a mexican latke, with no potatoes.  

So while I was waiting for my papusa to be made, I got to gander at all that come here and work here in the back.  It was impressive the range of folks that stop.  Spanish speaking families, dudes from the street, neighborhood tough guys,  an occasional hipster, and even a tiny little asian lady.  Every walk of life likes tacos and papusas.  Every. One. And THIS is the place to get your papusa  and street taco on. 

While I was watching people order, I noticed some things.  You can get cheese and lettuce on the tacos, IN A TAQUERIA!!  The ladies make those papusas one at a time by hand.  They make the flan in house.  there are like 4 ladies back there cooking, and it looked so hot back there,  and they were all SO busy the whole time.  1.75 tacos is a great deal, made from scratch, by several people.   The kitchen is bigger than the waiting galley and the waiting galley is tiny.  Def. take out.  (people knocking down stars for that; DUDE. It&#39;s a taqueria.  Get over it. )

I suspect the corn tacos are also made in house, because they are thick and fluffy and so fricken yummy.  I loved this place.  It seems like someone lifted it right out of Mexico and onto East colfax.  Like a magical papusa fairy.  Ding!! PAPUSA MAGIC."

Since Denver has a very large Hispanic population, every time I visit the area I feel obligated to eat cuisine of that nature. Most times, it&#39;s been extremely Americanized, Tex-Mex crap. This place is quite authentic. 

Since I knew I wouldn&#39;t be back in the area for a few months, I ordered as much food as I felt I could handle. 4 tacos (2 chicken, 2 carnitas), and an al pastor-stuffed Pupusa. 

Absolutely DELICIOUS!

The tacos were served with a side of freshly cut onions (with a sprinkling of cilantro), and freshly cut limes and radishes. Very delicious. The chicken was a TAD on the dry side, but was still pretty good.

I will admit, this was my first-ever pupusa, but at 2.50 per serving, this could have been its own separate meal. It was served with red salsa (delicious), and some coleslaw. When eating, I attempted to make a taco out of it by putting some of the coleslaw in the middle and curling it up, as one would do when eating NYC-style pizza. It worked, somewhat.

The Al Pastor was delicious - full of flavor. I will definitely be trying some in a taco on my next trip. The carnitas were also quite good. The chicken was a little bit on the dry side, but this could be easily mitigated by combining with salsa. 

My consensus - this place has delicious, cheap (for 4 tacos and a pupusa, it was around 12 dollars) authentic Mexican/Salvadoran food.

My only qualm was that the radishes served were not pickled, and were not sliced thin. If this restaurant pickled their own radishes and sliced them thin (for taco garnish), in addition to having slightly more flavorful chicken, it would have gotten 5 stars. 

I will 100% be back next time I am in town. Try this restaurant, you will NOT be disappointed!"

Salsas were good, red sauce was very mild but I really liked the 2 other (red/green) salsas for more heat. Try with the cabbage slaw.

The pupusas are the star here: impressive almost more in texture than in flavor. 

Kind of weirdly, you can get a pupusa al pastor. It was pretty good, as was the new rajas pupusa (cheese and strips of chile pepper). 

-Yes, the place has the good and the bad of a place with funk: you wait a long time, there&#39;s not a ton of parking, and you don&#39;t want to be wolfing down those pupusas at 7 pm on a cold Friday night, cramped into that tiny waiting space with a million other people eating alongside you.

I put on the salsa verde, and even without it, the burrito had some kick, but not to much of a kick.

The papusas (A Salvadorian dish, it is a tortilla filled with cheese, beans, or meat. Usually served with a special tomato sauce or cabbage mix) was DELICIOUS!!!!

The good:

The pupusas were out of this world delicious. Highly recommended.
Staff was fun and friendly.

The average:
It was late so the al pastor was a little dry and lacked flavor. I will try again and update my review.
Tortillas for the tacos where a little dry as well, but again, it was getting late.
The torta was average. Not the best bolillo I&#39;ve ever had but worth a try.

This isn&#39;t fast food by any means and you can tell just by watching the kitchen. 

We ordered a variety of tacos, papusas (sp?) and a shrimp cocktail. 

The shrimp cocktail came out first and was very very good. It was more like a chilled soup with a tomato base with shrimp, avocado, onion and more inside of it. Came out cold and was amazing on a hot day.

We then went into the tacos which were good, but not mind blowing. Definitely some of the better tacos though I&#39;ve had in Denver. The chorizo was my personal favorite.

Lastly we had the papusas and these were AMAZING. Definitely the go to meal here based on what other people ordered. A papusa plate comes with three papusa&#39;s of your choosing, a nice slaw and an amazing red sauce. Definitely get these when going here."

Honestly, the carnitas and al pastor tacos were my favorite and they came with pineapple, which I&#39;ve never had with tacos before, but I really liked it! Also love that my cilantro didn&#39;t come full of a million onions. This is the first taco place I&#39;ve found where I can just have cilantro without onions... so happy for that. 

I also tried a beans &amp; cheese pupusa... and wow, soooooo good! That caramelized cheese is delicious. My bf really liked the cole slaw it came with and I liked dipping it in the tomato sauce. 

The only down sides to this place is that there are only 5 bar stools inside to sit on... so it&#39;s outside seating or take it home. Also, it&#39;s in kind of a creepy area. If the motel across the street is boasting about their &#34;clean rooms&#34; on their sign... you know it&#39;s not the nicest part of town.

Since moving to the EC (East Colfax), we have become regulars at this joint.  They are open late, cheap, and offer delicious, fresh Mexican.  

I&#39;ve had my fair share of tacos al pastor and have to say, Tacos Acapulco offers the best.  The meat is very flavorful and delicious.  They also throw some cilantro and fresh pineapple on top and it creates a delightful melody of flavors in your mouth.  I am quite addicted to these tacos.  I am also addicted to their queso pupusas. I am a newcomer to the pupusa world, which is crazy shocking since I am a cheese addict.  Pupusas were made for me, especially these pupusas.  The tortillas give off a subtle, perfect corn flavor which meshes perfectly with the melted, gooey cheese.  The best part is when the cheese leaks out of the tortillas and caramelizes.  I go bonkers for caramelized cheese.  They also have wonderful horchatas!  

We usually call ahead and get it to go since it is a pretty tiny place.  They do accept debit/credit cards now.  Give Tacos Acapulco a try.  You will not be disappointed!"

There is a pretty wide variety of meat options and you can get tacos, pupusas, burritos, and things of that nature. However, the place is super small.

 I&#39;d never tried a pupusa before, but it was made to order and down right tasty.  The tacos al pastor were tasty, but their tortillas were straight out of the bag.  Their pupusas are made from scratch with masa, why not make fresh tortillas as well?  That alone would have bumped this up to a five.  

Service could have been quite a bit faster, especially when you can see the entire kitchen working at a leisurely pace from the tiny walk-in area that can&#39;t even be called a dining room.  I saw my completed order sitting on the counter while one of the girls in the kitchen went in back to chat with a co-worker.

They did provide an ample selection of salsas with my take out, and a baggie mostly cabbage for a little extra green crunch.

Okay, I&#39;ll be honest.  I was pretty stuffed by the time we rolled into the 3rd taco stop of the day.  This place is TINY inside.  I think there are five stools by the window, period.  The outside area is basically a corral with three picnic tables.  Additional people eat off the top rail of the fence.  I had an okay carnitas taco.  It had a fair amount of meat, but for $1.75, it really should.  It was moist, but did not pack significant porky goodness in the flavor department, B-.  The taco al pastor, on the other hand, was pretty good.  I would give it an A-, it was also a generous and tasty portion.  I had a small taste of a pupusa, which once again reminded me of a hockey puck, but the flavor was good.

Pretty cheap prices if I remember correctly.

The place is incredibly small and narrow inside, with just enough room for the ordering counter and one bar style counter to sit at. There&#39;s maybe enough room for 5-6 people inside, but there is outdoor seating available. Very &#34;hole in the wall&#34; but worth trying."

Had a repeat of Al pastor taco and pork/cheese papusus.  There was tons of meat and sauces and cucumbers and radishes and a slaw.  For $3.75 you gets tons of food.

The area is sketchy and some of the people who came in were questionable, but the pupusas were SO good. Almost like eating at my favorite spot in San Francisco. I got the cheese and steak &amp; cheese and they were both delicious. I&#39;ve never had a steak &amp; cheese pupusa before but it was to die for.

The tacos themselves were okay.  They had no cheese, which is supposed to be a good sign.  The lady who took our order was pleasant and got the order right (I asked for no cilantro).

A heads-up:

If you&#39;ve been to Pinche and loved their lengua taco, this one is different.  It&#39;s cut in strips instead of chunks and doesn&#39;t have the triple fried texture and taste of the ones at Pinche.  It tastes slightly like organ meat, and you can see the tastebuds.

That said, it wasn&#39;t bad, but I won&#39;t order it again.

The asada was my favorite.  The al pastor was good.  They were all topped with raw onions and came with two sauces.  The green was mild and good.  The red was way too spicy for me.  I guess the problem is that nothing was remarkable.  Everything seemed just average as far as texture and flavor and was rather plain.

My friend from Denver made reservations for 5 of us to eat here. When we arrived they said we were late for our reservation and they had a policy. After talking to them they realized that we did make it by our time. (We made reservations at 8:40 which is a little different) At any rate, we waited another 50 minutes before deciding to leave. As we left the group behind us was seated right away. I&#39;m not sure what happened there.

Although we made a reservation and the place was quite empty we were seated at &#34;the chef&#39;s table.&#34; I&#39;ve sat at chef&#39;s tables before, but this was a poor excuse for one. It was so hot and looked directly into the pizza oven, therefore there were no chefs to be seen. 

While eating a fly landed in my meal, resulting in me not wanting to eat it. When the waiter noticed I had a full plate of food I wasn&#39;t eating he asked what was wrong. I pointed to the bug. He proceeded to take my knife, fling the bug away (it landed on the table), and say &#34;that&#39;s better, out of sight, out of mind.&#34; I have NEVER experienced something like this in a restaurant! This sounds like something my grandmother would&#39;ve done while eating at the family farm. No offer to replace the food and no apology for grabbing my silverware to flick the bug away. 

Outside of the bug incident, the food took a very long time. We ordered appetizers and a pizza, and we were are Bar Dough for 1 hour and 45 minutes. That seemed like quite a long time to be sitting and waiting for each course. 

Finally, when the waiter came and got our bill, we asked him to split it based on what we ordered (my friend ordered more drinks). He instead split it down the middle, which was pretty careless of him. 

From a food perspective, it was good. I&#39;ve had much better pizza elsewhere, but their appetizers were interesting."

Like he promised, the seasonal risotto with a red wine reduction, mushrooms, &amp; duck sausage was awesome! The side of ranch meatballs (not like ranch dressing, like cattle ranch, I think) were on the salty side, but good. The spicy clam pizza was unimpressive - the dough is too thin to support the weight of the ingredients &amp; it needs some kind of drizzle to add some flavor to what otherwise tastes like Parmesan &amp; clams.

The restaurant is clean, modern, and cozy. I immediately noticed the white &amp; red interior which looked very sleek and classy. Their bar is gorgeous, it looked like white marble. This place can get pretty busy, so making a reservation is recommended. 

They have an extensive &amp; great beer, cocktail, and wine menu. My friends and I shared a bottle of lambrusco which was so so good! If you&#39;ve never had lambrusco, it&#39;s sparkling red wine and I haven&#39;t met one person who didn&#39;t like it!

We heard their garlic bread was addicting so we gave it a try but unfortunately, we were not too impressed. I think they went wrong with using focaccia. The slices were very thick so it was hard to take a bite. And the bread was so fluffy. When I think garlic bread, I think buttery, crunchy, slices. Not fluffy, soft, giant focaccia muffins.

However, their pizzas were delicious and perfect for sharing! We shared the Margherita pizza &amp; the Spicy 2.0 pizza. Both tasted fresh, with quality ingredients. The pizza sauce was very tasty and the crust was perfectly light and crunchy. They also gave us a bottle of chili oil to drizzle over our pizza which increased the flavor! Oh, and their Oven Roasted Carrots from the appetizer menu was out of this world! We don&#39;t even like carrots that much, but this dish blew us all away. The carrots were roasted perfectly, and the cumin vinaigrette and pine nuts gave the dish a very unique flavor. We were all fighting for the last bite!

The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because the service was slow. We felt like our server disappeared a lot, for long periods of time even though the restaurant was only 60% busy. Their garlic bread was a bit of a let down.

We started with drinks; coffee for him and a mimosa for me. I love love that they use prosecco in their mimosas rather than champagne. Totally delicious. 

The tempura avocado BLT sandwich had my name all over it. Fried avocado is a sinful treat that I cannot deny myself when I see it on a menu. I&#39;m sure the salad that came on the side negates the fried component. The hubs went with the eggs Benedict dish. He was satisfied except the spicy jalapeño bread wasn&#39;t and he didn&#39;t get the heat he wanted from that. We shared the summer polenta and wow, that was some incredible polenta.

I went early on a Friday night and sat at the bar. We had outstanding service from Sasha, who had great recommendations on food and drink. They have a strong beverage program, which begins with aperitif-style spritzes, continues with a strong wine program and ends with a good variety of digestifs. I heartily recommend the Aperol spritz before dinner and having an Amaro Nonino with dessert.

On to the food!

Their octopus appetizer is currently the best restaurant dish I&#39;ve had in 2016. The octopus was boiled then grilled, so it&#39;s tender and crisp. Paring that with eggplant caponata and crisp fresh celery was quite creative. If you&#39;re an octopus fan, you must get this!

We also shared a pasta, the bucatini. There&#39;s nothing better than mixing a perfectly poached egg into a great bowl of pasta. The side of meatballs (made with ground chuck, pork belly and pancetta!) were quite good. 

You could go to Bar Dough and skip the pizza because the rest of the menu is so strong, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. We had the Signore Bianco pizza. I normally don&#39;t gravitate towards white pizza too frequently, but this one was too interesting to pass up. It featured creamed leeks as the dominant flavor while olives, pickled fresno chiles and stracciatella cheese were fantastic supporting flavors.

There are simply no words to describe it, I&#39;ve ordered Tiramisu from 5 star restaurants to hole in the wall places and cannot remember having one taste quiet this good. By far the highlight of my night and I will definitely be back for more.

Food aside the service was also second to none. With my friend having nut allergies the waiter went completely out of his way to accommodate for her, regularly checking in and made great conversation. 

This is definitely now one favorite restaurants however I will say this place gets very loud so might not be the best place for a first date."

I&#39;m glad we discovered this modern restaurant. The pizza oven wasn&#39;t working when we visited but the staff was sure to let me know once I made the reservation via Open Table which I appreciated. 

We made it in time for happy hour which was a great way to start our evening. The garlic bread wasn&#39;t as hot as I&#39;d like it, room temp bread, but maybe this was because they were having kitchen issues. 

I can&#39;t remember the details of what we ordered as I&#39;m writing this a few days later but I will say we all really enjoyed our pasta (they offer half and large sizes) and our server was great- he offered to explain anything on the menu (I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t know what &#34;speck&#34; was) and asked whether we had any food allergies which I&#39;ve NEVER been asked before.

We will visit again to try the pizza."

For a girl who avoids wheat and dairy I was worried when a friend picked this hip spot. Never fear! I had an amazing meal that was so yummy and gluten free. 
Olives, shisito peppers (cheese sauce on the side), sunchokes and the most delicious ribeye (split between two meat hungry ladies). Yum. I will be back if I&#39;m in the area - maybe there&#39;s a gluten free way to sample some of those yummy pastas..."

We had a spot on the patio, and I loved the people watching and summer sun. I went before the recent revamp on their brunch menu, so drinks weren&#39;t bottomless, but I enjoyed a bloody mary. The brunch menu is small (I think they&#39;ve added more options when they redid it,) but everyone in my group was happy with their food. I couldn&#39;t resist ordering a pizza because obviously pizza at 10 am is necessary. The signore bianco was so good. The combination of onion, olives, and peppers led was the perfect mix of salty and spicy. I completely get what the hype was about, and can&#39;t wait to come back and sample more of the menu. Especially now that they have bottomless mimosas!"

Chef Max, Manager Steve and the staff have really put together an amazing spot. The wood fire oven is NO joke and the pizzas are delicious. And so is everything else. They truly have mastered the idea of &#34;elevated Italian&#34;. Here&#39;s what we had the delight to taste during the meal:
Meatballs (HELLO, IT HAS PANCETTA IN IT!)
Brassicas (perfect light blend antipasto)
Garlic squid - super tasty &amp; the fennel was the perfect accent
Tagliatelle - again with the pancetta.. AND CLAMS
Pappardelle - excellent bolognese
Garlic bread - homemade foccacia - party in the mouth
3 cheese Pizza - so light and delicate - perfect crispy crust
Mountain Man pizza - this is a busy pizza but i LOVED it and the calabrian chile honey drizzle is the best!"

Bar Dough made me feel like a complete hypocrite. From the moment we walked in to the end of our meal, I was blown away. Ambiance, food, and the hospitality were tremendous.

Was able to grab two seats at the bar last Friday and was greeted by tremendous service from our bartender and the general manager Juan. These two seemed to go above and beyond to make sure our meal was desirable. Pretty sure that&#39;s just the level of service they bring to the table night in and night out. Kudos to them.  

-Caprese:  Tomato escabeche set this dish a part, may have been the freshest tomatoes I&#39;ve tasted in Colorado. This caprese is unlike any other you&#39;ve tried. Order this! 

-Carne Crudo: The beautiful presentation was only matched by the taste. 

-Bucatini &amp; 7X Ranch Meatballs: My mom is constantly on the hunt for tremendous bucatini, I&#39;ve already made reservations for her trip this month because I know she will fall in love with Bar Dough&#39;s rendition. House made pasta done to perfection. 

-Pollo al Limone: The most divine dish I&#39;ve had in Denver. I may request this as my death row last meal. 

Booked a reservation the following morning to bring my entire family when they visit. Not sure I&#39;ll be able to make it that long."

I have gushed about a lot and cannot wait for my fourth visit.  Each visit, the food has been a star.  Even with my vegetarian friend, options were aplenty.  The scratch offerings are well executed and smart.  The pasta is housemade and delicious.  It&#39;s hard not to order the bucatini.  Don&#39;t forget the roast carrots to start: puffed farro?  Yes please!  The mains are great, and the pizza is scrumptious.  Try the mushroom or leek ones!  The cocktail program is smart and simple.  The gin drink is awesome.  Most times the service is unassuming and on point.  Do yourself a favor and dine here, and do it often."

All  week I had been looking forward to choosing from one of their delicious sounding pasta options. Unfortunately, you can only have brunch on Sunday afternoon. It was frustrating because it was well past what I consider &#34;brunch time.&#34; The brunch menu offered one pasta option which included a runny egg, which I&#39;m not a fan of. I ordered a pizza that was really good but I still left a bit disappointed. My friend had a tempura fried avocado BLT situation that she said was really good as well. So obviously there wasn&#39;t a problem with the food, but I was slightly annoyed that even at 12:15 I couldn&#39;t have &#34;lunch&#34; food. First world problems."

We had a group of 7, and it did take a bit to get a table, but we hung out next door at HTB so nobody minded.

At the waiter&#39;s suggestion, we dined &#34;family&#34; style. Starting with pizzas, don&#39;t miss the clam. Trust me. The spicy meat pizza was also solid, but the clam is what you need to drive across town for. Also the crust is maybe the best in Denver. 

Small plates: meatballs are phenomenal, as was the straccietta (which is burrata. I could live on burrata, and this one is amazing). 

We had a mash-up of entrees: pasta with clams, prawns, tortellini, and meat skewers. I was hesitant to order the skewers (it just didn&#39;t sound &#34;italian&#34; enough to me), but it may have been the best dish on the menu. 

The wine list was well-crafted and affordable; the service was very solid. All around great addition to the &#39;hood."

Recently opened on West 32nd Avenue with a Modern Italian focus and highly praised Happy Hour beginning at 3pm, Bar Dough from Max MacKissock seemed like  perfect place to kick off Wednesday evening, particularly with  Williams &amp; Graham just down the street and an Avalanche game at Pepsi Center beginning at eight o&#39;clock.

No doubt an anticipated opening, the Chef a known entity with several previous local restaurants seeing varying levels of success across the years, entry to Bar Dough presents patrons with pleasant hostess at a podium lined with Chris Bianco&#39;s canned tomatoes, the focus on product immediately evident even before seating or perusing the menu.

Long and narrow up front, seating at the bar divided from banquets by long communal high-tops, a look at Bar Dough&#39;s interior speaks of a minimalist approach and with retro music playing overhead the food and beverage takes a look at Italy by regions, the happy hour a veritable bargain with the full menu offered from 5:00pm till close 

Perhaps a bit too hip in terms of service, the young man assigned my table keen on words such as &#34;awesome&#34; and &#34;bro,&#34; orders were batched as not to overwhelm the table and starting with an open-face Meatball &#34;Sangwich&#34; the value early arrival was immediately evident, just $7 exchanged for two sizable balls of beef, pork belly and pancetta with almost no binder atop crispy, dense focaccia drenched in crushed tomatoes and a bubbling layer of pecorino plus mozzarella.

Deeply discounting a competent Margherita that saw a bit less rise to the crust than I would prefer, despite a good blister and taste, far more intrigue was offered by the subsequent round of polenta and pasta, the former lent great crunch by dehydrated kernels juxtaposing butter and Fontina while each handmade pocket of Butternut Squash was exceedingly delicate with bright acidity added by pickled red kuri squash and a lightly sweetened sauce of vinegar and raisins.

Oversold by the server on &#34;Pumpkin Seed Brittle&#34; Gelato that tasted like little more than vanilla with unsalted pepitas chopped into the mix, those looking for a sweet ending are encouraged to instead trust rumors of the city&#39;s best ladyfingers, each espresso soaked bite enriched by creamy mascarpone in a dish that lives up to hybrid naming by harkening both pudding and Tiramisu."

My husband and I are foodies and we live a block away from this fun little spot. Food- great but service to deliver is SLOW... It took almost an hour to get to our meal. The food was fantastic and the wine prices very reasonable. Bright vibrant atmosphere. The downside- you can&#39;t tell your dinner mates anything about your meal until you leave. It is SO NOISY!! The cemet floors and high ceilings make for an awkward screaming match or a creepy staring contest with others. Sign language lessons with the appetizer menu might be a great addition.

Everything is brand new, of course and they have 2 tvs. Chase, one of the bartenders, greeted us immediately as we sat down and explained to us the menu. We ended up ordering the lamb with a side of polenta as well as the spicy pizza (which was recommended to us from the manager of highland tap [next door]). The lamb was the best lamb we have had in Denver. It&#39;s fall off the bone! The polenta was delicious as well and went perfectly with it. The pizza was amazing- thin and crispy! And of course I had to have desert. The tiramisu was light and crispy- they definitely took a classic and made it modern. We cannot wait to come back for happy hour and dinner again!"

Friend and I had an 8:30 reservation, walked in, place was popping off. Crowded to the brim, 3 people deep at the bar, minimum 45 minute wait for the two girls who naively assumed they&#39;d get a table. Highly advise you to call ahead to make a reservation. 

Ordered the octopus for the starter, half plate of pappardelle, and the commendatore (tongue twister) pizza. A+ for our server&#39;s octopus reco, charred and not chewy, a slightly sweet mention from the eggplant, pistachios for texture. Is there anything better than a plate of pappardelle in lamb bolognese? Al dente noodles, flavorful and hearty meat sauce to beat back the cold winter chills. Our tummies were regretfully full by the time we got to the pizza but the one slice that we each ate thoroughly satisfied our inner meat (and garlic/bad breath) lover. 

Our server was incredibly attentive and sported one of the most impressive and well groomed beards I&#39;ve ever seen. Place is a little loud but no matter, business is good. Couples galore sprinkled around the space so I assume it&#39;s a popular date spot. Come share a few plates with an SO or a group of friends, Bar Dough guarantees a good night."

The interior is sleek and modern, an upscale Italian eatery. No you will not find red, green and white flags anywhere or mosaics on the wall depicting a vineyard or gondola ride. Not that I mind the latter, but Bar Dough is a bit more upscale that a traditional Italian joint.

Getting a table without a reservation was easy on a Friday night. It was also pretty early (before 7 pm) and the week after New Year&#39;s, when a lot of folks are still trying to commit to resolutions and the sun sets before 5 pm. 

Happy hour looks appealing, but my +1 and I were in it to win it in terms of ordering. We each tried the $40 tasting menu, which is served family style. Three courses of food served family style to be accurate. This included garlic bread, meatballs, arugula salad, pappardelle pasta, bucatini, scampi and lemon chicken. Granted, the portions were smaller but that was a good thing! There&#39;s no way two people could eat that much... we even took home leftovers that were just as good the next day.

Also, try the house red wine or a limoncello spritz since there are several to choose from. The grapefruit/basil sprits is quite refreshing!

Welcome to the neighborhood, Bar Dough!"

We were looking for a late-night meal, and I&#39;d heard good things. I went in expecting a pizza shop, but this is so much more. I didn&#39;t realize it was a full-on Italian restaurant.

We had some delicious olives, good cocktails, and pizza. Since it was my first visit I tried a classic margherita pizza. Everything about it was great, but I was especially impressed by the dough. Thin but not a cracker. Chewy, a bit sour, but still light. It was delicious.

Upon entering, the place is adorable. Great lighting, nice subway tiling, wonderful set-up and the staff was incredibly friendly from the start! 

I started with a spritzer... which they make with limoncello and prosecco. I asked the server if the lemon basil would be too sweet, and he explained the taste perfectly in terms that I could make a legit decision. It&#39;s such a good drink I had to have 2 (ok fine, 3). Their happy hour menu is stellar, and incredibly well priced. We ordered the pizza margherita and it was huge! Huge in the best way possible, all for 6 dollars! I cannot believe it! We ordered the olives as well. Tasty and well-seasoned. Finally, we chose the meatball sandwich sans bread... absolutely mouth watering. 4 drinks, 5 apps, all for under $50. The place started out a little emptier when I first arrived at 4, but by the time we left it was hoppin and the crowd was diverse... there were couples, young peeps, older peeps, families, etc.

For lunch we had the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder.  It had lots of flavor and was perfect.  We even saved room for some dessert.  Chocolate cake that was rich and yummy.

Second time the menu changed up a bit. I thought it&#39;s kinda pricey for pan seared and a lamb shank. Didn&#39;t know everything was ala cart, but it definitely was not worth the money.  Their happy hour items and pizzas are good.  I enjoyed the grilled octopus, margarita pizza, and meatballs on the first visit."

The reviews you read have you ready for a life-changing Italian eating experience.  This was not the case.

1) The earliest reservation I could get was 9:00 pm for a party of four, but when we arrived there were an abundance of empty tables.  I was also told by the hostess that my table wouldn&#39;t be ready for about 10 more minutes, despite the fact that half of my party was already seated there.

2) Bar Dough as been praised as one of the best pizza places in Denver, so we focused on that.  However, the pizza menu was very limited and disappointing.  The margarita was a dry and flat pizza with little more than crust and tomato sauce.  The Commendatore had some great flavors, but was so greasy that I did not finish it.  The only pizza that really impressed me was the Smoked Mushroom.

3) While the food is ok (and I would be interested in trying their non-pizza menu offerings) I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nearly good enough to justify the prices, the hype, or the difficulty in getting a table.  There are plenty of Italian/Pizza places with superior food, better value, and less hassle.  They just aren&#39;t as hip."

Sat promptly even though they were quite busy. Have a cute patio as well. Service was friendly. Had the Margherita pizza and tasted very fresh. 

My only complaint, confusion really, was what these guys are going for atmosphere wise. Everyone is dressed up and the space is classy. But they were playing some crazy rap. Just not sure how I felt about that."

My family is in shambles, so when I stepped into the loving arms of this restaurant I was hoping for a miracle. Well, let me tell you first, this place is a miracle embodied in pizza form. Not only pizza form, but meatball form, prawn form, toasted bread form and hospitable owner named &#39;Juan&#39; form. 

With each bite of their four cheese pizza I forgot about all that troubled me so. My ex wife, GONE from memory after my first slice. My teenage son who huffs paint, a smudge in my imagination after those meatballs. After such a euphoric experience  I had to ask my waiter to pinch me, I was sure it was a dream. But no, it was just a wonderful meal at my new favorite place in the entire world. 

Later that night I walked home and looked at the moon, I&#39;ve never seen it look so beautiful. Maybe this life isn&#39;t so bad after all."

Meatballs - tasty, but overly average with minimal sauce 
Garlic Bread - amazing definitely order!
Margarita Pizza - why do they even include on the menu?! Extreme amount of sauce with very little mozzarella or basil. How do you mess this up?!
Pappardelle - heavy emphasis on meat in the meat sauce, but nothing near a pappardelle bolognese I would expect for the time and money

Ambience - someone needs to help! The immediate vibe is diner plopped into the middle of LoHi. Bright light with awkward red leather benches. Take it down a notch all around!

Not sure how or why this is rated the top spot right now in Denver. For all that read this, please check out Il Posto or Luca D&#39;Italia for true Italian. Same price. And better experience. If you&#39;re into the top spots of Denver because Eater or 5280 was paid to say so, keep on keepin on with Bar Dough."

The food itself was great, but it was difficult to focus on that as the service was absolutely terrible. Our server gave us little to no insight into the menu, with no knowledge (or perhaps willingess to share) about the dishes they offered. Our service was slow, sloppy, and ruined this restaurant for us.

You can&#39;t let the food speak for itself when the service is speaking louder..."

The atmosphere was comfortable and sophisticated, servers were friendly, helpful and professional.  We shared the yummy caprese salad and the signore Bianca pizza between the 5 of us for starters.  I ordered the pollo al limone, was hesitant because it was a chicken dish and the pastas looked incredible.  It was the best chicken I have ever tasted,  I am craving  it and have been thinking about it ever since.  Cooked to perfection with a delicate lemon sauce. Debating whether to write to Bon Apetit so that they will publish the recipe.  We shared the tiramisu , Zeppoli, and the chocolate torta .  We gobbled them up to."

We started out with the grilled octopus which was done perfectly and had great accompanying sauces.
I got the half portion of the pappardelle (lamb bolognese). The half portions are perfect for one. The sauce was effing amazing. The pasta sadly felt like it had been overworked and was entirely too thick.
My mom got the tagliatelle. The pasta was more successful though some of it had glued together even with visible flour trying to keep it from doing the opposite. I guess when I see an item involving clams, I kind of want a few whole clams in shells for presentation. The clams were chopped so finely, I felt like they got a bit lost. The dish was a bit blah. I did have to admire the knife cuts though, lol.
My husband got the braised lamb shank which was hands down the winner. It was fall off the bone tender and the flavor was out of this world.
For dessert we got the fried dough and a trio of gelato (olive oil, pistachio, and caribbean chocolate). The fried dough was good. My mom loved it. The olive oil gelato made me sad because I wanted it to be awesome, but unfortunately it tasted like the oil was rancid oil. The pistachio was SO good (my fav) with the chocolate in second (my hubs fav).
This place was nice, crazy busy, and I will definitely go back despite the occasional misses. Its only been open since Oct, so I could see it working through the occasional issue. I&#39;d love to scope out the happy hour.
Also, on a side note, a fellow seated at our community table paid for our entire table and told us to pay it forward. It was overwhelming, but made this experience all the better. We have started our pay it forward journey and maybe just reading this might inspire others to do the same."

1) lighting was a bit too bright and wasn&#39;t dimmed until later in the evening
2) the music seemed to compete with everyone trying to have conversations over dinner and we found ourselves having to talk pretty loudly to be heard over the music
3) the dishes were hit or miss: 
- brassicas was a great veggie app with broccoli, brussels sprouts, pumpkin seeds, pecorino, and a flavorful brown butter vinaigrette
- meatballs were tasty with a mixture of chuck, pork belly and pancetta with a crushed tomato sauce, I would recommend these!
- garlic bread was soooo good and went really well with the meatballs so get both!
- pappardelle with lamb wasn&#39;t bad. our friends thought the rosemary was a bit strong in this
- butternut squash ravioli which was pretty disappointing. the sage was really overwhelming and since it wasn&#39;t finely minced, you would get a big piece in your mouth which would leave a bitter taste in your mouth. I love herbs in general but sage has a very strong and distinct flavor and it really overpowered the delicate ravioli so it did not feel like an appropriate addition.
- margherita pizza was really fresh, good sauce and a nice crunchy crust
4) the prices for these small plates and the wine really started to add up. overall, we were surprised at the bill and this would deter me from going to bar dough more often. 

We appreciated being able to taste the wine before ordering a glass so we all got what we wanted. We were too full for dessert but I bet the tiramisu is great!"

Loved the open kitchen and imported brick oven. Service was great. There&#39;s black and white TVs on the walls which was a little odd but it worked. I would definitely recommend this as a casual weeknight dinner spot for pasta and pizza foodies.

One salad each and a pizza shared by two was a perfect amount of food for two big eaters. I eat a lot of salads but the tricalore was an amazing new unique creation of spicy, savory, and just a few punctuations of sweet. The salad had a mixture of red lettuces, shishito peppers, cauliflower, cantaloupe and honey. I loved that salad. The pizza was also amazing: crisp, thin crust topped with sausage and broccoli.

So I highly recommend making a reservation. My boyfriend had the white wine on tap, which was really good. We ordered the bucatini and margarita pizza to share. The home-made pasta was amazing! Highly recommended. The pizza was also super great, can&#39;t go wrong. The only problem we had was the noise as it was difficult to hear (but it was a busy Friday night).

I&#39;m a tiramisu connoisseur, so when they first brought out all the desserts I thought they&#39;d forgotten it. Nope! Just a fun twist on my favorite dessert, and it did not disappoint!

Inside was Loud, and a basketball game was playing.  The server Ashley was fantastic, we hope to get her next time.  The Margherita pizza was very good.  There were no beer options outside of craft beer.  I loved my Pinot Grigio, but the Chardonay Blend (also house) was not worth $18 for a 9 ounce pour.  This is Highlands, not New York City, to justify that $ for a house wine.  We will go back, and try happy hour another time."

They were both SO friendly. Immediately my group was invited to take the grand tour which included some food and beverages at this sexy new hotspot.  It was immediately obvious that their menu was well above average.  

Before I left I even reserved the evening of my birthday the following week which Katie made sure was over the top.  

The service, food and mixology skills at this place are sure to impress even the harshest critics.

As I said in my last review I&#39;m on a quest for ethnic food, I&#39;m sick of the foodie scene. I&#39;m writing this review as I sit in the restaurant. Drunk girls are shouting basically in my ear next to me. I can&#39;t even think about enjoying a meal at this decimal. And again it&#39;s the $150 foodie nonsense. Yea a bunch of pasta and sauce that they throw some Italian or Spanish word into the menu and all of the sudden chef boyardee  is a $24 entree. 
Seriously why would anyone want to eat in a freaking nightclub? 
I compromised on here when the Indian place I picked was a bust. No way I can even try to eat with the noise level. 

Oh and the drunk girl keeps elbowing me in the ribs. As she&#39;s shouting at her friend. Wow this is lovely. And I tried a bite of my partners paperdelle, it&#39;s too salty and pasta is not very good. 
Omg I&#39;m so sick of the millennial foodie scene. 

And now the bartender is woo hooing with the loud screaming elbow to my ribs girls sitting here. 

Bottom line...this is a club it is NOT a place to try to have a chill dinner. I&#39;m running out as fast as I can."

We went there for the first time last night and ordered the coppa di testa, mountain man pizza and one of their $30 table wines.  I would have given it an extra star if we didn&#39;t have the service experience we had. When we got our bill, we were charged for the antipasto which was twice the price of the coppa di testa. We pointed out the error to our waiter and he said &#34;that&#39;s how much it costs, I&#39;ll show you&#34;. I explained it wasn&#39;t the price that was an error, it was that we didn&#39;t order it at all. He just said ok and took $10 off our bill (which didn&#39;t even make up for the full difference). He never admitted his error, he just shamed us for not wanting to pay for what was apparently the antipasto platter and sent us on our way, which I didn&#39;t really appreciate.

You won&#39;t find any standard and boring dishes around here. If you are looking for simple Italian food try some where else. The menu changes so it&#39;s a good place to keep coming back to with out getting sick of the food. I didn&#39;t try the pizza but it seemed to look amazing as it was coming out to other tables. Great wine selection. Busy atmosphere but very laid back. A few &#34;regulars&#34; we&#39;re sitting alone at the bar and the wait staff treated them like family.

So I was excited to spend a soon-to-be holiday dinner w friends at this new LoHi joint. We got seated immediately by a friendly staff (all staff were great!), and looked around at the amazing food! Definitely excited. We ordered a bottle of wine, garlic bread, ordered lamb pappardelle and a red sauce w guanciale pasta. That&#39;s when it went down hill. The bread came out 10 minutes before the food. When the food came out, only the pappardelle came out. We weren&#39;t going to eat without our friend, so we waited and waited. Eventually I called to our waiter to check on the food. It hadn&#39;t even been made. So our food sat and got cold. They brought him a salad and comped his meal, but it was another 10 before he got his food. Our food was pretty mediocre at that point. Re: the pappardelle, it had no distinct flavor, spice, salt, or seasoning. Nothing stood out. Too many noodles that were a bit too al dente. Noodles stuck to each other and created thicker noodle chunks as if the water wasn&#39;t salted, too much gluten in the water or something. Positive is that the portions are huge and the prices very reasonable for prime and secondi.

Atmosphere overall was nice, but the music was loud and out of place. It also changed tones halfway though the meal. It&#39;s like they aren&#39;t sure what they are trying to be.

Last point: my friend got food poisoning and has been sick for the last 5 hours off the pappardelle. He ate nothing else afterward or before."

Excellent service again. From waitress and runner.
It has become &#34;muy popular&#34;. We got there are 1723 and it was crowded.

11DEC2015

4.49 stars truncated to 4 as it was my first visit.
You should eat and drink here; it is very good.

++ Our waitress: Ashley. Perfect. Knew the menu top to bottom. Made excellent recommendations. Timely. Efficient. Friendly. Skilled.

+ Happy Hour is 1430-1800 every day. Dinner menu starts at 1700, so I think you know when  to arrive.
+ Thick, large cloth napkins.
+ Hefty, good quality flatware.
+ Wi-Fi.
+ Tabletops are white synthetic quartz. Attractive and easy to keep clean.
+ Atmosphere. Brightly lit for us old farts. Very hip design. Open kitchen.
+ Food.
   A. Meatballs - $7 during HH. The tomato sauce had a very fresh taste. And, when I wanted/needed just 2 tablespoons more, I received them quickly and with a smile.
   B. Garlic bread - $3 for 3 pieces during HH. Powerful and mouth watering. Normally, I am not a fan of foccacia and prefer ciabatta, but this is very good.
   C. Verde salad - $8. Highest quality arugula. Sharp pecorino.
   D. Pappardelle with lamb bolognese - $19 for the large. (We brought some home.) Al dente egg noodles. Well balanced bolognese. Melded flavors.
+ House wine is decent. We had both the red and the white. HH price is OK.
+ Patio. The chairs are super comfortable. Looking forward to warm weather and working on my skin cancer.

0 Noise level. Quiet when the are no customers. Noisy when it is crowded.

- TVs. No reason to be in a food emporium as good as this one. You want to watch sports? Go next door to Highland Tap.
- Wine prices are a bit steep. $30 and up. No $30 bubbly. No rosé at all.
- Verde salad is overpriced by $1-2.

Difficult to believe this the same ownership as Highland Tap. This is delicious Italian-style food and way better service."

The pizza was better than we expected, not as good as a Marco&#39;s but still solid pizza, even if the topping are a little on the scant side. 

While the pizza was good the other dishes did not meet expectations and the prices seemed to very high. At $12.00 the Tricalore salad was over dressed and lacking in freshness. 
We tried one pasta and that was enough. If you have not perfected homemade pasta then don&#39;t put it on the menu. What a disappointment. 

Great for a weeknight snack, but stick to the pizza."

I had read all of the great reviews and knew that I needed to try it. Got there around 5:45 so we ordered a few items from the happy hour menu. The happy hour  wine and Margherita pizza were great - pizza was definitely the best thing we ordered all night. We also got the shishito peppers. I love shishito peppers but these came with a &#34;fondue sauce&#34; on top that hardened immediately and had a weird consistency - would not recommend. 

From the main menu we ordered the Brassicas Salad, Octopus appetizer, and Clam Tagliatelle. The Brassicas Salad had some great flavor but was incredibly oily. Biting into the broccoli released nearly a tablespoon of oil, which was overwhelming and unsatisfying. The octopus was okay; the sauce that accompanied the octopus dish was delicious, but the octopus itself was a little tough. However, the  most disappointing dish was the Tagliatelle, which was also the dish we were most excited for. Most of the noodles were stuck together, the sauce was way too salty and the clams had a very fishy flavor. The clams were also cut up in such small pieces that it was hard to discern where they were in the dish. 

I would recommend sticking to the pizzas. The staff was great and I liked sitting at the high-top counter, but unfortunately will not return to this place."

They have $1 pieces which suited my price point and allowed me to sample sushi I do not always get. The service and decor were great. The food quality was good and i left feeling like I had eaten some healthy chow. I am a sucker for small family owned businesses, and this appeared to be one. Their location is a bit of a business killer and so I hope they make it, as there are many ways they made this strip mall location feel authentic....green tea was great!
Ill be back and you should give it a go go!"

But we were invited to go with another couple and since we love sushi we decided to give it a try. When you walk in the layout is sort of strange, it is almost like it was two separate businesses at one point and they cut through the wall and now there are two dining areas. One area was full so we were sat in the other area and we were the only patrons in that area the entire time we were there.
The waitress let us know that the sushi chefs were pretty backed up and we needed to be patient. We were not in any hurry so that was fine. We ordered drinks: two sapporos and two glasses of wine. They don&#39;t have a great wine menu, it is mostly of the sutter home variety (or some similar low quality wine). 

We ordered 6 rolls and some happy hour nigiri which is $1 a piece. We definitely could have ordered more because none of us were full but I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t because when the check came it was $180. We didn&#39;t realize we had racked up such a bill. I thought the nigiri was great, it was a nice slice of fish. I liked about half of the rolls but some looked like it was topped with cat food or some other weird minced meat mixture. I don&#39;t think our meal was worth the price, we will probably stick to other places that we love."

They have a great sushi selection and $1 nigiri during happy hour and when we went it seemed to be a two person team running the show. The decor is stale and uncomfortable, like Thavry said, very IKEA-esque.....and thats not a compliment.  It wasn&#39;t like gas station sushi but it wasn&#39;t anything I would recommend and and just wasn&#39;t as mind blowing as the reviews had me believe. The sushi didn&#39;t have a lot of taste and the fish tasted rubber-y at best.

Sushi Hana is one of them.  I was looking on Google to find a sushi place in the area and came across this one.  They are open late and offer $1 nigri.  I am in! We walked in and the place was dead. Not a soul in site except the two employees there. Many people complain about the decor being too Ikea ish, but I feel like it looks inviting and comfortable.  We were seated and saw the sign stating 2 for 1 sake on Monday through Thursday. Perfect! We ordered a couple of rolls, and a ton of nigri of yellowtail and salmon. Service was super fast. I know they didn&#39;t have anyone else to serve, but still felt like they were faster than normal. The sushi was good, maybe not the best, but still pretty fresh.

For dinner I  ordered edamame, two specialty rolls-- two dragons &amp; spicy shrimp, and a tall Sapporo, for $28. 
The rolls were wonderful, but I was disappointed in the edamame as I&#39;m pretty sure I could see what was freezer burn on them.

First off, I am a sushi snob.  I love the stuff and eat it often.  Here my nigiri was anemic.  The portion size was laughable, and the rice was dry/old.  The spicy tuna roll was acceptable, but not spicy.  The miso soup was average at best, and the curry bowl was boring and uninspired. All that being said, the food was average to below average.

( compared to other places in my hood like the Golden Dragon, or Sonodas)   I also enjoyed their Dragon roll (eel) and the California roll.  Their ginger dressing is amazing on their salad, and they have cold Saki which I had never tried.  Delish!  It is also convenient to home and work, so I will definitely be back."

The Ikea like furniture hurts my eyes and is definitely not welcoming.  You walk through the entrance to another section of the restaurant that looks like used to be an older section.  That&#39;s when you get greeted.  Service was ok at best.  Miso soup was bland and the salad was alright.  Only liked one roll that came to our table so we ordered it twice.  The nigiri was made with a huge cut of fish and a dab of rice.  This place is ok like I said but the ambiance doesn&#39;t say &#34;please come back and enjoy the food.&#34;  Instead it says &#34;You want to sit in uncomfortable metal/wood chairs and chic see-thru tables?&#34;  Someone needs to bring the feng shui bat and swing it around a couple times.

It&#39;s a shame too because this place is right by my house and I really liked their sushi. The reason I stopped coming is because in my experience the service was not the best or friendliest. I used to come here as often as once a week and the owners and staff here all knew me, and surely knew that I came around a lot. And they were always professional and got me what I wanted. And yet they never greeted me in a friendly way, it was always more of a gruff or formal &#39;hello&#39;. I would often sit there waiting for my order for 20, 25 minutes and they would never tell me if it was on the way.

Ordered shrimp tempura rolls, the Hana roll, Tokyo roll, and spicy tuna. All extremely delicious. The Hana roll was by far my favorite. All tasted very fresh, too. Drinks were refilled consistently, and I have zero complaints. Can&#39;t wait to be back and try that Firecracker app!"

When it first opened it was consistently good. I&#39;d even make special trips during my lunch hour to go there.  When we had out of town coworkers come in and we&#39;d go to lunch, this was one of the places on our radar.

But lately, the past several years, it seems the quality has diminished.  Sushi isn&#39;t always the freshest anymore.  And by that I don&#39;t mean that its bad or going bad, but it seems like the raw fish can be &#34;flavorless&#34; and getting old.  I&#39;ve ordered Maguro there and the fish has an odd texture and color (on multiple occasions).  Again, not that its going bad, but its no longer &#34;fresh&#34; and its obvious.    Nigiri portions have shrunk over the  years as well. And while they do have a Happy Hour Sushi menu, those items are smaller than you&#39;d expect, more like you&#39;d find at one of the &#34;All You Can Eat&#34; sushi bars.

I&#39;ve also ordered cooked items off the menu.  Again, hit and miss.  No consistency.  Sometimes its really good and has me coming back and other times it lacks flavor and is overloaded with vegetables. As an example I really like Beef Teriyaki. The beef is small, smothered in Teriyaki sauce and loaded with &#34;filler&#34; vegetables. 

The service is good and the people are friendly.  Decor is nice and pretty cool for a strip mall in S/E Aurora... But while those are nice its the food that counts... and thats where this place seems to miss the mark lately.

So, why do I continue to go there after all these years?  Well, its the closest or was the closest sushi bar to my house and I kept hoping I hit it on a good day..."

It&#39;s not the highest quality, but it is pretty damn good IMO. Well worth the $1. Rarely do I ever go to a sushi place and mark 10 pieces of salmon nigiri and NOT feel guilty about it. (When I say guilty, that&#39;s in reference to the damage I do to my bank account, not my body.)

The service was quick and attentive. What more could you ask for?

In conclusion, if anyone came to Denver and said, &#34;hey girl, I&#39;m craving some sushi, but I only have $5.&#34; I would say, &#34;Try Hana Sushi before 7pm.&#34; Then I would say, &#34;Also, when you google map it, you may think that the place has disappeared once in the area, but it is really tucked in a corner by Safeway, two doors down from the Thai place.&#34;  I got a little lost, so I think that would be important to add in."

Wednesdays they have buy one get on free sake (sucks if you have to drive and get do that).  Because I had mostly sashimi, miso soup and I think 1 spicy scallop roll I didn&#39;t get to try a wide variety of sushi.  Hats of to them for doing it pretty well.  For the money and if it&#39;s not to far to go I think I&#39;d rather hit Sushi Katsu because you can get more sushi for the $$.  However, that said this place is still great.

Ordered a few appetizers and 4 rolls tonight and I was extremely disappointed with everything.  The gyoza was not typical and actually came steamed like dumplings.  Tasted okay but not what I was going for.  Don&#39;t even order the spring roll/egg roll thing.  For $3.00, there only came two small pieces cut in half.  The seaweed salad was mushy and didn&#39;t taste fresh.  The biggest disappointment were the Manhattan and Twin Dragon rolls.  For $11 a piece, you would think they would be substantial but they were actually the same size as the California roll and the artificial crab is the worst I have ever tasted.  Honestly, King Soopers sushi has more flavor, better quality ingredients and a better value for size.  The calamari tempura roll was the highlight of the meal but even the pieces of tempura were small and insignificant in the roll.  I wasn&#39;t expecting too much but could not get over the price of each roll vs quality and size.  Their are other better sushi options in the area.  Would not recommend."

I scoffed at the idea of eating sushi in a little suburb of Denver, how could they offer up anything even remotely close to what I get in Cali or Hawaii. What I got was a sushi bar that provided good cuts of fish, with some decent roll options for those you are into the cali sushi style. 

Usually, places that serve cali style sushi don&#39;t put much into the quality of their fish, as it will be soaked in eel sauce, or avocado, or crunchies for that matter. But having ordered a few hand rolls, and nigiri, I realized I had a gem on my hands. While not in the same ball park as the places I normally frequent, the pricing was right here, and the waitress was kind and funny. 

Don&#39;t know if I will ever be out here again, but if I were to be out here and wanted a decent sushi fix, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to eat here again."

Some pros &amp; cons to Hana Sushi. Clear pro is the nigiri was exceptional. The downsides outweigh the sushi, though. First, we ordered some eggrolls to start off and it was basically 1 eggroll sliced. For the money, it was too little for the price. The other thing is I just didn&#39;t like the ambience. The seats were extremely uncomfortable and overall the little place just feels cold &amp; uninviting.

It was about 2 in the afternoon and the place was empty.  I took a seat at the sushi bar and carefully selected my happy hour order.  The sushi chef was very friendly.  Also, on a side note, they changed the chairs at the sushi bar and they are much better than the old ones.

After talking with the sushi chef, I found out that he is the owner of Hana Sushi.  His name is Bob and he was very accommodating.  I really enjoyed my sushi and had a great conversation about Asian cuisine with him and his wife.

The experience was much better than the last. But due to the inconsistency in visits I&#39;ve had here, I&#39;m sticking with 3 stars.  I will definitely go back if the opportunity arises.  For Aurora sushi bars, it&#39;s a decent one!"

Their hand rolls were good especially the spicy scallop.
It was bit on the sweet side and their ponzu sauce was also good.
It&#39;s not too much soy sauce taste and enough tang and sweetness.

We also order pork katsu... it was not that great.
Out side was flaky but the batter was not cooked all the way.

I didn&#39;t have any of the rolls so I can&#39;t really say but the interior is big and clean and simple.

I also didn&#39;t like it as much because there was a lady that keep going in and out with cleaning materials.

I know you have to clean the place but to see it every 5 minutes I was there was not a plus for me.

My husband ordered the Yakisoba, which he was not impressed with. My husband lived in Japan for a couple of years and frequently ate the Yakisoba there, which he loved. The noodles are supposed to be crispy, but the noodles here were very soggy. He got chicken with it, which he did say he liked.

Our waiter was polite, but he seemed very disconnected. He almost seemed annoyed by our presence. This ruined the atmosphere for me a little bit.

I was very surprised to see the place nearly empty on a Saturday evening at 6 p.m. There was a party of 4 that had been there for a bit when we came in, but they left shortly thereafter and we never saw another soul come into the place before we left around 6:30.

My favorite sushi roll is the fuji roll, I would definitely recommend getting it. 

Everyone that goes there gets the spicy (deep fried) mushroom rolls, I think it is their number one seller. I don&#39;t eat mushrooms but my husband loves that roll. 

The nice thing about their sushi too is that the rice is very sticky. Some restaurants don&#39;t use actual sticky rice and so the sushi falls apart, but here it is perfect!

We ordered an assortment of various rolls and cuts of sushi (lots, as we are a family of 5 and can consume quite a bit), and we even got a couple extra as thanks. Not fishy at all and my mother (who has had many a bad experience with sushi) delights in eating here.

Everyone enjoyed their Sushi dinner on Thursday evening October 09th 2008.  

Since I feel like some Miso soup for that evening, I tried their MISO Soup with Clams.  Oishii!!

Next came my main entree that consists the following:

Unagi, Tobiko Flying Fish Eggs, Kaibashira Scallop which I only pay this $1 a piece coz I ordered them before 7pm ~ entitled for HAPPY HOUR.

The rest were Ama Ebi, FUJI Roll, Spicy Shrimp Roll, Spicy Scallop Roll, Spicy Shrimp Handroll and Spicy Scallop Hand Roll.  I was slightly disappointed with their Ama Ebi coz it seems not too fresh for me.

I shared one piece or two with my fren who ordered their Spicy Mushroom.  This I HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Spicy Mushroom Roll!!!  Since both of us do not fancy, salmon in the Spicy Mushroom Roll, we requested for Shrimp instead.  Double Oishii!!! Be warned though, when they served the Spicy Mushroom, make sure you wait for abit before eating them coz, it can be pipping HOT and can burn the top tip of your mouth.  Just be cautious okies...

They have other menu in this Restaurant, perhaps I would return to bring hubby to try them.  Service was prompt, accomodating and fast.  Though I cant deny not everyone get their food at the same time.  There is room for improvement if they would want large groups to dine here.

Come for their Happy Hour for $1 per piece Dine Only sushi during Lunch and 4pm to 7pm everyday.  Another added bonus for me.  I ended my evening with Mochi Ice Cream of Strawberry, Mango and Vanilla flavors.  Triple Oishii!!!

Very friendly service; the owner is behind the bar when the place gets busy, but still takes time to chat. 
The happy hour quality is surprisingly good; they don&#39;t switch the out to inferior sushi for HH, so its very well worth $1/piece.  They didn&#39;t have anything too crazy for nigiri, but hey, it is in a strip mall after all.  
I tried just about everything they had for nigiri and I didn&#39;t have anything that stood out as off.  Even their saba was tasty, and it&#39;s generally one that&#39;s the first to taste foul when it&#39;s not fresh.  They were out of Uni; that&#39;s the ultimate test for me...it&#39;s only available on weekends.

We came as a group of five with three of us arriving first around 6pm so we quickly submitted our happy hour order.  By the time our last friend showed up around 6:30 our order had still not arrived.  It looked to be an average day with less than half of one side of the restaurant filled so it failed to explain the excessive wait time.

When the sushi arrived it was good but not in the mouth melting yum way.  We managed to quickly get two more orders in before happy hour ended at 7pm and still nothing really stood out for me.

Last but not least our bill averaged $36 per person!  With a few beers and some forgettable rolls that may have increased the bill, it still was not the happy hour deal I was expecting."

Hana does not have delivery but since this place is only about 5 minutes from my house I figured I would give it a try for take out.

I ordered the Tetakki Salad and the Tokyo roll. The Tetakki was not good and I won&#39;t be ordering it ever again. They mixed a vinegar based sauce with a mayo based sauce and you could imagine the image...not good. However the Tokyo roll was pretty tasty and I think if I went back I would certainly order it again along with some other sushi options. 

Overall it was just OK. I have had much better sushi and just can&#39;t bring myself to give 4 stars for anything that is just ok. So there you go. Take it or leave it."

stopped in for a to-go order of sushi -- hostess was very nice and offered me some water while i waited. picked up a few rolls for myself and took them home. i&#39;m pretty picky when it comes to what&#39;s &#34;good&#34; in terms of sushi -- not that i&#39;m picky about what i&#39;ll eat (i&#39;ll pretty much eat everything when it comes to sushi!) but more that if you tell me a certain sushi joint is &#34;the best&#34; it better damn well blow my socks off.  however, i was pleasantly surprised at this little place. i wouldn&#39;t say it was the best, but it was good. especially for a small little hole in the wall so close to home.

I have eaten sushi at nearly every sushi restaurant of note in the Denver metro area, and in my opinion you&#39;re not going to find better sushi in Aurora.  On any given night you&#39;ll find KC and Nemo behind the sushi bar cranking out sashimi, nigiri, and rolls with speed, accuracy, not to mention an eye for detail, presentation, and most importantly -- flavor!

Bob and Angie, the (Korean) owners, are very friendly and hospitable. They will take the time to get to know you and generally will bend over backwards to take care of you. 

What else can I tell you? Most of the fish is US-sourced and is very fresh and tasty.  The happy hour prices are fantastic. The only time that service slows down is typically during the latter part of happy hour (6-7) when the place gets packed, especially on weekends. I think those who complain simply aren&#39;t used to a local restaurant being this popular. My advice is: come early and hungry!

There are a few sushi places in Denver that are better than Hana, and I&#39;ve been to them, but like another reviewer noted, we simply can&#39;t break away from Hana long enough go back to them.

Love it!"

I can&#39;t remember his wife&#39;s name, and she&#39;s nice too.  I also like how all there sushi chefs get to know you.  It&#39;s like Cheers, but with sushi.

The evidence was nicely placed back on to the plate. Then the waitress/owner refused to take it off the bill. Her response, &#34;well, sometimes you get a bad steak&#34;.

We had just watched a movie and were on the drive home. A coworker of his had recommended Hana... we called him for the details of where it is. Cute little sushi place near the Safeway on Buckley and Quincy. It&#39;s actually rather intimate once you get inside. Tables are somewhat close together. 

We didn&#39;t want to spend a fortune (which is easy to do at a sushi place). We each ordered 2 rolls. I tried the Hana Roll and Chicken Tempura. The hana roll had cooked salmon, mayo, tempura crunchies, and green onions. Very tasty! I think I liked it more than tempura rolls. I usually get shrimp tempura, but decided on the chicken here. The tempura rolls are bigger - so harder to eat in one bite. Still very good. The chicken tasted a little dry - but other than that, everything was great. My husband ordered the spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls. He has a shellfish intolerance, so unfortunately he can&#39;t eat shrimp or crab (two of my favorites).

One of the waiters acknowledged us and then was  rude when he realized we were going to make it a take out order.  He threw 2 paper menus at us and told us to look over these instead of the regular menu.

The staff was very polite and attentive, they took our order fairly quickly, and our food was brought to us promptly. However, the food itself wasn&#39;t amazing or delicious per say. It was &#34;eh.&#34; The sushi was bland, not tasty at all. The sushi rolls themselves and the nigiri were tiny compared to other sushi places I&#39;ve been so because of that, I thought the prices were a bit steep. I&#39;m from the Springs, and there&#39;s a sushi place there called Kohnami...now that is the best sushi restaurant I&#39;ve been to thus far, EVER. Their rolls aren&#39;t tiny nor is the nigiri a sliver of fish with a bit a rice attached  like at Hana Sushi. Kohnami&#39;s sushi is truly tasty, flavorful, and delicious, hands down. Needless to say, I miss that place and I&#39;ve had a hard time finding a great sushi restaurant since moving to Aurora and driving the 30 min to Denver to get some good sushi is a bit discouraging. Now that being said, I would continue to go to Hana Sushi if I&#39;m in dire need of a sushi fix and because it&#39;s close to my house, otherwise, I&#39;ll probably have to settle exploring my options elsewhere."

Most of our food was pretty alright, except for one of our rolls, which just threw everything off. My husband got a combination of rolls, and the fish in his yellowtail roll was definitely spoiled. It did not look right, the color was very dark and the fish looked partially cooked (probably because it was so old and spoiled). It also smelled horrible! 
The place was pretty full and we did not want to make a huge scene, so we wrapped it up in paper and asked them to take it away. I just could not believe they would serve something like that. Imagine a newcomer didn&#39;t know that it was spoiled, ate it, and got sick! 
Maybe we just went there on an &#34;off day&#34;, but we are definitely not going back.

For quality sushi in Aurora, try Sushi Katsu on Havana Street.
Mount Fuji in Southlands is a bit costlier, but it is good too.

This place is located on the NW corner of Buckley and Quincy, along the Quincy side of the lot.  It can be easy to miss if your coming off of Buckley.

The atmosphere here is excellent.  The dining area is calm and fancy, but still casual.  There&#39;s always someone to offer a warm greeting as soon as you step in the door.  The service is attentive and friendly, and the guys behind the sushi bar seem constantly up beat.

The sushi here is wonderful, but being a Japanese Cuisine Resteraunt, the menu is extensive.  So far everything I&#39;ve tried has been fantastic.  The presentation alone beats out most other places I&#39;ve tried in town.  Happy Hour consists of one dollar sushi making it a nice spot to stop for a quick, after work meal."

I do tend to get a little snobbish about my sushi here in Denver, simply because I got rather spoiled from spending a semester in Japan a couple years ago.

Hana Sushi is one of the only places I will go for Sushi in Denver. Their Hana roll is amazing, and I LOVE their masago rolls (flying fish egg) with a quail egg on top. Yum!! :D  Unagi rolls are something I tend to approach with caution, because while they are absolutely delicious when prepared with quality eel, most sushi joints&#39; unagi rolls are chewy at best, and stringy and tough most of the time. Hana is an exception - I always make sure to have at least an order of unagi rolls when we are there! I&#39;d also recommend their rainbow rolls, as they are fantastic as well.

The staff is always fantastic as well. The servers are always there when you need them, and are consistently friendly, and great with kids. When my niece and I decided to try out Hana Sushi, our waitress offered to make &#34;kid chopsticks,&#34; basically, she took a couple chopsticks, rolled the packaging into a ball, and rubber-banded in between the chopsticks, which helped Katie learn to eat with chopsticks. The bar guys are the same way - always upbeat and they enjoy chatting and getting to know their patrons.

I think the only thing preventing Hana from getting five stars is the whole cold, urban look. It&#39;s just not something you&#39;d expect in South-East Aurora, which is, let&#39;s face it, right on the edge of suburbia. The decor would look better in downtown, maybe, where the metallic, edgy look is common, but again, in SE Aurora, it might be better to go with a warmer look.

Aside from that one little detail, Hana gets almost perfect 10&#39;s down the list. I even like their tempura rolls, and I have never been a fan of tempura."

We got a plethera of rolls and an apetizer call monkey brains which consisted of an avocado cut in half stuffed with crab and cream cheese then fried. Pretty tasty but so unneccesary. We ended up taking 1/2 the rolls home because we filled up on the appetizer :(.

The service was really swell, though it took a little longer than you might think to get the sushi out but there was only one chef crankin everything out but he did so with painstaking detail so it was worth the wait.

Seemed signifigantly more expensive than other places I&#39;ve been frequenting lately (sushi train, mt fuji) but the quality was really good so I can&#39;t compain.

And for the record this place is on the NE corner."

This small pub deserves credit for being awesome, and no it did not take a long time for our food to be served. The best part about being able to eat here was the holiday. On Halloween, it was dead and it felt pleasant having this tap tower to ourselves. Though it&#39;s higher priced, the platters are worth it. The fried pickles, we pictured to be tiny chopped pickles with dipping of course-- but no! It was definitely full pickles and they were already filling us up. But this was just our appetizer. The beau craved the Fish &amp; Chips, and I had the best spaghetti ever-- it almost looked Italian, Mexican and American literally in 3! That&#39;s perhaps why they called it the 3-Way Gary. It was also Monday&#39;s special on the menu. They have various specials on their menu that are highlighted and it was awesome to have the chance to come in and try their Monday one. 

All the servers were going above and beyond to impress us. There was this nice gal who greeted us , I thought her tummy looked so cute because i saw she was expecting, and she was telling us she was 5 months, I loved her warmth presence.

The sliders were especially good, with yummy grilled onions, so give those a try.

Once our server did come to our table we asked twice for the air to be turned down. We were informed that it takes time for it to happen. It never did. The second time I asked I walked to the host stand to ask the hostess - and there was our server chatting at host stand. 

My 13 year-old noticed on her own &#34;why are all the staff in a pack?&#34; Yep. Non-efficiency. Like a row of ducks.  And they are not looking at anyone in the eye. 

Food was cold. And not how we ordered the burgers. Bucket Bites had onions even though we ordered without and kids burger didn&#39;t have cheese. Wedge Salad came out alone without soup and was terrible lettuce - bitter and inedible. 

Waited about 6 minutes for the soup to arrive and it was the best thing - albeit salty as heck. 

Server came over to present check with all of our plates and half or uneaten food. I was like  whoaaaa.... Not paying yet. Need to recap all this.  

Manager came and said you don&#39;t owe us anything - I said - thank you - (&amp; I do think this was the right move.) I have worked in the industry and opened many restaurants - sometimes things are just off. 

After waking away-at the end.  The GM wakes over to air controls and turned the three hvac vents down in front of us. Hmmmm.  

And then she said &#34;yes, it always comes in threes&#34; to a server. I am guessing we weren&#39;t the only table with concerns. 

My take on things. They have a young staff. Training and feeling in tandem hasn&#39;t happened yet. 

It&#39;s cold temperature-wise in the space - like grab your arms cold and rub. 

Our server checked the boxes and it felt like she had had enough with kitchen complaints. 

The food is not to par. The salad not edible. The instructions in preparing our two burgers - both wrong. 

Oh and I nearly forgot the food runner literally stood in front of the three of us with plates of food waiting for us to say which plate belonged to who. Not auctioning it, but stood there until we said &#34;oh that&#39;s mine.&#34;

Glad it was comped, left a tip and went to 3 Margs for a drink and tacos."

Hostess was great , we were seated . And things went down hill from there. We waited for 20 minutes for our drinks. Not a hard order.  4 waters.  2 glasses of wine., One root beer(menu said that they had draft root beer., we got ibc in a bottle.  My granddaughter ordered milk. Took another 10 minutes to get her milk. Waiter said he could not find the kids cups! After another 40 minutes we ask our waiter to check on our food order. Order had obviously been sitting.  Every thing was cold.. I ordered a taco salad., it was terrible. Fried tortilla smeared with beans and fried hamburger meat. Topped with soggy salad. By the time it got to me  . Was a soggy runny mess!
Every time waiter came to the table . He was apologizing for something! We were hopping for a good lunch.. will not be back!! Go somewhere else!!"

This place has a lot to do to get up to par. Hostess station is a mess. Unable to manage stress (3 people waiting- seriously). Inside is really small and cramped. Waiters are very slow to the table and not familiar with the menu. The bartender recommended a Bud Light when I told him I like lighter beers- are you kidding me- bud light? I&#39;ve got a fairly sophisticated pallet. Food appearance is poor. Overall food is okay- basic bar food- NOTHING special.

I had the BBQ chopped chicken salad, and it was disgusting. The lettuce was mostly iceberg, meaning they made a poor attempt to save money by buying the cheapest crap lettuce in existence. There was some romaine, too, but it wasn&#39;t that great. Their BBQ sauce was just ketchup with some extra spices or something. It tasted just like ketchup. The chicken was dry, tough, and tasted like it had been grilled on a grill where they cooked fish, or the cilantro ranch dressing had anchovy paste in it. The whole salad tasted fishy.

Nobody else at the table had any complaints, but nobody raved about the food either."

When I walked in, the wait time was 2 hours, and there is not a single thing there worth waiting for. Thankfully, we had reservations, so I got to skip that part.

The food seemed very hit or miss. Friends seemed to like their burgers and quesadillas, and the fish sandwich was alright (too much bread, but it tasted decent). The mac &amp; cheese tasted like absolutely nothing, the coleslaw was dripping in what tasted like Miracle Whip, and the fries were soggy. I ate some of my food because I was starving, but I sort of wish I&#39;d just eaten at home.

The beer list was similarly uninspired. I saw one stout (Guinness) on tap, and the rest was all pale ales, IPAs, and maybe an amber or two? The bottle selection was mostly made up of fairly stereotypical imports (Corona, Fosters, Molson) and a few decent to good domestic choices. Still short on dark beers, and most of the options were 22oz bottles that ran something like $13-$25 each. They were out of the one I ordered, and the manager brought me a different beer without asking, which happened to be one I don&#39;t particularly like.

Really, the only decent thing was the service. Our waitress was very nice and the manager was clearly trying hard to make people happy. They ended up comping my entire meal, which they didn&#39;t have to do since I still ate some of it. They actually made me willing to go back in a couple of months to see if they&#39;ve worked out the kinks"

Pizza was cold and the &#34;soy glaze&#34; on the salmon was so sweet it was barely edible.

Environment: 
They seemed like every other tavern/restaurant in business today.  To be honest, the entire atmosphere felt like a total rip off of the Baker Street Pub franchise.

Food: 
The food was not good.  Both my boyfriend and I ended up sick later on in the evening.  I&#39;ve never seen a restaurant prepare Mahi Mahi fish as badly as this restaurant.  I ate one of the three tacos on my plate, and was repulsed.  It was basically a frozen fish stick in a soft-shell taco.

Service:
Getting sat was a 40-minute wait, while we sat and looked at multiple open tables for over 20-minutes.

Our waiter was nice enough, but we ended up asking for one of my drinks again after 10-minutes.

Drinks:
The only saving grace of the experience.  The drinks were good, and reasonably priced.

If we go back, it will only be for the drinks.  Stay away from their food unless you like overpriced frozen food."

Mahi mahi tacos were bland, had a weird, watery Cole slaw in it. Beer/ drink selection was just ok. Flagship beers from the biggest craft breweries, but nothing special.
Atmosphere was decent, and service was good. Unfortunately because of the very poor food, I can&#39;t recommend this place."

In fact, based on the rubber feel and nearly paper thing cu of the &#34;chicken breast&#34; I am willing to bet that it was indeed microwaved, perhaps out of a boxed dinner purchased at the super target for $5 around the block. I happen to have celiac, so I&#39;m unsure if the dinner was that expensive and that awful in their attempt to make it gluten free- regardless, they lost a customer.

Most importantly, know that I ended up sick from their food.  The food didn&#39;t taste horrible, but it certainly wasn&#39;t great.  I had the Chicken Parmesan, and it tasted like every single thing on my plate came from the freezer or out of a bag.  The fettuccine Alfredo was dry.  The chicken Parmesan was salty and tasted like a cut of crappy pre-breaded frozen chicken.

With that in mind, the food is overpriced.  The seating wait was almost 35-minutes...with open tables not being quickly cleaned or seated.  The service was &#34;meh&#34;.  The environment is a repeat that&#39;s been done time and again.  I said to my girlfriend, &#34;If they&#39;re striving for mediocrity, mission accomplished.&#34;

...and I won&#39;t even go into the amount of flies in this establishment.

Regardless, I ended up sick from the food, and that&#39;s the most telling review.  I&#39;m writing this review the day after, and my stomach still isn&#39;t right.

I will not be returning to this establishment."

The first time is a pre-opening training dinner.  Service was great even though our waiter was obviously new at the job.  They were probably triple-staffed for that event with trainers everywhere.  We had wings (excellent) and bucket bytes (decent) for apps.   For main dish we had the daily special BBQ pork sandwich, tuna wrap, reuben and something else I forgot.  All came quickly and well prepared, the only complaint we had was one batch of fries needed a bit more time in the fryer.  Beer selection is decent and they have some interesting choices in the rotators.  Environment is about what you&#39;d expect for a bar and grill place, clean, efficient with good patio space.  Wifi connection took forever to login.

The first experience was good so we came back a couple of weeks later to see how the regular staff performs.  The place was packed with long wait time for table, kinda expected with locals checking out a new place so we sat at the bar instead.  We had wings, Italian torpedo and hot brown this time, all came out fairly quick and were tasty.  Still had slow wifi login issue but another customer at the bar told us once you&#39;re connected, the speed was good.

The staff still wasn&#39;t quite settled yet, there were 4 people tripping over each other in a not-that-big of a bar, a little unorganized but we didn&#39;t have any service complaint.

Overall, it&#39;s a decent place to eat, there are many more items on the menu we haven&#39;t tried yet.  Maybe it should be higher than 3 stars but the menu is too generic, nothing creative or really outstanding."

Very limited choice of beers and the bar drinks are on the pricey side. I&#39;ll pass on going back.

The beer batter breading on the buffalo chicken sandwich was especially delicious. I&#39;d definitely order that again. The bar had a good atmosphere and pretty good beer selection. The staff was clearly still learning the ropes in a newly opened restaurant but they were friendly and courteous.

It was do refreshing and great. Decor and atmosphere was great. For lunch I had the turkey club and French onion soup- both very good! My partner had the Asian Wrap and loved it. My only hope was for a more unique menu, it was very similar to Rock Bottom and other surrounding places. Our server Vy was great, so kind and attentive. The bar service was slow but they just opened so I&#39;m sure the service is a learning curve. One more time though on that Grapefruit Marg- it was soooo good."

rusty-bucket-restaurant-and-tavern-westminster,Jessie R.,Zyi3Wxrmrqf6cwK86UreGw,"Broomfield, CO",0,1,0,2,1,PQldHjU0PkDXOhuzeyA6rw,1.0,2016-07-15,"Our friends suggested this restaurant and my gut feeling was to say &#34;no&#34; due to three things:  1.  Bad reviews  2. Chain restaurants often skimp on quality and 3. It&#39;s only been open for a short time....not much time to work out the kinks. I travel extensively for my job and make it a point to seek out restaurants in other cities with the best reviews. I only mention that because due to the fact that I frequent quality restaurants often, I feel I have a pretty good perspective on what makes for good food and good service. 

So I went because I really wanted some nice quality time with our friends. I should have listened to my gut....it&#39;s never wrong.  Our friends were already there when we arrived and we were seated on the patio, which I always think is a good thing.  There was an extensive menu so we decided to partake in drinks first.  I ordered a Kentucky Mule (like a Moscow Mule only with bourbon).  It came in a copper mug, which got my hopes up that it would be good.  Wrong.  It was mainly ginger beer....could not taste any bourbon at all so I sent it back.  We had to ask for waters and when I requested lemon for my water, the waitress (who had some difficulty with linguistics due to her tongue piercing) said &#34;No!&#34;   I guess she thought she was being funny but it was just a really odd response.  For one thing, this is not an Ed Debevic&#39;s or a Dick&#39;s Last Resort type of place.   I&#39;m pretty sure the Rusty Bucket is not going for the &#34;rude to the customer&#34; schtick.  I was taken aback.  My friends politely laughed but we all thought it was kind of weird.  I was brought one lemon slice on a heated plate.  So odd. 

I&#39;m quite the &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34; kind of orderer (changing things up on the menu to suit my taste) so I ordered the salmon with sticky rice but instead of stir fried vegetables, I wanted fresh fruit instead.  I am not a fan of vegetables.   I also ordered a side order of sweet potato fries.  When everyone&#39;s food was brought out, I was handed a plate with a huge stack of vegetables with the salmon on top.  No sticky rice.  I let them know that was not what I ordered.  I was given the sweet potato fries and small bowl of fruit, which I munched on while everyone else ate their dinner.  The waitress came back several times to let me know that SHE had not messed up putting the order in, rather it was the KITCHEN who had screwed up.  Since I still had no main entree, I didn&#39;t really feel it was very professional to be letting me know that she was not taking any of the blame.  I don&#39;t care WHO&#39;S fault it is.  When everyone is eating while I have no entree, there should be no playing of the &#34;blame game&#34; by the waitress.  It took forever for my fish to come out.  By then, everyone else was done.  To add insult to injury, the waitress questioned why I couldn&#39;t just eat the salmon that was brought out.  I explained as calmly as I could that since I didn&#39;t like vegetables, I sure didn&#39;t want fish that had been lying on top of the vegetables soaking up the flavor.  I finally said that I didn&#39;t really want to discuss it further but she insisted, going on to say &#34;Well, if it was an allergy or something...&#34;  WTH.  I&#39;m a paying customer so if I don&#39;t want one food to touch another food, then that&#39;s really all that needs to be said.  

When I finally received my entree, it was obvious that the salmon had been cooked as quickly as possible with very little seasoning.  I&#39;m thinking the kitchen was just trying to get it out the door.  It was dried out and the sticky rice was pretty basic.  I asked if they had any soy.  That seemed to really stump them.  Our waitress finally brought some sort of teriyaki sauce that was actually quite good.  I told her that the kitchen should use that sauce on the fish from now on and she questioned me, indicating that the salmon was just perfect the way it was.  She did finally acquiesce by saying &#34;Thank you for the feedback&#34;.  

We did not ask for any adjustments to our bill but did notice that they did not charge us for the salmon so I&#39;ll give them that.  At least they realized I shouldn&#39;t pay for a meal that I had to eat alone and one that was also sub par.. 

My advice is to find another restaurant and tavern combo in town.  There are plenty that are MUCH better than this place.  I hope they&#39;re just suffering from new restaurant syndrome and with any luck, will get their act together.  Regardless, I won&#39;t be back.  There are way too many good restaurants out there."

The hostess/greeter was friendly.  We sat at the bar.  It took quite a while for any acknowledgement by 2 bartenders and then we waited another several minutes for 2 beers (one of our beers was forgotten and the bartender had left to head to kitchen).  At least 3 of the beers from the rotator list were no longer available but that was not communicated except if we asked one by one.  Since we had time to sit there and wait, looking around indicated a huge lack of care and attention to detail.  For a fairly new restaurant/bar, it was super dirty, especially our glassware for our beers, shelving behind the bar, tap handles, floors, bartop, seats, etc.  I would be afraid to see the kitchen!  We had no desire to eat after that observation.   Unfortunately we will not be back ~   very disappointing."

We then sat there  for ten minutes waiting for the waitress to bring our check. When she did I told her the burger was uneatable, she then became super rude saying you should have told me. I explained that she never checked on us. She continued being super rude, said she would take care of the check and stormed off.

We had spent the day in the mountains and thought we&#39;d stop in on our drive home. We had a party of 9 so we did call ahead seating. They quoted us 105 minutes - but we were driving from the mountains so that was fine with us. On the drive down we &#34;yelped it&#34; to see what the reviews were saying..... Needless to say it wasn&#39;t good. We decided to go anyways and see for ourselves We got there in about 70 minutes and our table was sat almost immediately. Our server was quick to greet us- I ordered food for my son when drink orders were taken. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. We had a little mix up with a beer, but other than that, drinks came out as expected. Food was actually delicious. The reviews I&#39;ve read raved on the burgers. I decided to have the beer burger and it was incredible. It was my cheat meal for the week, and it was completely worth every calorie! When we left at about 8 pm, there were probably 30 people outside waiting for tables. I have a feeling they&#39;ll be quite busy for a while. New restaurants + busy = slow ticket times and long waits. So if you know that going in, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be upset. But our experience was lovely. Server was quick and attentive, drinks were good, food was delicious and came out timely. We will definitely be back."

At Rusty Bucket you don&#39;t get what you pay for. I ordered a mule and it cost me $11. I&#39;ve never paid that much for a mule but that&#39;s not the problem. The problem is that it was the WORST drink I&#39;ve ever had. They filled the cup with ice. That is not an exaggeration they literally filled the cup with ice. I placed my palm over the cup and it didn&#39;t even get wet because of how much ice it had. I pressed pressure downward and nothing came out. The mule was literally 90% ice and 10% drink. I promise you that I&#39;m not exaggerating. I told the server and she said that&#39;s how we serve our drinks. It took me 3-4 seconds to finish my mule. That is such a rip off. The food is average if that, very greasy. I sincerely recommend you skip this place. Take your hard earned money and get your money&#39;s worth elsewhere.

I ordered the Pad Ped- a stir-fry of Jalepanos, carrots, onions, and bell peppers with chicken.  I ordered it hot, reassuring the server that yes, I understood hot was going to be really hot. &#34;Hot&#34; here is one notch down from Thai hot, which I avoid after losing my eyebrow a few years back.  

Hot was hot, jalepenos included, and it was PERFECT!  The rice came in the shape of a heart, which is about all of the romance Ia m getting these days, so it was appreciated!  Soup appeared in front of me, with a glass of water immediately after sitting down and I was fiddling with my Yelp app to check in.  Free Soup!  At lunch!  NICE!

I went with a friend on a Friday around 7:00, and I was surprised at how empty the place was. The restaurant next door was jumping, but I think there were only two other tables with people at them when I came to Mali Thai. Weird.

Anyway, the service was prompt, and I was happy to learn that they could make gluten-free Pad Se Ew (my personal favorite dish). The food was yummy and served in a timely manner. Nothing outstanding, but it was good.

I was bummed that they were out of mango sticky rice for dessert, but it&#39;s not like I needed the extra calories. Maybe it was for the best.

So, while I&#39;m not crazy excited about Mali Thai, I did like the place and I&#39;ll probably go back the next time I want Thai food."

More specifically, the food quality and portion size has gone down, but the prices have gone up. 

I recently switched up and ordered from another local thai place, then went back to Mali Thai the same week. Both places I ordered the panang curry, both were tasty but the Mali size was half that of the other, and a few bucks more.

At 7pm on a Sarurday night we were the only table in the restaurant. Two adolescent boys were the only workers we saw during our visit. We ordered vegetable egg rolls, chicken pad thai, and mango sticky rice. The egg rolls were 4/5 stars. The dirty plate we got with our egg rolls was 0/5 stars. Then we were told they were out of mango sticky rice. Our chicken pad thai was a few pieces of chicken- the appearance of meat expanded with tofu chunks. It looked fancy from the purple cabbage shaved on top but that&#39;s where it ended. At this point we felt our experience and meal was worth three stars, despite our young server and the other employee retreating to a table in the dining room glued to their phones each time they weren&#39;t serving us. We sat with our empty plates and payment sitting out for a fair 5 minutes. Then we realized our server was the figure head down on the table in the center of the restaurant.

I ordered from Mali Thai tonight due to a serious craving for some Thai food. I used to love a place in Lakewood called Star Thai, but have since moved near DTC area.

I ordered for pick up, and once I got there I went to pay and realized, that for only the second time in my life, I forgot my wallet at home. I told the gentleman I would go grab it and come back. He said I could take the food with me, and just call when I got home. I promised I would call him in 10 minutes.

I wanted to tell my boyfriend about the trust the gentleman extended me so I called him up. I then started to feel the pressure of showing the man that he did the right thing to trust me, and got nervous and ended up getting turned around in the tech center. Like I said I&#39;m new(er) to this part of town and rarely go into DTC. My boyfriend was able to tell me how to get home, and joked that the staff was probably betting on whether or not I&#39;d call, since now 20 minutes had passed.  Well I did, and I was very grateful for the customer service.

By the way, the Pad Thai and Tom Kha soup were absolutely delicious. I would have rated it a 5 even if I would had to drive back home for my wallet.

I&#39;ll definitely order here again, and encourage others to do the same."

The restaurant is very green with interesting decor (still had Christmas decorations up in February) but it&#39;s very clean and modern.

Service is very quick and friendly, they know they get busy.

Larb chicken was good but had no spice whatsoever. I know we ordered it mild but didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be as bland as it was. I had the daily special garlic chicken which was DELICIOUS. Just the right portion too. Friend has pad Thai which was also really really good. They didn&#39;t have mango sticky rice available even though it was on the menu. We went with coconut ice cream and some other sticky rice. The ice cream had a different texture, wasn&#39;t exactly ice cream, but was still really good. The sticky rice and Thai custard were yum."

When my friend and I arrived around 6pm, it was SO empty inside, I was afraid I had made a wrong decision to come here..

The summer rolls we ordered as appetizers were filled with bean sprouts that I couldn&#39;t taste anything else. So we both did not like them... 

BUT, I had their panang curry, and it was delicious! So good it makes up for the nasty summer rolls. :) It was creamy and spicy and savory, just as I like it. It was the perfect portion, and I loved that they offer both white and brown rice. 

There seems to be just one waitress (probably b/c it was so empty...) and she was very nice and attentive. I would come back and try some of the other dishes. Or do take out! I could see this joint being super busy around lunch time.. but for dinner, it was seriously completely EMPTY. But don&#39;t be fooled, the food was delicious.

Though scores of reviews mentioned the heat level, I found it not hot at all. I ordered Red Curry with Vegetables Hot and it was maybe a notch above mild. My friend ordered medium and we both asked for hot sauce to ladle onto our dishes. So it sounds like they&#39;ve been gringo-fied. You&#39;ve been warned. Tell them adamently what kind of heat you want! The flavor of the curry was good but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d order the dish again.
I loved the soup they brought out upon arrival! It was just a simple broth with carrots and celery- but there was a distinct delicious flavor that set it apart from just a &#34;normal&#34; soup. Props there. 
We also ordered the summer rolls as an appetizer. I did not care for these at all. They were dry, barely any shrimp, and the peanut sauce was clumpy. I don&#39;t see a big need to return here."

I have ordered delivery from Mali Thai before and it&#39;s been great so I was confident inviting friends here for lunch.  Service was okay and atmosphere was pleasant and clean - would be great on a warm summer&#39;s day.  

We ordered Duck Curry, Eggplant Stir Fry and Pas Se Ew.  Duck Curry was great, full of flavor.  It was begging for more duck and vegetables though and not enough rice was served with the dish to be able to eat all of the curry.  The eggplant stir fry was good and the best value of the three dishes.  

The Pad Se Ew was AWFUL.  I didn&#39;t want to say anything in front of my guests or return the dish, but I was nearly inedible, tasting burnt and rotten (smelled of feet or dirty socks, honestly).  Very off flavor and I couldn&#39;t eat more than a few bites to be polite to the guests I was hosting. It also didn&#39;t have more than a few very small pieces of chicken for the add on price of $2.  Oh and the curry came out 10 minutes after the rest of the dishes.

I will not be ordering from here again."

I have no issue of visiting this spot by myself, and taking advantage of their beer special of buy two get one free.  I&#39;m from Colorado for god sake!  I feel like I made a relationship with the female owner enough over this year.  She appreciates that my husband and I can take the heat, and quite frankly never order Pad Thai.  

I haven&#39;t been in to the restaurant in a few months.  I have ordered to go quite a few times in the last few weeks.  

So I ordered tonight, and it was a mess.  I was a bit shocked at the food.  So I called and made my plea.. Beef salad had no flavor, coconut soup, tasted oily.  I call immediately.

The young lady says they are going to come pick the order up???  Ok, and then what...

Long story short.  The young lady apologized over the phone.  But I didn&#39;t get any kind of apology from the husband/owner when he came to get my food.  It was like, we&#39;ll see if you have the right to have me deliver new food to you, which by the why was &#34;fire&#34; hot.  Like trying to teach me a lesson, BEFORE they received my first order back into the kitchen.

Well I&#39;m sure they realized I had every right to complain for the first time, even though they have given me reason before.

Not sure if I will continue being a patron to this place again.  One reason is, I haven&#39;t ordered anything but beef, chicken, or tofu for awhile because I was concerned with what kind of meat I was actually being served.  

If someone orders/visits your establishment for a year and complains once.  You should have a bit more empathy.  Not happy."

My friend&#39;s entree did not come for about 10-15 minutes after the rest of us were served and it was brought out with no apology/explanation, I found a hair embedded in my food (at which point I stopped eating, but I hate complaining about that type of thing because it&#39;s really no one&#39;s fault...It turned me off, but I won&#39;t hold it against them), and the wine served to our friends was hot.

The place is pretty easy to find, just off Ulster next to Darcy&#39;s Pub. Plenty of parking. The place was pretty empty when I went in, with only 2 or 3 other customers. It was pretty early on a Saturday, so this was to be somewhat expected.

Service was very good, quick and friendly. The Chang beer special (3 beers for the price of 2) was a great start!

The food came, pretty quickly, and was decent. I ordered the Pad Tai with chicken, and had it &#39;medium&#39; spicy. I&#39;m not sure what &#39;medium&#39; spicy is to most people, but what came was very mild and tame. I should have gone for the &#39;very&#39; spicy I suppose. The flavor was good, a bit on the sweet side, which would probably have been masked if I ordered it at the top of the spicy scale. Portion was good, but over all, just kind of average in the experience.

I will probably try again sometime, when I am in the area.  They are only minutes away from the Landmark movie theater, and Comedy Works Landmark, so it is pretty convenient for a night out."

True to form, by the time our food came we had to ask for it in a to-go container, because it took more than half an hour. The waitress wasn&#39;t attentive at all or responsive to our situation. When the food FINALLY came, guess what? Both had MEAT in them and we had specifically ordered vegetarian items!!

They said they&#39;d redo the items, but that took a long time too, and we had to leave with to-go bags when I&#39;d planned a nice birthday luncheon for her. ARGH!

I&#39;m not one who likes being told how to order something but there was something friendly about her remark so I took her advice and got medium spice.

Um, homegirl was right. I took one bite of the medium spice chicken pad thai and my mouth was on fire! And I liked it   The pad thai sauce was right on point with a great balance of sweet and spicy along with a hearty portion of both chicken and noodles. The chicken, the peanut, the bean sprouts, the spice--this dish had it all! I was so conflicted--I wanted to keep eating bite after bite because it was delicious but at the same time I wanted to stop since I never wanted the meal to end.

The prices are reasonable, and the food usually comes out pretty quickly. Most importantly it is delicious. If you are a lover of all things spicy like me, I suggest the Pad Ped. It is a stir fry dish with jalapenos, yellow onion, carrots, bell pepper, rice, and your choice of meat. 

The only downside about this place is on the few occasions I have gone there with parties of 6 or more there has been confusion about who ordered what from the wait staff each time.

The mango salad is best mild in my opinion but it&#39;s delicious. All the employees are polite and professional but I prefer to pick up rather than dine in. There&#39;s a work area almost like a home office set up at one of the tables in the corner which was distracting. Best thai food I&#39;ve found in DTC so far though. They did deliver once to my apt but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a regular thing.

Methinks not&#34;.  Looking for an exciting place to eat while on the road, Mali popped up as a 4.5 start Thai restaurant.  How could I go wrong i asked?  I grabbed my colleagues and made the 20 minute drive to Mali.  We came early and there was only one server, which gradually grew to two.  The server was in a rush since she was alone but got our orders in right before we were ready to walk out.  Drinks came out two at a time, and then the wait for the food began.  I will give up a lot if the food is great

And therein lies the disappointment.  My dish arrived first and I mean 15 minutes before the other&#39;s dishes!!!  I got the house special noodle which was bland, and for $12 was too small.  Other got the house special, and one got the noodles.  Not a single person had anything good to say about their food.  The food was bland, and the veggies undercooked.  As a matter of fact we all kind of didnt want to say anything because we were expecting so much based on the reviews and were just really let down.

Maybe there isn&#39;t much Thai food in Denver but somehow I doubt it.  This place was lacking in every regard.  A big AVOID!"

I mistakenly chose this Thai place over another one close by.  Bad idea.  The parking is horrible, even with the underground parking.  We were greeted with &#34;Two?&#34; and that&#39;s all, not even a smile.  The dining room was nearly full with about 50 people and the noise level was horrible.  I could barely hear my husband across the table.  There is an open ceiling and no sound proofing.  The server just said &#34;Are you ready?&#34; and I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken lunch special.  My husband wanted Garlic Beef but was told they were out of beef.  At Noon?  So he ordered pork.  Then the server walked away without offering us beverages.  My hubby flagged her down and he ordered a Sprite and I ordered a Thai Iced Tea.  The Sprite was fine...until he needed a refill.  It was very long in coming and when it did arrive, in a 20 oz glass, the top level was 1.5 inches below the top.  Since it was full of ice, it was about three sips.  My Thai Iced Tea was served in a very skinny, very tall glass, also packed with ice.  For $3.00 I barely got any liquid at all.  Plus, I had to drink it by holding it near my hip.

The soup that was served to us when taking our order was very bland.  It had frozen mixed vegetables in it.  Yuk.  It had no seasoning and the broth tasted like brown water.  There were no condiments on the tables - no salt, pepper, soy sauce, teriayki, sriracha, or pepper sauce/paste - so we couldn&#39;t add any flavor to it.

It took nearly 40 minutes for our food to arrive and, my husband said his smelled odd.  I could smell something &#34;off&#34; and he said his pork (which he had to order due to no beef) smelled like the pet food processing plant he has worked in as an engineer.  Plus, his Garlic Pork was presented poorly and was very bland, even though he ordered it with a lot of spice.  There was no color and it just wasn&#39;t appetizing.  It was also cold.  Not room temperature, but cold.  The white rice was a bit warm.

My Pad Thai was very blah.  I can make it better at home.  There was one, one-inch square of chicken that I could find, and NO peanuts.  I think it was a peanut sauce but it was not very tasty.  The bean sprouts were at least fresh.

One quarter of the way through my entree I found a long, black hair.  My husband&#39;s hair is short and gray and mine is medium-length, dark blonde.  I was getting ready to ask to pack it up to go but I completely lost my appetite.

Our server had only been to our table once to check (very late) on the Sprite refill and never once asked us how things were.  After it was obvious we were done (napkins on the table), she finally came by and simply picked up my husband&#39;s empty plate.  She did not offer me a box or anything.  I finally had to flag down a different server and tell her &#34;Well, I wanted to take this home for later, but I found this hair.&#34; and showed it to her.  She said she&#39;d be right back.  She came back with our bill and said, &#34;They said I could give you a discount&#34; and walked away.  I looked and it was a LOUSY 10% OFF!  For a hair in my food!?!?  Not to mention that I only got to eat about one-fourth of it???  I was hungry two hours later, but still put off by the thought of that hair in my food.  By the way, no one in the front or back of the house was wearing hair restraints.

We will NOT go back.  Poor parking, very poor service, not a good value, even with a lunch special, food that was worse than I can make myself, a very loud atmosphere, and uncaring managers/owners who don&#39;t want to make hair in food an issue they handle themselves or do anything about - free entree, free meal on return, etc.

This could have been a favorite lunch spot for hubby and I since it&#39;s close to his office.  We&#39;ll stick with our favorite Thai place (Dancing Noodle) and Asian place (Cherry Village Asian Grill) in Parker."

This location used to swallow up greasy pizza joints, so I hope Mali Thai does well.  When we were in last month for DTC lunch club (the longest running Yelp lunch club in the Denver Metro area, I might add) it seemed to be hopping.  This place has the lunch hour in and out down to a science.  The time from ordering to scraping every last delicious morsel of food off of my plate was not long at all and they were good at accommodating separate checks.

I ordered the pad see ew with tofu (my usual go to, medium spice).  This version had lots of crispy fried egg bits and long pieces of Chinese broccoli to soak up the sweet soy sauce.  My favorite kind.  Call me a wimp, but I thought medium was perfect heat...detectable but not distracting.

My other dining friends had some great looking entrees.  Some even had sides of what appeared to be wild rice in the shape of a Christmas tree!  That&#39;s pretty cool.  They also start everyone with the prettiest bowl of tofu soup (clear broth with the vegetables cut into star shapes).

The noodle dish tasted like the ones I had in Thailand as a kid (my family is from Bangkok) and the soup was perfectly seasoned and you could taste all the fresh herbs in it. Plus, they actually only put ingredients in the soup that are supposed to be in there instead of other places that also add bell peppers or onions. They also have duck curry and Kao Pat Boo on the menu which I will try out again because these are hard to find dishes in Denver. 

One of the ways I test a Thai restaurant is whether I get chop sticks or not. I didn&#39;t and instead I got a spoon and a fork as it should be (google Big Bang Theory Sheldon on Thai food for an explanation).

Tom Kha (coconut lemongrass soup) was enjoyable.  It had a decent amount of herbs to compliment the tofu I chose. 

Panang curry was rich in flavor and the sauce had a perfect consistency.  Don&#39;t expect many veggies; I had to order a side of them steamed for $3, which helped.  For $1 more, I ordered the dinner size, which isn&#39;t all that much. I&#39;d hate to see how small the lunch portion is.

I get my food &#39;medium&#39; and end up needing a drink and a tissue for my runny nose (that&#39;s a good thing for people who like spicy stuff.) Their fried bananas are Awesome as well! I&#39;ve had swift customer service every time. 

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t recommend them as a large group ordering location. Our office ordered from there for roughly a dozen people and there were some definite let downs. 1 girl found 2 hairs in her food, and another coworker did as well. The quality definitely suffered for the quantity I think. They were prompt, so it might have just been an &#39;off&#39; day."

We got the Tom yum soup and papaya salad to start. Both were excellent! We had Penang curry and the drunken noodles for entrees. Again both were excellent! Tons of flavor! We ordered both dishes medium and they definitely were spicy. It cleared our sinuses right out! We were disappointed that they were out of the mango and sticky rice for dessert but we got the fried banana and coconut ice cream instead. The ice cream was great but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d order it with the bananas again. The bananas had a batter that was similar to tempura and tasted greasy. Just not for me. We would definitely return though! I&#39;d love to try more dishes!

Our party had nothing but raving compliments of the food here. I loved the Tom Kha- it was incredible and one of my new favorites. The creamy coconut milk was perfectly accompanied by a hint of lime and slight spice. I also had a pad Thai that was flavorful and filling. The Tom yum and curry had nice reviews from those dining with us. Thanks for the recommendation and for going us Shane, Andrew, and baby Lexi!

And live up to the name they did.  I wandered in here for a late lunch the other day and had an outstanding experience.  I took a seat at the window so that I could people watch in fabulous Uptown.

There are so many classic dishes to choose from including gumbo, red beans and rice and shrimp etouffee.  I couldn&#39;t decide so I asked the waitress to choose any of the three for me along with a side of cheddar grit cakes and a classic iced tea.

She went with the gumbo which arrived lightening fast and had the fabulous deep flavor of a well cooked roux, providing a launching point for all the other ingredients to shine.  My only complaint is that I wanted a bigger bowl and they offer only an appetizer size, it was that good.  The cheddar grit cakes arrived at the table a little after the gumbo and had a nice crisp crust; I&#39;m sure they are deep fried which is even better.  The flavor had a nice smoky cheesy quality paired with the rich corn flavor and slight crunch on the outside.  Delicious.

Service was quick, fun and well done.  In short, this is an Uptown restaurant that I will be back to many more times."

I ordered the gumbo and the red beans and rice, as these were two things that I grew up with and I wanted to see how they compared to my mama&#39;s. After I placed my order I waited for about 20-25 minutes. About the time I was going to flag down my server, she came up to me and apologized, saying that the kitchen guys thought my order had already gone out and that they were making it right then. Ok, no big deal. I told her that it was my first time there and she apologized again and told me that one of their servers had quit that night by simply not showing up. The place wasn&#39;t super packed so I thought there must be something going on. 

I got my food shortly after that and it was delicious. I decided that I was still hungry so I ordered the Tilapia Ponchartrain. This dish came out much quicker than my earlier order and was also very tasty. Though, as my grandfather used to say my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I asked for a to-go box. My server asked if it would be a silly question to talk about dessert and I said yes, but of course asked to see what they had as I could take it home for later. 

You guys. Pecan cheesecake with bourbon caramel sauce. OMG. Anyway, I ordered that to-go and was getting ready to pay my bill when the server tells me that the cheesecake is on the house because I had to wait so long for my original order. 

This is what made me give Gumbo&#39;s four stars. Not only was my server sincere in her apologies and great with her attentiveness, but she also wanted to make things right on the part of the restaurant. I can appreciate any establishment that recognizes a mistake and makes up for it. It shows that they care about their customers.

I will be going back to Gumbo&#39;s for sure."

My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. It&#39;s a little pricier than we would normally spend going-out, so we saved it for a special occasion. 

The service was a slow and inattentive. But the cuisine is the closest thing to home - good New Orleans style comfort food. It is better than any corporate creole/Cajun restaurant that we&#39;ve tried. It&#39;s not too greasy and not over blown with spices. Gumbo, dirty rice, and crawfish Etouffe are among my favorite dishes. The ones that stand-out and that I would highly recommend are the Tilapia Pontchartrain (Pon-choo-train) and the BBQ Shrimp &amp; grits. The BBQ is not your usual BBQ pulled pork/beef brisket style. It is an entirely new creole style. You&#39;ll love and be surprised by the flavor."

My preference is to sit at the bar - the spot where you can see into the kitchen... pretty cool to watch the chefs do their work - atmosphere is great, always candles, light music and pretty intimate.. great for a date, business or relaxing evening - like the artwork and pictures on the walls too.  My favorite dish is the tilapia pontchartrain with shrimp and crawfish... the sauce is incredible!  I also love the gumbo, etoufee and catfish... there&#39;s nothing that they don&#39;t do exceptionally well here.

We both got the shrimp po&#39;boy, mine fried, and his grilled. Both were decent but we agreed that there wasn&#39;t much seasoning or spice present. You don&#39;t bite into it and think cajun cooking. 

I got an appetizer of the seafood dirty rice and I thought it was really good. I&#39;d definitely get it again. Especially if you put some of the green hot sauce on it to give it some kick. Plenty of shrimp mixed within.

My buddy said that the red beans and rice were just ok, and that Popeye&#39;s (yes the fried chicken chain) has better red beans and rice. Ouch... or maybe Popeye&#39;s just has really good red beans and rice?

Not a bad place to grab a bite in the neighborhood. I&#39;d come back."

I tasted the gumbo, and again I say to Denver folks it&#39;s probably good, I know the chef prides himself in his dishes however once again not the best I&#39;ve tasted, but that&#39;s cause I&#39;m from Louisiana and he&#39;s from New Jersey.

My friends and I headed over rather early on a Friday night. There were a few empty tables on the patio and several open tables inside. We hovered around at the hostess stand until a somewhat frazzled server told us the wait would be about 40 minutes. Hmmm...but what about all of these open tables? They are reserved, we were told. About 15 minutes later, as the empty tables remained empty, the server finally capitulated and let us have a table on the patio. I think overwhelmingly the 3 of us agreed that if you want to survive, if you want to stay in the green as a business, you&#39;ve got to be welcoming and get people in your door. Making us stand awkwardly around the front entrance to the restaurant while tables stand empty is just not a feasible approach.

Finally seated, I ordered a bowl of gumbo and a simple salad. The salad was barely dressed. I had to ask for extra dressing. The salad was, as the name suggests, &#34;simple.&#34; Nothing to write home about. I did not care that much for the gumbo, however, it was dark and chock-full of sausage which is probably how it&#39;s supposed to be! The fried green tomatoes were delicious and they are something I would recommend if you are dining here. My friend&#39;s order of fried catfish was huge! We ended with an order of beignets, which were freshly made. 

All in all, it was a nice evening after we got settled in."

We dined for dinner on a snowy evening and opted for bar seats. Was disappointed in the beer offerings and in the fact that the two of us were handed a single menu and had to ask for a second so we could both decide what to eat. I inquired about the best way to order as the menu is separated into small plates, salads/po&#39;boys, and large plates and was told &#34;um, it&#39;s really up to you&#34;-not exceptionally helpful. So, with limited input from the bartender/waiter the two of us decided to order the bbq shrimp &amp; grits, gumbo, and crab cakes (all small plates). Additionally, I ordered the warm kale salad. The kale salad was exquisite served perfectly warm, with crispy Brussels (more like crispy chips), and tahini dressing. The crab cakes also came with warm kale salad and were great to share. The gumbo was spicy and rich with plenty of sausage. The shrimp and grits were tasty with the grits served in three triangular patties. 

The restaurant itself is a nice space located just near the intersection of 17th &amp; Downing.  It appeared that there was a single large table that accommodated  a larger group. 

I would definitely recommend sharing the small plates and eating tapas style. My only qualm is the beer selection and the seemingly scattered service. But neither are enough to keep me away. I will be back again!"

My dad had said he wasn&#39;t starving and ordered the red beans and rice. I will pretty much always order a Shrimp Po&#39;Boy if its on the menu. That is what I did. The waiter was not impressed that we didn&#39;t order drinks and a lot of food. Sad to not be treated well because we have a smaller appetite. 

My Po&#39;Boy was pretty good except two of the shrimp had not been deveined. I did it myself at the table and continued to eat it. I am not a NOLA-style food expert, so I could be wrong but I was surprised they severed their Po&#39;Boys with mustard, not just a mayo type sauce. The mustard took away from the other great flavors. None of the (many) Po&#39;Boys I have eaten in Louisiana had mustard. The flavors were still good though. I&#39;d like another option for my side besides sweet potato fries.

Sadly my dad&#39;s red beans and rice left much to be desired. Out of the entire soup bowl, there were only two slivers of sausage. Good thing he wasn&#39;t that hungry. 

I gave this place the benefit of the doubt because its in my neighborhood and I know they are capable of providing good food. Their (now closed) downtown location surely did. I will try again in the hopes that this was a fluke."

I used to love Gumbo&#39;s and I can say the food is still good, lacking in presentation and pricey for what you get, but the flavor is definitely good. Unfortunately the service is horrible. And unfortunately that is not an exaggeration. The last two times I have been it has been beyond negligent. I last dined there early October 2016 and the girl &#34;serving&#34; us could not have ignored us more - it took 50 minutes to get a bowl of soup and our waters were never once refilled. Sorry we didn&#39;t buy alcohol, but that seemed to be the kiss of death for service from her as we were now seen as &#34;cheap&#34; customers, or so it seemed hard not to believe. There was one large group there of about 12 people but other than that, we were among 3 other tables of two people, so it wasn&#39;t busy and there&#39;s no reason for a bowl of gumbo to take 50 minutes to get to the table. Our meals took another 35 minutes from there for two entrees. The waitress could have at least apologized for the long wait but she didn&#39;t acknowledge us at all after taking our orders. Simple efforts like, hey, how about a free dessert since that was an excessively long wait, or being at least on the ball with drink refills and apologizing for the wait would have gone a long way. I never want to not tip, and I did leave a small tip, but I don&#39;t think she deserved it at all and I&#39;m sure she wasn&#39;t happy about the $4. We had the Denver Passbook, thankfully, since $50 would have been too much to pay for bad service, but she made a point to heavily circle the full total rather than the discounted one. That wasn&#39;t necessary, but rather, very tacky. We know how much to tip on and if she would have been better, I would have tipped the 20% on $50. 

With so many new and exciting restaurants popping up in Denver, Gumbo&#39;s would be smart to update the decor ( it&#39;s really cold and stark right now) and better train their staff to be friendlier, more professional and prompt. That&#39;s part of what you pay for when you go out to a nice meal.

Sorry Gumbo&#39;s, like I said, I have really liked you all for a long time and good creole food is hard to find in Denver,  but the last two times have been so disappointing and I won&#39;t be back for a while. :("

  Went to this establishment, after having a Dinner somewhere else since the Birthday Girl, choose this establishment for her Birthday Dinner Party.  That evening was on Saturday November 8th 2014.  The Party starts at 19:00hrs.  I came in at a later time slot coz I have a prior engagement before this event.

  Anyways, we were seated at the Right Wing of this establishment, near the entrance.  Since I came in late, I sat all the way back near to where the Bar Section.  Once seated, I have to wait a bit, from our Main Server.  Man at that hour, this place is indeed super busy.  I was there way before 20:00hrs ish.  My friends already ate the Appetizer orders from what I could recall was the Mussels, Fried Green Tomatoes and Crawfish Etouffee to name a few.

  As for the Menu, it looks good and appetizing, but in terms of flavors some fall short for my personal taste buds.  I opt to order the Jumbo Lumb Crab Cakes which was ($15) as an appetizer.  WOWZA!  $15 for an appetizer can be a little too steep for some!

  TAKE NOTE, the ONLINE Menu and The Restaurant Menu DOES NOT TALLY, hence there are differences in some pricing of certain dishes.

  Anyways, about 20:25hrs my order arrived at the table.  It comes with the Crab Cakes which is a little too tiny for my liking, Pan seared, with Garlic Butter, served with Kale Salad and some pieces of Fried Kale with a Charred Lemon.  My Appetizer order was just MEH (2.5 stars), to Slight OK..  It does NOT WOW me as much.  *SIGH*  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing..

  I had the chance to sample the Crawfish Etouffee ($10), Grilled Flat Iron Steak, Chicken dish and Alamosa Striped Bass of what my friends ordered.  The Grilled Flat Iron Steak comes with Wild Gulf shrimp, Cremini mushrooms, Red Wine Pepper Sauce, Duck Fat Fingerling Potatoes and Brussels Sprout.  The Alamosa Striped Bass comes with Crispy Skin Bass Fillet, Gulf Shrimp Etouffee and Seasonal Vegetable.  To end the evening we also ordered the Beignet.  THANK GOD those are OK.  Fluffy, though small and the powdered sugar dusting was minimal at best.

  All in all, EVERYTHING was just OK.  Maybe I would return but NOT In A Hurry coz there are other options to eat from the Menu.  From there, perhaps my review might differ.

I appreciated their reservation system that my friend suggested I use.  Despite how busy it was, I was quickly seated by Kayla when I got there and she was super friendly and very knowledgeable. 

Kayla recommended the striped bass and it was delicious!!!  I had a glass of Sauvignon with it and complimented each other well.  The meat of the fish was tender while the skin contrasted with a crunchy texture with a scrumptious sauce that had just the right amount of kick but didn&#39;t overpower the bass. I also ordered a slice of key lime pie and it was the best key lime pie I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s sweet flavor was a nice way to end the meal that left my taste buds happy!

Kayla&#39;s service was unlike any other.  She consistently wanted to make sure my meal was satisfactory, and my drinks were full.  I enjoyed getting to know a bit about her and she was genuine in her interactions. She wasn&#39;t a typical waitress and made my experience more personable with her style of individualized attention that waiting staff don&#39;t do anymore these days.

We stumbled upon it after the restaurant we planned to go had a violation and couldn&#39;t serve alcohol. So glad we did! We got there at 6pm on Saturday night and had 30 mins of happy hour!!! Great drink, I had a cool and spicy Marg and hubs had a hurricane. We both had to order one more because they were fab. Since it was happy hour, we got 6 small plates and shared-all were AMAZING!!! Gumbo, red beans, shrimp &amp; grits, Brussels and sausage, green tomatoes and garlic butter (with ciabatta). Spicy to the eight degree, spiced just right and cooked to perfection! Every single bite was great! Service great, patio great! So pleased with our stumbled upon date night find. Can&#39;t wait to return!"

To my surprise, the place was fairly empty. We sat down in a table on the patio and shortly after, our waiter greeted us. 

We ordered the steak and the scallop for entree, adding onto a crawfish etouffee and a shrimp etouffee. Both the entree and the sides were perfectly cooked. The etouffee were spicy but not so hot that you can&#39;t taste anything. Not the best I&#39;ve had but definitely the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to compare it with the ones I have had in NOLA. 

Server was friendly and attentive through the whole meal. Ambiance is nice and it&#39;s a nice size patio to sit on. Definitely check the place out if you haven&#39;t already!"

I split the blackened catfish with my boyfriend which comes with chicken gumbo and dirty seafood rice, and then we got a side order of ettoufe.  The ettoufe was pretty good, but probably our least favorite, although it came without rice so that may have been the strange part (they did warn us the side orders don&#39;t come with rice, but it was still a little weird).   The catfish was probably the best I&#39;ve ever had, and everything on that plate was amazing.  My friends got the blackened chicken and vegetables, and regular gumbo, and also said theirs was very good.  The gumbo didn&#39;t have quite as much of a kick as gumbo I&#39;ve had in the past (in New Orleans, which is hard to beat), but was good, and I must say the kick to our catfish is probably what made the meal so good.  The drinks were very affordable, the wait staff was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was good, although not very busy as we went late on a weeknight.  Overall, we will plan to be back!"

Service is okay, which on the Denver scale is an 8 anywhere else it&#39;s a 5. I&#39;ll definitely be back because the food was good and, hell, it&#39;s the only Cajun place I know of in Denver."

Place was still pretty busy at 1:15pm but we snagged a table outside.  I have to say I was pretty impressed.   I had a huge portion of fried catfish on étouffée with crawfish dirty rice and a side of collards with bacon and andouille and she had a really ample bowl of mussels with grilled bread for lunch today. $20 plus tip It was delish - not low cal but really good.  Considering the outrageous prices the restaurants are charging on 17th Ave. these days I thought this was the best deal I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  Next time I feel like a calorie splurge we&#39;ll be back for sure.

Got there about 6:45pm and there was only 1 table occupied. Our waitress greeted us with menus and asked if we wanted drinks. She seemed annoyed because I was not drinking and my husband ordered a beer. The only IPA on the menu. They were out of it!  So he ordered something else. When she returned we told her that it was a first time visit and asked what she recommended. Her comment was &#34;people seem to like the gumbo&#34;. Really? That&#39;s it?  Hello, first time visit!! She was quite unenthusiastic...
I asked about the pan roasted vegetables. What kind?  The answer was &#34;it varies, I will have to check&#34;...shouldn&#39;t a server know whats on the menu daily?  We ordered the popcorn shrimp for a starter. My husband ordered the red beans and rice and the andouille sausage with onions and peppers. I ordered the red beans and rice and the gumbo. All small plates.  She came back a few minutes later and said they were out of the sausage!  Strike 2! So my husband then decided on the shrimp po boy.

The popcorn shrimp was overcooked and very brown.  The gumbo however was tasty. My husband never got his red beans and rice and my order had about 18 rice grains in it and was extremely bland tasting, and when I asked for a side oder of rice, I was told they were out of rice and it would take 15-20 minutes to cook! Strike 3!  How are you out of the main ingredients on your menu?? On a Wednesday night?  With only 5 tables occupied? 

At this point we were completely over it and couldn&#39;t leave fast enough. Very disappointing..won&#39;t return.."

Don was our server. He was fantastic. Very personable, friendly, and had great recommendations. 

We started with the Popcorn Shrimp and Gumbo. I was going to give this place 4 stars solely based on that... And then came the entrees: Blackened Catfish and Pork Tenderloin. Holy moly! Both dishes were melt-in-your mouth good. Seriously. 

We will be back, maybe next time for lunch to try one of their Po&#39;Boys."

It was so good the only reason why I&#39;m giving them 4 stars is because I thought the rice could&#39;ve been a little bit more brown as it was more orange and looked like Mexican rice but it still taste good... But the gumbo soup is off the chain and the fried catfish is so tender and juicy. I definitely will come back when I&#39;m visiting Denver

All I need to say is that the food is fantastic!  I have eaten some amazing food in New Orleans and Gumbo&#39;s is just as good.  We enjoyed a lot of items from the menu.  The gumbo rocked, the étouffée was killer, and the beans/rice were first rate.  The only knock is that the kale is prepared in what I would call &#39;california style&#39; as with garlic and brown sugar so it&#39;s too sweet.  Would prefer &#39;southern style&#39; where it was cooked for hours with a ham-hock or bacon.  Otherwise, there is NOTHING wrong with this place."

The gumbo (chicken and andouille sausage was fantastic - great spices, a little bit of kick - I felt as if I were back in NOLA.  We order something that looked like polenta friters, another excellent choice and great for dipping in your gumbo.  

My hurricane definitely packed a punch.  The Mosow Mule was delivered in a tin cup - what happened to the traditional copper cup?  

Here&#39;s the other side of my review - it was bone chilling in the restaurant.  We asked twice to get the temperature raised.  Some people made a comment in regards to the temperature and waited until some tables were opened outside.  Lastly, if you have ever visited NOLA, you will know that their service is not the greatest and the servers are not very attentive or have good attitudes - this was exactly what we encountered at this establishment.  

Lastly, there is a huge ABITA beer sign above the door.  Yet, they only offer one of the beers - Turbo.  What about Purple Haze? The Amber?  A bigger selection of Louisiana beer would had helped my experience.  

The food was great; the service does not match."

I went here for lunch today and got the blackened chicken dish with chicken gumbo, carrots, cauliflower and brussel sprouts, and I added blackened shrimp.

All of these dishes were very flavorful and soo so so so good. I also got the hurricane cocktail and the cool and spicy margarita they were both very good and strong but tasted just right.

If it was warmer when we went, the patio would have been a lovely option. This food is so delicious! It is hard to find Cajun food in Colorado (I think).  We got the BBQ shrimp, crispy shrimp, fried green tomatoes, and crawfish etouffè. Everything was delicious and the spice was mild (just how I like it, all the flavor with out overpowering spice). The only complaint is that I was hungry for shrimp and grits and they said the BBQ shrimp were their version of it. While the BBQ shrimp do come with grit cakes, it&#39;s a far cry from creamy grits topped with gravy and shrimp (how I think shrimp and grits should be). Overall delicious meal. The crawfish etouffè I think was $10 and it was by far the most delicious etouffè I have ever had!"

The kale salad was wonderful - crisp, fresh and not overpowered with dressing.  The chicken and crab was superb - I wish I had their recipe for the chicken.  If all collard greens are as good as theirs I should have tried them much sooner!  Had a side of crawfish etoufee (I am sure I spelled that wrong!) which had a bit of kick but not overpowering.

They treat everyone that comes in for happy hour like we are 2nd class citizens, each of the waiters are SO rude and I have been to this place on more than one occasion in hopes that maybe the last person just hated there job.... 

But no I was wrong they all seem to hate working there or at the least serving customers who want to enjoy there happy hour...

I get going there on Fat Tuesday would be busy but this place isn&#39;t that big so you&#39;d think they&#39;d be happy they were busy.  Well you&#39;d be wrong.  Our waitress clearly wasn&#39;t amused to have the opportunity to make fat cash on Fat Tuesday.  

We had reservations at 6:30 at the exact time the specials ended.  When our server showed up she was clearly unamused and nearly mumbling.  Like I said she seemed mad to be there in general.  We order a round of drinks and ask if it&#39;s to late to get the small plate deals.  We got a very unamused answer that they are over and she walked away.
We ordered our dinner and I ordered an appetizer  of the hummus to start with.  Well the appetizer turned into the duringtizer.  Our meals arrived and asked to just cancel the hummus seeing that our food is now here.  I was told that since it was already rang in and being made I couldn&#39;t cancel this order.  The server blamed the busyness for the mistake.  However it&#39;s not my problem that the busy restaurant is to blame but why should I now have to pay $6 bucks for an appetizer I now have to mix in with my meal.  

My friends Scallops were burnt, which were the most expensive item on the menu.  Now our server is clearing our dishes before we&#39;re even done eating. Meanwhile all of our drinks sat empty.  At this point I refused to spend any more money on drinks and got a water.  

Well needless to say I can see why they downsized from their downtown location, and I won&#39;t be returning any time soon.   The servers attitude cost her a few rounds of drinks to run up a bigger bill and let&#39;s say a group that normally tips 20%+ tipped significantly less.  I shouldn&#39;t have had to buy an app because it was rang it and being made.  It should have came before the meal. It&#39;s generally how it works.   Lousy experience!"

I drove by this place a few times and have wanted to check it out for a few reasons.  One because I like Cajun food and two because the location is awesome.  A nice patio section on 17th street, will draw me in almost every time.

The restaurant itself is very nice.  It has a New Orleans theme but is not over the top or cheesy in anyway.  The staff was very attentive and was able to answer any questions we had about the menu or food.  It&#39;s an upscale~ish feel without being snooty, nice mix.

The food ... oh the food.  I had the blackened catfish.  It&#39;s severed over dirty rice with shrimp and a Cajun slaw.  The catfish was above average but was really stuck out to me was the shrimp dirty rice (I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the official name but that&#39;s what I&#39;m calling it).  It was phenomenal, a little creamy not too rich.  My date had the salmon, which was very tasty as well.  There were hints of Cajun but not overpowering.  

The booze ... They serve a few New Orleans beers on tap and a few CO beers in a bottles.  They have a good wine and mixed drink selection.  A few of the mixed drinks are New Orleans themed, like a hurricane.  

Gumbo&#39;s is a place I&#39;ll return to ... the food and atmosphere were great!"

First Tastes then Wild Catch then Roam and now Gumbo&#39;s, and man alive, I hope this last one sticks around for a while. 

I had never been to the old Gumbo&#39;s, so I can&#39;t compare, but here&#39;s what I can say...the location, for me, is perfect. They have a nice happy hour. The first thing the waitress told us what that in downsizing the space &amp; menu, they were able to focus on the food. All good things, if you ask me! 

We started with the gumbo, which was good, not great and they had &#34;run out&#34; of rice. I found that odd and frankly, it would have made the dish better, but I overlooked that because I was half way through my Hurricane (which, as a side note, I had 2 at Zydeco&#39;s prior to dinner and I preferred that one - less sweet and more boozy). For my entree, I had the delicious blackened catfish. Delicious, I say. It was served over &#34;dirty&#34; rice (so I got my rice fix, although, like David M said, it is more like a risotto) and a yummy slaw. The hubs got the Colorado bass and while good, was remorseful that he didn&#39;t order the catfish too...

I want to, and will, support this business, hence why I&#39;m rounding up a 3.5 star experience to a 4 star one. Don&#39;t be scared if it looks empty - people tend to sit inside, and while it is a lovely interior, grab a seat outside."

The walls were plain yellow with a couple of scattered pieces of art, and our waiter, while nice, had obviously never been given the opportunity to try everything on the menu to even remotely describe any of the dishes we inquired about.

On to the food: Although I expected to shell a good amount of money for a couple entrees and dessert, I didn&#39;t expect to end up feeling hungry about an hour after our meal at Gumbo&#39;s.

High quality food can scream smaller than usual portions at a premium price, but sometimes that recipe gets old when you&#39;re just trying to enjoy good food without having to order the entire menu just to get full."

Part of the let down were:
--Gumbo made of mild sausage, chicken, okra, in a thick brown gravy. We had to douse ours with Tabasco in order for it be consumable. 
--Collard greens which tasted like sweet boiled greens
--Forgettable BBQ Shrimp
--Crispy shrimp slider, which I thought was quite tasty, but contained no traces of creole influence
--Crispy Catfish that was about 90% batter


On the plus side, we arrived during happy hour which offered a great value, but the food is nowhere near authentic nor satisfying. 

The food would be considered decent if had not claim to be &#34;Louisiana Style&#34; and failed to deliver."

Shakes here are thick and delicious. Haven&#39;t tried the other desserts. 

Did I mention how much I love skinny fries???"

But No.
But No.
But No.
But No.
The burgers are just plain old fast food...nothing special.
The custard is runny...do not tip it upside down...it will spill in one second.
I am happy I only ordered a mini concrete...still $3.99.
The whipped cream was good with the peppermint chips, but the chocolate was runny and plain.
My son&#39;s &#34;oreo&#34; tasted just the same as store brand ice cream...stop.

Can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been in Denver for over three years and have not tried his place until today.

I have never been to a Freddy&#39;s before and I was impressed with how many custard options they had.

There was a group of us and we tried the turtle sundae and the peanut butter and banana sundae. I thought it was awesome that they had a dirt and worms sundae as I haven&#39;t had that since I was a kid! The custard can be ordered in a milkshake or sundae form as well. We ordered the sundaes and asked for a side of gummy worms as well which they didn&#39;t question which leads me to believe that they have gotten his request before.

The custard was great and was not overly topped with the chocolate and peanut butter goodness so the ice cream to topping ratio was great. This was a nice quick option for some sweets while visiting Denver."

I&#39;ve stopped there a few times to get custard for my kids.  The custard itself tastes good, but no better than any other ice cream place.  On my most recently trip I got a small custard and a small sundae.  The only difference in the price (about .60) was one topping that my son got to pick for the sundae.  The sundae didn&#39;t even come with whipped cream and a cherry (or even a sauce of his choice).  You had to pay an extra .50/topping for an extras.  So, why pay for a sundae?   Also, the prices for the custard were a little on the high side.  I won&#39;t be back."

It&#39;s a wonderful alternative to the humdrum McD&#39;s, BK, Wendy&#39;s greaseball burgers.

Freddy&#39;s burgers are different. They are thin and smashed - almost flakey - but oh-so good. The fries are my favorite kind; thin and crispy. The custartd is a nice little (or big!) after-dinner treat. On multiple visits I have yet to find a food I didn&#39;t like.

My only (minor) complaint is that the tables are dirty more often than not. There is an army of people working at Freddy&#39;s and yet it&#39;s usually hard to find anybody cleaning tables. This is a common problem in the fast food world."

If I&#39;m on Arapahoe and wanting a burger I usually head for Smashburger and if I&#39;m further east I head for Five Guys.  My experience here didn&#39;t change my mind on the other two.

The patties are so thin at 2.6 oz each they don&#39;t have the usual texture you experience from hamburgers.  Now the edges are nice and crispy and such, but the meat just didn&#39;t have the &#34;right feel&#34; for me.  I enjoyed the thin cut fries and the fries sauce, it&#39;s a nice unique touch and my favorite thing I took away from this experience.

I had read a few reviews and felt like I had to try the turtle sunday for dessert.  It was awful!  I felt the custard lacked any flavor and the hot fudge and caramel left me wanting a visit to Dairy Queen for a blizzard to get the bad taste out of my mouth.  They put just a tiny little dot of whipped cream on top.  Huge disappointment.

Walked in to a very clean restaurant that was very busy.  Seeing the prices there are comparable or even cheaper than other burger places. Got a double bacon cheeseburger combo and food was actually very good except fries were WAY too salty. But their fries, they are less than shoestring fry size, and delicious; a nice change from the standard fry. 
Only downside was how loud it gets. Was probably 80% full and busy and is extremely loud. Maybe its the building style or fabrication materials but it was louder than your usual place. Gf wants to try it and I&#39;m definitely game to go back and try other things."

This time tho I waited in the drive-thru line entirely way to long. I had already ordered so I was three cars deep and I waited probably at least 15 mins. Unacceptable! Also I feel sorry for the 5 cars that I could see anyway... that were behind me. You know when you wish that you were not locked into the drive thru line because it is taking entirely way to long.

What you will get for $8:
The thinnest wafer of a patty you&#39;ve ever seen, over salted and cooked in about 90 seconds.  Fries that are just not good eats.  Something about the oil, maybe too old, I  don&#39;t know.  And a soda.  

The meat they use is highly suspect.  The taste is so foreign, it&#39;s as if there are more fillers than actual beef.  The bun and condiments were unremarkable and the burger did not hold together very well.  

You want a burger that will make you go gaga for $8?  Try Crave Burgers."

The patties are very thin but full of flavor. The fries are also unusually thin, but tasty. A little pricey compared to their counterpart Good Times and the menu is very simplistic and unimpressive. However, this just opened recently so I expect they will grow and improve as time goes on. 

Minus 1 star for location... Cornerstar is a pain to get in and out of during rush hour, and with all the competition in the same shopping center (Five Guys, Chipotle, Which Wich, Garbanzos, Panera, Cheddars....) it seems like they could have been a little more strategic in location planning. 

Minus another star because their custard doesn&#39;t even begin to match up against Good Times"

I had to repeat my order 4 times and stil had to clarify when I got to the window. I&#39;m not talking spit-in-your-food special order - I just wanted 3 pints of custard, already packed. Had I known, I would have walked in, grabbed it from the case and been done in a third of the time. We waited at the window another several minutes while the employees were busy with their phones.

Their burgers are tasty and reasonably inexpensive.  Freddy&#39;s has cut into my Five Guys trips.  One reason is the convenience of their drive-through.  Another reason is that their custard is phenomenal.  I keep getting the turtle concrete and it continues to blow my mind.

The burgers are pretty thin patties and sort of a smashed on the griddle appearance.  They remind me of Culvers.  The french fries are thin and have a stronger potato taste than most french fries.  

Definitely try the custard.  I usually forgo the french fries and eat a burger and some ice cream.  The drive-through staff is unusually polite and it only takes a few minutes to get your food."

I agree with the other Yelpers who suggest ordering the double - the patties are really thin, so if you are hungry you definitely want two.

The only disappointment was that they carry Pepsi products - I thought with the red and white awning and decor, it would be Coca-Cola and I could get my Diet Coke fix!"

We have been to Freddy&#39;s many times, at the old Buckingham location, but now we have one right in our back yard!

This time around we were looking for a hot dog. You cannot find a decent hot dog in the Aurora/Centennial area. I am a traditionalist when it comes to hot dogs, usually just mustard and onios is all I put on them. Ketchup on a hot dog should be punishable by deah in my opinion. LOL Anyway, I got the plain hot dog just like I like it and I saw a Patty Melt on the menu, I had never seen it at the other location. So I got that as well. The hot dog was delicious. I love the grilled flat side buns and the hot dog itself was cooked pefectly. The only downfall was that it was so tiny! I chowed through it what seemed like a minute. Good thing I got the Patty Melt. The melt was delicious too, the carmelized onions and cheesey goodness complemented the thin burgers. And the rye bread was lightly grilled to perfection.

We were running errands so we opted out for the custard, a poor decision on our part thats for sure. I am still wishing today that we would have gotten the custard. Next time I will not make that mistake again!

I dont understand the camparison between Freddy&#39;s and In-N-Out. IMO In-N-Out pails in comparison. I just dont get the facination with thier food. Freddy&#39;s is much better and will be a regular stop for us!

5 Guys probably hates the fact that Freddy&#39;s is right in the same parking lot. Now they can sit and watch all the people going to Freddy&#39;s!

Sadly, this was not it.  The onion rings were decent, but the burger was a trainwreck.  I opted for the double with several toppings.  It was sloppy and fell apart quickly.  I was not tasting a lot of beef, so I pulled off part of a patty and ate that by itself.  Very weird.  There was almost no &#34;meaty&#34; flavor.  The texture was also oddly soft.  It was as if the patty had been poached.  The only enjoyable flavor on the burger was from the grilled onions.  Prices were reasonable, too bad the food was largely unacceptable."

This is a great &#34;steakburger&#34; (Winstead&#39;s in Kansas City has the only one better).  It&#39;s different, but really tasty.  Their frozen custard is great also.  The fries are good, and one order is enough for 2 people easily.

Being from Buffalo NY, its hard to impress me outside of NYS with &#34;good wings&#34;. Woody&#39;s was recommended to me by a coworker, who is a native of CO and never had true Buffalo NY wings. I thought I better give it a try...

I took the bestie with me, both of us being from NYS. We both agreed, they were pretty good. Not the best, nothing ever will be to us anywhere outside of our home-state, but these were worth going to Woodys. The size of the wings were as close as you come to Buffalos wings. I try many other establishments and you pay quite a bit for these small wings and that gets frustrating. I got 6 wings for about $6, and a side of curly fries and drink. My son got the kids meal of grilled cheese and fries and some milk. In the end we shared a bowl of ice cream and our total only came to $18. That&#39;s pretty good for a wing place. I ordered the bone-in wings, Medium and crispy. Most of the time I&#39;ll order crispy and it wont even be close. This was the perfect amount of crispy! No need to ask for them extra saucy (or as we say &#34;wet&#34;), theyre pretty covered in the sauce you order. The curly fries were okay...they tasted like Arby&#39;s fries. My son&#39;s grilled cheese(which he loved and was the cheesiest grilled cheese ever) came with straight fries and they were real tasty. They have a lot of flavors to choose from with their wing sauces too. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and I think we&#39;ll be back."

The wings are usually delicious so we have put up with long wait times, frequently incorrect orders (they forget something almost every time) and rude customer service. But in the last year things have gotten worse. The quality of the wings have plummeted (think trying to eat a piece of old jerky), the wait times have been as long as an hour and half, and the prices have gone up to boot (almost double what they were a year ago)! When we have had issues I have spoken to a manager who could care less about a long time customer having to wait an hour and a half because they couldn&#39;t get the order right the first 3 times.

These wings were tough. Felt like I was snapping into some leather. Definitely not the texture I was looking for. Overcooked most def. Taste wasn&#39;t much to write home about either. Their mild flavor apparently meant just vinegar and not much else. 

Their sides weren&#39;t much better either. Garlic bread was so salty. Had me grasping at my water immediately. Their curly fries tasted good but they gave us just one tiny cup of ranch for a large order. Wasn&#39;t enough to go around at all. Fried pickles were pretty tasty though so they got my seal of approval.

Woody&#39;s is in our neighborhood and we stopped by after a brewery to refuel. I didn&#39;t realize at the time that we had already been to the second store on Havana. Now I&#39;ve been here once before on my own and had the nuclear.  These folks ain&#39;t messin around there, so be warned.  I loved it but it did melt my face a little bit.  This time around Jess M. and I tried a honey sriracha they were offering and the garlic Parmesan.  The latter was very good initially but after a couple it became very salty.  The former was an excellent balance of sweet and heat. The wings themselves were big and meaty.  And unlike their other spot the sauces weren&#39;t overly watery.

Inside the decor is extremely basic, just a simple spot to sit and eat or pick up.  There isn&#39;t a huge amount of room.  There&#39;s a sports bar on the other half of the restaurant as well.  

The main downside is that carrots and celery is an extra add-on, not included.  I&#39;ve not seen this anywhere before and I must say I felt slightly nickle n&#39; dimed.  And I&#39;m fairly certain that the blue cheese dressing was not made in-house, which I always find to be a nice touch.

Complimentary veggies for the table. Service was ok, pretty friendly, but kinda slow."

Some of the better ones in Aurora, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;ve never come here and left disappointed. I literally have enjoyed every flavor of their wings that I have tried. Their traditional wings are always a good size and fairly meaty and the boneless are pretty dang good as well. Update, I tried the fried pickles and thought they were pretty good. Also, good fries with your order. I am a huge fan of the fact that they have a restaurant side of you want to bring the family and then a bar side if you want some adult beverages as with your food and while there is a door way in between the two sides don&#39;t bother each other. Either side you sit on your service will be great and your food will come quickly."

They have a good selection of wing sauce, not a whole lot but a good well rounded selection, not too many of those extra flavors that most people don&#39;t order. 

The lunch specials here are a good deal in my opinion, definitely try this place out. the furnishing is outdated but the wings here are good and not completely drenched in sauce (the way I like it, might be different for others)."

There are obviously satisfied customers as the place is always packed.   But, I find the over-priced small portions of ordinary wings in flimsy paper table-ware to be a real downer.  

To top it off, both times I have come to Woody&#39;s the table service was horrific.  Young ladies with horrible attitudes who treat you like you are much more a bother than business.  It was so rude it was comical.  We spent a third of our lunch time making guesses at what we must have done to offend her before she even came to the table.  

On the other hand - the gentleman at the bar was cordial, generous, and kind.  Oh, yeah, that&#39;s where your tip went, Miss."

Their mild sauce is VERY mild, so we all got medium instead which was a little spicy for me but I loved it, it had lots of vinegar which makes it a good sauce.

We tried to order at the counter like we had in the past. We were told that they are full service now and since we were dining in to grab a seat. After that it took more than five minutes to get acknowledged.  Then when we were asked if someone had helped us yet we said no and then waited another few minutes until another girl came by and finally got us our drinks. 

When we ordered the girl didn&#39;t write down our order then came back and asked what sauces we wanted. She also asked if we wanted ranch with our meal, which I requested, I like ranch with my wings. Our food took more than 20 minutes to come out, which seems a bit long for 20 wings and a corn dog. 

When our food finally came out my wife said everything looked good and I immediately noticed no ranch. No big deal, she told the waitress everything looked good, I&#39;ll just get up and ask for some. Ten minutes later, I&#39;m still waiting for ranch.  She finally notices I&#39;m still waiting for ranch and apologizes and gives me two. 

To be fair, I don&#39;t know how many tables she had other than the 4 in the dining area. If you are going to be a full service restaurant, there should be a bit more organization. We will be back in the future and I hope the service issues get addressed. Watching the waitress spill beer and talk on the phone, while she forgets about us is a unprofessional. 

I tipped  15% on a $41 bill which was generous. Had my wife not been there I would have forgotten her tip like she did my ranch."

The staff was very helpful in helping us decide which flavors to get for our family. The suggestions were great. All 5 kids and my husband left very satisfied with each having their own favorite. 

The place seemed clean and was very busy on a Sunday night. They have a full bar and a self service &#34;soda&#34; dispenser so perfect for refills.

I am still convinced that compared to a couple years ago, they changed the recipe for the Buffalo wing sauce.  Once upon a time, they tasted exactly like real Buffalo, NY wings.  Not any more. Sauce has a decent flavor, but it is missing what it once had.  (The last time we asked about whether the sauce had changed, the owners swore that it hadn&#39;t). 

The small order of curly fries was pretty meager and in a bunch of pieces as if they came from the bottom of the bag.

What bugs most is that a server and what appeared to be a manager had flip flops on--open toe and heal shoes.  Aside from a blatant health code violation, it looks pretty gross when staff who are going in and out of the kitchen are running around in almost bare feet. 

Every time we visit, we are less and less inspired to return."

I always order the chicken tenders ($8.15) and fries. The food is not too expensive, and this is one of the few places where you get a good serving of food, sometimes extra. The chicken comes with 4 tenders, but you usually get anywhere from 6-8 tenders, and lots of fries on the bottom of your tray. One time a girl even brought us free brownies.

The bathrooms deserve about a 1. They are dirty, but as long as you don&#39;t eat your dinner in there, you will be fine. 

The staff is usually very friendly, and the new people are actually very well educated about the job. 

One thing, Woody&#39;s Wings has great food and good servings/prices, but can be loud if your not seated in the bar. Screaming kids and toddlers exist in this place, but you can always ask for a better seat."

These wings are the best I have had in a long time! Goodbye Buffalo Wild Wings or Wing Stop. The flavor is amazing and the appetizers are fun and plentiful.

And have been frequenting Woody&#39;s off and on as I have moved away and eventually back to Aurora.  They have been serving wings since well before what I would call the &#34;wing craze&#34; and well through it.  Back in the day I would have given them three thumbs up if I had that many thumbs to give.  That being said as the years have rolled on and my pallet has expanded and expectations for quality food have risen, I have to say the Woody&#39;s falls depressingly short in the quality of food area.  While it is a family owned and mostly family ran (as far as I know) business I cannot give the food anything better than a barely passable grade.  The wings and most other fare is late night bar quality at best and all of which appears to be straight off the local frozen food distributer truck.  Nothing notable and mostly quite the opposite.  Service can be heart warming at times when the owner is behind the bar and down right rude at other times when certain other employees are working it.  Many occasions when coming home from a trip and stopping by for a quick to go order i would drive home only to find my order totally wrong.  Long story long, I grew up with this place and would love nothing more to give them a &#34;three thumbs up&#34; review.  But sadly too many of my recent experiences have led me to set them aside as my local go to for wings and a beer as aurora has many many other options that more than meet the expectations of quality food and warm service..."

This is the best hot wing in the state. I have gone here since I was a child. Even in my travels, I am hard pressed to find a comparable wing. Not only are the buffalo sauces amazing but the wings are gigantic and loaded with meat. 

The last decade has seen the wing chain restaurant descend on the Denver Metro Area with accompanying grossness (yes, you Buffalo Wild Wings, just nasty--especially in comparison).

Several years ago, a friend brought fried fish fillets from Woody&#39;s wings to a gathering.  They were great!!!!  Reminded me of home.  I try to keep my fried foods to a minimum which is why I hadn&#39;t been back since before they moved to their new location.  I ordered the large fish (pieces) dinner.  That was the first clue.  Their fish used to be full fillets fried in cornmeal, very traditionally southern, which is why I loved it.  Now these pieces have replaced those fillets and are prepared with what must be regular flour.  Not only did it not taste good, it has the taste of old, muddy catfish.  Further, the fish is cooked until its so dark, it looks and tastes burned.  NEVER going back."

When they first moved to their new location I was thrilled! There wings were always good (love the sauce) and they had added a nice new bar. After going there about 5-6 times it seemed like the service took a drastic turn for the worse. Every time we go in there lately there are 2 tables including us, the tables are filthy, and it seems like I&#39;m inconveniencing someone to get served."

Though it was a 30 minute wait until the wings were done, it was understandably a very busy night (Mayweather vs Canelo was on and they were SLAMMED). The service was good considering how busy they were. Most importantly, the wings were DELICIOUS! Huge, perfectly cooked on the inside, crispy on the outside, with a perfect amount of delicious sauce!

The wings ARE good - but there are much better wings other places.  For example, Piper Inn ( 2251 S Parker Rd  Denver, CO 80231) is a motorcycle bar - but the wings are STELLAR - and the service is always wonderful...

We popped in here a time or two during the 2013 Broncos season and it&#39;s not really busy or loud. You can see the large wall TV screen fairly easily near the bar. Service was good too. The bar is a separate room from the wing joint. So your food orders come from the Woody Wing joint vs their bar. Their take out is decent too. Ordering isn&#39;t professional. Everyone sounds bored or like they don&#39;t want to be there and they can&#39;t seem to figure out their own computer system half the time. But the food is ready for in 20 minutes. The atmosphere in the restaurant side of building is less then desirable. Feels like you&#39;re waiting at a public transportation location, even with the scattered TVs. That&#39;s why 9 times out of 10 we do carry out. Prices are decent. There wings and sauce is sooooooo yummy to me. Somethings they are dry if the order is ready before the designated pick up time but roll them in some sauce and you&#39;re back in business. Hubby loves loves loves their ranch. I order it in pints from this location just to get him to eat a salad at home. So I&#39;d recommend them, but taper your high expectations."

Some of the best I have had since leaving western NY (not far from Buffalo) in 1981. However, it&#39;s really chincy to charge 35 cents and more for bleu cheese or ranch dressing after you&#39;ve paid $6 for 6 wings. There isn&#39;t a &#34;genuine&#34; Buffalo wing restaurant in NY that would dare do this. Dressing is always part of the serving. And $4.15 for fried mushrooms or zucchini is ridiculous. Too pricey to make it a regular thing but again, the wings were good (honey hot buffalo sauce was good, too)."

Do Well:
1. Atmosphere- lots energy, modern feel and makes you want to order another round

2. Rooftop Bar - one of my favorite things in the world is rooftop dining or drinking and this place has a great view of the Denver skyline

3. Food - just ordered wings and fries but they were very good  

4. Extensive drink list - I did not partake (so sad) but they had a great Tap list and mixed drinks arsenal. 

5. Great happy hour - price point was low and selection decent

Things to work on:
1. Lower price point for non-happy hour - a little high but taste is pretty great. 

2. Wait staff was good but not very attentive. Needed more water and other things but good recommendations. 

If in Denver go for a pint, wings and soak in the view!"

But for a slow Saturday afternoon our service was terrible.  We sat at the bar with maybe four other people and had no attention for the first ten minutes we were there. The food was tasteless. Had eggshell in my Reuben Benedict. Fish and Chips was plain. Bonefish Grill is much better.

We started with bloody Mary&#39;s, and also shared the salmon tots- which were all decisions. Our waitress also brought us extra pickles and olives as requested.

For my entree I ordered the breakfast croissant (plus bacon) with a side of cheese grits. The grits were delicious, but sadly my croissant was awful. I did not send it back (though I really wish I had) only because the food had taken so long I did not want my guests to wait. The sandwich indicates that it comes with hollandaise and avocado. What I received was a literal jar of yellowish mayo on top of my sandwich plus a scoop of mushy guacamole. Mixed together, my sandwich was a goopy, slimy, mayo-like mess. I tried my best to wipe the excessive &#34;hollandaise&#34; and guac off my sandwich, but by that point I&#39;d lost my appetite. 

True, I could have sent it back- but I could not believe the kitchen would make, let alone serve a sandwich that covered in room temperature mayo trying to pass for hollandaise. Without the sauce and &#34;avocado&#34; I think this sandwich would&#39;ve been bomb- so I would recommend it and would try it again (sans any sauce).

Otherwise brunch was very pleasant, aside from slow-ish service."

1: Kept Amato in their name.  I believe there use to be Amato Statutory business at the same location while back.
2: many and many more seating options.  Wow..  we sat at the rooftop patio overlooking downtown.  It was nice sunny day (as usual), but kept us cool throughout the Sat lunch.
3: lots and lots of drink options.  I settled for $4 bloody Mary and it was pretty good. Will definitely try their super extensive craft beers on tap.
4: my breakfast burger with chorizo pattie and eggs was delicious.

The 5 starts are for their incredible and rare selection of beers and the knowledge of beer bartenders, especially Kevin. I came here first during GABF 14 and was blown away by the Russian rivers and other barrel aged specialties they had on tap. It was best part of my beergrimage to Denver. I came back on Oct 15 , Kevin was still there, he recognized me and again, a wonderful selection with even a Crooked Stave offering that wasn&#39;t available at the brewery.

Can&#39;t review the food much, I&#39;ve had the southwest burger, which was quite good and had a some kick to it. Also, they have late night bites. They also have open seating upstairs and a patio

The soup had popcorn in it, which you think would be a creative idea, but just doesn&#39;t tasted good. I ended up pulling the popcorn out of the soup.

I was skeptic about the burger from the start, because the waitress never asked me how I wanted my burger cooked... red flag! Anyway, the skyline burger was very underwhelming.

I would come back here again for drinks on the rooftop... and quite possibly a different meal. My fiancé did mention that she enjoyed her chicken wrap, so I will have to try that next time &amp; update my review."

I had their version of a French dip. The meat was tasteless and the aju didn&#39;t help that much. They did have good fresh gluten free buns and spring 44 gin which are big pluses in my book.

I have honestly wanted to try the Ale House for years after seeing it&#39;s awesome patio and view of Denver! 

We walked in and seated ourselves on the upstairs outdoor patio, where we had a stunning view of Denver (front and center). We were quickly brought waters and menus, but after that, our server was MIA for awhile (at least 10 minutes). Finally she showed up and took our drink and food orders. The drinks took a seemingly long time to make. We were brought our drinks and our food came out maybe 5 minutes after. I had a mixed cocktail, which was good but quite small compared to my boyfriend&#39;s (he got a different vodka drink, but mine was much smaller). 

For food, I had the blackened chicken sandwich, which was great. It had breaded avocados, pineapple, and cheese on it.. YUM! Instead of fries, I opted for the ale and cheese soup. It was alright.. The popcorn was pretty weird and not a good addition. I don&#39;t think I would get the soup again. 

Also tried the raspberry sour beer which was lovely! 

Ale House gets 3 stars for the awesome views, good blackened chicken sandwich, and tasty drinks. The service was pretty bad, though. I don&#39;t like seeing a server ignore you and do other things (like running dish racks full of glasses to the kitchen when you still haven&#39;t taken your table&#39;s drink order yet, for example). I would go back to the Ale house again to give it a second shot because the view is hard to beat."

I ordered the classic breakfast. I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese. The whole meal was cold, the eggs were still raw, and there was no cheese. I asked to waitress if I could have cooked eggs with cheese. They came out when everyone was done eating, still no cheese. Eventually got some on the side. Not only did they not comp my meal after serving me raw egg- the menu says the meal is $9 and I was charged $11.

Been here a few times and the service was Always fine so no issues there. The issue lies within the food - this is our second time back where we had to send our food back to the kitchen for the meat being undercooked. Having to do this twice is very disappointing. The cooks seem to have no idea how to prepare a meal - on top of the meat being under cooked the food was simply awful. In fact my girlfriend ordered a steak salad and when the salad came out the steak was literally raw (not pink/red) in the center and had looked like it had been sitting out for 2 hours. That went back to the kitchen and when the second came out, same thing. At this point we had given up and asked for the bill. In the end, we spent 90 bucks for some Brussels sprouts, calamari and 5-6 drinks. 

Again, the service wasn&#39;t an issue. The server was more than happy to send the food back - the issue here is the food that they are serving which certainly warrants two stars."

The upstairs deck is first come, first serve so don&#39;t waste your time trying to make reservations. If you&#39;re able to wait, please do! It&#39;s mid July and hot and we weren&#39;t hot at all. The food was ok. I had the seafood risottoV which was pretty good. It came with some shrimp and salmon I believe. The shrink was great but the salmon was a bit overlooked and dry. We all shared the nachos which were good as well but they are a little skimpy on the sauces that are on top. I would recommend adding the pork as it was delicious. Amazing selection of beers as well!! This is a great place to try for sure. Make sure you arrive a little early as parking is very difficult to find in this area."

Ale House was just delightful. My dinner date and I sat on the rooftop with a lovely few of downtown. It was a little chilly, but they had standing heaters to provide some warmth. If you&#39;re looking for rooftop seating, be aware, it&#39;s first come first serve here.

I ordered the PB &amp; J burger and it was just the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I partnered my burger with sweet potato fries which were fried to perfection. 

Loved the rooftop bar scene in Denver and can&#39;t wait to explore more during my next visit. Ale House is a five star&#39;s for sure. Next time you&#39;re in the area, definitely check this place out!"

I&#39;ve eaten here twice now, and neither time has been that great.  On my last visit, we tried the artichoke appetizer (pretty good, not too hard to mess up artichoke dip, though), and I had a burger with blue cheese.  The burger bun was soggy, as if it had been sitting out for quite some time, meat flavor was off-tasting.  I had mac &amp; cheese as my side, but really didn&#39;t like the flavor at all - I ended up passing it to my boyfriend, who ate a few bites, but also wasn&#39;t a fan.

The service was really great and the manager even stopped by our table to apologize for the long wait for our food.  Apparently our order had been lost in the shuffle.  They also comped us for some of the food, which was awesome and a very nice gesture.  This almost helped me bump my review to 4 stars, but the food quality is holding me back. 

Try this place for a beer, maybe an appetizer, but skip the main dishes."

This place is quintessential Denver with the views, brews, and modern yet laid back atmosphere.

I&#39;ve been here many times, but most recently brought a friend visiting here from Manhattan.  She fell in love with Denver just from sitting on this very rooftop!  The views are beautiful, food is good, and mixed drinks are on the stronger side.  While my friend adored the skyline views, I noticed all of the gorgeous flowers lined up along the side of the rooftop patio (I enjoyed the view too, but I&#39;m used to it!)

My only wish for this place is to allow reservations for the rooftop patio.  I understand why they can&#39;t offer that, but eating inside just doesn&#39;t quite compare to that little slice of heaven on the roof.  I&#39;ll be back... with local friends and out of town guests alike!"

We proceeded upstairs to the rooftop which has an AMAZING view and was very nice with the warm weather that night.

We literally waited 15 minutes!!!! Until someone came over and asked if someone was helping us. Their had been 2 servers who walked past us multiple times and talked to other tables, but were to much in a hurry to even ask if we needed help. 

Once we got asked if we were being helped we received waters about 4 minutes minutes after and then menus shortly after that. The waitress who helped us was very nice and friendly - just wish we could have seen her sooner.

We ordered the hummus with pita bread and the pretzels knots, which were delicious. The pretzel knots had a wonderful raspberry house jam, clear your sinuses horseradish dip, and deli mustard. I liked them all. 

My friends liked the beers. I had lemonade and the server kept those coming. 

I ordered the 50/50 PB&amp;J burger since I loved the jam. Best decision ever. I want to put PB&amp;J on everything now.

Date of Visit: Many

I&#39;ve been here a few times, and can always count on a few things: (1) Great beer list - A ton of great local crafts and unique options you can&#39;t get everywhere. (2) Solid food - Upscale bar food done well. The wings are a bit drab, but the Mile High Burger, 50/50 PB&amp;J Burger, and Breckenridge IPA Fish &amp; Chips are all great options. (3) Long waits - I&#39;ve been here with parties in sizes from 3-6, and each time there are pretty significant waits during service. You often finish a beer and your water before getting a refill order for either, so make sure to order 2! The odd part of this is I&#39;ve always sat in the area close to the service door, where most non-bar drinks are poured.

Overall Amato&#39;s is a solid upscale tavern, but needs to raise their service and timing quality to get that fourth star."

I asked the waiter to inform the manager that it took so long. The manager came out and paid for our meal. He was very nice and apologized.

Since we live on opposite ends of town it was a great place to meet halfway.  First off met the Chef Bob Moser.  He has made some great new food changes!  We had wonderful crab cakes with a fresh corn salsa, a fried green tomato and smoked bacon sandwich and fish tacos with a pineapple salsa.  Margaritas made with silver tequila, agave and fresh lime juice.  Let me just say this new chef is bringing some tasty fair to the Ale House!!!!"

I have been going here since they opened.  They always had good service at reasonable prices for tasty food and drink.  This is the first time I have been there and had such a frustrating experience.  The service was sloooow and inattentive, almost nonexistent considering it was raining and no one was sitting outside and they were not that busy.  It took 30 minutes to get our first drink and that was after having to waive down the server (we were sitting a few feet from the bar).  A simple glass of rosé now costs $11.  Pinot Grigio is also $11 (they were out of this) and Chard is $12.  That is quite expensive for one glass of mediocre wine in a pub.  The food we ordered was dry and tasteless, especially the french dip.  We had to flag down our server to order our second drink which took another 20 minutes.  We will not be returning since there are so many other fabulous places in LoHi."

Brunch, they have amazing bloody Mary&#39;s and I love the manmosa&#39;s here (Orange juice and beer). The green chilli and eggs here isn&#39;t my favorite but it was good. 

Lunch/ dinner is good but there&#39;s usually a wait. I really like the pulled pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw and Mac and cheese but everything else I&#39;ve had here has come up short. The seafood chowder is a mix of seafood that would be good if the broth it was in had any sort of creaminess or flavor to it. 

Happy hour is a good deal on drinks but that&#39;s pretty much it. They offer strange plates like jalapenos with peanut butter and bacon (I thought it sounded funny but would be good, it&#39;s not). 

Definitely go and give this restaurant a try, especially for the rooftop patio and outdoor seating in front. Be prepared for a wait during the weekend."

If you&#39;re looking for a rooftop / patio bar with a great beer selection and view of downtown, this is your place.

I cannot, however give it above 3 stars because service can suffer a bit much during busier times, such as weekend afternoons. On one occasion, my dining companion and I waited over a half hour for an appetizer that never arrived. Apparently the kitchen staff failed to tell our waitress who failed to tell us that it was out of stock. 

I&#39;ve never been disappointed by the food and beer I&#39;ve actually received though, which is why it&#39;s tough for me to only give 3 stars. 

I do recommend this establishment, but be prepared to be assertive as a patron if you&#39;re there during a relatively busy time."

The food is fantastic and until last evening we always received fantastic service. So much so that my girlfriend wanted to go to Amato&#39;s to celebrate her birthday with a small party of friends. Considering it is open seating upstairs, we were lucky to find a seating that we could manipulate to make work for our party of six on the roof. Everyone was delightful to us accept the waiters, both of whom we dealt with seemed unhappy to serve us. 

After ordering several appetizers and well over a hundred dollars in food, our waiter balked and even made a rude comment regarding how he would rather pay the bill then split our tab. We literally wrote out every order, who ordered it and what the totals would be on the back of the receipt (after he instructed us to do so), and he still took over 35 minutes to ring us out. My girlfriend, whose birthday we were celebrating, was extremely disappointed in the amount of time it took for us to be rung out. After so many great experiences, it was perhaps most disappointing that this happened to us on such a special day. We have always taken guests to Amato&#39;s for their quality food and excellent views, but we will no longer be doing so in the future."

Our group probably spent close to 2.5 hours there because things were coming out of the kitchen slowly, but we weren&#39;t in any rush, so it just made for a relaxed evening. I had the coconut crusted ahi salad which I would definitely recommend, although it didn&#39;t have a strong coconut flavor. The second time I ate here our party was in and out in 45 minutes flat. Our food came super quickly and there was hardly any waiting involved. On this visit I opted for the grilled salmon Cesar salad which was delicious.

The beer selection is pretty top notch and almost all of them are $5-6. The food is pretty decent too, especially for the price. I ordered the fish and chips and it was about as well cooked as I could want, especially for only $12. My husband had the skyline burger and, while $15 might seem like a lot, it was really worth it.

Just be sure to pay attention to the 2hr parking limit signs in that area!
The main goal was beer so we found a high top table in the bar area and it didn&#39;t take long before our super cool waitress Tera greeted us. They have an extensive seasonal beer list and she had input on most of them which really helped. Just tried to look on their website for the names of what we ordered but the beers are always rotating so its not up to date. Another bonus was that Tera offered us samples on any selections that we weren&#39;t sure of.
We also ordered the chicken wings which had a pretty good spice without being overbearing and the Sausage &amp; Cheese board which had some interesting flavors!

I can barely put together a proper English sentence, waited until late afternoon to write this, and am doing so with one eye open and a wet towel on my head.

I hate to blame AH for food poisoning, but nothing else I ate yesterday was out of the ordinary for me, and this was the only place we went to. All I had was what&#39;s pictured - the smoked portobello sandwich and a bloody mary - and man, do I feel like I&#39;ve been whacked by a ton of bricks.

I could carry on for a few more paragraphs about how wonderful I feel on this nice sunny day, but I will drop off. Were this any other place, it would be a 1-star review where I rant that I can&#39;t leave a -1. AH, you&#39;re lucky I wuv you. Still. Even after my sleepless night and churning stoma......

Shorter, very sweet) was amazing. He told us about Lingers happy hour prices and his favorites and steered us towards the best of the Breckenridge beers! He bought us a round of beer as well. As we began to get hungry he recommended a couple of foods from their menu as well as the HH menu. The mushroom pizza was awesome, and so were the wings! We sat at the bar and were in the restaurant  in the afternoon and early evening. The only complaint I have is the other bartender.  He was a tall dark haired tan man maybe in his late 20s to 30s. He had walked in for an evening bar shift. He was clearly athletic because of the way he pranced around and flexed his chest while holding his protein shake bottle and plastic containers of his meal prepped food. Made me giggle. He ignored almost everyone at the bar. Spoke to his friends whom were coworkers and that was about it. He had no interest in interacting with people at the bar, to which our previous bartender I spoke of talked to us about beers, fed us riddles, and joked with us. This bartender was a joke of a bartender. He clearly thought he was better than others, had a very shallow attitude. And had no interest in working with customers. The main reason people sit at the bar is to interact with their service more, to learn about the alcohol and more. He was the part that left a bad taste in my mouth.  No one likes to be served by someone who has an angry resting face, and doesn&#39;t care to have a personality. Looks aren&#39;t everything,  and no one likes a blank wall for a bartender. We get it, you&#39;re fit and have a deep manly voice.  For that I give 2 stars otherwise I would have given it 5. Had the male employee not also hit on me on my way to the bathroom (he was African American and had only one dangly earring for some reason) then I would have given 4.5 or 5 stars instead of 2."

Though I did not partake of any eats and can&#39;t speak to their quality or flavor profile blah blah blah, I did enjoy a locally-brewed Belgian IPA on their lovely rooftop patio with the one and only fantastic Frances G before departing Denver.

We were able to eat on the patio before the rain rain rain came pouring down for the remainder of my trip in Denver. Wahhhh

Anyway, I ordered some fancy margarita-type drink that was outstanding. I will say this for Denver--they know how to craft a drink or a beer. It was tequila and lavender and grapefruit juice and mmmm yummy. If I recall it was $10? Try it, you&#39;ll like it.

For lunch I got the Black Magic--blackened chicken breast, breaded/fried avocados, pepper jack cheese. This was a hearty meal and oh-so-delicious. I would love to know how they got those avocados fried just right--every time I try to recreate something like that, it fails miserably. It was so filling that and I couldn&#39;t finish it.

I had a bite of my brother&#39;s macaroni and cheese--and this is a real winner. It&#39;s not overpowering of any one flavor, but balances out tanginess and creaminess and umami really nicely.

There is a plethora of hot sauces and condiments to choose from to flavor your meal.
For our first visit we ordered the Special - scrambled eggs, sausage patties, hash browns, orange juice, and two large golden pancakes, and the Santa Fe Sunrise - fried potatoes, green chili with beef, scrambled eggs, and toast.
Both meals arrived less than 10 minutes after ordering. Convenient but lacking in quality. 
Total cost including tip was relatively inexpensive.

Great experience, atmosphere, simple food,   good location."

If you&#39;re looking for some straight diner food, Breakfast King is the place to go!

So far their steak and eggs are my fave. I also like their chicken friend steak and cheeseburgers. 

Service is great! The waitresses make you feel so at home and the food come real fast even when it&#39;s a full house. 

I also dig their coffee. It&#39;s not very strong but it has a good flavor to it.. Almost caramel like. 

Plus the price is right! 

Love this place. Five stars from me!"

The breakfast burritos are the size of a forearm, the country fried steak is gigantic, and when you order the sausage special you get two full size sausages. 

We came at peak time on Sunday at 11am and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. They do not take names or reservations--they call out the number they are able to seat and if your group waited the longest and fits they&#39;ll seat you. If you&#39;ve ever played Diner Dash same concept. From just watching seats as I waited, I think party of 2 is the most efficient. 

Also came on a Saturday morning and we were seated immediately and had food come out quickly. Great for a quick, hearty meal."

Please know going into a dining experience at breakfast king that this is not fancy or healthy. It is a wonderful, very flavorful breakfast that you can still feel hours later. With all of that being said, breakfast king was definitely a great experience knowing this prior to going there for breakfast.

The service was great. We went earlier in the day on a Saturday so it wasn&#39;t too busy but I could see it getting quite crowded as the morning goes on. Our server was attentive and even made sure to double check our toast (I ordered dry wheat - yes being difficult) to make sure it was what we wanted.

The food was pretty good. The hubs got a breakfast burrito smothered in green chili - definitely on the large side giving him quite a bit bang for his buck. I ordered oatmeal which was definitely warm &amp; filling. Not my fave oatmeal but I definitely take part of the blame as it probably wasn&#39;t the right thing to order here. Next time we come back I&#39;ll most likely do an omelet or something.

I would definitely recommend this place if you want a fun greasy spoon in Denver. It has its own style for sure and is much better than some of your typical breakfast chains."

For those of you that don&#39;t know it, this place is a staple for the breakfast and lunch crowd in the north downtown area. When I say staple, I don&#39;t mean healthy, I don&#39;t mean it is the BEST food you are going to have (even though it is pretty good) I mean it is great diner food that will leave nothing to be desired. I had the country fried steak breakfast, this plate was MASSIVE! Needless to say in my Tito&#39;s (vodka) state of mind, I still couldn&#39;t knock out the entire plate. My two buddies that were with me, they had the burger and the ham steak breakfast... you guess it, it left them in a food coma. The designated driver could barely even drive because he was so full. Good thing you can&#39;t get a DUI for being gluttonous, he definitely would have been over the limit!

Had the gyros plate. I was surprised how much I loved the french fries. They really stood out so much so I asked if they were cut from fresh potatoes daily like their hash browns are. My server checked and told me no.

As I was sitting in the dining room the decor had me puzzeled. About half way through my meal it dawned on me that it reminded me of the 1970&#39;s. Light colored paneling on the walls, orange chairs, booths and table tops. The free standing chairs were also orange and were a style that I have not seen for over 40 years.

So nostalgic!

It was after this that I realized walking into this restaurant was like going back in time.

The flip side to that is that recipes probably haven&#39;t changed in half a century. Portions are gargantuan and the dishes are prepared with seeming disregard for anything we have learned about healthy food in that time. I&#39;m pretty sure the veggies in the omelets are from a can and everything is pretty buttery.

The place was PACKED and a line out the door.  Felt very retro.  Service was EXCELLENT; fast and very friendly.  Unfortunately the food was so-so at best.  To be fair our favorite breakfast haunts are places like Toast, Cafe Tera Cotta etc...  Maybe our bar/expectations were too high.  

My breakfast burrito had a bite that was out of the ordinary crunchy...upon further review (spit it out in a napkin) it was eggshell :-(

Biscuits and gravy were ok, biscuits heavy and gravy average at best.  No real character to either. 

My fiancée had the corned beef (right out of the can and cooked on the mushy/runny side, not crisp at all; like they&#39;d been heated in a microwave, not in a skillet). She ordered her two eggs over-easy and they were delivered over-hard...the third strike. 

We checked the box and experienced a Denver icon but won&#39;t be returning.  Too many great options to choose from."

The other morning upon awakening I had a  craving for waffles and we decided to try it.  It was crowded and the rather surly woman at the register told us that the seating is on the honor system of first come first serve.  Looking around I saw a mass of people who were waiting for tables with no way of discerning who was first.   Fortunately I saw a couple stools at the counter in the corner and we grabbed those.  

They had some interesting variety of sausages so I ordered the alligator with my waffle.  I like alligator meat but the sausage had a very unpleasant taste.  The waffle was exactly what I expected there was nothing special about it.  The lady had the corned beef hash and again it was right in the middle of the road.  Our waitress was nice, but my first and last experience was with the woman at the front who clearly didn&#39;t want to be there. 

I had put off eating here because I thought it would be a run of the mill greasy spoon and I&#39;m not partial to them.  Enough good reviews made me give it a shot, but there&#39;s so many places to get breakfast that overall I really didn&#39;t feel that it was worth the fuss or the rudeness at the front."

The only downside was they were deep cleaning the carpet while we were there, so we had to change tables partway through to accommodate for that. However, it&#39;s a 24 hour place, so I understand they have to do it sometime and it&#39;s not their fault we came in then."

Route 66 is famous for many things but primarily for its abundance of roadside diners.  Breakfast King reminds me of those diners in so many ways.  Breakfast the way you want it whenever you want it.  Some lunch offerings too but I&#39;ve never strayed from some variety or another of breakfast.  If you&#39;re looking for vegan, gluten free, &#34;health&#34; food, you are in the wrong place.

If, on the other hand, you are looking for large, slightly greasy portions of classic diner fare served in a kitschy atmosphere by pretty well &#34;seasoned&#34; (but usually funny and always efficient) waitresses in 1950&#39;s style uniform attire - this is your place.  I have no idea how many times I&#39;ve nursed a hangover successfully here over the last several decades but it&#39;s a lot.  Stick to the basics and you&#39;ll be fine.  I usually have eggs soft scrambled smothered in surprisingly tasty green chile, hashed browns, bacon crisp (or sausage of which they have some &#34;exotic&#34; variations) and a short stack of pancakes and waddle out fortified to face the world.

There&#39;s something about the lighting at night, the vinyl booths, the waitresses... that feels familiar like only childhood memories can. 

The coffee is diner coffee, light and the type that I have to drink with cream and sugar. 

The plates are greasy in a delicious way.

The waitresses are sassy in their motherly way.

And they serve breakfast 24 hours a day.

I had a hankering for breakfast for dinner this week so Sir Nicholas took me here to satisfy that craving. I had an order of pancakes that were just what the baby ordered and a side of crispy bacon. Be aware that you have to go here wanting to eat food that is not good for you. Blueberries in a pancake are frozen. A side of fruit is canned pineapples/pears/peaches. Breakfast burritos are the size of Qdoba&#39;s dinner burrito and smothered in cheese and green or red chile.  Put all that aside and focus on indulging in food that is bad for your gut and good for your soul.

I usually order the pancakes or biscuit and gravy to go, and I will still have plenty of ham left over.

When your server comes to take your order, stand up and yell, &#34;I want your GREASE ON ME, IN ME AND COMIN OUTTA ME!!!&#34;  They will give you your meal for half price if you yell it loud enough.

I can only come here every few months or so because I&#39;d be dead if I ate this way every day.  But if you had a good week of healthy living and eating and just want to get a little crazy, this place is awesome.  I get eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, country potatoes AND... onion rings.  That&#39;s right.  And coffee and OJ and water.

And then I go home and read the newspaper, if you know what I mean.

So this place has great diner food and you always wonder about the servers.  I don&#39;t wish bad fortune on anyone, but maybe I secretly hope for pure novelty that their lives are filled with drugs and jail time and stuff like that.  Just to enhance my own personal experience.  I also kind of wish they smoked cigarettes while they serve.  My personal rule is that if I have a pregnant server at a diner, I tip and extra $20 bucks.  

I&#39;m kidding about the above paragraph.  I tip everyone the same.  Pregnant or not.

Just kidding again.

The only thing I don&#39;t like about this place is that there&#39;s not a lot of walking space.  I know what you&#39;re thinking:  &#34;Mark, did you come to Breakfast King to walk, or eat?!?!&#34;.  

Allow me to explain.  The tables are low and very close to each other and the aisles are big enough for only 1.5 people to walk side by side.  This means that butts and groins are constantly in your FACE, close to your food on the table, etc.  And a lot of the people eating there are old, sometimes unkept and sometimes it seems that their clothes were worn the previous day, too, which means dirty groin and butt area right there in your face.  RIGHT when you are eating your breakfast.  I am a creative person and so I have to really try hard not to visualize what&#39;s on the other side of that dirty denim.  So disgusting.  Because who showers and then puts on yesterday&#39;s clothes.  

For that reason, I suggest you eat at the bar, where this will not happen."

Late-Night craving for the world&#39;s best Hash Browns (Crispy, please)  with awesome Chili  (NOT GREEN CHILI!  Newsflash:  Breakfast King has some impressively passable Beef Chili, too!  A tad Spicy with just enough Bean Paste in it and ground beef.  Yes, Please.)  Throw it on top of a side of Hash Browns and enjoy the madness.  You&#39;re welcome.

Got a sweet tooth?  For less than $5, their French Toast fills the plate and the palette!  (Heh.  See what I did there?  Get it?? Get it??)  It&#39;s crusty and golden and I don&#39;t even mind the fake syrup.  Beat that!

Oh, and let me TELL you about their English Muffins!  Perfectly toasted and tons-o-jellies on the table to slather!  Done!


Oh, Breakfast King.  Thank you for staying open all night, in all your Bright Orange Vinyl Splendor, with your Diner Fare and People Watching.  Thank you for being near work for those Late Nights.  Thank you for being reasonable distance from downtown for THOSE &#34;Other&#34; Late Nights.

Not only is it The Breakfast King, but (now that I work nearby) they whip out great, classic lunches: their Rueben beats the crap out of pricier versions available at hipper-than-thou establishments like Steuben&#39;s or (insert name of some other joint that charges $12 or more for a sandwich), their burgers are good and greasy, and every soup-of-the-day I&#39;ve had has been delicious.

The servers wear old-school white uniforms. That&#39;s pretty neat. A plethora of menu items, usually common for a place that&#39;s open 24 hours.

Many Yelpers reviewed this place and praised the breakfast burrito (with ham, egg, potatoes, etc.) that&#39;s smothered in green chili. Guess that was an easy choice. At $8.95 and generously sized, it was a pretty sweet deal. 

Yup, that&#39;s one damn good burrito. Panda-dancing good. The best part was the smothering green chili; it had a noticeable kick that I hadn&#39;t previously seen in other green chili concoctions. Also, big praise for the perfectly cooked potatoes. The exterior had an amazing browned crispiness that I wish all browned potatoes had. The ham lacked that mouth-watering smokiness I crave, but still left me a happy panda. No question, I&#39;d get this again.

The coffee ($1.75) was pretty watery, mostly a lifeless, darkened cup of coffee essence. It&#39;s also very lukewarm, not fresh-piping hot. Would they allow me to zap the coffee in the microwave or something just so I can torch my taste buds? At least unlimited refills is a positive. I don&#39;t believe pedestrian coffee is a death blow for a diner/dive joint.

Overall, it&#39;s still a good place for that breakfast burrito. Unsure what else I&#39;d get here, but hopefully it would be just as satisfying!"

I am spoiled from eating east coast Chinese most of my life and I much prefer the flavor of the BBQ pork to the seemingly chopped up pork chop thrown in as most places do. 

I have been coming to this location for years now.  It&#39;s a great stop on the way back from the Airport and really easy to get to.  My only issue with them now really isn&#39;t their fault.  A pot shop opened next door to them and unfortunately it permeates into their location.

Yes, the staff&#39;s attitude does vary, unfortunately, however, they have some delicious appetizers, entrees, and the dessert is eh... Not so much. The grab cheese wontons are exquisite and creamy, the sesame chicken is so crunchy, saucy and gourmet. The egg drop soup is nice and hot and makes a perfect appetizer idea. The vegetable dish is also fantastic and mouth watering. The dessert is alright but not highly recommended. The place itself is wholesome Chinese food and you won&#39;t regret eating there!"

If you&#39;re looking for a late night meal I suggest you call first. You might be able to order take out if they are closing.

My favorite part of the day with the creamy egg drop soup super yummy in my tummy.

I was looking to try something new for lunch and so I did a quick Google search and found this place. The food is good - not excellent, but good. However, the pricing is what really blows the deal away. 

The lunch special includes a huge tray of food, large slot filled with meat, two smaller slots filled with your choice of side. Along with that, you get crab cheese Rangoon and veggie egg roll, all for an awesome $6.50 (before tax). When was the last time you had a meal so large, you couldn&#39;t finish it for $6.50? I also got a &#34;small&#34; order of soup for $1.50, but don&#39;t let that word fool you: it was probably about 16 fluid ounces of soup. For some, that could have been the meal.

I ordered the sesame chicken, as it is a favorite of mine and a common order at Chinese restaurants. Cooked to perfection, crispy, not overcooked. Sauce was a tad bit sweet, but it wasn&#39;t a deal breaker. 

Overall, an excellent deal. I am very happy and would highly recommend eating here for a cheap, tasty meal. I would not, however, recommend this as a formal dinner. As I said, the food is good, but not excellent, and the inside of the restaurant looks a little dark and damp. Best to order to-go from this place."

The menu is pretty typical for Chinese food, but they will sub sauce for you or keep an item out. They are also great about adjusting spice. 
What keeps them from a 5 star rating for me is the following: dumplings skin is way way too thick. It&#39;s gross in the wonton soup. The sesame chicken is both white and dark meat, pick one. The mooshu once had a tiny bone chip in it...cracked my tooth. Not their fault per se, but speaks to quality of ground pork."

Hence I&#39;ll write my review in this &#34;slot&#34;, which was first reviewed in 2009 with the rest of the Yelpers who had reviewed this establishment.  Was here with one of my gurl fren, on TUESDAY February 21st 2012.  

First note to self, make sure if to dine out on a TUESDAY, check all the possibilities of all the restaurants, I am eyeing, to dine out especially at this part of neighborhood to be open.  Tsai Shen Garden came to our rescue coz after running errands all the way from the other part of the neighborhood aka WEST AREA and need to be in this area.  We called in, and asked TSAI SHEN GARDEN if they are OPEN.  Thankfully they are.

When we arrived for this LATE LATE LUNCH, time was : 15:15hrs ish.  Another good note, we arrived just in time for their LUNCH HOUR cut off, which was 3:30pm.  If I am not mistaken, there are like another patron dining in.

Since both of us were &#34;starving&#34; and from the brief &#34;glance&#34; of the menu, these was what I ordered :

*  Szechuan Beef ($6.25)
*  Bomber Combination (to go for Hubs) (Chef&#39;s Specials $6.95)

My friend ordered Kung Pao Three Delight ($6.95)

My order came in with, Egg Roll, and Crabmeat Cheese Wonton, and I opt for Egg Drop Soup and Fried Rice.  The Egg Roll and Crabmeat  Cheese Wonton, came out hot, crispy, a good sign, since I dont like stuffs cold or soaggy.  Another good note, if I could recall properly, we were given complimentary tea for our lunch.  My main entree of Szechuan Beef was A-OK, though I so wish it could be more spicy.

All in all, its an OK Lunch though I bet my friend bet to differ from her glowing review.  For the LUNCH price you get, its DEFINITELY a STEAL DEAL!  As with regards to flavor, its just OK for my taste bud.  Dont mind returning, when needed if I am in this part of the neighborhood.

The Bomber Combination comes with Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with a Spicy Sauce and Vegetables.  Also from the Hubs&#39; feedback, he likes the order of his Bomber Combination, the flavor was just right and has a &#34;unique&#34; taste in which until now I am trying to figure well.  Oh well.  But when I had the Bomber Combination to go, I think the Kitchen staff forgot or perhaps its &#34;their&#34; practice NOT to include any kind of soup for that pricing.  No big deal, but just want to give a heads-up.

The service was prompt, inviting and we got our food freshly cooked, hot and fast.  While having our late lunch, there are many more patrons came in to dine in.  We left Tsai Shen Garden about 16:05hrs ish.

This place is very consistent.  Flavors are always good, the food always gets here quicker than the time frame quoted on the phone and the staff is very friendly.

Lately, I have been on more of a health food kick and have been eating their steamed veggies and tofu dish.  It comes with a ginger sauce that is pretty darn good!  The veggies are always fresh and well prepared.  The only con is they don&#39;t offer brown rice.  White rice or fried rice only.

For those of you that are in for the night but think you can&#39;t get healthy food delivered to you, think again!  This is a fantastic option for those of you that don&#39;t want to suck down sugar filled sauces and piles of meat.  

For those of you that aren&#39;t watching your waistlines, I recommend their Mongolian Triple Delight.  It&#39;s a combo of beef, chicken and shrimp in a very savory yet sweet sauce.  Their crab cheese wontons are also delicious!

Which ever way your diet takes you, Tsai Shen Garden is a great option for everyone in your group to get something to their liking.  I&#39;d recommend this place to anyone in their delivery range."

So ya, I whipped out the phone and typed &#34;chinese restaurant&#34; in the area. 

Tsai shen popped up, and we decided to just go for it as we were really too hungry to think or do any more research. I did call just to make sure they&#39;re open for biz (of cos!).(There was another chinese restaurant that came up but it said &#39;american chinese&#39; cuisine, and we wanted authentic chinese food, so we decided to go for this one)

We were pleasantly surprised to find the food very good. On top of that, hot chinese tea was served complimentary! Nice. The lunch came with a freshly deep-fried crunchy spring roll and a crab cheese wonton, both of which tasted great. And mind you, I had many spring rolls before, and some I would just not eat after one bite because they just taste icky. Oh yea, came with a soup too, and you even get to choose which soup you want (out of 3 options). And yes, I was even impressed with the soup - had fresh ingredients (springy tofu), something I normally wldn&#39;t think twice abt.

Plus: The food was GREAT.  The Singapore noodles had generous portions of shrimp and chicken, and overstuffed the box.  The scallion pancake was crispy but not greasy.  The crispy chicken was... crispy, but not greasy, with large pieces of white meat.  The garlic shrimp was okay, with that weird assortment of criss-cross vegetables that accompany some Chinese dishes.  The prices were reasonable -- even the seafood dish came in at less than $10 -- and we got our money&#39;s worth (none of that &#34;food in half the container and shredded lettuce in the other&#34; nonsense). 

Minus:  Not surprisingly, delivery time on the busiest night of the week, at the busiest time, ran to almost two hours versus the promised 60-80 minutes.  

Minus-That-Turned-Into-a-Plus:  Before I&#39;d even had a chance to say anything, the delivery driver already had a cash discount in hand to apologize for the delay.  When we called the restaurant to let them know how good the food was (and how the wait was worth it), they were gracious and apologetic and invited us to the restaurant where they&#39;d shower us with freebies.

All in all, we&#39;re happy we&#39;ve found a great Chinese restaurant in Aurora, and we&#39;ll be coming back soon."

Stopping in for a quick slice recently, though, the place seemed different. Run down. Dirty. My pizza slice was mostly bread. Everything, from the floors to the drink dispenser is dirty. There was some violent movie on the tv and I had to get up and move to the far corner of the room to try to avoid the sounds of shooting while waiting for my slice. When it did arrive, it wasn&#39;t very appealing and had very little toppings. I ate a few bites and scrambled out of there.

I ordered the Hawaiian slice. It was full of Canadian bacon and pineapple. It was delicious and the crust was crisp. It was like a perfect NY style gaint slice.

First off, my order arrived relatively quickly which I was pleased with.  However, my driver couldn&#39;t seem to understand the building number, gate code, or building code I explicitly put in the order instructions.  She asked if I could just &#34;come to her,&#34; even though she couldn&#39;t tell me exactly where she was.  I&#39;ve ordered from other local resturants where I needed no extra instructions for my food to arrive at my door.  The fact that I had to leave my home and walk further than my vehicle was parked made me wish I had saved the delivery fee and tip.  

Secondly, cinnamon knots I ordered were severely burnt.  The bottom was completely blackened and rock hard.  The cinnamon knots fused to the paper and was not edible by any stretch.  Very disappointing for my first order.  

I ordered a small Hawaiian pizza which was OK.  No major complaints, especially for the price.  Also a Taco pizza that was not what I expected in a bad way.  The pizza came with unshredded chunks of salad lettuce.  I expected the type of lettuce one would get on a typical taco which was not the case.  I&#39;ve had taco pizza in the past, this was the worst.  It was either poorly or hastily prepared which showed.  Not sure if I&#39;ll order from here again."

It&#39;s hard to mess pizza up, but I have to say I was pretty let down.  The pictures just didn&#39;t look like our pizza at all.  Sparse on the toppings and cheese...  tasted like your run of the mill frozen pizza.  Super bland crust.  The only thing holding it back from 1 star, is the cheesy bread we ordered.  The cheesy bread was awesome.  If only they put that kind of cheese on the pizza.  All in all, not a fan.  Especially for the price (About 21 bucks for a xl or xxl I can&#39;t rember which size.  It looked like an XL.).  It definitely does not warrant the cost.  I&#39;ll eat it again, if it&#39;s free, and our boss orders... otherwise, I&#39;ll pass.

First the pizza: crust was perfectly done, just enough to have a crunch, but slightly chewy. The toppings were fresh, generous and bright. Honestly, this pizza was &#34;advertisement quality&#34;.

The mini-calzone. If that&#39;s a mini I&#39;m scared to try the regular (although I will have to now). It was only a 3 topping calzone, but it was packed! 

Both the pizza crust and the calzone crust  were infused with just enough oregano to enrich the flavor but not overwhelm.

Would rather find a great small shop pizza joint rather than a big chain like papa johns to get pizza delivered from. They had a great online ordering deal for 2 medium pizzas for $10! So how could we pass it up? Well. We should have. I had no issues placing our order. Received a confirmation email time stamped for 7:28pm. At 8:40 I called to get an eta on our pizzas since it had been over an hour. I was reassured by the person I spoke to that the driver was on his way &amp; he was going to give him a call to see where he was. 25 mins later - still no pizza. We called again asking for a manager. The cashier on the phone told us he &#39;couldn&#39;t find her&#39;. He couldn&#39;t even find our order! They had no idea what we ordered &amp; nobody could clearly answer questions. We told them to cancel the order completely (luckily we hadn&#39;t paid yet). 10 mins after we get off the phone the delivery guy shows up. We explained what happened &amp; that we wouldn&#39;t be taking the pizzas. He explained NOBODY had called him - not for an eta. Not to let him know we cancelled. 
If after an hour a customer calls because they still haven&#39;t received their order - you should be doing what you can to figure out what&#39;s happened &amp; possibly offer a discount or incentive to come back again. If after the second call I can&#39;t even get a manager on the phone &amp; you have no idea about my order - then I have no interest in trying to support your business."

We also ordered the jalapeño cheesy bread and it was on point. The jalapeños were fresh and gave the bread a nice bite. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more things on the menu.

I am sad to write this, but I can&#39;t let my old review stand. 

I don&#39;t know what happened. Maybe the Yelp and Eat24 deals caused their margins to shrink, but this is not the pizza I fell in love with. I&#39;ve ordered consistently for years and tasted the pizza change slowly. After TWO disappointing pizzas in a row, I am compelled to do a new review. 

It&#39;s veggies and meat with a bit of sauce on an okay crust. If I wanted that, I would order from Papa John&#39;s (::shudder::). The extra cheese I always order was heavy on some parts and almost non-existent on others. The veggies were fresh and crisp. They weren&#39;t cheap with the meat, either. It just didn&#39;t taste like a good pizza should taste. 

Just to be sure I wasn&#39;t wrong, I compared this last pizza to a slice of leftover pizza. This old slice was from a new place from which I ordered the night before. Exact same ingredients. Mama O&#39;s LOST...big time. From appearance to the taste/texture of the crust alone. No more orders from me."

The size and price are competitive and worth every cent. Normally these go around $10, ma ma has them for $7 for the premium calzone. They are $6 normally with 3 toppings. 

If I am in the area I won&#39;t hesitate to buy again with or without a coupon deal. The calzones are just not the best but they sure beat the price and generous portion."

First, we were thinking we would send her some flowers. But nah, flowers are for the basics. We wanted to make our girl feel super-san special on her birthday, so that&#39;s when we decided pizza would be the gift that would make her heart sing (with palpitations induced by cholesterol and high blood pressure). Pizza will never leave you. Pizza is eternal.

So we ordered pizza, breadsticks, and a pint of vanilla ice cream online and made a note for them to spell out &#39;26&#39; (she says she&#39;s forever 21) with the extra pepperoni we added to &#39;za. 

Before they delivered the pie to her apt, the delivery man gave me a call to double check her location. I kindly asked (forcibly demanded) him to wish her a &#39;happy birthday&#39; and he made my heart melt when he replied with, &#34;Of course!&#34;

It gets better. When she received her order and sent us a picture--after, of course, properly blasting it on all the major social media networks--we were happily surprised: they added the extra pepperoni, but made the number &#39;26&#39; out of breadsticks!!! And wrote &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; on the inside of the box!!! And gave her extra sauce!!!! 

THANK YOU Ma Ma Olivia for making us look like the most awesome friends ever and for making her feel special on her big day. You guys went above and beyond the call of duty and made so many people happy!"

We decide to dine in.

Hubs order was LARGE 14&#34; with 4 toppings of Black Olives, Jalapenos, Green Peppers and Steak.  The LARGE 14&#34; was $10.  Each LARGE Toppings cost were $1, and with all the 4 toppings, it was like $14.

My order was the MEDIUM 12&#34; with 3 toppings of Steak, Jalapenos and Pineapple.  The MEDIUM 12&#34; was $8 with all the 3 toppings, each cost were $0.75 hence, my Main Entrée Pizza was $2.25 + $8 = $10.25

Hubs also ordered the Mini Calzones which was $2.99.

I also ordered the Spicy BBQ Chicken Wings - 6 Wings were $5.

If I am NOT mistaken there are other flavors that comes with the Chicken Wings on the Main Menu Board, but NOT on the Paper Menu, that we read.

Hubs liked his order of Pizza and Calzone.  Hubs had half of his order at this establishment, while he opt to have the Calzone at home.  For me, I opt to have like 2 slices of my Pizza order, and like 2 pieces of the Chicken Wings order dining in.  The rest I take my time to eat them.

I like my order of Chicken Wings with Spicy BBQ Sauce and my order of Pizza.  The pizza that we ordered were the thin ones.  Just the kind I like my Pizza, THIN CRUST.  All the ingredients were fresh.

Its $33 well spent indeed.
 
In this establishment, you can have your Pizza or food order, dine in, TO GO or for delivery.  In the establishment alone, they can seat like about 10 people at one seating.  All in all, 4 SOLID STARS and we Definitely Do not mind returning when needed.

Can&#39;t find it.  I&#39;m not sure what kind of ordering system they use, but they asked what my total was to track it (most ask for a phone number, name, or address)?

I gave them a 3 because I though it was a nice little pizza joint that was pretty small inside but the food came out quick and was fairly cheap. The wings were better than Pizza Hut and the calzone, which was 3 toppings for $6, was more than filling enough and last me 2 meals. 

I closed my initial review out like this &#34;Will definitely be ordering from here again. Very good food at a good price. They get docked spot because there is hardly a place to sit inside purely a delivery/takeout joint.&#34; 

Well fast forward 2 years and I have finally made my way back. They have expanded the inside so there are plenty of places to sit. It was a mad house in there though, they had ingredients out in the front where you order and it was pretty clustered. I got the Hawaiian Deluxe pizza and pepperoni pizza rolls. The pizza was on point but the pizza rolls were kind of a let down. Overall, based on food, they would get a 4 but the set up, clutter, and the fact that they told me 15 min and I had to wait closer to 30 for my food was upsetting. I will give them another shot based on my first experience but hopefully they give me a good reason to keep coming back because I really want to like this place."

My personal go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni and my girlfriend does the personal pizza with chicken and olives; we&#39;ve never had a bad slice, each is always covered in toppings, smothered in cheese and cooked perfectly on a great dough (which makes an amazing crust). The delivery is always quick (besides one weird experience) and the phone service is always pleasant which is always nice.

Tucked away near Hobby Lobby, you&#39;ll find the unassuming storefront of Ma Ma Olivia&#39;s.  I had a tough time locating it in the maze of parking lots over here, so look for Hobby Lobby and go toward the north side of the same building.  Boom!

Teeny tiny little place, but packing a big punch.  I tried a Hawaiian calzone (for the tough price of just under $7 or so, my whole bill came to just under $8 with a small soda) and was totally in love.  The crust is fabulous:  baked perfectly and seasoned well.  They could probably just give me crust and I&#39;d be happy with it.  But oh, the cheese plus the ham and pineapple was super tasty.  The calzone was big but I managed to eat the whole thing because it was that good.  Pizzas, pasta, salads, wings, and the like, everyone at my table enjoyed the gamut of food to be found here.  Not to mention single slices as big as your head.

That slice is as big as a whole small pie! Jumbo slice = $4 and it&#39;s huge! I had a regular slice with sausage and jalapenos and a salad and it was less than $5? Did you add that right? Alrighty then, no keep it that&#39;s fine. The regular slice is big too and was plenty for lunch for me. If you like to go all man vs food with pizza, by all means order two jumbos.  : )
I saw the lines over here when I was eating at the Pho 888 that&#39;s in the same parking lot and knew I wanted to check them out. There was a lot of pizza talk on the talk threads a bit ago and that triggered my pizza tunnel vision/target fixation. I&#39;m so glad the Eastsiders lunch crew decided on this spot.

I really try to save some for lunch the next day, but both times the pizza has failed to make it past midnight. If it&#39;s not eaten at dinner, I usually sleepwalk to the fridge and finish it in the middle of the night. Our first time there, we took a reviewer&#39;s suggestion and ordered the garlic knots.

We dined in on a Saturday afternoon and the service was lackluster. The guy behind the counter was uninspired and looked less than thrilled to be working. The delivery drivers take up three tables in the dining room talking shop about their deliveries. Everyone here from employees to customers just looked sketch. 

The pizza was very bland and reminded me of Pizza Hut buffet pizza. The taco pizza we ordered was also very far from being tremendous. It was sausage pizza with salsa mixed in with onion and green peppers. What?!

I ordered boneless wings and one wing came half-raw and I had to spit it out in the napkin at my table. 

If you think this place looks promising I advise you to look elsewhere. I wouldn&#39;t return here if the meal was free."

I found them one day while looking for delivery since I was too lazy to cook dinner. :) I ordered a calzone and it was pretty good. So I decided to try them again. Still great. Then one day I decided to go in person since I was nearby. Well let me tell you, don&#39;t go in person. I haven&#39;t ordered since. First off it&#39;s in a kinda off area. You go inside and it&#39;s brightly lit the employees are friendly. Some of the customers there made me uncomfortable (due to their loudness and what not). Not their fault I get it. But here&#39;s the part that sucked so I ordered and sat down. Well the whole dinning area stunk. It smelled like someone just dumped cleaning products out all over the place. Cool you&#39;re clean but the smell of chemicals was intoxicating. Then my salad was old. I mean mushy not just a few pieces here and there. So I was baffled since they always give me a great salad. My calzone was delicious as usual. I just don&#39;t order from them anymore because I can&#39;t stop thinking about the bad salad and the chemical smells. I know kind of silly but it just left that kind of impression. Maybe in a few months will order through grubhub but definitely not dinning in there again."

First of all the marinara had no salt. None. I can cook tinned tomatoes myself. I ordered pizza rolls with pepperoni, calzone (chicken, spinach, red peppers), &amp; cheesecake. 
The cheesecake did not mention flavors at all, it came smashed and with a red swirl on top. Basically Sam&#39;s Club cheesecake, ick. The pizza rolls shouldn&#39;t be called pizza if you have to pay for one topping, however, they were OK. Now for the biggest disappointment of the night, the calzone. Calzone is supposed to have ricotta and mozzarella otherwise it&#39;d be stromboli. Not a sign of ricotta anywhere. The filling was packed in one log and had a flat crust 3&#34; around. The crust was seasoned well, but that marinara ick. 
Basically everything I got was food service products made elsewhere and thrown together in dough they may or may not have made. 
Hugely disappointing. Not re-ordering and I do not recommend if you&#39;ve ever had American Italian outside of Denver (it&#39;s not our strong point). Even Sabarro seasons their sauce. If there is a Mama O, she either lost her sense of smell or is horrified. 2 stars because I didn&#39;t get sick, just bummed that I was duped by reviews by mistaken people."

Crust is medium thick, cheese and toppings are fresh and plentiful. There are always yelp deals lurking around.

Tip: if you think the pizza is too greasy, dab it with napkins first to reduce some of the guilt and self-hate. Bill Nye the Science Guy says this actually does help to reduce some of the fat intake :D

Nice diner, kinda feels like a Mel&#39;s.  We got a chocolate malt (sooooo good, but went down way too easily), husband got pork chops and I got the cobb salad.

The pork chops were pretty bland, so we had to ask for a side of country gravy, which helped a little (apparently the country gravy isn&#39;t very salty either, which I guess can be good, right?).  The brown gravy on his mashed potatoes was more flavorful.  

My cobb salad was pretty impressive looking!  The chicken and the bacon were a little dry though.  

Tables next to us ordered country fried steak, pizza, and breakfast scrambles and all those looked amazing!  Huge portions and they all looked pretty appetizing.  We would definitely come back again."

I now understand the other reviews that mentioned terrible service - this waitress was easily the worst service I&#39;ve had at a restaurant in awhile. She was slow to take our order and then we waited insanely long for our food to come out. The appetizer we ordered was delivered cold and about 5 minutes before our main food would come out. Our waitress simply said, &#34;I didn&#39;t know if you wanted it beforehand.&#34; The food was also the worst we&#39;ve experienced here. It was clear it had been seating for a bit. And then as if our server hadn&#39;t made us wait enough already, when she dropped off the check - we put our payment out promptly as she was nowhere to be found for a good 15 minutes. That combined with what happened earlier, we got fed up.

     This place is a great alternative to overpriced crappy airport food. The service was spot on and the staff were very friendly.

&#39;No thank you, I&#39;m not comfortable at the counter.&#39; I am extremely  tall and can&#39;t sit at counters easily.

Plenty of parking. The interior needs maintenance with sticky tables that cry out for sanding, stain and a clear coat. Booths have duct tape sealing up the holes. Nice decorations for Halloween. 

We decided to stop for breakfast before our flight. Decide on your order quick as food takes a while.  Probably because the short order cook needs extra time to overcook the food.

My grilled cheese was great but the accompanying hashbrowns that were ordered crispy arrived black. The replacements weren&#39;t any better as they were very dry and had no flavor.

The scrambled eggs were poor and more like ribbon pieces;  my brother wouldn&#39;t eat them after the first taste. Sausage was good and the over easy eggs were good. Pancakes were okay but a little on they dry side. They were also out of orange juice. 

Rita, our server, was excellent.

I ordered the banana bread french toast, which was soggy. The hash browns weren&#39;t cooked, and my side of ham was both tiny and dried out. Husband ordered the Moonlight Classic, and asked for crispy hash browns and eggs over medium. What arrived were undercooked hash browns and eggs that were not only broken, but cooked &#34;hard&#34;.

Guess I scanned the description of this breakfast too fast as it contained no meat. Just toast (pancakes optional), two eggs, and hash browns.

Kinda hard to review this place from what I ordered as the eggs and hash browns were exactly the same as any other diner. The toast however was thicker and more flavorful than expected and buttered just right. Unfortunatly the eggs were easy though I ordered over medium. 

My waitress acted as if she would rather be doing anything else but working here, which killed the warm friendly 50&#39;s atmosphere other yelpers mentioned...unless she was really into character and was playing the grumpy old wise crackin&#39; diner waitress...but that is doubtful.

They have all the staples of a classic greasy spoon, and they do those staples well. I came here with a group a few weeks ago, and most of us ordered some iteration of eggs, sausage/bacon, hash browns, and pancakes, including myself. I thought my meal was solid - everything was cooked exactly how I would expect it, but it wasn&#39;t anything special. A couple people in my party ordered egg white omelettes and didn&#39;t like them very much. They were very watery (like, sitting in a puddle of water) and did not look good to me at all. That said, the regular eggs were delicious and I would order my meal again if I ever came back.

The service was... just okay. I understand that it&#39;s difficult to serve a large group of people, but 20 minutes just to get a cup of coffee is tough, especially first thing in the morning!

The food: my daughter ordered the enormous Big Island Bird sandwich. I totally recommend this!  It&#39;s a big fried chicken breast all decked out with ham, pineapple, gooey Swiss cheese, and Teriyaki sauce.  My husband ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap, which was very spicy and delicious. He also had a cup of green chili, which was too salty but was otherwise fantastic, and an excellent chocolate shake.

Unfortunately, my fish and chips were not good.  The fish wasn&#39;t cooked long enough and they didn&#39;t salt it after frying, so it was chewy, flavorless, and kind of greasy.  The cole slaw was pretty terrible too.  Great fries though, although they have cheap generic ketchup on the tables."

It was good for one night but I would have chosen something different for a second night if I had an option.  Not bad though.

We were starving following our flight and didn&#39;t want to pay airport prices, unfortunately the prices were a little inflated here as well.

Located among apartment buildings and next to a hotel, it is a classic looking diner: Tables were populated by airport workers and from the moment we came in I knew we were going to leave happy.

The portions were huge, the food all homemade and the staff was super friendly. We at so much at 10am that we did not eat again until 7--and then not much.

We had breakfast, and it was clear that the pancakes were from a homemade batter. If you can eat them without syrup then its good batter. Excellent!

The eggs were very fresh tasting and I had Chorizo (Mexican sausage). Both were outstanding. Home made hash browns, and good coffee.  Everything was perfect.

I can not recommend this place more. (THANKS to other yelp-ers for helping us find this gem)."

Walking in I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect the incredibly slick signage made be fear  this might end up being a super boring wannabe diner. I waited a moment for a waitress and she seated me immediately. There were only 2 servers on and they just traded off taking every other table. I sat on the smaller side of the diner, without the bar. 

She slid me a sticky fading menu with various items blacked out with sharpie. This wasn&#39;t encouraging. There was a separate drink menu on the table and I saw they had a bloody mary and with a mix I had never heard of. Settled on that. Choosing this to drink also sort of set the stage for what I was going to eat.

A Meatloaf entree was on the menu, and in my mind that would go well with a Bloody Mary. 

My drink and meal came out at the same time, and I didn&#39;t get my salad. The plate had two massive slabs of meatloaf that had green peppers and onion dispersed throughout it and a tomato ketchup cover. The mashed potatoes were real, even had some chunks and the skin in it. The veggies were your standard frozen mish mash, but they had been sauteed in bacon fat and served with a piece of bacon cut up in the serving. There was a nice fluffy biscuit that was cut in half and toasted for me. A few minutes into the meal the waitress brought out the most impressive side salad I&#39;ve ever received. The salad had tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, fresh mushrooms, dark greens,  

The bloody mary was nice and spicy, very peppery. Though it was lacking the customary celery stalk, I did like the green olives it came garnished with. 

I finished my meal with the Fab coffee, which was a hot coffee with all sorts of booze poured in it and topped with whipped cream. Perfect. I thoroughly believe you cannot go to a diner and not have something with whipped cream."

I didn&#39;t eat dinner...so, I arrived in the morning hungry and ordered the handmade chicken fried steak.  The small portion is huge, but that&#39;s it.  The hash browns were not cooked all the way.  The eggs were over cooked.  The coating would not stay on the greasy (as in a pool of grease) steak.  Gravy lacked flavor, and overall the meal sucked.

Good customer service, fun diner atmosphere...doubt any of the food is much better."

We complained and the manager was very nice and took care of it! Sadly, we came back about a week later and the same rude lady was there, and she shouted very loudly &#34;LET ME GET SOMEONE ELSE TO SERVE YOU.&#34; Probably will have to find somewhere else so go now, she ruins it.

After spending the last few days moving to a new home we were craving some good old American breakfast food. The menu has a great selection of all the classics. I went for the Chicken Fried Steak, that came with hash browns, eggs and a side of toast or pancakes. I picked pancakes - light and fluffy, just dense enough to know they were the real deal. My wife had the Kitchen Sink - a heaping portion of goodness, topped with green chile. We both took home leftovers and enjoyed them the next day.

Don&#39;t deny it, you remember.   Anywho, that&#39;s what I felt like after eating the biscuits and gravy here.  I&#39;d picked up some friends from the airport and we had an hour to kill while waiting for our next friend to arrive, so thought we&#39;d get a tiny nosh.

Ended up eating like pigs and loving every minute of it.  We started with chips and salsa.  The chips were warm and came in a variety of fashion colors.  Salsa was great.  The ladies split a giant quesadilla.  They asked for it to be beef and chicken, meaning one half put some chicken in and the other half put some beer, but they just mixed it all in together.  No matter, it was great.

My aforementioned biscuits and gravy were like a disconnected telephone because they were OFF THE HOOK!  Coffee was great, service was nice and for some reason there were a lot of good looking people there (not just us!).

If you&#39;re out in that vast wasteland where the DIA resides, this is your oasis in the desert, baby.

I tried several different dishes, from breakfast burritos to tamales. All of which fell significantly short. It was nice however to see them make the food in front of me. The salsas were just blahh. There was no kick to any of it, and I tried it all. The carne asada was pretty bland as well. So my search for delicious mexican food continues, yet again!"

But it&#39;s priced like a fancy place.  $12 for a burrito and coke (Mexican imported).

I love dumpy spots and staff who can&#39;t speak English and tables you self-bus with Auto Trader, and a parking lot full of sink holes.  No chips, salsa, silverwear and I had to retrieve and open my own Coke.  I&#39;ll do all that when the burrito is $5 or 6.  But this lunch tab was on par with some of Denver&#39;s more polished Mex eateries.  

Shit for $12 you get shot at banging the cliff diver at Casa Bonita.  I&#39;d eat there again, but it&#39;s not worthy of the current Yelp ranking in terms of value for the money."

The most authentic mexican food I&#39;ve been blessed enough to taste while living in CO thus far. I&#39;m from southern NM and am on a mission to find food that is similar to what I miss oh so much-- this place nailed it. 

Ordered the green/red enchiladas which came with chips/salsa, rice, and beans. Super delicious, enough said. I could literally drink the salsa that the chips came with. 

I would give it a 4.75 if possible because it took a while to get our food---but it was made fresh right in front of my face, so it&#39;s excusable in my opinion! 

It&#39;s a &#34;walk up and order&#34; style restaurant and is definitely a whole in the wall (oh boy, always such hidden gems) Saw that they sell $2.00 breakfast burritos---sweet deal! If you&#39;re a fan of authentic mexican food, I&#39;d definitely make your way at this little place."

As a result, the aromas filling this small spot are completely off the charts.  The menu is a bit disorienting, but the food is spot on scrumptious.  A steal at $1.59 each, La California&#39;s breakfast burritos huge vessels of breakfast glory, packing eggs, beans, salsa, cheese, potatoes, and your choice of meat into a ginormous flour tortilla. This is my new go-to spot when I need a big and cheap breakfast.  

The chicken is billed as the headliner at this establishment that touts authentic pollo asado estilo Sinaloan.  I must say, dig into the dark meat as the white meat tends run on the dry side.

Not to be overlooked and possibly the champion on this menu is La California&#39;s carnitas.  These chunks of fatty, deep fried goodness are juicy, tender and bursting with flavor.  You can eat these as an entree plate or you can burrito-ify it.  While the squeamish might hesitate at all of the giggly parts, those of us who are culinary thrill seekers will love the added flavor and recognize that fat is where it&#39;s at."

Largest, most complex, tastiest tortas I&#39;ve ever eaten, and I&#39;ve torta-tized the western half of the US.

Menudo AND Posole available. Terrific.

Pollo entero and medio, amazing crispy skin, more food than one can safely consume.

All meals prepared inches away in the open kitchen, and the fresh carnitas are borne right outside the door.

Volumes of killer Northern Mexican eats for pennies.

And on the day I saw a mural being painted on the outside of the building, I knew I was going to have to try La California. Last Saturday and one of the first days of being opened, I walked in after a ride and was completely surprised by the interior renovation. It is clean and bright and the kitchen is up front for you to observe the preparation of your meal; there is also a panderia offering fresh pan dulces. 

And what do we all like best about a new business besides tasty food? The new owners and staff, of course! I was thrilled to be greeted by the wife and given a &#34;tour&#34; of their meal offerings: Chilirio (a great looking stew), soups, chilies, meats for tacos, salsas. Next week the barbecue is going to be installed for Rico pollo. She said that I should first try their torta and I went with the suggestion; pollo flavored. This alone earned a star as I like being given suggestions by the owner.

And Oh, what a great tasting monster sized torta this was. YUM!!!! Perfectly seasoned chicken, slabs of avocado, great tasting beans, the whole thing was mouth watering and only $5.50. AND it really was the size of two normal sandwiches. 

Let&#39;s hope the economy is kind to this business because I would like to see it succeed so I can keep going back and actually get to taste some of those soups, tacos, and stews."

The place is right on the corner, parking lot is small, and there was construction in front, so I almost missed it.  I did find 2 bones in my chicken tamale.  The place is very small (2 tables inside, with a few counter seats) and it seemed pretty clean and smelled good.  My tamales were from the frig and microwaved.

I recommend the dark meat, which was juicy and scrumptious. The white meat was a bit dry, (as white meat often is).

They have a good takeout family meal for $25: two whole pollos asados with beans and rice in large quantities. There might be a liter of soda in there too,  not sure.

I shared the skin and &#34;sogs&#34; (wiggly, jiggly parts that are slimy going down) with my faithful pups, who give this place a rating of 4 paws on the counter plus a spirited howl for good measure.

It&#39;s a local bar in Edgewater, who would have thought out server would have been so attentive? Almost overly attentive; I was too indecisive for as often as she came to check on us!

The food was half and half. It was either amazing or just okay. The wedge salad had almost no bacon. Like, I was insulted by how little bacon was on it. It tried to make up by having a crap ton of dressing, but bacon is way more important. The boyfriend&#39;s burger was delicious. French fries and onion rings, perfectly crispy. I&#39;ll skip the salad starter next time. It&#39;s a bar, why did I have high hopes for that anyway?

Service was a bit on the slow side, but friendly. I just wasn&#39;t blown away by the food here. The burger patty was clearly from-frozen and nearly every topping has a .95 (or more) charge to it. My $6 burger easily turned into a $10 burger with no fries. Split a basket of onion rings with the BF and they were okay.

Providence Tavern is along the main strip of commerce on 25th. Lots of older buildings and quiet neighborhoods made it pretty idyllic. Perfect for a summer stroll, followed by a late night meal.

Kitchen stays open until 10 pm on weeknights and that&#39;s a good thing since the food is pretty much what one would expect at a spot like with a mahogany wood decor: simple, classic, delicious.

I recommend that buffalo chicken club sandwich with a side of fries. A spicy take on the OG sandwich. And you know I&#39;m getting a side of ranch to squelch the flames in my mouth. That and a &#34;salty dog&#34; cocktail, which is really a greyhound with a salt rim.

We sat on the patio in the covered area. The weather was perfect and we even caught our Texans on TV! The waitress we had was mediocre but the brunch food made up for it.

We started with chips and salsa., which were alright. Being from Texas you realize salsa is different everywhere else. Too sweet for me, tasted more like tomato/ketchup sauce.

-too orange for my liking, I like the orange to be faint. But they add pineapple juice so I could easily drink bottomless of the juice. 

I had the fried pigs in a blanket. yes, That&#39;s right. It was heavenly. Drizzled a berry sauce over the fried dough and dipped in maple syrup. I highly recommend if you want sweet and savory!!

Others at the table had the pork eggs Benedict which was served with potatoes. The pork had great flavor! 

The breakfast burrito was a schmorgus board- highly suggest it for hungry men.

I like a luxardo cherry and an orange peel as garnish, but definitely not muddled in the drink. But the waitress cheerfully replaced our bad drinks with tasty beers. They have a good selection but were out of like 4 of the 12 menu options. My food was just OK. I got a grilled cheese sandwich that was supposed to have habanero cheese on it. I expected a more generous serving of cheese in general (I think grilled cheese and I want to see cheese oozing out of the sandie) but this had maybe 2 slices of cheese, one of which looked like boring plain ol&#39; American. And the &#39;habanero&#39; cheese had no spice. Maybe my palate is just too accustomed to spice, but I felt the sandwich was bland and uninspired. BF loved his buffalo chicken though."

The bar was nearly empty when we walked in, but started filling up.  Lea (please forgive if I spelled it incorrectly) was wonderful.  She served us with a brilliant smile and great attitude.  

The atmosphere is rustic.  The floors are old hardwood, and then brick in the back.  It is very clean, but embodies Old West charm.  They have an interesting cocktail menu (I will order just about anything with cucumber-infused vodka), along with a great local beer selection.  We started with pot stickers.  They were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside, flavorful on the inside, and paired with a nice thick sauce.  I had a hard time choosing what to order.  They offer salads, tacos, and burgers, primarily.  I selected the pork tacos.  I was not disappointed.  The plating was nice - three tacos with hominy salsa and a salad.  It was more than enough, and I took leftovers home.  The pork was perfectly seasoned and tender.  Paired with caramelized onions, and it was lovely.  

I will definitely return.

PS - I do not generally like leftovers, but enjoyed my pork tacos so much I thought I&#39;d heat them up for breakfast next day.  Still amazing."

After receiving notoriety via WestWord, Providence Tavern has seen an uptick in business and publicity! 

Seemingly rising to the occasion, PT serves up a delicious brunch with a bunch of great options. My girlfriend absolutely loves their Pork Tostada Bowl, and I have to admit that even as a frequent vegetarian, this dish has me jones&#39;n to cheat. While I try to hold back my temptation, I ordered the truffle grilled cheese sandwich which is rich, gooey, and one-of-a-kind. This sourdough grilled cheese is served with an over easy egg and hollandaise on top with tomato compote and bacon (if you so choose) on the inside. PT&#39;s brunch is coupled with FANTASTIC drink prices ($5 bloodies, $4 manmosa, $8 bottomless mimosas) and service worth noting. 

The only thing keeping PT from 5 stars from me is front of house hospitality. I have had 2 incidents come up here where a member of the front of house (not my server) was rude. I&#39;ll be back on account of my previous comments to see if they can squeeze that 5th star from me."

First, our waitress, although nice, was running around like a crazy person and seemed quite flustered - The manager clearly didn&#39;t staff appropriately for that day.  

Second, the brunch menu had apparently been updated, but no new menus were printed.  The first 5 things we ordered were no longer available.  If you change a menu you should time it better with the printer or take the initiative to go to Office Max in the meantime.  Management 101.

Third comes the food review.  We ordered a few items to share:  pigs in a blanket (delicious but deep fried like a churro), hummus with veggies (no complaints here), and for my meal the Caesar salad with blackened seared tuna (tasty, but....)...

I&#39;ve had the worst stomach cramps since eating there - all afternoon Sunday, took a full sick day Monday, and still feeling it Tuesday.  Everything I read online points to the tuna or leafy salad greens.  I&#39;m hoping that it was true tuna and not escolar &#34;snake mackerel&#34; - having to pay $5 extra, I can&#39;t really say what they are serving.

Our bartender with short dark hair made highly offensive and passive aggressive comments about us to the patrons next to us multiple times, assuming we were too oblivious to hear. She was also extremely rude to an elderly woman who came into the bar a bit confused while we were present. We eventually paid our tab and left (no tip as none was deserved) only to be chased out of the bar and screamed at as we walked down the street.

Fast forward an hour later to another bar down the street from Providence Tavern. We were enjoying a pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff only to spot that crazy dark haired bartender talking shit about us to our new bartenders at this new bar. Yes. She followed us to the next bar. 

I don&#39;t care where you&#39;re from, but it&#39;s well known that tips are optional based on quality service. This rude psychotic woman deserved nothing and chose to threaten us based on a false sense of entitlement to a tip after treating us like dirt. I hope she finds peace in life and I hope you all steer clear of this terrible bar. Cheers."

But something has changed in the last year.  While the burgers are still pretty good, they are using a cheaper beer batter for the rings so they have a weird flavor and are a little soggy.  To top it all off, those perfect Moscow Mules now have a cheap vodka in &#39;em, and you have to pay extra for a decent vodka to be used.  The servers clearly know that the MM&#39;s aren&#39;t as good, because they actually say, &#34;Is it ok with the [cheap vodka]?&#34;

We still give it the occasional try, but are usually disappointed."

The kitchen also stays open a little later than the surrounding restaurants, so it was nice getting a bite to eat here after a long evening of unpacking boxes. The service is slow, but friendly. It was packed on the weeknight we came in, so understandable. 

I had the southwestern cobb salad, which was great and not drowning in dressing and bacon! They serve it with avocado dressing on the side, roasted peppers, and the same pork adovada my husband had in his torta. Now that I think about it, it&#39;s...not really a cobb salad at all. Still tasty though."

I thought that I would bring them to Providence Tavern for dinner, and try it once again, in hopes... that my experience would improve from 2 months ago. A new oppotunity to see improvement RIGHT....

Wrong....it went from a bad B.L.T X 2 dinners at the same table, You couldn&#39;t even see the bacon nor taste it on the sandwich. They charged us for two orders of onion rings when only 1 order was given to us. 

One of the other people at the other people at our our table, was also very disappointed with her pork sandwich, and would not want to come back, she said that it was very dry and bland.

The only person that ordered a hamburger ...loved the burger....

I guess one out of 4... isn&#39;t too bad...RIGHT

Well it gets better....or rather takes a nose dive..... the manager comes out to talk to the gentleman who ask to talk to him at our table concerning his....experience....not mine....
The manager looses his temper...and proceeds to blame me and yells out at me stating that I&#39;m  no longer welcome because I wrote a negative review on yelp....from 2 months ago....and didn&#39;t understand why I would come in the resturant anymore...This manager...totaliy tried to humilate me in front of everyone at my table..

 Well... my answer would have been to give Providence Tavern another opportunity to improve on my last visit....but he didn&#39;t giving me a chance to say it, because he wanted to prove that he was right and I was wrong!! He&#39;s reason for the poor ....quality...was his bottom-line...on food costs....not a great excuse in my business, nor any other business.

The excellant food quality, and the warm fuzzy feelings of the really nice management....has changed from a totally amazing and great neighborhood tavern, to a very average to below average pub. 

My suggestion to the owner is to re-evaluate your management during the evening shift; and your portion control and budget on a sandwich.....it was a joke of a portion, just ask your server, I she saw the size of the portion,,,  

In the future I also...will look for a place to eat.... I will look for another place that will accomidate my food sensitivities...without humiliating me in front of everyone in my party and other customers. I will not be spending my money, nor suggest that others spend their money at this establishment ever again!!.

They have tasty grub, excellent vibe, killer cocktails and great service. Plus they are located near a bunch of fun spots in and around Edgewater, so you can make a day of it! I haven&#39;t actually been at night, but hear it gets fairly busy. I recommend off hours, but that is my recommendation for almost anywhere as it is my lifestyle.  
 
They have a rad happy hour and a great menu. It helps to create or diminish your hangover depending on where you are in life at the time. The service has always been super cool and the energy always comfortable and welcoming. Even when it is busy, it is chill and comfy!

They have some fun specialty cocktail options, some tasty micro brews on tap and I have always been super happy with my drinks. The food is fab and priced reasonably. The clientele is usually a nice mix for people watching and they are located in a friendly neighborhood with ample street parking. I can dig it!"

Smack in the middle of the mighty Edgewater, the ProvTav is a skip and a hop from the corner of Sloan&#39;s Lake.  Greeted almost immediately as we sat down at the bar, menus were provided while our drink order was taken.  Quickly followed by appetizer plates and drinks.  The menu is relatively standard fare for a bar and grill; sandwiches, burgers, salads, some fried goodness.  They do know how to correctly temp a burger and for that I must applaud the chef.  Our party of four had three burgers, each with a different temperature request and I have to say that they did that perfectly.  Reasonable prices and not &#34;too much&#34; food also are positive qualities on display at the ProvTav.  The interior has a calming feel done up in mostly wood textures and there&#39;s an extensive patio out back.  Overall I&#39;d say check this place out next time you are in the area."

Pros:
- Awesome outdoor patio when it is nice out
- Trivia Tuesdays are a blast
- Good cocktails (Huckleberry Lemonade is my favorite)
- Good happy hour snacks and burgers
- Fun bar atmosphere 

Cons:
- Pretty standard menu (haven&#39;t had much other than the burger)
- Service is consistently sub-par"

They have a decent selection of craft beer and seem to keep things rotating which is always nice. They also have a variety of unique mixed drinks, I tried a pear mojito here once and it was really tasty. 

The service is generally attentive and for the most part everyone is very friendly. 

All the food I&#39;ve had here has been good but the burgers are where it&#39;s at! $4.95 will get you a basic burger (+ lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles) and cheese, fries, etc are a la carte. Still a great deal, especially when you consider that they get their beef from local farmers. I&#39;ve yet to order from their brunch menu but it sounds fantastic and any place that offers bottomless mimosas for $8 has my heart. I have no doubt that I&#39;ll be in to try it soon!"

The bacon I had added to this beauty was arranged perfectly in corn rows, possibly exposing a chef with OCD as a handicap. Poor fella.

Bottomless mimosas, interesting menu items, DELICIOUS bloody mary&#39;s(I think the use a cucumber vodka- so that&#39;s different). Bring your dog, sit outside, load up on Bloodies, and absolutely try the pulled pork Benedict. You&#39;re bound to have an unforgettable time."

My fiancée and I have slogged our way through quite a few mediocre meals at this place because of the convenient location and good beer selection. I can deal with subpar service and lackluster cuisine, however, when it is apparent that all parties employed by the Providence are lazy and completely incompetent, I have to put my hoof down!  One such instance is when we accidentally stumbled upon their childlike attempt at a brunch menu. While reviewing the ten unappetizing options, I asked the server if I could simply have a B.L.T.  They had all items required on their brunch menu and they serve it on their lunch menu. The server refused to accommodate me. Additionally, my friend asked if he could have his hot wings tossed in the buffalo sauce instead of on the side which is their standard way of serving them. They refused him as well. These seem to me to be two completely reasonable requests. Moreover, these are just two issues out of about twenty.

Me and my roommates and my cousin and my uncle and my dad all popped in one night to watch the first night of Thursday Night Football! We had a seat out on the back patio, and other than a leaky roof during a rainstorm we really enjoyed ourselves. Server was stellar (though she thought we stiffed her, when my dad paid and put $0 for tip, intending to make the rest of us pay the tip in cash -- whoops!) and the food was pretty great too. The tacos were a TOUCH dry, but enough hot sauce and my mouth was none the wiser.

The part that I really enjoyed was the sizeable beer list. Much better than I expected for a kind of tucked out of the way place in Edgewater.

Another great little piece of the experience was the helpfulness of both our server and the manager -- it was cold, we asked him to turn a fan off -- he did immediately. Also without being asked he turned the volume on for the TVs on the patio so everyone could hear the sound for the game -- really dug that, nice touch.

Not only was the serving staff unprepared, dismissive, crass and drunk.. A party of 10 was quite literally turned away to accommodate one newly arrived guest.. I understand that every guest is important , yet shooing away the bulk of the business at the time was not the best managerial decision.. I suggest in the future that home teams and large parties that arrived far in advance garner the available media, this is simply a suggestion and in no way reflects your establishment in general, yet this most recent Sunday experience has soured a group of forgiving patrons that know the difficulty and challenge of running a successful restaurant..
Good luck in the future.."

Overall cool place, very laid back vibe. I had the burger and it was good. Fresh meat and veggies.

The onion rings were almost burnt. Maybe they like them well done.

Our server was nice but slow on the refills. It was very slow so I don&#39;t think it was because she was too busy. Never like have to ask for refills.

Not bad at all but nothing special."

Providence Tavern has great bar food, and a good beer selection. The staff is very friendly and they were able to seat us, being a party of 6, without any problems. I recommend it highly for those who want to watch the game at a friendly bar."
