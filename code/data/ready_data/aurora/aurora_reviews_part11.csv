The real Denver Nuggets are a must have. The burger. Must have. 

The drink list -yum. And ask for recommendations because the staff knows what&#39;s up.

She is very familiar with the place and goes quite often, so I was stoked when she said that is where we would be celebrating her birthday. 

The place is quite small but they manage to fit a lot of people inside.  We wanted to be on the patio, but there was a private party already taking over the whole outside so we were seated right by the front door. 

The table shared the Denver nuggets and the chips and dip.  Both were absolutely delicious. I really liked the dill sauce that came with the nuggets. It was the perfect amount of tangy. Brian went with the Meadowlark burger. That thing was HUGE! Oozing with cheddar sauce. It almost took over the burger, there was so much.  He said it was amazing and I don&#39;t doubt it.  It looked phenomenal. I went with the BLT.  The best part about it was that it came loaded with candied bacon. When I say loaded, I mean loaded!  Fantastic food and drinks! The service was even better.  I felt like we were family.  The whole table was well taken care of, always refilling waters and cocktails. What a great place! I will be back for sure!"

-Chips and Dip
-Mushroom and Kale
-Denver Nuggets
-Burger
-Cobb Salad
-Caprese Pasta

The take on the apps - loved the chips and dip - kind of a mess to mix it all together but it worked. The chips were crispy, could have stood be warm in my opinion.

The Nuggets were &#34;ok&#34;... Dark meat, they were thighs so not my fave.

Mushroom and Kale thing was delicious - messy again and could have used a side of bread to sop up the liquid in the bottom of the bowl. 

Burger - everything your MD would tell you to avoid. Extremely decadent. Topped with a fried egg and a generous amount of a brie like bechamel. 

Cobb Salad - loved the butter lettuce. Could have used a little more veg in this - actually really glad it didn&#39;t come with bacon, unless it was on there and I didn&#39;t notice?

Caprese Pasta - I didn&#39;t try this, but lots of tomatoes and basil cream sauce with fried burrata, enough said.


I wish there were more healthy/vegetarian/vegan options available. 


The patio had colorful strung Christmas lights everywhere and reminded me of a tiki bar vibe.


Cool joint, would come back if running around at the breweries again."

We had the brisket, which was tender and flavorful, and the burger, which was the same. There was some green chile-like flavor to the burger that I was in love with, and the cheese sauce should be smothered on everything. We thought the onions rings were better than the fries, but we liked the house made ketchup. The honey mustard is also house made, but a little too horseradish-y for us."

You&#39;re going to find a sort of casual hipness in every part of this restaurant. For starters, if you don&#39;t pay attention when you&#39;re walking by, you might miss the entrance; look for a door with a red &#39;M&#39; on it. There are seating options inside or outside; both are intimate, but the outdoor patio offers some more space (and has heating!) 

The servers are attentive without being intrusive (much appreciated) and will give their honest opinion about the dishes. Which brings us to the most important bit... the food. 

Even if you ignored everything i just said, the food is a good enough reason to go out to Meadowlark. Two dishes that I&#39;d like to highlight are the seasonal pasta and Meadowlark Burger. These probably seem like simple enough menu items and not things that you would necessarily seek out, but here&#39;s my advice: seek these out. 

Both of these dishes are special because of how the individual components are crafted. The burger has a melty cheddar sauce that binds the other ingredients together in flavor.  Not an easy task when those ingredients are candied bacon, poached egg, jalepno confit, AND (yes - and -) an onion ring. But something magical happens when these all come together and you get the Meadowlark Burger. Use whatever adjective you want for &#34;delicious,&#34; this is it. 

And then there&#39;s the seasonal pasta. It doesn&#39;t matter when you go, just go. My first Meadowlark pasta experience was a caprese version. The person I was eating with ordered the pasta  (I got the brisket which was also wonderful) but I ended up eating at least half of it when it came. The fried burrata mozzarella was the highlight here, marrying fresh tomatoes and creamy basil sauce.

Just go.."

It is a small unassuming storefront to the point we drove by it the first time.  We knew we were close so we parked and started walking.  The signage was more readily apparent not in a car and we walked in to a mostly empty restaurant.  It was a touch after 5 when we arrived and by the time we left the place was packed.  And for good reason.

The brisket and catfish caught our eye so we decided to order both and split.  The catfish was seasoned perfectly with a nice crunchy, but chewier coating than I am used to (it is also a gluten free blend).  The fingerling potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly to compliment the spicy tabasco sauce that was smeared under them.  And as a final garnish, there was a very mild, very lightly seasoned slaw.

And then we tried the brisket.  Holy amazing this was.  Our waiter had explained that it was dry rubbed and cured for a few days and then smoked in house for something like 9 hours.  The first bite I took was the perfect balance of smoke to fat to pure essence of beef flavor.  With brisket, I just don&#39;t believe there is any other way to eat it than full fat.  The layer of fat had moments of crispy perfection which literally melted in your mouth.  Combine with a high quality meat and the perfect smokey essence, and both my friend and I were in heaven.  The brisket was so good in fact that we each ordered an additional order to take home to our husbands.  Thankfully this dish is a constant on their menu unlike the catfish which is seasonal."

Now on to the food portion of which I&#39;m excited about. I shared the popular Denver Nuggets with Adam D. He was more thrilled with this than me. I on the other hand was pleased but was more in tuned with my entree the Colorado Lamb. This was my favorite of the night. Never mind that the lamb was super tender. It also was seasoned perfectly and wasn&#39;t boring looking. Plated beautifully and yet casually unpretentious. 

This is where the ambience matches the above entree. It&#39;s casual from the start. The sign that welcomed us outside was delightful. The happy chatter from the bar occasionally punctuated by a robust laughter was very inviting. Casual but mind you the brains running this place wants you to feel relaxed and welcomed to enjoy their lovely dishes.

That soup. Potato Soup. Was one of the best. I am still thinking of going back for the soup alone. Simply garnished with fried potato and a wedge of that crispy waffle fry. It was so creamy and tasted perfect. 

Outstanding service from a very amiable gentleman staff! Way to go!

The way they charge you is pretty damn sketch though. All their beers on menu are 6 or 7 flat, and all items were flat dollar amounts, but we were charged 9.62 for a beer (not including tax/tip). Then again hey, maybe I&#39;m wrong and that&#39;s the actual price the restaurant charges for that particular beer.

The burger was actually pretty good, I will admit, although kind of hard to eat in the way it was stacked. We ordered brussels sprouts on the side, and they were straight up weird. They weren&#39;t even cooked - just hard and raw brussels sprouts. I think they were lightly boiled and then covered in a sauce, but something about it just wasn&#39;t right.

It has been 3 nights since I came into Meadowlark and I cannot stop thinking about it. I was visiting Denver alone, and this was the one treat-yourself meal I allowed myself. I sat at the bar and was poured a very generous glass of their cabernet. I ordered the lamb (pictured) and holy moly was it incredible ($32). I also got to know the bartender, Billy, who was super friendly and went to the kitchen to ask questions for me about the dish. As you can see, it is rare, beautiful, and served over an incredible fried avocado. The green is a mint-pea puree, as well as a mint-yogurt puree. Just delicious. There are no listed desserts on the menu, but Billy convinced me to keep the enjoyment going and brought me a decadent and airy berry pastry with champagne gelatin. 

I&#39;m back in California and all I can think about is that meal in it&#39;s entirety. Meadowlark is a lovely place with a casual, hip vibe and warmly-lit atmosphere. The individuals behind the bar, in the kitchen are talented and kind. I&#39;ll be back the next time I&#39;m in Denver!"

Janet D. has been hard at work making reservations for restaurants that are difficult to book a table with.  One of them was Meadowlark in the artsy district, where the hipsters roam the streets.  The restaurant was full of them including the staff.  Very cool atmosphere with positive vibes.  It&#39;s a small place with a few tables in the house front and a covered patio in the back segregated by the main bar in the middle.  

We ordered several items that were popular including the Denver Nuggets, which were served with dill sauce, spicy mustard and delicious pickles.  They were delicious, made with real chicken thighs fried to perfection.  We also had the Potato Soup, which was amazing and probably one of the best ever, super creamy and full of flavor with a touch of cheddar.  The fried potatoes and waffle fries that garnished the soup were very thoughtful, the soup was all about the potato.  For our entrees we had the Mascarpone Ravioli and the Colorado Lamb.  The ravioli was splendid with a unique preparation, mostly dry without the usually overwhelming marinara.  I didn&#39;t like it, I loved it.  I had a taste of my wife&#39;s lamb and it was super tender.  We also had a couple of tasty drinks to wash down the tasty entrees with, the Whiskey Smash and the Smoked Margarita.  As far as service, it was phenomenal, our server was friendly and professional.  

The decor was super cool and reflected the neighborhood&#39;s artistic theme with art hanging throughout.  Lots of earthy materials used throughout, setting a relaxed mood.   I really enjoyed this place and will return to try the rest of the enticing menu."

Parking is essentially just street parking, which didn&#39;t look too bad actually. I&#39;m sure it can be difficult during really busy times tho.

The entrance is not really obvious, and the place next door has a different kind of decor so to speak. Thankfully they had a sign out on the sidewalk saying that&#39;s where they were located. The interior is not very large, but I believe there was seating in the back of the restaurant as well. Dim lighting, fun ambiance, good music and service. 

The menu is very small. Was able to try quite a few things on the menu, all of which were really good. The smoked brisket was a little on the dry side for me, but I was a big fan of the denver nuggets, artichoke dip and colorado lamb. I&#39;m also not particularly a fan of mushrooms, but the wild mushrooms were surprisingly delicious. 

Overall, great food, great service! Definitely check this place out when you&#39;re in Denver."

We came here for dinner, bellied up to the bar and were greeted by extremely friendly bar staff.  I made straight for the drink list to get down and dirty.  The smoked margarita was my first choice.  Dayum.  Then I ventured towards the Pioneer.  Amazing.  Then I sipped on whatever Jess ordered.  She slapped me for stealing but it was worth it.  In the end I went back to the smoked margarita. Which tells you how good it is.

The food:  Their menu is small and seasonal which to me has always been the sign of a good restaurant.  I hemmed and hawed and struggled between the lamb and the seasonal mushroom ravioli, which I finally decided upon as the lamb is regular fare.  If you come here and they are offering this, get it.  It was delicious.  Portion size was good, not too much food but not so small that you feel ripped off.  Prices were great for the quality.

The decor is awesome, play the game and try to guess who&#39;s on the wall.  Really the only downside to Meadowlark is that it&#39;s extremely small, and the tables are next to the door so if it&#39;s winter you&#39;ll get a blast of cold air anytime the door opens.

I truly cant wait to come back here, the food and the service were excellent.

This is my 3rd time back to my favorite restaurant in Denver. Came back and brought a vegetarian friend for some girl talk. We ended up ordering the chips and dip for appetizer. The portion size is always so good. The dip was delicious per usual.

This time I decided to order the BLT because everyone has been raving about it. I am so glad I did. It doesn&#39;t seem like it will be that filling when they bring it out to you, but after having the chips and dip, I got so full just eating half the sandwich. It comes with a delicious sauce on it and wonderful tomatoes. The BACON! Oh that BACON, is to die for. It is what made the burger when I was there the last time. They stack that bacon ON triple thick. And it&#39;s candied so it gives you a sweet bit to the savoriness of everything else.

My friend got the asparagus salad. I had a bite of it and it was delicious. The nuts add a unique taste to the salad. And the presentation of the dressing inside the grilled avocado is just gorgeous. Everything is very appealing to the eyes and tastebuds. 

The service was decent this time. My smoked margarita was ok. Normally it knocks my socks off. I know that Meadowlark is still new so this review won&#39;t lower my 5 star rating.

It is my goal to try everything on their menu. And you should too."

Everything in here is a beautiful delicious masterpiece. Billy is always there when we come in and he&#39;s so friendly and accommodating. I first tried and fell in love with brussel sprouts here. Also my first stop in Denver. Cozy, quaint little spot. The brussel sprout caesar salad rocked my foodie world. They were crunchy and crispy and delightful. The homemade croutons are also a nice touch. Also shared the dark meat chicken nuggets with sauces. Nice presentation. I&#39;m not a dark meat person, but they are good.

Second time here, first eating choice after landing in Denver. Had the burger with egg and I don&#39;t know what the sauce was they out on it but holy moly it was effing heavenly. The fries accompanied with a house made dijon mustard that was the best gosh durn mustard I eva had. My boyfriend has requested we make a stop here to eat before departing back to Tejas.

It&#39;s so good that at 4.5 stars, it&#39;s still vastly underrated. I&#39;ll tell you why. 

First, the menu. Represented is everything from serious veggies (Brussels sprouts) to playful &#34;kidult&#34; foods (Denver Nuggets) to the BEST ARTICHOKE DIP EVER. People, it has burrata and fried &#39;chokes in a creamy, soup-like bowl of goodness that makes my eyes roll back in my head. It&#39;s like edible art, and I can&#39;t believe it. The burger goes without saying. It&#39;s huge, decadent, messy, amazing. Recently I tried a mushroom and mascarpone ravioli, which was killer. I just adore the range: low-brow, high-brow, all extremely well-executed. 

Second, it&#39;s reasonably priced, especially because the quality is so surprisingly high. 

Third, great drinks. The Smoked Margarita is tops. Drink one. 

Last, great service and ambiance. Staff are hipstery but not aloof or unwelcoming. Atmosphere is cool, but not try-hard. They play great music, too. 

I&#39;m hard-pressed to think of a restaurant in Denver I like much more than Meadowlark. Sure, there are fancier places, more conceptual places, scenier places. But do I LIKE them as much as Meadowlark? Nah."

We only had two things...the Artichoke Dip and the Denver Nuggets. The nuggets were surprisingly delicious. But the Artichoke Dip......let me try to find the words.
Beautiful. 
Perfectly textured.
Let&#39;s the artichoke be the star of the show but with quite the supporting cast!!!
It was the kind of dish that prevents you from having a conversation while you eat. Or if you are talking, you&#39;re talking about the dish and nothing else. 
Here&#39;s the tragic news....this is the kind of place where they change the menu so the artichoke dip is only on the menu for the next few weeks. 

Enjoy it while you can!!!!!
We will be back very soon."

It is a hip, casual, gourmet take on comfort foods. The reviews are stellar as you can see so we definitely went in with some high expectations mind you. For how busy the small joint was, the service was quite good, attentive and courteous. We ordered a couple of their scratch-made cocktails, that are not cheap and were impressed with everything we had in the libation department.

We ordered the brussel sprouts that had a ton of potential in the flavor department but were sadly, not cooked. They were overly crunch and raw in the middle, despite a nice char on the outside. The flavors developed on the plate were incredible however. It was essentially brussels two ways: they were presented in halves (the undercooked pieces) as well as the loose leaves. The sauce to go with it all was delicious.

I had the reportedly nationwide famous cheeseburger. It was pretty incredible actually. You do have to be willing to have a messy meal though. It comes drenched in a creamy cheese sauce that is delicious. My wife had the same thing except as a gluten free iteration without the bun. My only complaint is we had a stomach ache afterwards but probably because we generally don&#39;t eat such rich foods. All in all, I would go back to try other menu items. The burger was good enough to ignore the shortcomings of the sprouts. 

Other complaint: hardly any GF options."

I was hankering for a hamburger late-night after coming back from a concert at Red Rocks. It was 12:06 am so options were limited, but meadowlark stuck out for its good reviews and perfect location near where I was staying in the RiNo district. There&#39;s a sign out front that says the best burger in Denver so I was hopeful. 
The location itself is cool - and I mean the definition of cool. Everyone there whether an employee or a patron had a breezy vibe about them and a definite stylistic point of view. The music was loud and bass-heavy. Because it was late night the selection was mostly small plates but I ordered the burger and waffle fries to go. The burger came with an onion ring, bacon, cheese sauce, and poached egg on a brioche. The sauce and egg were packaged separately so things didn&#39;t get wet and soggy during my quick walk home. 
The waffle fries were awesome. Hit the spot. Not too greasy or salty, and way more fun than the standard shoestring French fry most places serve. The burger however was not my favorite. The egg looked weird - probably my own issue since I had to watch it jiggle in the container and put it on the burger myself. And I didn&#39;t really trust the cheese sauce either, as Im a mayo hater and didn&#39;t want to risk hating it. The bacon was excellent, the meat was okay (overcooked for my medium liking), and the onion ring was a fine addition but unnecessary. I could take it or leave it. Where they lost me was the brioche which was way too sweet of a bread for the savory burger in between. 
I&#39;m giving four stars cause this place is cool, and would be a great place to grab drinks where you can actually talk to your company and see where you are stepping. I liked the vibe a lot. Just didn&#39;t love the food. Especially not for a $13 burger."

We couldn&#39;t have been happier with our experience.  From the food to the great service, everything was on point. In fact, it was so good that I wanted to tell you all about everything!

We had the following:

Smoked Margarita - Which was an explosion of flavor! That smoked salt was insanely good.
Pioneer - Great combination of flavors
Chips &amp; Queso - The chunks of avocado and the way you mix everything up was just yummy gooey goodness! The coriander chips were so unique and perfectly crunchy.
Eggplant Linguine - I&#39;ve never had cheese stuffed squash blossoms but boy am I glad that I have now! Wow! Great presentation and a very tasty dish.
Meadowlark Burger - I&#39;ve actually never seen my husband eat so fast in my life.  He devoured it in minutes and raved about it for the rest of the night.
Our service was impeccable and you could really tell how much the staff loves the food!

Had their absolutely outrageous BLT and onion rings for a solo dinner the other night. Until then I had honestly never had the following thought: &#34;Oh my, I don&#39;t know whether I can eat all of that delicious bacon.&#34; But I did when faced with what seemed to be an inch high stack of house-cured candied Meadowlark bacon on homemade ciabatta. It was accompanied by one of my favorite brews on tap--90 Shillings--and the meal completely blew me away. Plus it was made and served by some of the nicest, sweetest, hardest workin&#39; folks I&#39;ve had the pleasure to meet in the restaurant business.

Since my first visit I&#39;ve tasted their pork and peaches entrée; their shrimp and grits (my favorite version of that dish that I can remember having); and their burger. Every one was a 5 star home run. It just doesn&#39;t get any better than that.

So run--don&#39;t crawl like a wasted pub marathoner--over to 2705 Larimer for a little taste of heaven at what I think are ridiculously low prices.

Their &#34;Wild Mushrooms&#34; dish was out of this world and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had.

Service started good but quickly went downhill.  Our waiter was attentive when we first ordered, but soon forgot to check in with us at all and even failed to deliver something we asked for.  During our actual meal, I spent about 10 minutes trying to wave him down simply to get my water refilled, and one of my friends wanted another drink but by the time someone paid attention to us, it was time to ask for the check and leave.  The place may have been almost full, but like I said, the back area was only about a dozen tables...  not like it was the size of a Cheesecake Factory or something.

Food was pretty good, though the brisket seriously upset my stomach later on that night.  Also, it came in about a half-dozen thick slices, three of which were around 70-80% fat, so I felt like I paid for a good chunk of a meal I couldn&#39;t eat.

Also, someone else mentioned the bathroom...  yeah, that was smaller than a Manhattan closet."

She mentioned how previously, she tried in vain to snag a brunch seat, thankfully we were able to grab two spots at the bar for dinner. 

Brisket for her, fried chicken for me, and smoke margaritas to sip. I have to say, those smoked margaritas? Probably the best I&#39;ve had in Colorado (although to be fair, I don&#39;t usually opt for margaritas so really my range is limited). Smoked salt along the ring, balanced drink, none of that straight from the mix shit you so commonly find elsewhere, the bartender assured us that you&#39;ll never find any of that sweet frou frou crap here, for which I&#39;m so thankful. My friend&#39;s brisket was unbelievably tender, fell away with the slightest fork tug, my chicken nugs, an upgraded and more nuanced version of the McD&#39;s. Salty, crunchy, peppery, sides of spicy mustard and this light creamy dill sauce. Plenty stuffed after finishing, almost tempted by the desserts but that would&#39;ve been too ambitious on our ends. 

The service was wonderful, our bartender so well informed and helpful to two indecisive gals (I forget his name but he dons a rubber glove when mixing drinks), devoid of any of that pretentious, too hip for school attitude you find at other new hot spots. Definitely come by for a relaxed/fun atmosphere and tasty dinner."

My girlfriend and I were looking for a place around my office to eat dinner, we found this spot on Yelp and decided to give it a try. When you first walk in, you might be surprised as to how small it is, but there is a back patio with a bunch of seating, and it doesn&#39;t matter because obviously good things come in small packages. 

We sat at the bar, and ultimately had three different people serving us throughout the night. Our main guy was great, and you could just tell that everyone that works there gets it, you know. Everyone involved seems bought in to the vision, which makes for a great experience. We both got glasses of red wine recommended to us by the bar tender. 

We then started taking a look at the menu. It is a small menu, but I&#39;m guessing there isn&#39;t one bad thing on there. We ordered three of the items and loved every singe one of them. First, we had the brussels sprouts. At first glance it looks like an appetizer or brussels, but this dish is actually their take on a Caesar salad using brussels instead of romaine. There are also some capers and full pan fried brussels mixed into the shredded ones as well. We split that to get things kicked off, and it wasn&#39;t a bad idea. 

I got the brisket and she got the catfish. The Brisket is my kind of meal, they didn&#39;t fill the plate with a bunch of starch or vegetables and give you one little piece of meat. This dish was how meat was meant to be served, probably about a pound of brisket on the plate, and a piece of cornbread. The brisket was cooked perfectly, meaning that you of course don&#39;t need a knife for this one, and the cornbread was just a perfect compliment to the brisket and the sauce on top of it. 

I only got one bite of the catfish, but the bite I had was amazing. It comes deep fried, but the breading isn&#39;t too thick, they didn&#39;t fry it for too long and the fish seems like it was fresh. It was really a perfect bite when I got to try that. 

I will definitely be back over there to try some more of what they have to offer... or maybe I&#39;ll stick with the brisket every time, it&#39;s hard to say."

They had some drinks, which seemed good, and I had a pot of tea, which I was warned was very hot but totally standard tea otherwise.

One of my friends had the burger, and he was really pleased with it. The other 2/3 of the party had the mushroom ravioli - the description on the menu made it sound incredible, so much that I&#39;d opted for it over the mushroom salad. However, when we got the ravioli the first warning sign was the type: it was four or five large and flat pieces of ravioli, trying to be fancy on a plate like scallops or something. The pasta itself was chewy and unforgiving, I mostly ate the ravioli bit with the mushroom insides. There were crunchy things sprinkled all over with an unidentifiable taste, maybe garlic or something else toasted. It was interesting - I would not order it again.

Generally, it was a fine dining experience but not one that would really make me want to go back."

The beef on the burger was juicy and tender and the way all of the flavors came together was really a burger fan&#39;s ideal burger. Alongside the burger I had some of the waffle fries which were fantastic. Honestly some of the better waffle fries I have had. It makes you wonder why more restaurants who serve fries don&#39;t have waffle fries as an option. I should have asked for another order of waffle fries to take home. I learned my lesson for next time. As for the ambiance, it definitely had a relaxed hipster vibe to it.

A large group may not be appropriate for this place either; it is small and intimate.

The Meadowlark Kitchen is a cozy, understated little spot in a growing part of the city. It perfectly caters to the eclectic crowds, hungry before a night of dancing downstairs or before a show at Larimer Lounge. I&#39;m happy to have the MK, as it is a unique space that truly says &#34;Denver&#34;; this city is frantically changing; We need more spaces like these.

Upon our first visit, we enjoyed the smoked brisket and wild mushroom dish. Each were very different and incomparable. The brisket was cooked and flavored to perfection. It was accompanied by a crispy, delicious cornbread. Our wild mushroom dish was somewhat of a take on a deconstructed Benedict. I personally can eat breakfast dishes all day long and this one fit the bill.

Speaking of the check, for all that we had and feeling perfectly satiated, the prices are quite nice.

Our server and food runner were incredibly friendly, perfectly attentive, and thankfully not obnoxious. The staff vibes tell me that this must be a pretty great place to work. This was definitely apparent in their food. It&#39;s clearly made with love.

We had a 6:45 reservation, arrived at 6 and bellied up to the bar for only about 5 minutes before they seated us early which was appreciated by all. 
Small place. Great vibe. Casual dress and down to earth good service. They serve their beer really cold. Always a bonus. Brussel Sprouts. Good. Not the best I&#39;ve had. I wish I had a) listened to the server when he said, &#34;would you like to start out with the artichoke dip? b) read the reviews here that highly recommend the artichoke dip. Next time.
Dinner. Husband ordered the burger and enjoyed every bite. I had burger envy. For sure. Friend ordered the Mascarpone ravioli. She was happy. Other friend had the Brisket. Very happy. And I had the BLT which was pretty much the reason I have been wanting to visit Meadowlark. It&#39;s also the reason that I missed the artichoke dip reviews. My tunnel vision clearly didn&#39;t get past the bacon reviews. I have to say that the BLT was not everything I had hoped for. The bacon was delicious beyond belief and the price was a modest $9. But there was just something missing when putting it all together. It was cold and maybe I was expecting something more toasted. But that&#39;s cool because the best part was the bacon. And I felt like I was eating a clown car full of bacon b/c I would take a piece off to share with my husband over and over and always managed to have a sandwich FULL of bacon. Overall dinner was delish and very reasonable. I really appreciate that the small menu had a nice variety of both meal and price options. 
So, this makes my heart hurt to say but the bread pudding was very, meh. Our group is pretty much all about the bread pudding. Whenever we get together for dinner it&#39;s what we order. Every time. We were excited to try the bread pudding. LOVED that it came in four pieces since there were four of us. But it was dry. We unanimously agreed that it was missing the squishy texture and was way under-sauced. I won&#39;t hold it against them since our meal was so good but they can do better than that.

So many times a BLT is just so/so but I would go back tomorrow for another!  We started our dinner with the chips and dip, what a great dish, I wanted to scrape every last little bit of dip out of the bowl. To top the meal off I had the pioneer to drink, it was heavenly.

My buddies had a couple appetizers and they put in work on those, so it only safe to assume they were good - they didn&#39;t even leave me a damn bite! :) 

Other than that, I definitely want to come back to Meadowlark too have a bite to eat and see what the kitchen is made out of, it is anything like their service and their beer, there shouldn&#39;t be any problems.

So Meadowlark perhaps made a mistake and as a result you were inconvenienced. Maybe you were justified in being a little upset. I was happy to eat at the bar, but I understand it&#39;s not for everyone. You really wanted a table. Fine. What bothered me was how you handled it. You waived your phone around in the air and threatened to write a negative Yelp review to a completely apologetic manager who was willing to do almost anything to make your experience a better one. It was pathetic. Do us all a favor and stay home on date night next time."

It is so good that it is likely one of the best BLTs in America. In my opinion, the BLT here will eventually become a legendary item that people come from across the world to try. It is that good. 

This life-changing sandwich is all about the spicy/sweet candied bacon at its center. This bacon is so incredibly good and complex and deeply flavorful that it just carries the entire dish to the next level. I can not even describe it. If you order the BLT take a piece out and try it on its own.

The chiabatta is also really nice, as is this smoky chipotle sauce they spread on it. The greens and tomato also are super fresh. 

It has legit been over a week and a half since I got back from Denver and I am still thinking about how awesome this sandwich is. And I seriously don&#39;t even like BLTs! 

So yeah, no remarks about the atmosphere or service or even a single other dish, this review is all about the BLT which, I have to say, must be the best one in the city, if not the whole country."

The place is pretty small so probably not great for large parties. Our bartender/waiter took our order. He was very friendly and attentive. Service overall was great. We ordered the follwoing:
Artichoke dip: definitely unique and so so flavorful.  The app was huge! Large enough for 4 people. I would get this again. There were so many big pieces of artichoke and burrata. Sooo darn good.

Denver nuggets: pretty good. Again portion was too big for me to finish. The flavor of breading was good. Chicken thighs were juicy. Nothing too mindblowing but solid.

Burger: Really messy and decadent. We ordered medium rare, we got medium rare! Which is really refreshing now a days. All components of burger went really well. Stellar burger.

Dessert: carrot cake. Sauce was AMAZING. Only complaint on this is it was a bit small...which is odd considering everything else was so big?  Oh well probably for the best!"

We sat at the bar until 8:30, and learned that our table had been given away. Sorry, the owner  told us, &#34;we don&#39;t take reservation after 7:30&#34;. Really? Then don&#39;t take reservations at 8... and string us along until 8:30 when we don&#39;t have time to go anywhere else.

How was the food? The chips and dip was good, but I can&#39;t speak to anything else.

If you&#39;re into spicy margaritas you have to try the Jalapeno Margarita, it has a smoked salt rim that is incredible. The brussel sprouts are also amazing, they&#39;re not what you would expect from brussel sprouts. The sprouts are cooked and shaved and mixed together with ceasar dressing and these amazing croutons, definitely delicious. We also go the brisket, it&#39;s 1/2 a pound so there&#39;s plenty for two people. The brisket is so tender and moist it&#39;s incredible. I&#39;m not sure what makes their cornbread so special but it&#39;s the best cornbread I&#39;ve ever eaten. If you&#39;re in the neighborhood give this cool little spot a try!"

Yes, it&#39;s full of hipsters and foodies. Yes, all of the artwork hanging on the walls is done by local artist. Yes, hip music plays in the background. But don&#39;t let any of that stop you from going here! 

The food blew me away! I&#39;m not kidding. I ordered the BLT.  How can a BLT blow me away? The bacon on that thing was cooked so perfectly. It was sweet, but also kind of spicy. It was amazing, it what I&#39;m trying to say. The bread it was served on, toasted perfectly. Oh, and the tomatoes,  were heirloom tomatoes. Yeah, it was the BLT that I have had in a long time.

My travel companions also really enjoyed their meals as well. The both ordered a pasta dish and loved it.

But don&#39;t just stop at the food. Order a cocktail as well. I had a hibiscus lemon drink (I forgot the name) but it was rave worthy! 

For dessert,  order the red velvet cupcakes with homade ice cream, you will not be disappointed!

Meadowlark kitchen presents a laid-back atmosphere with the taste of a hip high class, foodie restaurant.  My husband and I went to Meadowlark Kitchen on a Sunday evening. I ordered the eggplant linguine and my husband ordered the BLT.  The eggplant linguine is service with a vodka sauce and the eggplant served three different ways. Every bit was different but just as amazing as the last. The best part of this dish was the deep fried eggplant blossom filled with cheese. It was like a classy jalapeno popper. My husbands BLT was beautifully plated - and huge.  I highly recommend this place for a night out on the town...or just for dinner some random week night. The prices are between 12-32 per plate."

After a trip downstairs to the connecting bar,  which was a little scary to say the least, we were redirected to the restaurant two doors down. It is housed in a nondescript space, an &#34;M&#34; marks the establishment. Oil paintings of rappers past and present cover the walls. Service was great! The bartender was attentive and knowledgable. 

Now the to the food... The menu was small, not always a bad thing, especially in this case. We ordered the smoked brisket with merlot-marrow sauce and the tomato salad. The brisket was fork tender, smoky and amazing! Almost licked the plate! Salad was fresh and well presented. 

I would recommend taking a chance, and venturing to this side of town, although it was a little sketchy it seems to be a neighborhood in transition, with new breweries and superb dining options."

Service was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and you could tell the staff, management, and (we assume) owner, were all very invested in the restaurant and genuinely cared about their patrons&#39; experience. We also loved the artwork on the wall and had a fun game trying to figure out who all the artists were in the paintings.

We started with a bottle of wine and the tomato salad, which featured ricotta, local melons, and homemade crostini bread (fantastic!). For dinner I had the Meadowlark Burger, which was excellent, and my wife had the catfish which was also very good.  We ended with a slice of coffee toffee pie which was perfect - not too rich or sweet, just a very nice texture and flavor.  We really appreciate the fact they make their bread and desserts in-house. Also, so many restaurants these days have great flavor but really small portions (like Cho Lon and Fuel Cafe), which is fine, but ends up leading to an expensive meal and/or leaving hungry.  Not so with Meadowlark - their portions are generous and we did not leave hungry! 

We also hear they change their menu seasonally, so we&#39;ll go back to try it out.  My only complaint is that I wish they had bike parking out front."

The food here is DELICIOUS. they serve only the late night menu past a certain time, but regardless the options on the late night menu are of variety and quality. We ordered the Brussel sprouts (one of my favorite foods) and the chips and dip. The chips for the dip were house made pita like chips that were huge, served with a dip that had some beans, tomato, Guac, and other ingredients. Perfect dish for sharing and nothing too complex on the palette so it&#39;s something that everyone would enjoy. The Brussel sprouts were my favorite. They were served almost like a salad with croutons and mixed greens. They weren&#39;t super hot, but a warm temp making it like eating a warm Brussel sprouts salad. I was a huge fan of this dish. I didn&#39;t share much of it because it was so good! My friend order the BLT (look at my check in to see a pic). It was a decent size serving! It had candied bacon on it. 

It&#39;s decently priced as well. The food presentation is great. The wait for food isn&#39;t very long, and they have a selection of yummy cocktails as well.

The cocktails were well crafted and the food delicious. Small rotating menu, which for me is typically telling of a good experience to come. We had the Trout (served with squash cooked 3 different ways - my favorite) and Smoked Brisket (served with house made cornbread - his favorite). Although the plates looked small upon arrival both were deceivingly more than enough food for each of us, and so good that we couldn&#39;t stop taking bites even after we were stuffed. Bourbon and gin cocktails were great. I had the Aberdeen and my anti-gin boyfriend actually loved it. 

Overall, fantastic food and cocktails with carefully selected ingredients. You can tell by the servers&#39; and bartenders&#39; knowledge and enthusiasm that this place really cares about what goes into what they serve and how it&#39;s presented. Everyone we encountered - from the hostess to the bartender, to the girl who delivered our entrees to the bar, to another guy we chatted with who had the presence of an owner or manager - was nothing but knowledgable, friendly, and engaging. Pretty nice contrast for us, because in a small chill place like this with a great chef &amp; cocktail lineup in an up-and-coming hipster-ish neighborhood in Chicago you&#39;d be hard pressed to buddy up with the staff.

This place is funky it is cool and it is a gem!

The food is insanely good and after a conversation with the chefs you immediately know why it is so good, these dude are passionate about what they do.

I had the burger and it jumped to the top of my list of burgers in Denver. I will be back again and again for this concoction!

My daughter had the Brisket which in itself was insane and hearing how they chefs had  macgyvered a smoker to help in the creation of this extremely tender beef was impressive!

I&#39;ve been here 3 times and each time it&#39;s just been ok. I got the smokey margarita (I don&#39;t think it is called that exactly, but something along those lines) last time and it tasted watered down and was just not well made. Los Chingones has a comparable drink and it&#39;s way better over there. It seems like people are a fan of the burger - something I have never had there - which may be its redeeming quality.

The space is small with about 5 tables but there&#39;s a large bar area. Servers were really cool &amp; easy to talk to. They all seemed down to earth. I tried the clementine Moscow mule for $10 &amp; thought it tasted pretty good (ginger beer was the strongest detectable flavor). It tasted like an orange tic tac.

We had the onion soup. Everything you want in a soup. Both complex and simple at the same time, the earthy notes of the raw onion and goat cheese really add to the amazing flavor of the soup. For the main course, I had the brisket. Oh. My. God. I know many places say this, but many places don&#39;t deliver. LITERALLY melt in your mouth good.

Denver Nuggets were a no-brainer, fried chicken with two sauces and pickles, yes please! My bar neighbor chose the Crispy Catfish, finishing it off with a big smile.

They have a solid buffalo sauce with their original hot.  It is just the right amount of spice with great flavor. The employees always seem upbeat and love working there. The best days to go are Tuesdays. The wings aren&#39;t any cheaper, but they have ALL of their beers for only a $1. $1!! That is right. This is the time to try different beers and enjoy some hot wings. The fries are also a bit different.  They season them with not only salt, but also some sugar to give them a slightly different flavor than most french fries. My only complaint about Wingstop is that my fingers are always orange afterwards! Ha!"

The people that work there are nice (they let me try the Mango Habanero sauce to make sure it wasn&#39;t too hot... Which it is if you&#39;re not a big fan of very spicy things), it&#39;s clean, they are fast (within 10 minutes I had my wings) and the wings are pretty good (I didn&#39;t like the lemon pepper though, very strong flavour for me).

They said, &#34;I have one more order ahead of you.&#34; 10 minutes later i asked again about my order, he said my orders ready, then I realize they were missing a side. I tell them they forgot my side which I paid for and they tell me I have to wait another five minutes for them to make it!

So I consulted the GPS and it brought me a mile or two down the road to Wingstop. It&#39;s a single wide storefront in a shopping plaza with very limited seating, but the (well tattooed) staff was friendly and the place looked clean.

I ordered 20 wings - ten hot and ten bbq. He was very precise with the time they would be ready: 14 minutes. And then a draft beer, but the counter-dude said that Tuesday is &#39;bottle for a dollar&#39; day and after looking at their beer fridge, I got two Stella. Stella&#39;s my fave and to get them for a buck a piece is practically robbery!

I took a table towards the back while my wings were prepared. Two tv&#39;s tuned in to a sports channels and watching the passing traffic of customers helped pass the time.

When the wings arrived (actually a little early), they were seriously hot (temperature-wise) so I had to wait a little bit for them to cool to eating temperature. The &#34;hot&#34; wings were the right spicy hot for me - not insanely hot and not boring. The &#34;bbq&#34; wings had a good smoky flavor. The texture was good - solid and crunchy but not too much so. They weren&#39;t the meatiest wings either. My main complaint: they were literally bathing in sauce. So much that I had to wipe them down before eating. I also got a small fries to go.

Would I come here again? Maybe. They were okay, but not great."

I&#39;ve had the other flavors and they&#39;re good, but, if you&#39;re a buffalo flavor fan like me, this won&#39;t disappoint.  I happen to love the bleu cheese dressing there because it has the actual cheese chunks in it.  This place is a little pricey just for some wings though.  The fries are pretty good, but what makes them excellent is the little bit of sugar they put in them.  I wish I knew exactly what they use...but, whatever it is, it&#39;s a good mixture of sweet and salty.  I really like the Bourbon Baked Beans too."

If you want more sauce variety or other options like seafood (clams, shrimp), buffalo brats, rocky mountain oysters, to name a few, go to Golden Flame Hot Wings farther east on the corner of Tower and Hampden. If you are really adventurous, try their fried Twinkies or fried Cheesecake."

We have had burnt wings on several visits, but I haven&#39;t complained as I understand mistakes happen... but the customer service could have been better in this situation to rectify the incorrect meal and then actions not matching what I was informed.  We will not be a return customer after all this.  

After a very long day at work I called in to pick up some Wingstop on the way home, the order was verbally confirmed when picked up (should have checked it at the counter!) and when I got home 20 of the 30 wings were incorrect.  Meaning the Hawaiian is now flaming hot!  We don&#39;t do spice like that, so this meant calling the store to rectify the situation.  Do they deliver?  No.  I then gave them two choices.  One is that we would drive back, return the wings and receive the correct wings along with a refund for our time/gas (Which is a 40 minute round trip) or a refund period.  Then that is when we were told only a refund would be permitted, not the other option of coming in.  Well, no refund showed up and I called to find out why.  They stated we never brought the wings back and that was what she really meant.  Completely opposite of what we were told and she is pretty sure they sent us home with the correct wings.  Hmmm.  

As I mentioned, I don&#39;t complain often, but this time caused me to call and to write this review.  I&#39;m sure some people may fool the system, but that is not what I did.  So not only did I lose out on food for dinner after a long day and having to make a new meal... instead of relaxing, I was then accused of lying and I only received half of what I was told I would receive for a refund.  This could have all be corrected with better customer service after the incorrect order given.  

We will no longer be giving this Wingstop our business and will drive to the Southlands location if we are craving wings due to better quality of the wings and now customer service."

You can also swing in next door and get a little ceaser pizza for the kids. Which mean you dont have to share the wings unless you have a little wing eatter staring at you saying &#34;I like dat&#34;.

First off, I have a Korean mother in law and I can cook Korean food, so I like to think that I know if a dish is good. The soondubu (spicy tofu stew) is delicious, as is the bibimbap. The winner though, is the fried mandoo appetizer. It&#39;s obvious that they are homemade and the taste is incredible. My son can eat a whole order by himself.

There were plenty of delicious side dishes that were vegetarian-friendly. The thing that really bumped this place up from three to four stars is the fact that they served my dolsot bibimbap on a huge stone bowl with tofu when I asked for no meat. Woohoo! I asked for the egg to be cooked all the way and, lo and behold, it was cooked just as I requested! There was a generous portion of veggies and rice, and everything was well-prepared. They have a lot of different options in terms of dishes, but I think the bibimbap is really one of the only entrees that doesn&#39;t contain some type of meat.

We ordered the BBQ combination C that came with beer or soju, 2 meats ( we got the pork belly and marinated bulgogi), soup, and steam egg. The side dishes were good! I feel like as long as the sauces are good you can&#39;t mess up Korean BBQ ! Everything was awesome!! Food coma for sure. The only thing that was missing was the rice drink at the end of the meal, most Korean places give you this rice drink at the end as dessert (like Seoul BBQ does).

The last 2 times I went none of the gas grills were being used. I asked for one of those. Apparently all of them are now &#34;broken&#34;. So I just left both times.

I finally figured out that the main reason I keep coming back here is because I can&#39;t get into other Korean places during the weekend.  I can always manage to get a table here and it satiates my Korean food hankering enough. 

One big complaint I have is that if you were to order BBQ, you have to get 2 orders to sit at the grilling table, which would be about $50, otherwise they make it in the back.

So if you are not very picky, you will get decent food and the staffs are friendly (although sometimes seem a bit overwhelmed), it&#39;s not a bad choice."

We had the bebimbap in stone bowl and sundubu. I like that the stone bowl here is wider then usual, making it easier to stir fry the rice. The soup though was only kind of flavorful. We were at the end of the lunch rush, and it seemed pretty clear the the other Korean tables were of more importance to the staff.

Again, if you&#39;re in the area I wouldn&#39;t say you should avoid this place.  If you&#39;re looking to try Korean for the first time, I highly recommend going to Dae Gee first."

Prior to this event, I made a reservation for the group as part as International Cuisine Enthusiasts meetup event.  Several friends opt for the BBQ table, while some other friends and I opt for the kitchen to do all the cooking for us.

With the extensive menu, for those WHO ARE INTO KOREAN BBQ,  Special BBQ MENU are divided into 4 portions ranging from $45.95 to feed 3 people and up to $99.95 to feed 6 people.  Then for those who wants to order from the main menu such as BBQ prepared by the kitchen, Stews, Bibimbob, Noodles and Grilled items the prices are between $9.95 to $32.95.

While waiting for our main entree to arrived, the waitstaff named Ms Young and her assistance, bring out the Korean side dishes and rice.  Each of us, get a bowl of rice for our personal consumption.  As for me, I order the Galbi, 3 pieces of BEEF SHORT RIBS marinated and cooked and also an order of Spicy Grilled Squid with vegetables.

I like the Galbi a lot for this I give them 4 stars while my Spicy Grilled Squid is about 3.25 to 3.5 stars.  I like the flavor of the Galbi.  Was slightly dissapointed on the Spicy Grilled Squid, since its not as spicy as I want it to be, though I have requested it to be EXTRA SPICY.

As for my other friends, one of them order the Bibimbob, another ordered the BBQ Chicken marinated with Special Sauce and those who sat at the BBQ table order the following :

*  Galbi (Beef Short Ribs)
*  BBQ Pork
*  Bulgogi (Beef)
*  Cubed Rib
*  Greenbean pancake
*  Porkneck Bone Soup
*  Monkfish w beansprouts
*  So Ju

If you happen to need refills of the rice and other side dishes, just press the bell that is on your table.  The waitstaffs will come to your RESCUE.  The waitstaff is indeed attentive, prompt and friendly.

I am indeed stuffed by the end of my Korean feast.  Had leftovers of the Galbi and Grilled Squid for Hubs too.  My friends like what they ordered.  All in all, I like this place and I dont mind returning back to Sae Jong Kwan to have my meal here anytime!  By the end of our dinner many more patrons came in having their late dinner galore!"

I submitted a change in status for the restaurant when I tried to check-in.  The street address is the same; not sure if it moved units or something.

Although I went to the grocery before work today, I really wanted some Korean BBQ for take out to bring back to my office for lunch today.  So I submitted to temptation.  This place did not fail to impress!  Their bulgogi lunch was $6.99.  I got two huge containers filled with a ton of food.  I got the bulgogi, of course, which a huge mound of rice, topped with fried egg surrounded by carrots, cucumber, mushrooms (2 kinds), bean sprouts, and a couple of other things.  In the other container was seaweed, kim chi, sweet boiled peanuts, sauce, and something so good I wolfed it down and can&#39;t remember what it was.  Oh, I remember, chunks of marinated tofu.

It took about 10 minutes to get it ready, so call ahead.  I&#39;ll definitely be coming back.  Their lunch for $6.99 - including other options such as beef soup, bibimbop, and some other things is such a great value.  If you&#39;re not super-hungry or a super-big eater, $6.99 could easily be enough for 2 people."

The women who work there are super friendly and accommodating. Plus, it&#39;s one of the few decent places for Korean BBQ in Colorado.

I&#39;ve been there twice: once for KBBQ and once for Bibimbap. Both were delicious and just as I had expected. The banchan was also good. There were a ton of little dishes and each time I went there was a different selection of sides which was nice. Also, miso soup comes with your meal. Definitely a great touch.

The lunch specials are dirt cheap so I would definitely recommend checking this place out during the afternoon hours. The KBBQ isn&#39;t as cheap and it strangely comes with one (only one) drink....weird, right? There were four of us eating and they only allowed one of us to order a drink with the BBQ combination. Super bizarre. But, whatever, the food made up for it. It was delicious!"

This one is located in the same stripmall as J&#39;Shabu (see previous review), near Havana and Yale. Its full name is Sae Jong Kwan, but the Korean-language sign simply spells out Sae Jong, while the English one says &#34;Korean BBQ&#34;. 

Still with me? Good, because you won&#39;t want to miss this. When you enter, you will notice that each table is equipped with its very own buzzer. When pressed, this sets off a signal at the back of the room that will summon a server directly to you. Nifty! 

The menu is extensive and varied, and a number of the Lunch options come in an elegant lacquered box called a Dosirak divided neatly into compartments. Therefore, if you order Bulgogi (tender grilled beef) or Dak Gui (zesty marinated chicken) you may also be treated to Chapchae (thin noodles with vegetables), or a cool refreshing salad, or... well, who knows what you may find? There are of course options available to grill your own meats at the table too. 

If this notion just isn&#39;t tickling your fancy, never fear! There are plenty of other choices. How about a nice big bowl of comforting Doenjang Chigae (bean paste stew with mushrooms and onions) or invigorating Gamjatang (spicy potato and pork spine soup)? Throw in an order of Bindaeduk (green bean pancakes), or maybe Mandu (steamed dumplings) and there you go! 

Naturally, the meal also comes with a number of Banchan (side dishes), as is customary. On any given day you could partake in egg custard cubes, seaweed salad, dried fish, or crunchy lotus root. Or a myriad (OK, maybe not quite *that* many) of other possibilities. 

In Korean it&#39;s known as Sae Jong Kwan, but I like to call it just plain tasty."

Went there for lunch on a weekend, wasn&#39;t that packed (5 tables there maybe).  Should&#39;ve turned around and walk out when it took 5 min for someone to even come up to the front to seat us.  The service is terrible.  Waited 15 min to even get a glass of water, the table seated 5 minutes behind us ordered and got their water before someone even stopped by our table.  

Food finally came and it wasn&#39;t spectacular.  I ordered their stone pot bimbimbap.  It was just ok, it has less meat than other places.  The fish my bf ordered wasn&#39;t that great neither.

I ordered the pork/kimchee bibimbop and beef bulgogi. The beef bulgogi was pretty decent. Their pork/kimchee bibimbop is usually piled high w/ grilled pork + all the fixings. This time the pork was slim, and something was off with their kimchee. Their sides are usually awesome but I was having a hard time w/ their kimchi based sides. I&#39;ve eaten here a handful of times and this time is the first time I have been disappointed. 

I do have to comment on their bathroom - it&#39;s totally a nightmare! I&#39;ve never used the bathroom in past visits... and now it&#39;s kinda ruined it for me. If I didnt have 3&#34; heels on I wouldve stepped in some overflowing from the stall next to me. It reminded me of a rest area bathroom in California...  It TOTALLY grossed me out.

I went here with my girlfriend (who is Korean and ordered in said language) and some friends on a Sunday evening.  The doorbells on the table are a little weird and I don&#39;t think ours worked.  We sat at a non-BBQ table because, honestly, it&#39;s a bit of a pain in the ass to cook your own food AND talk at the same time.

We ordered several entrees which I don&#39;t remember what they are because 1. I didn&#39;t order and 2. I don&#39;t speak Korean.  However they were all delicious and came out quickly  but not all at once (which is good when table space is an issue).  The stone bowls are really cool and generate those rice crispies at the bottom which some people really like.  The portions are good sizes and we had plenty of food.   

If you&#39;re hunting for a Korean place to try I&#39;d give it a shot...I&#39;d go back, but probably not before trying others in the area (like Grandma&#39;s).  

Three stars because I think the door bell thing is stupid and because in my girlfriend&#39;s much more educated opinion it was very adequate but not spectacular.  There you have it."

I stopped in for lunch today and was really happy with the place, the service, and the food.  After dining here, I think I know why the other big time Korean BBQ just down the road joint just did a major re-modeling.  They better do more than that if they want to keep up with Sae Jong Kwan.  This place is clean, nice, good, and fast!  The menu is well-organized and easy to read, and the service was well beyond my expectations.

We went for the lunch menu, and it can&#39;t be beat.  You have about 15 choices of all of the standard Korean dishes like pork and beef bulgogi, bibimbap (plate or dolsot), kimchi jigae, mul naengmyun and bibim naengmyun, and about half a dozen soups (including gamjatang and yukaejang if I remember right).  Most of the lunch items are $6.95 with some at $8.95.  

They served us 12 types of banchan with the meal, including one I had never (gasp!) tried before that had a sweet-hot chili pepper and dried shrimp.

The place wasn&#39;t swamped around lunch, but it was still nice to get good and fast service.  (Take note, other big time Korean BBQ joint just down the road that rhymes with the first name of the supporting actress from Black Swan!)   A great lunch for around $15!"

It was great--a vast array of pickles and condiments, yummy green bean pancakes, and more meat than an army of Huns could want.  Topping it off was the yummy and tummy warming stew of chili, potatoes and pork neck bones.  OK so we didn&#39;t get to try several other favorites but this place is a keeper.  We will be back. The barbeque and the meal was better than the place in NYC (see my reviews) we ate at recently, and the price was a lot better.

They had separate seating for those whom wanted to do the BBQ, we just sat at the tables.  

Soju? My friend ordered some Soju, and must I say it&#39;s a liquor I&#39;m not used to and for some reason it was not agreeing to me.  It&#39;s like a vodka tasting drink kinda wished i had a mixer with it. Drinking straight was not doing me any good.  I had a taste for beef and rice and a vegetable so my friend recommended the Bulgogi and wow they give you alot alot of meat. It smelled so good and the seasoning was delish. Knowing that Korean meals come with an assortment of side dishes I was able to get my tasting on.  I loved, loved the spicy/sweet cuttlefish. the Kimchee..eh very unique taste, the smell was one thing but i&#39;m always open to trying new things. 

It was an experience, I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know more about Korean food. This was a great starter place, a little on the expensive side but with the amount of food they gave it wasn&#39;t too bad.  I want to try their many different soups next time."

For some reason, the mandu is horrible when I order it on my own -- if I&#39;m with my mom, she works her Korean magic and gets the good stuff off-menu  but the last time I was there (this past Saturday) they were really greasy and just... bland.  Sometimes the kimchi is weird -- it&#39;s been too sweet, too sour, but overall all the banchan is excellent.

I have to agree that the service can be a little slow, but you can always press the annoying table bells to bring a server over (unless I&#39;m having BBQ, I try not to press the bell... seems, erm, rude somehow?)

Their soups are always top-notch -- my favorite is the spicy cod with tofu, they don&#39;t call it maeuntang, but that&#39;s pretty much what it is (fish, scallops, all manner of veggie) and it arrives boiling over in a stone pot.

The bibimbab is great -- go for the dolsot (hot stone pot) version.  It&#39;s easily enough to feed two people.  The lunch menu is the best deal -- they have bento-type lunch boxes and bulgogi and spicy pork for under $8.

I&#39;ve been to Seoul BBQ but prefer Sae Jong Kwan -- one of the tests is seeing a higher brown-to-white ratio and you definitely get that at SJK.  Besides, it&#39;s a nice place to stop on your way to shop at H-Mart."

I love the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop and the Korean BBQ. I usually get the beef Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop, which is a combination of Rice, Beef, and a variety of vegetables served in a sizzling hot stone pot with an egg on top. It stays warm through the entire meal and continues to cook while you eat. They also have a seafood Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap. I tried this once and it was surprisingly more spicey than the beef. We also like the chap jae and I&#39;d recommend the green bean pancake for an appetizer. Careful if you order a soda, they will just bring you a can. :) 

Please take note of the wireless doorbells on each table.  You ring these to call your server for everything. And believe me, you NEED to use it. Ready to order? Ring the doorbell. Need more water? Ring the doorbell. Need more water later? Ring the doorbell. Ready for check? Ring the doorbell. Ready to have the check picked up with your credit card? Ring the doorbell.  

Cleanliness would probably be a 1 star (bathrooms are a little scary...  the floors have seen their day).  Service can also be kind of slow, which makes this a 3 star review as A-OK."

Although there are several worthwhile Korean Restaurants in Aurora, (Silla, in particular, is very good as well) Sae Jong Kwan&#39;s exceptional Mool Nyeung Myun (cold wheat noodle soup, for all you giajen)  gives this place top billing.  

Not for you...? No problem, Can&#39;t go wrong ordering from  the extensive selection of meat. Bulgogi, beef tongue and pork belly are especially good. Add a shared bowl of Tofu soup and a dozen Jinros, and you got the makings of a memorable (albeit blurry) Sunday afternoon feast!"

Waited another 15 minutes and the side dishes came out, then we waited another 20 minutes for our main meals. The meats were so touch you could not chew. I had ordered Bulgogi, kids ordered Bibimpap Hot Pot (Came out COLD), and I am not sure what husband ordered. However, we could not eat the meals. We each took maybe 2 bites total and had to spit out each bite due to the taste or toughness of the meat. When we tried to speak to someone we got the &#34;I don&#39;t understand English&#34;. Well luck would have it my husband speaks Korean. The woman still denied that there was something wrong with our meals.

The fried catfish po&#39;boy, fried shrimp po&#39;boy, and cajun fries were all deliciously fried with just the right amount of batter and seasoning. I&#39;ve never been to New Orleans, but judging from the food at this truck, I need to go immediately.

The only reason I have to give 3 stars is because of service (sadly). After ordering 2 po&#39;boys with fries at 12:28 (as printed on the receipt), I waited...and I waited...and I waited.  Finally at 1:05 pm, I got my food. Food trucks, in my opinion, are meant to be an easy and convenient way to grab a quick lunch, or a quick snack. 37 mins at even the fanciest sit down restaurant would be pushing it. I get that all of their food is freshly fried, but for a food truck specializing in fried foods, that wait was way too long and it meant that the majority of my lunch hour was spent waiting to eat. 

The lady at the window was apologetic and the sticker proclaiming &#34;best food truck of 2016&#34; makes me want to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The sandwich came with fries and a drink. The fries were a bit salty for my taste, but had nice Cajun spicing; I enjoyed it.

This deliciously flavorful gumbo... filled with four different proteins and tender veggies,  is served from a denver food truck. Jessie&#39;s smokin nola is an authentic new orleans style food truck that I only discovered a few weeks ago but they have been serving up their louisiana-fare for a couple years now in the sunshine state. I have become an instant stalker, tracking their every move through their online calendar because I cannot get enough. But back to the gumbo...

You can taste the time and love put into creating their perfect roux, it is deep in flavor and gives the gumbo a rich color and consistency. The stew is filled with an abundance of ingredients but they are well balanced and do not feel over the top. Tender chicken, spicy cured sausage, sweet shrimp and even mini meatballs, which are my favorite part of the gumbo, are then mixed with the &#39;holy trinity&#39; (sautéed onions, celery and bell peppers). Finally, a big spoonful of rice finishes things off. After one bite you will feel like you have been transported to bourbon street, minus the live jazz music.

On a cool autumn evening, this is the perfect dish to warm you from the inside out.  I would also suggest ordering up one of jessie&#39;s awesome poboys to round out your meal.

I was shocked when I was charged 15.00 each at two different places, and they had hard french bread and not enough shrimp as I always remembered. I spent 27 years in the service industry in the French Quarter. Since when is a po-boy now 15.00 in N.O.? I havent been gone that long. LOL Both were so disappointing . 
Jessie&#39;s po-boys are mouth watering, loaded with ketchup, mayo, and hot sauce.. &#34;Dressed&#34; exactly as a real New Orleans po-boy is supposed to be. YUMMY!  I was glad to be back home, in Denver,  for my weekly po-boys from Jessie. I look for his truck in my neighborhood every week. So does my son.

I had the pleasure of trying Jessie&#39;s Smokin&#39; Nola last week while visiting Comrade. I love cajun food, so I was super pumped to find a food truck that serves this delicious fare.

I ordered the the cajun sausage on a stick and the cajun fries.  The sausage was the bomb.  Very succulent. Bursting in your mouth with flavor and juices  Perfect blend of cajun spices and herbs.  This was one of the most flavorful sausages I have ever tasted (and I will note that I have tasted some pretty darn good sausage while living in Chicago). I will be scoping out this food truck just for the sausage on a stick.  The cajun fries were also delicious.  Greatly seasoned and the perfect fry consistency.  I would put them up there with some of my favorite fries. 

My friend ordered the seafood platter with shrimp and catfish.  I have to say, the shrimp and catfish were awesome.  Both cooked spot on and the batter had excellent flavor.  Also, great quality seafood for landlocked Denver.  I was pretty impressed. 

We had the pleasure of speaking with Jessie that evening.  He told us how he tried the meats/fish from various establishments before deciding on one.  He is very picky about food and will only serve the best.  One thing is for sure, you are guaranteed high quality food when you visit Jessie&#39;s!  I highly recommend you stop by Jessie&#39;s Smokin&#39; Nola if you see him parked!"

With two peas in a pod in my belly, it was an excellent meal, but what made the experience one to remember was the service I received. Or I should say, the service my fur child received. 

I love the beer garden, not only for the rotation of food trucks that are slinging solid eats, but because it&#39;s dog friendly. My pup, Marley had been intently watching the food truck crew break down and clean up for the evening when Jessie personally offered him an unseasoned sausage to snarf down. As much as I&#39;d like to put my dog to work as sous chef to help with bills, persistence, along with a face you can&#39;t say no to earned him a tasty treat to enjoy. That act, along with food packed with incredible flavor, although a bit pricey, earned 4.5 stars.

Thanks again, Jessie! Can&#39;t wait to try your other dishes. And Marley will be right there to help to bus tables for leftovers!"

I couldn&#39;t leave my desk for lunch one day, so a friend introduced me to Jessie&#39;s Jambalaya.  It was fabulous!  So, the next time the truck was here, I stool in line for 20 minutes, heart set on a po&#39; boy when the woman, who had been whispering to everyone ahead of me, told me the wait for po&#39; boys was 20 minutes and WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT, proceeded to try selling me on the jambalaya.  Wait, what?  If the wait is really that long, you should let everyone know since not everyone gets an eternal lunch, and not everyone wants yesterday&#39;s leftovers."

Now about the fries. They were a bit too salty for my wife&#39;s liking but I enjoyed them. These fries are also spicy but a good kind of spicy. I&#39;m glad I was able to try Jessie&#39;s food. I&#39;m a fan for sure."

Also, since they do some food prep in Elizabeth, they can sometimes be found there as well (currently in front of Charlie&#39;s Hot Dogs on Mondays).  I had a drink from the truck during the Elizabeth Music Festival, but had already eaten, and so did not sample the fare that day.  I had also seen them at the Parker farmer&#39;s market.  This summer, they started parking outside of Elk Mountain Brewery in Parker.  This was a great idea.  Since you need to bring or order your own food at these small breweries, anything that is convenient is appreciated.  You place your order and pay.  When your food is ready, they actually bring it to your table inside Elk Mountain.

I had the Muffaletta on my last visit.  This sandwich, for those not familiar, is a huge heap of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, swiss and olive salad, served warm on toasted italian sesame bread.  The flavors are intense.  The saltiness of the meats and olive tapenade pairs extremely well with a cold beer.  Although I have not yet tasted a Po&#39; Boy from here, they look amazing."

Well after talking to Jesse and getting the &#34;boil&#34; I have to say what the heck are you doing in a truck, get a restaurant! The shrimp, sausage, corn, crab legs, potatoes and the red beans and rice were right out of New Orleans! The spices were perfect just leaving a hint of heat on your lips wanting more.

The first is every time I go to have them they are not ready so I am essentially having to wait 45 minutes to an hour for them to finish their set up, and in the process the service is sub par. When they are not set up they are short with the customers who approach their food truck. So if you are patient enough to wait that long for food it will be worth it but the point of food trucks is to get your food fast, and they are still pretty slow."

I&#39;ve never heard of Detroit style pizza, but a new friend told us about how yummy this place was. 

It&#39;s a small place with limited seating, but we&#39;ve found the food rewarding and delicious on both of our visits. 

We have gotten the brooklyn bridge on both visits which is super tasty. The dollops of the super creamy ricotta are utterly delightful, seriously. Our last visit we also tried the mountain top pizza, which has both cupperoni and the other pepperoni with mushrooms. The crust was good, but the combination wasn&#39;t anything exciting. My father in law, who actually dislikes mushrooms ended up feeling luke warm about it. (expected)

Salads have also been clean and fresh, and the large size is good to share if anyone else at your table is interested. They have some great sounding specials,  notably their Monday dine in (2 for 1 detroit style pizzas) and lunch specials also sound generous."

While we waited, someone else came in and took the last table big enough for us. So, we kept waiting. Then, the big table by the door opened (3 adults and a baby were sitting there), but they apparently save that table in case a party of 5 or 6 comes in. So, we left. While we waited, we had a chance to watch the four employees. At any given moment, three of them were doing nothing. So, we will go back there eventually, but only for take out.

Not longing to visit Detroit, I am very happy that my Denver hosts - Gordon and Andrea - did their research and took me to Blue Pan Pizza in the West Highland area.  Before getting to how delicious it was, I should share a few important points of their research.    One, others know it is delicious.  Two, there isn&#39;t much seating.   Three, they don&#39;t do reservations.  With that said, Blue Pan does a lot of carryout business and recommends calling ahead about 30 minutes prior to dining to at least get put on their waitlist for a table.

Based on our experience, Blue Pan Pizza has not let their success go to their head, and they treat all customers very well.  The manager was especially friendly and very helpful in getting us a table as soon as possible (Gordon mentioning his Midwest connections may have helped as well).  Waiting is the hardest part, but once seated you can relax and prepare to enjoy some delicious food.  

Ready to eat immediately after being seated, we started with their &#34;Good Dog&#34; appetizer.  This is their house made garlic cheese bread.  While I don&#39;t understand the name, all you really need to know it was very good and carried some of the same dough and cheese characteristics of their Detroit-style pizza.  

So what is Detroit-style pizza?  It is a thick, square pan pizza known for its crust that is light and airy on the inside yet crispy on outside.  Also, the cheese always goes to the edge of the crust and forms a caramelized crisp there.  This same crust and cheese process made the &#34;Good Dog&#34; appetizer very tasty, and adding some garlic to it didn&#39;t hurt either.

Continuing to confuse me with their names, Blue Pan&#39;s award winning Detroit-style pizza is named the &#34;Brooklyn Bridge.&#34;  It consists of mozzarella and brick cheeses (a blend authentic to Detroit-style), pizza sauce, creamy NY ricotta, natural casing pepperoni, Italian sausage, chopped garlic, Sicilian oregano, and pecorino romano cheese.  Again, the taste more than made up for my confusion on the name as this pizza deserves its first place billing in the traditional division at the 2014 International Pizza Challenge.  I suppose the name likely comes from the creamy NY ricotta, and that was actually the only part of the pizza I could have done without (just too creamy for my liking).  Otherwise, everything about it was delicious.  The crust, especially its edges, was my favorite part.  A close second was the flavorful and spicy meats.

Blue Pan also serves classic Italian, Chicago cracker thin, and New York-style slices.  Plus, the Detroit-style has a gluten free option.  All of their other offerings couldn&#39;t sway us from the standard Detroit-style they are most known for though, and we also tried it with pepperoni and extra cheese.  Both pizzas were delicious, but my perfect pizza choice from Blue Pan would be the Brooklyn Bridge minus the creamy ricotta.

If you want Detroit-style pizza in the Denver and don&#39;t mind carryout or a potential wait, then I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t get any better than Blue Pan Pizza.  For those of you in other areas, Jet&#39;s Pizza is chain from Michigan now offering Detroit-style pizza in many states."

We ordered to pick up, so I can&#39;t speak for the restaurant service or any of that. The menu pretty much had me drooling. The combinations and toppings all sounded really great. We went for the seemingly popular Brooklyn Bridge since it&#39;s so popular and the combo sounded like a home run. 

The good: 
The crust (though very thick and bready) was actually very good. It&#39;s a pan pizza, so the bottom is extra crispy. While there wasn&#39;t a ton of sauce, what I was able to taste was pretty good. It definitely didn&#39;t taste like it came out of a can and straight onto the pie. Suspect they used very good tomatoes and made their own sauce. 

The meh: 
The toppings were just so sparse, I barely had any pepperoni or sausage on the pizza. I mostly ate bread. As I think about it more, we paid nearly $30 for mostly BREAD. Makes me think of and compare to the cheaper pizza chains, where we could have very well gotten the same thing for less than half! Also, the pizza was pretty small...I had hoped it was going to be a better size, but in all honesty, it was more like a medium size pizza and not truly a large. The cost just isn&#39;t worth it for me. It literally costs anyone a number of pennies to make bread. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a huge profit margin on these pizzas...

The verdict: 
Compared to other pizza places, this isn&#39;t the one to get your money&#39;s worth. I&#39;m not sure if in Detroit they actually have the same product for this price point, or perhaps this is a &#34;novelty&#34; item here in Denver and hence the reason they charge this much for mostly bread. I&#39;ll also say that if I&#39;m going to eat THAT much bread, I&#39;d rather go for a full-on deep dish."

Yeah, Detroit and Philly are light years apart, but....this place knocks it out of the park with their pizza. Everything tastes fresh and vibrant...the crust, sauce, toppings, etc...all great. They even have the legit, real-deal pepperoni that curls up around the edges when cooked. I haven&#39;t seen that anywhere else in Colorado yet. They have their awards from international pizza competitions framed on the wall. They&#39;re all written in Italian...&#39;nuff said there too. 

They top it off (no pun intended) with really friendly and prompt service. I haven&#39;t tried their delivery yet, but they said they deliver within a pretty decent radius of the shop.

They have high quality ingredients and specialized crusts. You pretty much can see exactly what&#39;s going into your pizza on their menu, which is neat. The menu shows the type of dough you&#39;re getting depending on the style of pizza you choose (Detroit, Chicago, New York, Gluten-Free, etc.) It&#39;s nice they have gluten and vegan-friendly pizzas as an option for those who have the need. 

We got one gluten-free pizza and one Chicago-style cracker thin pizza. We personalized both pizzas and added 3 ingredients on the gluten-free and did a half and half with a total of 5 toppings on the Chicago-style thin pizza. We had two glasses of mid-range red wines. A friend next to us had the Detroit-style pizza, so we were able to try 3 different pizzas. 

We enjoyed the pizzas, there wasn&#39;t anything super special about them, but they were good. Though, the Detroit was definitely the star. The issue I have with this place is that it&#39;s overpriced for a pizza joint, especially when there are other great pizza joints not far from it. 

Our bill for the one small and one regular size pizza with 2 glasses of mid-range red wine was $120 before tip. That is just insane. I would much rather go to Parisi for an authentic Italian-style pizza or Hops and Pie for a specialty pizza, both down the street on Tennyson and also use high-quality ingredients, for a fraction of the cost we paid at Blue Pan. Unless you go here on a Weekly special night or the lunch special day, you&#39;re bound to be overpaying."

They are both soo, soo good though, it&#39;s tough to call, so I suggest you get both. They let you get half and half pizzas. The gobs of ricotta cheese on top are amazing.

Yes. I&#39;ve been &#34;Pizza Crazy&#34; for my entire life. It is a statement of simple fact that literally we are what we eat. And god am I a walkin&#39; piece of pepperoni pizza right now. Just had a large slice of it at the best Detroit-style pizza joint in town--the Blue Pan in Highlands. 

The crust, oh the crust . . . I could go on about it forever. But instead of just raving, let me give you some advice about how to maximize your PC experience at Blue Pan: get two small pieces instead of one large piece as I, a Detroit-style neophyte, ordered. It&#39;s a tad more expensive to get the same total square footage of pizza that way, but by that approach you multiple your pleasure two-fold when you crunch down on the crusted cheese at the edges of your square slices. And wow, that my friend is one of the secrets about what it is to be  &#34;Detroit-style.&#34; The lightness, yet the airiness and mouth-feel of the crust and cheese at the edges when combined with the richness of the sauce and the spicy tingle of the pepperoni. There&#39;s  just no better combination of tastes in the street food world (well, except for the perfect 5 star New York-style slice:).

If you look back on my writings about pizza you&#39;ll see that I have never before thought any pizza I&#39;ve had was rated 5 stars. That remains the case with respect to New York-style pizza. But with respect to Detroit-style pizza . . . I can die a happy PC man. Blue Pan, I&#39;m having you served at my wake. At least I&#39;ll know that someone there will be having fun.

I have loved Detroit style pizza before I even knew that was what you called it. The dough is airy and there is no crust around the edges. Instead of crust there is a delicious crispy cheese border around the pizza. YUM. 

Blue Pan does Detroit style right. Kudos for having the Detroit favorite, Faygo, on the menu. They give you a 32 oz resealable bottle so if you can&#39;t consume around 100 g of sugar at one time you can save some and drink it with your leftover pizza the next day.

Grab a couple small pizzas and share with your friends. The amount of topping options available is unbelievable. And even though I say to share, and I planned to share when I went this past week, it might be tough to be willing to part with a piece of your pizza once you find out how delicious it is. I speak from experience. I got the Koto (I think?) it&#39;s vegetarian and instead of a standard pizza sauce they cover it in a delicious spinach and artichoke spread and top it with fresh tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. I can&#39;t get over how good this was that night and how amazing it was reheated the next day.

The place is small, but the servers are great. It gets crowded around dinner time, especially on Monday when they have their 2 for 1 small pizza deal. The prices can get a little expensive when you look at it on a price per slice basis. You have to remember the quality toppings that are involved and how much better this pizza is than your standard delivery pizza. Then you&#39;ll come to the conclusion that it&#39;s totally worth it. And if you don&#39;t? Just come on a Monday and get the 2 for 1 special. You can&#39;t tell me that two delicious pizzas for under $20 isn&#39;t a steal."

It&#39;s quite possibly some of the best pie out there.  Detroit style pizza - yeah, I hadn&#39;t heard of it either.  Not cheap, but WORTH IT.  I promise.  

It was New Years Eve.  We arrived at a party where there was to be lots of drinking and there wasn&#39;t much food.  We had, irresponsibly, not eaten before we showed up and thought it would be nice to treat our new friends to some pizza.  Great reviews, excellent menu - we thought we&#39;d give it a try.  

Let me tell you about this pizza.  The dough is phenomenal.  It&#39;s not as thick as Chicago style but still robust and chewy and perfectly crispy.  We got two different pizzas - the Tomato Pie and the Parma Italia.  Both were terrific.  The toppings were great and the outer crust is maybe heaven in your mouth.  Crunchy and cheesy and...crunchy cheese!  We need more of these Blue Pan locations EVERYWHERE.  I hope you try it and I hope you love it."

And I should be. I grew up eating Buddy&#39;s pizza--that&#39;s the Conant and 6 Mile pizza operation where it all started, as acknowledged by Blue Pan on its website. I recently moved from Austin, home of Via 313--which does a darn fine job at Detroit-style pizza. So yes, I had high hopes for Blue Pan. (That is not a Denver/CO joke.) 

Alas.

I admit some fault on my part. I chose the &#34;Greek&#34; pizza, normally meant for a NY style pizza, which Blue Pan also makes. I definitely should get something with fewer toppings, maybe one of the &#34;award-winning&#34; combinations. Also perhaps my fault, I ordered it carry-out instead of eating in at the tiny-and-packed-at-seven-pm-on-a-Saturday brick-and-mortar location. By the time I retrieved the pizza and got home to consume it, the pie was lukewarm at best. (Though I picked it up in precisely the 30 minutes the website told me it would take. Perhaps not entirely my fault?) Next time, I&#39;m go early and eat in. (Yes, I plan there to be a next time. More on that later.)

But the toppings chosen for the Greek pizza were poor. The tomatoes were cherry tomatoes, halved and placed on top of the already cooked pizza. The spinach was raw and not wilted, hardly cooked. There were far too many olives. I effectively had a salad atop the pizza, which doesn&#39;t make any sense. I actually broiled the pizza in my oven when I came home to cook the toppings and remelt the cheese.

So, my pizza was overall quite disappointing. And expensive; too expensive for 4 slices of mediocre pizza. But there were signs of hope. After reheating/recooking my pizza, ends of each slice had the familiar crispy, cheesy glint typical of Detroit-style pizzas. That is why on a future visit, I would eat in at the restaurant. Then there would be a better chance of having that hot, melty goodness from the first bite without a second trip to the hot box. 

I&#39;ll give Blue Pan another chance (and the benefit of my doubt). I hope the second trip, with changes to my selections and (hopefully) the resulting quality, has a better outcome."

We sent friends one evening who arrived casually late on a Saturday night so the wait was 40 minutes or so.

And that&#39;s mostly what we did. We got the Brooklyn Bridge. It was beautiful and genuinely tasty. Great crust. Flavorful meat. ...Except - and this feels really whiny - the pizza was lukewarm to cool :/ I tried so hard to ignore the temperature, but biting into a cool pizza (the ricotta on top was even colder) was just totally deflating. 

I don&#39;t guess that would keep me from going back. There&#39;s no doubt a more normal, straight-from-the oven-type pizza would be killer. I have to think it was a one off. But today sort of bummed me out."

Three of us (2 adults, 1 toddler) went on a Saturday at 5pm and found four-top table (lucky!) immediately. Detroit Style pizza (large, Mountain Top) took about 15-20 minutes to arrive and it didn&#39;t feel like a long wait. Rectangular DSP crust is very crunchy and a tad on the oily side, but it&#39;s a different and delicious take on the usual crust.The restaurant is small but airy, and it has good music (R&amp;B, rock) through the speakers. There was a bar with about 6-7 stools and about 7-8 tables throughout. I think the wait could be a lot longer if you don&#39;t time your arrival correctly. 2-hour street parking in front of the restaurant.

The service? Well...I couldn&#39;t be too mad at the waitress because she was super nice, but she was incredibly spacey and disorganized. She messed up our order, brought us things we didn&#39;t order and didn&#39;t bring things we did. It worked out more in our favor than not, and she was aware of each mistake and apologetic.

I decided to order one from Blue Pan after hearing so much about it. I learned a few things.

1 - It is NOT cheap. It isn&#39;t Chicago style pizza expensive, where each slice is a potential meal so you expect to pay a lot for a whole pie, but it is premium priced.

2. Brick cheese is STRONG. I like sharp strong cheeses, and the Blue Pan brings them hard here. Brick cheese looks like mozzarella  when melted on a pizza, but the taste is much stronger.

3. It is very very good. I wouldn&#39;t order one of these for dinner while pounding out a paper, but for dinner with the family, or eating a couple slices and saving the rest it works.

I ordered pick up, but the neighborhood is very cool and the staff at the serving station seemed friendly - I could see doing a date night at the location."

The crust on the Detroit-style is delicious and covered in cheese around the outsides that has caramelized a bit. My husband usually throws his crust away, but didn&#39;t this time. The toppings they use are high quality and meld really well together. They do have a BBQ chicken and a pineapple pie, but most of their pizza toppings are very traditional.

I landed in Denver after a long day of flying and just wanted to pass out. I found Blue Pan and called for delivery. I was surprised there was a 60-90 minute wait, nothing out of the ordinary for a delivery place people love. If I lived here in Denver, I&#39;d be happy to wait a while to have this pizza appear at my doorstep. But I was hungry, NOW (like Schwarzenegger) and decided to order a 4-slice portion, 2 slices of Brooklyn Bridge and 2 slices of Parma Italia. 

They said it&#39;d take 30 minutes and I showed up about 50 minutes later. Easy to find with GPS. It&#39;s a small place and I like that about it. They only just opened in June 2015 and the owner commented on another review saying they have plans to expand. Can you just come to Boston instead? 

At pick up, the staff was smiley and friendly. I paid about $22. This makes sense to me given the volume of food (4 pieces really is a 2-person serving) and quality of ingredients. 

When I got back to my rental place, I decided to have a few beers and make some phone calls. I waited about 90 minutes before heating up the oven. So at this point the pizza was almost 3 hours old. I put the oven on 400, the pizza on some tin foil, and heated for 5 minutes. Then I heated for 5 more minutes at 350 and slid the slices onto a plate. 

It&#39;s hard to describe this pizza. It&#39;s everything you&#39;d expect from using the best ingredients. It looks like a deep dish but acts like something else. The standout is the dough and crust. It was delicious on both the Brooklyn and the Parma Italia... crunchy and buttery on the bottom of the pizza, all the way through to the crust which is nice and cheesy. 

Want to go back for breakfast. 

Tips:
-If it&#39;s your first time get the Detroit style pizza. Go to their website. It says &#34;Authentic Detroit Style Pizza&#34;. That&#39;s their jam! Lots of awards. 
-Follow the reheat process I used. It worked pretty well.
-There&#39;s a Yelper on here with 600+ reviews claiming he&#39;s going to serve Blue Pan at his own wake. David M, I like your style. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9KPEd4l0S-dlWiXWtthtrA. Go to Blue Pan."

We ordered 2 small Detroit style pizzas thru postmates. We got the Brooklyn bridge and the prima. Both were fantastic. The crust, sauce and toppings were Devine. By far the best pizza we&#39;ve had since living in Denver. There are some close runner ups and I don&#39;t need to name them as they are also on yelp with rave reviews. 

I didn&#39;t give 5 stars because Blue Pan is pricy for &#34;PIZZA&#34; I mean yes it&#39;s delicious but nothing will justify almost $20 for a small pizza- 4 square slices. 

Blue pan isn&#39;t your authentic pizzeria. We travel to Italy for that and spend around $10 a pie and its thin and phenomenal. Blue pan at least the &#34;Detroit pizza&#34; pizza is thick, yet airy and super buttery. That&#39;s what makes this pizza so good.

I got the Detroit style pizza called Brooklyn Bridge. I got one for myself but it could have fed two people. After we were done was my real issue with the place. There was only two wait staff working and with a rush of people they were really slammed to say the least. After we finished to the time we paid and left was 30 minutes because they took a long time to come over to us and realize we were done. When they eventually brought our check it was wrong and needed to be changed. All this time they were waiting on all the other people so I do get it but waiting that long after you are finished to pay your bill is a bit much. The employees were doing the best they could so I would say that&#39;s more of an issue with management not staffing correctly. Again the food was really good but if I go back it will be for take out not dinning in."

Since when did Detroit get it&#39;s own style of pizza??  Well, I&#39;m glad they did because it&#39;s amazing!!

The flavors and crust doesn&#39;t compare to anything else.  By far the best pizza we&#39;ve had in Denver.  It&#39;s so good that we went back a week later.  

Only downside is that the place is super tiny, but it&#39;s worth it!"

Was humored to find another pizza place in this location since we liked the former.  I was interested in trying the Chicago cracker crust but was talked into Detroit style this time.  The staff was great and the order was ready when we arrived.  We got a large Rocky Mountain and the sausage and pepperoni was supposed to be isolated on its own half.  It was, but we are pretty sure we just got half of the amount instead of moving the other half over.  The toppings were sparse.  The crust was thicker than expected but that might be what Detroit style is.  Overall the flavor was OK but the lack of topping and price paid really makes me question if I need to try the Chicago style or just take a pass and look elsewhere next time.

Staff: great
Flavor: OK
Value: Meh"

Let me start by saying I work close by, so whenever lunchtime rolls around Blue Pan always pops up in my mind. They have a great lunch special called The Square Deal, which includes a 6&#34;x 6&#34; two topping Detroit style pizza, a side salad, a drink, and a little dessert for $11.00. That price is a steal compared to their normal pizza prices, so lunch is usually when I stop by. I got myself a bacon and artichoke pizza last time and it was delicious. Their side salads are solid, and you have an option between the house salad and the caesar (both tasty). Their little dessert is awesome as well.. its a Oreo cookie crust with ice cream, whipped cream and cherries on top, drizzled with chocolate. Yum! They have won a bunch of awards, and I see why.. everything I&#39;ve eaten there has been fantastic. Definitely give this place a go if you&#39;re in the mood for cheesy deep dish done right!"

We always get a large Brooklyn Bridge.  It&#39;s not Chicago-style deep dish, so the toppings are on top of the cheese.  More like the deepest pan pizza you&#39;ve ever had. They melt additional cheese around the crust so it&#39;s like a cross between cheesy bread and pizza. Insane.

Can&#39;t recommend Blue Pan enough.  They have a tiny dining room so get there early, if you want to eat-in.  Best thick-crust pizza in town."

Minus one star only because the actual restaurant is teeny tiny and even if you manage to get a table, it feels cramped and the hungry people still waiting for a table are feet away staring you down, so not the most enjoyable dining experience. However, it is all totally worth it for this pizza. 
Do yourself a favor and get the Detroit Style. The Brooklyn Bridge is my personal favorite, but my group ordered several pizzas, and even the non-Detroit ones were pretty delicious. I don&#39;t live in Denver anymore, but I plan to drag my parents here every time I visit (not that they need to be dragged, my whole family loves this place)!"

The sauce is as pizza sauce should be. Fresh and 
unf€$!/ked with. You actually taste delicious fresh tomato instead of sugar, oregano and whatever else most joints do to ruin their sauces.

The cheese is perfect. They obviously don&#39;t skimp on the quality of the cheese. Tasty, not too greasy but not too ungreasy if you can imagine that.

But crust is off the hook. The time, technique and ingredients used to produce the base for this incredible pie are second to none. Ask them about it. It&#39;s good pizza crust trivia that you will find no where else.

I usually get the Detroit Style Tomato Pie.... Blue Pan produces one of the most respectable pies in the Mile High. And there aren&#39;t a whole hell of lot of them out there.....

Friendly spot, expeditious as you can be in an incredibly busy and small space..... and I&#39;ve been here way more times than I would like to admit. Yeah it&#39;s small so if you like to spread out, get it to go already."

Now onto the most important part : the taste of the food!
I really enjoy a good pizza. I always order a cheese pizza at any place I go to so that I can really taste the quality of the cheese and the sauce. I ordered the Detroit style pizza  and the Italian style pizza. Both of the pizza have won awards in the past. More so then the sauce and the cheese both of the crusts were really what caught my attention. The attention to detail in these two crust was Great and really showed in the taste of the pizza&#39;s. I am impressed! The Italian pizza had a crust that was just the right thickness and crispy at the same time;perfect medium. The Detroit pizza style  was nice and airy with a cheesy crispy finish in the crust. These crusts were definitely in the list of my favorites."

We were greeted by Giles the owner who welcomed us inside, what a cool guy! We learned about the technique used to make their pizza as well as the many national and international awards they&#39;ve won.

The pizza is aesthetically appetizing and incredibly tasty. All of the toppings work in unison for a fantastic flavor. They all sit on top of a unique crust that&#39;s light, chewy and crunchy. I ordered the Mountain Top which was outstanding.

They use plenty of garlic (which I like on pizza) and the ingredients seem really fresh and delicious.  

They&#39;ve got a decent choice of beers to drink and the staff seems very friendly.  The seating is limited (place is small), so if It&#39;s crowded it&#39;s easy to get something to go.

My wife and I brought our child here and ordered him the two meatballs and garlic bread off of the children&#39;s menu, and we ordered a small pizza to share. When our child&#39;s food came out, only one meatball (not two; just one) arrived. We asked where the other one was, and our waitress said, &#34;Uh... it looks like the menu has changed and there&#39;s only one; it&#39;s probably because the meatballs are really big.&#34;

I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m any sort of meatball expert, but if the menu says two meatballs, I expect two meatballs. We then asked about the garlic bread that was supposed to accompany the meatballs. The waitress said it would be right up, and upon another server&#39;s arrival, we received plain sliced bread. This server made some comment about there never being garlic bread and it was a mistake. Come on! Two menu mistakes? That sounds like lazy cooks and servers to me.

When our pizza arrived, our toppings were cold. It&#39;s as if they had a pre-cooked pizza and just dumped our toppings on-top and sent it out. If I&#39;m paying $20 for 4 pieces of pizza, I should at least see some sort of indication that our toppings and pizza have hit the oven together for even just a few minutes.

To make things worse, I couldn&#39;t even complain to our server, as she only came around to drop off our food and never spoke to us again. It was as if she was intentionally ignoring us, as I nearly had to physically block her to ask for her check.

I&#39;ll never bring my family back here again."

We got the Detroit style half Brooklyn half 313.  While they were both good, this is a type of pizza that is best kept classic.  Sausage, Pepperoni, ricotta go really well with it.  I felt like this is not the pizza for arugula and fancy Italian meats.  Sometimes something doesn&#39;t need to be fancy to be straight up delicious.  Stick with the usual suspects in the world of pizza ingredients and you will be much happier.  

The only downside to this place is it is TINY!  The dining room is rather uncomfortable, but the great service helped make up for it.

Yelp said this restaurant was kid/family friendly, it&#39;s not. The food they did provide for my kids was an over salted, spicy ground beef in tiny taco shells. 

My wifes meal, the enchaladas, was &#34;ok.&#34; My meal, the chili rellanos, was awful! One chili had cheese the other had flavorless ground beef, both sat around too long after being fried and got soggy. The rice we got was over cooked and flavorless. 

One bright spot was the house tequilla, nice earthy flavor that came through in the drinkbut even that was ruined by the length of time that elapsed between ordering and receiving my house margarita. A house marg, it shouldn&#39;t take that long. 

The atmosphere was cramped and loud with the tables too close together. 

$7 dollars for chips and salsa it outrageous. I feel bad now for leaving 15% cause non of my complaints about this place are the waiters fault, sorry for that. $125 for rellanos, enchaladas and 4 street tacos is outrageous. Next time I&#39;ll take my family to our local hole in the wall and have a feast for that amount of money."

I brought a group visiting from out of town and was completely embarrassed that I chose the restaurant. I based it on yelp reviews.

Prices are way too high for the portions I can forgive that knowing they are local and organic but I wouldn&#39;t have unless we didn&#39;t complain and get the explanation from the Serbian manager.

None of us drank and I believe that many of the favorable reviews are due to the alcohol not the food.

The food is just slightly above average in flavor but the rice and beans are what marks an authentic and delicious Mexican restaurant. Mine were cold and flavorless.

Service broke down the second they sensed a complaint.

Atmosphere was too loud and a bit cramped.

I will not be returning to this restaurant I wish I knew of an alternative in the area for Mexican but there are plenty of other cuisines available.
I&#39;m not even going into the inappropriate name."

No sign. Why? This is out of respect to the city of Denver. El Chingon was a name that was the idea of the affable owner Lorenzo&#39;s dad. It means &#34;Bad Ass&#34; well at least that&#39;s the tame translation of it :) But this has become to me almost like an exclusive bad ass place to go eat some bad ass tacos. 

This is the owner Lorenzo&#39;s first restaurant venture. It&#39;s a baby at about two plus years old. El Chingon is making waves in the foodie world. My friends talked about his offered dishes and drinks. They swear by it and having visited the place twice I agree 100%.

All it takes is one bad first time experience and I&#39;m sometimes one of those people that will never go back. Simply because there&#39;s so much good restaurants out there. Denver is thriving with excellent places to visit. My first time here was a realization that I do like tacos. Just not all tacos. 

Consistency is paramount to success in the food business. This place warranted a second visit to confirm a five star rating. I am not a taco person at all. All these years I refused to eat taco. It&#39;s wet and it falls apart and its messy! I would say if you come to visit EC you must try their Shrimp Taco. Succulent shrimps, three of them total in one taco with some guac, salsa and some spice will make you a fan. I am! Best reason of all? It&#39;s not messy! The taste? To. Die. For. I ate four orders last night. Yeah. I&#39;m a complete Shrimp Taco fan at EC.

I&#39;ve tried both ceviches on their menu as well. Get this too! The Flautas as well. The Carnitas steak taco is very tasty but I&#39;m in love with the shrimp taco!

Now these are all the food and drinks I had the first time. I went back and tried them all again. Consistently awesome. 

Now the drinks. This is by far my favorite bartender. Chris is El Chingons heart. He&#39;s very personable. His demeanor is perfectly suited for his job. He&#39;s friendly but he&#39;s very professional. He&#39;s classy.  Great memory and totally remembers his customers. You don&#39;t have a fave drink? Or you just want to let the dice roll and have Chris take over? Best bet! He&#39;s the kind that would only ask you a couple of questions pertaining to what you like and don&#39;t. I&#39;m a bourbon girl. So that&#39;s my base. He made me some pretty tasty drinks. Go ahead. Try him!

Not a pro tip( not yet): but as someone who knows a good deal. Every Tuesday of the week is Happy Hour all day!

Now thats a badass HH that goes with their bad ass food!"

Funny thing is, the guy working at the car rental place at the airport recommended this place. We raised eyebrows thinking that this guy was getting commission. We took the leap of faith and gave it a try!

Before coming here, don&#39;t get it confused with the other Mexican restaurant, Los Chingones. We were super confused for the longest time.

Upon arrival, the place was pretty packed, but luckily we made last minute reservations. It&#39;s a cute, modern restaurant with food packed with tons of flavor! I love how the meat is organic and everything tasted fresh. Their margaritas aren&#39;t loaded with a ton of sugar, too! Also, the green sauce is amazing. Be sure to pour generously with your food.

The food:
- Chips &amp; Guacamole: Addicting. The guacamole was so, so good!!! And generous portion, too. They give you fresh, warm chips with bottomless refills!
- Chille Rellenos: a MUST get. My bf and I loved this so much, we ordered a second plate of this. We were so full, but our tastebuds screamed for more!!
- Chicken Enchiladas: this was flavorful and good, but I would probably pass this and go for the chille rellenos.
- Churros: Fresh churros. Yum! 

The server was super sweet and very helpful, too. She let us sample the salted oreo ice cream, which ended up tasting odd, so she happily switched it out with the churros. I especially love restuarants that are cozy, and this one definitely is... the owner/manager greets all the tables to make sure everyone is well accommodated :) I&#39;ll definitely be back if I&#39;m ever around visiting Denver!"

It&#39;s just not cool, people.  I don&#39;t need hands on my shoulder, arm, back, squeezie squeeze.  Ewww.  Everything WAS just fine, your hands on my body didn&#39;t enhance my food experience.

The place was tiny, maybe 800 square feet, and thus, very loud/echo-y. The room was filled with Bronco&#39;s nuts yelling and screaming out loud. This confused us since it&#39;s supposed to be a bit of a high-end restaurant. 

We entered and stood in the doorway awkwardly with no welcome. Finally got a table for our party of 5. 

We browsed the menu and were shocked by the prices. $6.50 for chips &amp; salsa? The chips arrived, and there were about 15 chips. Granted they were hot and delicious, but the portions were just way too small for the prices. 

Also, when we received a new plate of chips, it had a mysterious meaty looking item on it. (3 of the 5 of us were vegetarian.) A fried pinkie finger perhaps.

Got the vegetarian enchiladas, which I was told would have mushrooms in it, but after ordering I was informed they were all out. Bummer! Guess I&#39;ll have beans and cheese instead. Lame. $16 for that.

Our waiter was nice, but impatient with us. In all I grant a generous &#34;tres estrella&#34; rating."

They have a small patio on the front which is two tables. It&#39;s great to sit out front (outside) in the warm times. It&#39;s very quaint as it&#39;s an old house converted into a restaurant.

Weekend lunch is not their strong suit.  While the chips were freshly fried and perfectly salted, the $6.50 price was a bit much, even with a perfectly fresh and perfectly ordinary guacamole and a blazing hot, texture - less salsa verde.  These were served up on a chipped and crazed plate to boot.  Not exactly prime sanitation.

A palomita cocktail of tequila,  grapefruit and lime juices that fizzed lightly with grapefruit soda was tiny for $9, but delightfully dry and spicy with a peppered rim.  My dining partner enjoyed a 10 Joe IPA but was put off by dust on the rims of the water glasses.  

Before we ordered lunch, the server announced that the kitchen had run out of beans.  Really?  Nearly every item on the small lunch and brunch menus included beans. My dining partner was now completely put off and refused to order.  Ever hopeful and forgiving, I went with a carnitas burrito advertised as accompanied by tomatillo/avocado pico de gallo.

The rightly portioned carnitas were flavorful and moist, wrapped with an ordinary Spanish rice in a properly chewy - tender flour tortilla. I&#39;d responded yes to the choice of smothered, so the whole burrito was under a coat of another hot green sauce.  Unusual.  Smothered usually means chile.  Perhaps a little information could be offered at the time of asking?  The sauce was little different from the salsa verde, but was whirled to the consistency of canned tomato sauce in its preparation.   Again, an absence of texture.  The burrito was topped with more green in the form of crisp chopped romaine lettuce punctuated with uneventful chopped tomatoes and a scant dusting of grated Oaxaca cheese.  I didn&#39;t see any sign of pico de anything.  The price was $9.50.

Strangely,  as I finished my meal, beans reappeared on others&#39; orders and rice alongside, formed in a short cylinder. 

I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go back. Being located in an old charcoal gray house in trendy and ever more overcrowded Berkeley, parking is a nuisance.  The prices are high, with one plate, chips/dips, and two drinks taking a $34 chunk out of the credit card, before the tip - for lunch.  Is it worth all that?  I want it to be!  Top-rated green chile per Zagat!  What?

So, I wrote this with a heavy heart.  I wanted to rave..."

We arrived around 7:30 with a reservation. We were seated right away and the great service continued for the rest of the evening. We ordered several drinks, margaritas, a paloma, and a few of the wines; the drinks were a little heavy on the ice but delicious. At $10-$12 each, I would love to see them a dollar or two cheaper, but they weren&#39;t too over priced. For food I got the duck tacos, hubby got the spare rib and we shared the corn. The tacos were yummy, but nothing special. The spare rib, however, was AMAZING. It was a huge portion and fell apart with just a fork. The potatoes underneath were fantastic, so smooth and creamy. Needless to say I was super jealous of the hubby&#39;s choice.

It is a converted bungalow house that is not large but seems nicely appointed. There were a dozen tables approximately which were mostly empty, yet it was crowded with many people standing around the bar. We felt like we were walking into a private party. We were seated at a table to the side, but the environment was loud (there was a DJ in the back with standing room only - what do the neighbors think at this late hour??). My friend and I decided to order almost everything on the late night menu just to be able to try everything. We requested to have everything come out as it was ready. Our $5 chips, salsa and guac were a little better than average. I was underwhelmed by the scallop ceviche - it could&#39;ve been so much more than the limey bay scallops with a few slices of avocado on top. Next, we split one carne asada taco and my two pieces of steak were grizzly. The flautas were just ok until I start thinking about how much each one cost and my neighborhood Mexican restaurant down the street has much better flautas that are less pricey. One of my favorite dishes was the most confounding at first - it looked like a salad plate when we order papas. After removing an entire head of sliced romaine lettuce off the top of the plate, we found our papas which were yummy. Overall, items were pretty spicey but nothing was over-salted. I think when you look at what you get on your plate and how much does it cost, the items are more expensive than they should be. All dishes were very well presented. Our service was good, but not excellent, but above average - everyone was friendly. My overall feeling is that I probably won&#39;t go back to this establishment - I&#39;ve been there once and that was enough. If a friend asked me if I recommended it to them, I&#39;d probably give them the names of other restaurants to go to instead... If I value my reputation with my friends."

I saw carnitas on the menu and almost didn&#39;t order it because whenever I try to order it from Mexican places it comes out either too fatty or too salty. I was talked into it and it was delicious. Two big chunks of perfectly prepared pork over a tasty sauce. The service was great, the atmosphere was excellent and the prices were fair."

I got the Pollo Asada tacos which had a pretty good kick to them. The house marg (or two ) was (were) perfect to wash down the heat.  A bit pricey, but you pay for the quality you get. The best part, though, was the staff and owners. They were so fun and friendly that it felt like you were hanging out at a friend&#39;s house, underscored by the fact that the restaurant space is in a converted old bungalow. I&#39;ll definitely be back, with friends, maybe tomorrow."

PRO TIP: La Pistola Margarita ain&#39;t no joke! Spicy and refreshing

Thinking a return to El Chingon is in my near future..."

Ordered a few drink and an app that took forever as we waited on our drinks. So excited for my margarita and it was terrible. Our braised short rib app was not the best either and tortillas would have been nice to enjoy the sauce . Wish he would have asked how things were . We were hoping for such a good experience . Asked for our check which was dropped and then we waited 20 minutes  or so to see him . I was ready to leave but my boyfriend waited . Just bummed that we can&#39;t enjoy a neighborhood spot. We have so many good ones

If you&#39;re wanting something on the lighter side, the Kale salad with chicken is amazing with the balsamic dressing, strawberries and quinoa. The barbracoa and the chicken tacos are very good. I also really enjoy their selection of margs. This is a great place to go if you&#39;re craving Mexican, but want something more on the lighter side of the spectrum."

The service, not so much. My brother and I were seated and a server didn&#39;t come to take our order for a good 15 mins . I had enough time to go to the bar to order our drinks. I&#39;m sorry, but im not sitting at the bar, so I shouldn&#39;t have to get up to get water and a drink from the bartender . We are talking 4 people in this entire restaurant and you can&#39;t even bring us a drink or menu for 15+ mins.  Super disappointed considering the food and drinks were great.

We have never been before, and our first time was indescribable! Food, drinks, and staff were all amazing. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone. The treat you like family and provides a warm and inviting environment. When you go, if you like spice, be sure to try the Pistola. It&#39;s one of the best cocktails I have ever had.

Sat outside and it started to sprinkle. The staff promptly came over and helped move the table further under a canopy. The owner asked if we wanted to move inside and we said that we were fine. 10-15 seconds later it started hailing. The staff immediately helped us inside with our drinks, food and personal items. 

By far the most outgoing, appreciative and professional staff we have encountered. You can get good food and drinks at a number of locations, but the attention to the needs of guests and the genuine appreciation the staff shows is second to none. Plus, the food and drinks are top notch  

Chips are served warm. Salsa has bite. The carnitas was exceptional and the drinks are always incredible. Amaretto foam with bourbon and ginger...wow. 

Will continue to return. Thank you for the excellent evening!"

The staff was so friendly, drinks were interesting and yummy. The food was a big step up from most Mexican restaurants. I had the chilies rellenos at the waiter&#39;s recommendation. We ordered six different entries and everyone was very happywith their choices, but the favorite of the table was the chilies.  We loved the salads, and fresh chips and guacamole too!  The owner stopped and chatted with us. Not in a pushy intrusive way, just genuinely a great guy. We are from out of town and he gave us advice on other great eats in the neighborhood so we could skip cabs.  This will be on my list of places to hit next time in min Denver for sure."

This place had good drinks and food but what we got was far less than what we payed for. Our waiter accidentally ordered our food wrong and brought out some before others and also brought us an extra dish we did not order. Not a problem the extra food was welcome. The rest of our order was incorrect though. I also accidentally spilled my drink and asked for a replacement  it took around 25 minutes for the replacement and it was the wrong drink. Another 10 minutes and I finally got the waiters attention and he said it was his mistake he would get me the right one. That never happened. I was only charged for one but was a little disappointed in the service. The food tasted good but was a little over priced for what was served. I most likely will not go back here again."

My boyfriend and I both got the enchiladas, which were very good, but also very spicy, even with the mild salsa. I was charged $.75 for a little extra sour cream, which I thought was a little cheap/tacky considering the price of the food.

They were topped with thinly sliced bananas and strawberries!  You could add duck legs too, similar to chicken and waffles. Everything on the table looked amazing though!  The cocktails also looked delicious but I didn&#39;t have any.  Very cute restaurant.  The owner or manager was super friendly and checked in on us multiple times!

The table certainly didn&#39;t appear to be occupied unless people are now invisible.  

As we tried to move away from this incredibly bullish man, he literally pushed me out of the way with his rear-end.  He then began to raise his voice about the hostess and how this was all her fault.  

We asked for another table but the hostess took off to look for another table and never returned.  Clearly, we were not welcome nor treated as customers.  All four of use moved outside to regroup - the waiter followed us out and was still attempting to belittle and blame the hostess.  Not once did he attempt to remedy the situation, apologize for the mix up or help to find a better.  We are all home owners who live within walking distance to this restaurant.

now at 5 stars
HH + dinner was top-of-the-line delicious
my only negative is that they now have TVs

24SEP2014
Tortas de Carne! A new, delicious item.
A much improved wine list with some bargains (Zardetto Prosecco at $22).
The back patio is fun.

18DEC2013
Went for Happy Hour and Dinner.
Excellent cocktails. Fresh ingredients and mixed just right.
The HH Ceviche was delicious. Fresh fish and just the right amount of time in the acid.
But, the Papas Chingon! OMG. These are not &#34;chile cheese fries&#34;. These are the best potatoes + chile verde + cheese (a light touch) that you will ever eat.
Chuleta for dinner. Pink, as ordered. With a bit a salsa verde and corn. (They have huitlacoche in the kitchen. Ask them to replace the corn with huitlacoche and you will be very happy.)
Trio of Little Man ice cream for dessert .

05DEC2013
A solid 4 stars. Very much recommended.

The food is handcrafted and in the style of Mexico City. Delicious Mexican (not Tex-Mex) food.

+ Tostada (carnitas), 2 for $8.50. Excellent. Definitely Mexican style (not Tex-Mex). very different (slightly sweet) taste to the carnitas.
+ Chips &amp; Salsa - excellent. The chips are cooked after you place your order.
+ Decor and overall atmosphere. Very clean black and white. Skylights and plenty of windows.
+ Temperature. 5° F outside and very comfortable inside.
+ Intimate. Seats 36 inside. &#34;Patio is coming in the Spring&#34;.
+ Cloth napkins.
+ Halogen PAR 30 pot lights. Good clean white light.
+ Chairs. Padded. Comfortable.
+ Flatware. Good weight Oneida.
+ No TV. Yea!
+ Service. Attentive. Knowledgeable.
+ Wi-Fi. Just ask for the password.

- Menu font. Horrible choice. Painful to decipher.
- Website is broken. Completely.

And there are things that I don&#39;t enjoy, like the prices and small issues.  I had the enchiladas verdes, which contained three small corn enchiladas with pulled chicken and smothered in a green chile sauce.  They were good, but I am not sure about the $12 price tag.  My fiancé had the $15 carnitas which is a meat-centric dish with pickled onions and chile verde sauce underneath and corn tortillas on the side.  The meat was tough and was brought back.  The waiter did everything right, except charging him for the dish when it came back tough again.  The waiter appreciated the feedback and overall was very nice...but we were puzzled by the charge after he admitted there was something wrong with the preparation.

Other than that, I noticed that management was very congenial and the tone of the atmosphere was nice.  If I go back, I would love to try the ceviche which is not a normal dish served at restaurants around the area and I applaud them for standing out."

That&#39;s our take on El Chingon.
  
3 unrelated, not-good things:  our waitress(and everyone else that came by our table) seemed unhappy to be there, our table was sticky, and happy hour food options stink for vegetarians.  (But then again, the dinner menu pretty much stinks for vegetarians, as well.)
2 good things:  the $2 Modelo was cold, and the salsa was spicy and pretty delicious(I even put it on the awful flavorless unripe &#34;heirloom tomato&#34; appetizer to help choke &#39;em down), so I guess I&#39;ll give them a 2nd star just for those things.

Final complaint:  the chips&amp;salsa took forever to come out, and we were told it&#39;s because everything is made to order, &#34;even the chips.&#34;  Sounds great, right?  Well, we might have actually believed it... if the chips were even remotely warm.   
They weren&#39;t, we don&#39;t, and we won&#39;t soon be back to ol&#39; El Chingon."

I went to El Chingon for the first time last night as a dinner date with my wife.  WOW! great time, great food, great drinks! Rarely will you find a bartender that tends to customers that dine in but sit at the bar, but ours definitely did.  I had the carnitas tacos and my wife had the enchiladas. Both were very tasty and packed some heat.  I&#39;ve had carnitas at many different restaurants, but theirs are some of the best.  My wife had a drink (I can&#39;t remember the full name of the drink but ended with &#39;Flor&#39;) that was one of the tastiest mixed drinks I think I&#39;ve had.

My husband and I came in on a whim on a Wednesday night, it was about half full and we were greeted and seated right away.  Our server Phil was friendly and gave us good recommendations and history of the chief and their food.   

I had enchiladas and the hubby had carnitas.  We were amazed.  The freshness, taste and tenderness of the carnitas were second to none.  Literally it falls apart in deliciousness.  AND is was a GIANT piece of meat, and for only $15?!?  Impressive.  My enchiladas were superb, the sauce was just enough spice and I love the green tomatillo sauce.  Ramon, the chef, came out to talk which was a nice treat, and we heard about his cooking history and his mothers background.

I liked the Arvada location and the family that owns this restaurant is very cool. The new digs are very nice and the new patio that they recently opened is going to be a hit. I&#39;ve only eaten here once although I&#39;ve meant to check them out for quite a while now. I ordered the rellenos this time because if you&#39;re going to show your skills in the kitchen, I feel a simple relleno is a good vehicle to do it with. The rellenos came out and the server poured the small metal server of the &#34;el caldillo de jitomate&#34; over the dish. Nice touch but really not an amazing but rather a decent presentation. The rellenos and rice it was served with were good. I guess my problem is that I&#39;m also an OG Denver northsider. Chingon means badass! i.e. &#34;You wanna throw some chingasos with me puta madre?&#34; The flavors although good weren&#39;t &#34;badass&#34;. It doesn&#39;t have to have chile heat to be badass but it needs to have a &#34;I&#39;ll punch you in your MF&#39;ing mouth!&#34; kind of flavor punch for me to consider it badass. No doubt, the gringos will swoon over this uppity fare but if I were bragging about the size of my cojones, I  would want to show everyone my corazón y machismo on a plate. Bring it homies!

yeah, i&#39;m a silly ass OG northsider. What the fuck do I know. Just speaking from the heart to people I felt have a lot of heart. Bueno fortuna ECMB."

Great flavor and made with Modelo Negro (which you get the rest of the bottle to top off your drink as you go).

Last time I went, the bartender (Valentina) was super friendly, and chatted with my sister-in-law and I the entire time we were at the bar. I love that - the whole reason I sit at the bar is so I can interact with other people, and she was incredibly fun and attentive. Our waters were never empty, and she checked in to make sure we were good on food and drinks.

As far as the food goes, I&#39;ve only tried a couple things. My brother ordered the smothered chicken burrito, and the chicken tasted ah-mazing. I don&#39;t know if they smoke it or just spice it really well, but it had really good flavor - I almost had to order my own. I&#39;ve also had one of the salads, which was filling and had a good dressing. The only thing I would change would be to make it with mixed greens instead of romaine, but it was still good. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more of their food, and to get my Michelada fix!"

When I eat there the food is pretty good but after numerous attempts to get food to go via ordering online, this was my last try. Don&#39;t expect your food to ever be ready by the &#34;promised time&#34; if you order online. I caught on that they were always late, so I&#39;d show up five minutes late on purpose to avoid a ten minute wait. I&#39;ve tried this probably 4-5 times and have yet to wait less than 10 minutes for my order once I arrive. Today, I showed up about three minutes late and had to wait 13 minutes to get my food. When I got back to the office (which is about 4 minutes away) everything was ice cold. The fries had no warmth, neither did the turkey burger. To top it off the Turkey patty was uncooked pink meat throughout the middle. Welp my lunch just went in the trash, I&#39;m done trying. Hopefully the dine in experiences are better. :-/"

Very Clean (bathrooms were clean too) &amp; Upscale Vibe. For a Monday Night (Kids eat free meal with a purchase of an adult meal of at least $9) it wasn&#39;t too busy at all. The guy who took my order was super nice and took our order promptly and made sure he catered our order to what we wanted specifically for our burgers and fries.

Now for the food. It must have been a busy day for the cook staff... Because our order was off. Fries: Were extra crispy &amp; had salt (we asked for no salt on 2 of the orders of fries). Burgers: one kids burger had no cheese, the other kids burger had very little cheese. Both kids burgers were dry (even though they were medium well), and the buns were more grilled than usual. The kiddos usually finish their burgers off with a quickness, but they had to give us their leftover bites (because they were so dry). My burger was good (I had a gluten free bun, which was yummy) although it was missing the house sauce, and there seemed to be a lot of black pepper on all of our burgers. Hubby order was all good, though he had a lot of black pepper on his burger too.

Now, with all of that being said... I still give this place 4 stars. We got a decent meal for a discounted price (2 kids meals free), and although it lacked the luster that we are used to at another location, I&#39;m going to assume that this was just a fluke night for the cooking staff. You should still check out this location and give Larkburger a try (if you haven&#39;t already).

I got the Truffle Burger and fries. Normally I&#39;d say most places who do truffle anything are just there for the gimmick and you can barely actually taste any real truffle flavor (and I get it... stuff is expensive, but trendy) but there actually was good truffle flavor that enhanced, not overpowered, the burger. I was pleasantly surprised.

Fries were good and they give you a decent, shareable amount -- unless, of course, you are a &#34;supersize me&#34; kind of person. 

Price is reasonable for a good meal. 

I&#39;ll be back."

Based on a TO GO order....

We had these items :

*  Larkburger ($5.95)
*  Little Turkey ($3.95)
*  Chili Cup ($3.25)

My experience was slightly different after the Yelp ELITE Event here.  The guy who was behind the register counter was a little &#34;blurry&#34;.  Maybe it was a long night for him, maybe it was just me or something.  Coz he never offer me or suggest to me, if I want anything on my order, such as the Cheese etc etc..  Maybe this was indeed an isolated incident.

So the Larkburger when Hubs ate it, comes without cheese at all.  Hubs was a little disappointed.  *SAD FACE*  Another thing about the biodegradable disposable bowl they had for the Chili Cup did not hold that well, when we reached home.  Hubs said the Chili Bowl was just A-OK, with the Beans and the Ground Beef.  For my order of Little Turkey it was just A-Okay too.  Maybe we would return when needed coz I like the salad from Larkburger and we might order different items too.

Both were great and reminded me a lot of Super Burger in SF. Both have similar concepts of fresh meats and a clean and modern presentation and both are chains in a localized area. 

The meat was cooked medium rare just as I liked and the presentation was unbeatable for a fast-food ish hamburger spot. 

The only thing I disliked was the cashier girl who didn&#39;t greet me and who was super awkward. I stood there and waited for her to ask to take my order because I wasn&#39;t sure if she was busy or if she was ready/receptive for/to my order. She just stood there and stared back at me. 

The interior decor is really modern and minimalistic. There&#39;s tons of wood on the walls and furniture are all white.

My boyfriend was in Denver for work and on a weekend trip to come visit, he made me try Larkburger, swearing that it was even better than my all-time favorite burger place in NOLA (Company Burger). I, of course, told him that he was insane... next thing you know, we ate there every day of the trip. For someone like me with food allergies, coming from a part of the country that&#39;s far less allergy-friendly, this place is burger heaven. I was genuinely worried at first that they gave me the wrong bun because it was so fluffy (and tasty). Their sauce truly tops it all off! We both got the burgers, regular fries, and truffle fries at each visit, and on our last one we even got a milkshake -- which was also amazing.

The truffle fries are yummy and I would recommend to anyone who has never tried such a treat.  Next time I need to try the truffle burger.

Their fries are good, their truffle fries are better and if you are feeling like a healthy kick is needed, they have edamame. Can&#39;t say much about their drinks as I always get water but I believe they have a nice selection of bottled beer and fountain drinks.

Service is always friendly and helpful. It is basic as you go in and order, they bring it out. My only complaint is that it is slightly smokey in there but it smells so good! They do have a patio for warmer days. Parking can be challenging, they have a shared lot but it is always busy."

The truffle fries are delicious!  And I love that they do shoestring cut, my favorite!!

I love the little Lark with Tilamook cheddar; it is truly craveable when I&#39;m in the mood for a straight forward, delicious burger.  My husband had the tuna burger and it was tasty!  (Of course I stole a giant bite.)  There was so much tuna on it, a really big chunk fell off and he didn&#39;t even notice so it was perfect to share with the toddler who was quite pleased with it.  My husband commented that he wished there was more of the cilantro sauce on his burger, but wasn&#39;t inclined to request more and it certainly didn&#39;t stop him from finishing it.  My 6 year old enjoyed his burger, actually finished it!  

We also tried the &#34;$5 shakes&#34; and we were less than impressed with the chocolate flavor- something about the flavor was off, and just not to our personal liking at all. They were a nice consistency though, which is a big deal in the world of milkshakes.

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?

The fast-casual, trendy counter-order scene (that I imagine has followed Chipotle&#39;s lead) is really taking the foody scene by storm, and Larkburger really pulls it off well. Service was fast and friendly, and food is brought to your table in a setting that is suitable for either large or intimate crowds. Star Granted.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Accustomed to burgers running right around $5, I was pleased to find that Larkburger&#39;s upscale vibe didn&#39;t bump up the cost. $5.95 pre-tax for the 1/3 pound angus &#34;Larkburger&#34; was reasonable, especially considering that the weight looked accurate. Additionally, $2.95 was fair for specialty fries. Star Granted.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

This is really a tale of two menu items. Was the burger good? Sure, but to be honest, it didn&#39;t quite meet my expectation. The patty was a bit bland, and it seemed as though the reliance for flavor really fell on the toppings, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to burgs. That being said, the Parmesan Truffle fries blew. my. mind. Wow. Thin-cut, crispy and flavorful, these were truly special. One meh one great? Call it a compromise. Single Star Granted.

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I really want to say yes here to propel Larkburger above the 3-Star threshold, but I honestly can&#39;t say I would favor Larkburger any given day to say Smashburger. At the end of the day, Larkburger is A-OK, but it&#39;s nothing more. No Star Granted."

First: the burger temps were all over the place. Both mine and my husband&#39;s were Medium Larkburgers. His had no pink or maybe a hint of it, while mine looked like pink-red barely seared ground beef. Our kids had the Med-well kids lark meal and it was pretty darn dark brown. *I may not be the best chef in town but even I know the variance of medium-rare to medium to medium-well is a much smaller window than what was given us just in the 3 burgers we had and the supposed one temp variation.
Second: customer service. I brought my burger up to the counter and asked if that was what they considered medium. The girl (who really seemed like a space case) turned away w/out looking and pointed haphazardly to the menu saying &#34;Our medium is pink throughout&#34; I mentioned that both my husband&#39;s and mine were supposed to be medium and his had no pink. She said she didn&#39;t know why they were different and then just stared at me. So I stared back and then said a slow &#34;Ok.....&#34; I turned around and after several steps she hollers at my back &#34;we can remake it if you like.&#34; By this point I&#39;m kinda turned off. Also, when we were ordering she barely made eye contact and conveyed a dismissive attitude when we had questions, as my Hubs said: she couldn&#39;t be bothered, or didn&#39;t know the answer.
Third: the soda fountain was way too watered down. So we didn&#39;t drink our soda.
Fourth: trash. I&#39;m not about to sort through the trash as we&#39;re trying to leave, nice gesture, but slightly ridiculous. And I&#39;m an avid recycler/composter at home. See now I&#39;m giving too much thought to what we threw away, I think they are trying to make everything compostable/green, but then they have packets of stuff? It&#39;d be better to just have bottles or tubs and more little paper condiment things. So your customer doesn&#39;t have to sit there sorting trash.
Fifth: Holy Pepper. Never have I had a burger with so much pepper.

Pros: burger fixings seemed very fresh. Bacon was nicely cooked. Cute packing. I do like that everything seems eco friendly and naturally minded / locally sourced. The place is clean (albeit hospital sanitation white). My husband liked that there was plenty of seating (inside and outside, only 2 other tables were occupied)."

Always on the hunt for a great burger place, I was stoked to try this place out. I was surprised to see they have a limited selection of burgers on the menu and what&#39;s different about them is that they keep it simple. I got the Little Lark burger, 1/3 burger topped with cheddar cheese (they only offer one type of cheese--simplicity at it&#39;s best), just enough to satisfy the grease monster inside of me. Then my eyes shifted to the rest of the menu and saw not only did they have fries but they had Parmesan truffle fries for only $1 more. My only beef (get it.....beef...burger place...ha!) is that I hate playing french fry roulette. When I order fries I want to know if they are french fries, steak fries, shoestring fries, etc. Turned out they were shoestring Parmesan truffle fries which was all good but I just like a heads up. 

Our food came out within few minutes and I didn&#39;t even want to eat my burger since it was adorable and tiny. The fries were awesome,  full of flavor and there were about two or three left by the end of the meal. This was the perfect selection for lunch since I wanted to be full but not unbutton my pants,take a nap at my desk kind of full. Not only is Larkburger easy on the stomach but easy on the wallet-it only cost about $6 for a burger and fries."

The angus beef is rather good, but staff likes to serve it underdone. I ordered it medium and got it really rare.

The wait was beyond annoying on a Saturday afternoon around 2:00 I&#39;m fairly certain we waited at least 25 minutes to get our order. (2 burgers, 1 order of fries and a salad.) I could have gone to a sit down restaurant and been happier.

The wifey had the chicken sandwich and a side of regular fries. She said it was the best chicken sandwich she has had in a long time. We don&#39;t do KFC or Chik-fil-a, so you can measure her standards by that (whether you deem it good or bad).

Medium-rare is a pretty standard order in the burger business. They INSIST their medium is LIKE a medium-rare elsewhere. (It&#39;s not. It&#39;s like a medium.) BUT, if you order a rare burger, it is literally cold in the center and like eating steak tartare.

The truffle fries are good. And we keep coming back, because the burgers are still better than Cherry Cricket or Park Burger, the other lauded joints in town. But it&#39;d be great to get a burger cooked to our liking at a place that has such potential."

I ordered a small lark burger (well done) with parma/truffle fries and a shake.  The burger was overcooked, with the edges burnt tasting destroying all flavor.  Well done - to me - is a requirement for any burger place.  Beef is ground up, contagion gets mixed into the meat (unlike steak) so being able to cook a decent well done is paramount.  They failed.

The fries? If I wanted Steak and Shake I would of stayed in Indiana. Small annoying fries and if they sometimes put truffle on it, it must be 1 part in 1,000,000 I couldn&#39;t taste anything

Milkshake? yeah its a standard milkshake. They didn&#39;t go wrong. . but with everything else, it wasn&#39;t exceptional.  Yeah better than mcdonalds, about the same line as a Denny&#39;s milkshake.

Overall  - this place does not meet a acceptable  price/quality ratio for burgers. Why not step down an exit to Arapahoe for the east coast version of In-and-Out (Five Guys). Better fries, better selection of toppings, better price, and damn it they can cook a well done burger."

As such, I didn&#39;t give it much attention until we went there for lunch and actually looked at the menu. There are only a couple of traditional burgers there. Everything else is MUCH more interesting. For example:

Chicken burger - comes with fried jalapeño slices and is topped with adobo sauce. Definitely not bland!

Tuna burger - a big filet of ahi tuna cooked to order (i.e. they&#39;ll do it super-rare if you ask).

We were impressed with both burgers. And, of course, you can&#39;t go wrong with parmesan truffle fries. That&#39;s kind of a fact of life and isn&#39;t specific to Larkburger, but that&#39;s all the more reason that they&#39;re a safe bet!"

Don&#39;t get me wrong--The place is bright, clean, and the service relatively quick. The food is clearly fresh and of high-quality. But the overall flavor and satisfaction was... well... meh. 

While the veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion) on the burger were top-notch, the pre-formed beef patties looked and tasted like Carl&#39;s Junior to me, and I couldn&#39;t taste the &#34;special sauce&#34;. The fries were soggy and unremarkable. If I had paid Carl&#39;s Junior prices I might be satisfied, but it was over $13.00 for a Larkburger, (plain) fries and a lemonade. Ouch!

Perhaps some greenies in Colorado like the place because they supposedly purchase wind power, or carbon offsets (don&#39;t get me started) or something. I don&#39;t really care how green they say they are or where they get their power, as eating a hamburger is about the least-environmentally conscious menu choice you can make anyway. Heck, if the burgers are good I don&#39;t really care if they fuel the grill by burning unicorn horns. 

Seriously though, bottom line is for me the food quality just simply isn&#39;t up to par with their prices. I&#39;d rather pay a little less and get a lot more at Smashburger, the other fast-casual Colorado burger joint."

PROS: Food is always great and when you order fries they always load you up compared to the other locations.

CONS:  The other Larkburgers have more variety of drinks.  I don&#39;t know what the machine is called but you can add flavors to your drinks (ie: cherry, lime, vanilla, etc) but the touch screen buttons.  I usually go in for dinner and it&#39;s always the same girl at the counter.

Its pretty darn good. The higher end burger restaurant is the trendy thing right now and this place is in the mix. Note that there is several other healthier options on the menu but im a burger and fry guy so thats what I got.

Id say its good enough Ill return. I asked for medium and got medium. The patty is a nice size, the swiss cheese and the bacon were both of notable quality. I got the parm truffle fries which were very tasty.

Unfortunately, the only option for vegetarians is a portobello mushroom burger. Everyone else gets beef or chicken or turkey or tuna, and vegetarians get a mushroom.

- Biodegradeable packaging: corn and potato based containers sound like they would go good with some dip.
- Energy efficient commercial equipment saves a dime on the electricity bills, but it&#39;s also also very marketable.
- We reuse our canola oil for automotive fuel, but I doubt I&#39;ll see a bunch of diesel trucks in the employee parking lot. 
- 100% natural ingredients: potheads appreciate this because they like their pot just like their burgers which is 100% natural.
- Yup, that&#39;s reclaimed timber in the interior. It beats that whole ivory look.

I should also add this to their list: everyday prior to cooking up the flesh of cow, every employee hugs a tree to spread happy karma, and I think I felt that energy.

The basic Larkburger ($5.75) was decent, but I&#39;ve never really liked the Angus breed of beef, and I&#39;m cool with your average fattier 80/20, 100% U.S. cow - it&#39;s like the girl next door.

Yes, enjoy that &#34;tuna burger&#34; ($7.25) because once you&#39;ve whet your appetite for the flesh of Yellow Fin or whatever tuna they used, you won&#39;t be able to give the Japanese crap for Blue Fin otherwise you just need to turn your head and look the other way cuz at least it&#39;s not dolphin. Eff you dolphin!!!

Who doesn&#39;t use synthetic truffle oil? Everybody seems to have this for fries now ($2.95), so It&#39;s so uncool and unhip just like global warming which is so two-thousand late.

100% wind power? I think they&#39;re saying that you may feel free to let one rip because the flatulents you let off inside Larkburger will be harnessed by the indoor HVAC and converted into energy. Nice, I just took care of the electric bill for three weeks, and also thank me for your burger cuz that wasn&#39;t propane.

I noticed this place the other day, and yesterday when I found myself free for lunch I decided to check it out, as I&#39;m always on the lookout for a new spot, especially where burgers are concerned. It&#39;s tucked away in a strip mall, when I came in it was noon and the place was packed. The menu was small, consisting of a large and small burger and a couple of other non-beef options. I went with the signature burger and a side of Parmesan truffle fries. I found a place to sit, and waited for my number to be called. 

The burger itself was, I have to say, nothing particularly special. It came with their &#34;special sauce&#34;. I have to be blunt, this was horrible. I have no idea what it is, it tastes and looks like a mixture of butter and mayonnaise. I tried to scrape it off and cover it&#39;s presence with mustard, but I couldn&#39;t get rid of all of it. It really left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively. A generous helping of fries accompanied it, and I was pretty excited about these, but to be honest, they were missing something. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it, but they were significantly lacking in the flavor that I was expecting after reading the description. To drink, I simply asked for a cup for water, as I don&#39;t like soda, and they charged me 50 cents! 

The employees were friendly enough, and I don&#39;t blame them for the crowd, but there was a serious lack of toppings, the condiments are in individual packets, and the food overall didn&#39;t really impress me.  As I close this, I&#39;ve decided to give it 2 stars, as the &#34;Meh, I&#39;ve had better&#34; line really sums up the whole experience.

Work is so slow and I don&#39;t want to be here.  So many other things tod be doing on this lovely day.  Comfort food is what I need.  No salad for me today.

A burger and fries at Larkburger.  Hum!  Good idea.

I had a sample of one of their burgers once and if I remember right it was very good.  Well it was really good today but not as fat as I remember but perfect for me, especially because I had fries.  NONONO!!.  They cooked it medium rare and it was just how I wanted my burger. Next time I will be good and try the tuna burger and soy pods or the mushroom burger.  So already you know I will return.

I am back at work and feeling fine but really too full.  It&#39;s still dead at work but I am ok for awhile only because of the rememberance of my lunch.  Larkburger take me away."

We heard of Park Burger several times before, so we finally decided to go there on a Friday night...They have four locations in Denver, and after driving by the &#39;original&#39; one on Pearl Street (people stood on the street), we went to this one on Holly. It turned out to be busy as well, so we had to wait about 30 min.

Even though the staff was busy, they were friendly and tried to do their best. I ordered a Hamburger (the Buffalo Park Burger) for $9.00 and a basket of fries. First bite? Good! The meat is yummy and juicy, the greens okay but nothing special. The burger bun was also okay, but I missed that &#39;grip&#39; it should have, it was a little too thin. 
But now comes the highlight (in my opinion): The Park Burger Sauce! I don&#39;t know what they put in it, but it&#39;s great and makes this Burger to something special compared to what I&#39;ve tried before.

So all in all definitely a solid four star burger restaurant!"

So I will never order food here again, the most shittastic restaurant I have ever seen in my life. The burgers where amazing the first time my room mate and I ordered through uber eats so we ordered again. 
Second time we ordered through uber eats we got a notification from uber (not the restaurant) 30 MINUTES after we placed the order that it could not be completed. We called the restaurant and the MANAGER told us that they simply didn&#39;t want to make our order. They got backed up with in-house orders and just decided to not make carry out orders, so when the driver got there they of course canceled when the order was not ready, but the fantastic management staff did offer us the option of calling a different location and replacing the order there. Worst excuse for service I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life and I didn&#39;t even go in, I can&#39;t imagine how shitty they must be in the actual store.

The Parmesan fries were great. If you get the large size, it&#39;s a ton of fries, enough for 2-3 generous portions. The burgers are good, not great, and a bit pricey. They have gluten free buns (Udi&#39;s, I think). It&#39;s definitely worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area. 

We&#39;ve never tried their ice cream because we like the ice cream place next-door. The kids meals come with free ice cream though, so it&#39;s nice if you don&#39;t want to go to the ice cream shop."

The chocolate shake was really meh- barely flavored with Hersey syrup. They need to step up the shake game! Parking is terrible. I parked in the lot behind the place and could not get out! It is too tight. Also, seating is very tight. 

Good news is the burgers are great. They also have a nice selection of beer. The fries were delicious. I heard our waitress tell two other tables about the new fries with shredded pork- for some reason she did not tell us :(

Overall, good. It is over in the Hilltop/Glendale neighborhood in a very hipster part of town."

today&#39;s visit, the hostess asked us for outside or inside.. and opted for inside.. and next option was high top or table.. and opted for the table..  and as soon as we sat down, knew why all the options and I did appreciate her effort.  it was filled with lot of toddler age kids surrounding us.  they were well behaved kids but still very loud.  I would loved to bring my own and let them enjoy the surrounding and all the great kids menu options they have.

its easy to find a place to park and walk short distance.  just watch out for cars while crossing Holly street.  They also have creamery and coffee shop nearby which is great combo activity after the meal.

I love their fresh, simple, lots of different choices.  not to mention happy hour specials (one of these days I will make it here on time) and royal to Colorado micro breweries!  

only gripe I have is their buns..  its falls apart while trying to eat the burger.  is it too soft?  too dry ?  definitely not chewy but don&#39;t like it when they crumble apart while trying to enjoy it.  

I will be back since its closest location to my place even though good 20 min drive."

It&#39;s an actual restaurant... which I didn&#39;t really know when I walked in. No one said anything to me so I just went and sat down.

Server was quick and friendly. 

Went with the original Park burger, no cheese and a small fries.

Ordered burger medium rare... came medium. Very nice size, toppings were good. Small fries were generous.

They have a good offering of soft drinks, beers, and cocktails. I had water.

All in all, probably a fun place for families. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out of my way to get to one, but if you want somewhere a little more cozy and a little less fast food than Smashburger, this is a good choice."

We went here and I was actually quite impressed at the location of the spot- it was located on the corner of a delightful little neighborhood next to a couple of other shops. Super cute. 

I enjoyed how this place was more of a restaurant than a smash and grab burger joint. The food was good and the beer selection really intrigued me. We had went after St. Patty&#39;s  day and they had some remaining Irish beers. I ordered the blond ale and was very happy with it. 

I ordered the scarpone with a turkey burger instead of a beef burger, and I can say I was happy. The pancetta was nice and crispy, and the party seemed to be homemade rather than just a frozen patty smacked on the grill. The fries were delicious!! My husband and I shared a large order of fries and scarfed them down. So good. He also enjoyed his burger, so the food was great in our opinion. 

My only gripe is probably the price. We are definitely okay to spend a lot of money on food, we have done it several times in the past- IF and only if the food is in competition with the price. We wouldn&#39;t say that here. I feel that the burger wasn&#39;t as of high enough quality and taste to be the price it is. We spend the same amount of money on Burgr at Chef Gordon Ramsey&#39;s restaurant in Vegas, and those are the best burgers we have ever tried. So in ending, the burgers were good, but not for the price."

It was a nice small bar in the back of the restaurant. The first thing I noticed was their beer selection. Every tap was a microbrew, and almost of them were local. This is one of the first places I&#39;d been to that didn&#39;t waste a tap on Coors Light, so I knew it was a good sign. On top of their draft selection, they also had a fridge full of bottles and cans. I ended up going with the Cara De Luna Black Ale from Crazy Mountain Brewing (which was a good choice) while my girlfriend had been curious about Ballast Point&#39;s IPAs for a while so she went with the Grapefruit Sculpin (if you want a nice beer for a hot day, I&#39;d definitely recommend it).

When I took look at the menu I noticed that their prices were pretty reasonable. Even their specialty burgers were in about the $8 range. I went with the El Chilango which was their take on a Mexican burger with cheddar, jalapenos and guac. I added a fried egg for good measure and a side of their truffle fries. The food came out pretty quickly. 

The burger was huge, and full of goodness. And one thing to remember when eating large thing full of goodness, you&#39;re going to make a mess everywhere. As I got towards the end of the deliciousness, the burger started to fall apart as I tried to keep devouring it. Until alas, I was defeated, I chomped up the last bits of meat and cheese, and left the last bit of bread on the plate (I had to save room for High Point Creamery right next door).

The staff was also extremely friendly. The bartender did a great job helping us out. When I needed a little more kick to my burger I asked for some Tabasco or Cholula, but apparently they keep a local brand of sauces in house call Merfs. I threw the green chili sauce on the burger, and it was really good, and added that extra kick I was looking for.

All in all it was a great experience, and a great burger. Definitely a good go to if you want a well-priced and great tasting specialty burger."

What is it about being in a restaurant during that in between hour (2-5) that makes waiters decide to ignore their sole table?

This is the first time my wife and I visited the Glendale location. We ordered the Scarpone, basket of sweet potato fries, and a malted vanilla milkshake.

First off, we appreciated the server for offering the slice the burger in half. Thank you. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s quite the messy burger. You saved us a lot of trouble. 

A note: The last time I visited a Park Burger was in April and the time before that was at least two years. Between now and then, their burgers got less salty. I didn&#39;t mind the salt as others did and I still enjoy the greatness in what they&#39;re doing with their burgers.

Basket of sweet potato fries - simply immense even for two people. Always a winner.

Malted milkshake - so the server needed a reminder about that, but I think he was expecting it to have been finished in a more timely fashion. Come to find out, the machine was broken, so he took it off our bill. And then, it was somehow fixed and he brought the milkshake. My wife&#39;s mind was blown and it was still left off the bill.

Came on a Sunday night and although packed, we were seated right away and found plenty of street parking.  I think most patrons either walked here or biked. 

We ordered the regular fries and truffle fries but weren&#39;t blown away. I&#39;ve had fries of similar quality at hop doddy and tag burger bar and unfortunately both those places have amazing side sauces to dip the fries in while we only had ketchup as an option here. 

The burgers came out in like 10 minutes. I was so surprised at the quick service.  I ordered the royale with cheese but substituted the blue cheese with cheddar. Am I the only one who thought royale with cheese is usually with cheddar?!?

Anyways the bread is house made, fluffy, and buttery. Delicious.  The burger was also so juicy I had to use multiple napkins.

I am not sure if this is a violation of health code - but they put it back on the grill and melted one more piece of cheese on it. Then, brought it back to me in a new bun (because the old one was blood soaked). So the waitress - comes back 25 minutes later to see how I am enjoying my reheated burger that looks like a surf board with a shark bite. And, she can&#39;t understand that I didn&#39;t want the original raw burger microwaved. 

&#34;We don&#39;t even have a microwave.?.?.??&#34;

Gourmet is French.

I had the ahi tuna burger on a gluten-free bun and my husband had a regular cheese burger.  I added their hot sauce to mine.  It was very tasty.   I also had their sweet potato fries.  It was crunchy and delicious.   My husband also enjoyed his burger.   My only complaint was that we could have walked out without being charged.   We had to ask for our bill.

We got there around 6:30 and our group of 4 was sat right away.  I&#39;ll take it!

This location has all the same things to offer in terms of good service, burger offerings and fair prices, but dang, they are in dire need of one of those big garage doors because it gets stuffy in there!  Also, for whatever reason, all of our burgers were way overdone.  &#34;Nice and pink in the middle&#34; apparently means dry without any pink.  

Seeing as this location is 25 minutes away and I have two Park Burger restaurants closer to home, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need to return to this one.  We mostly went to take advantage of dinner and ice cream being in the same building."

And it has most definitely delivered with fresh, homemade burgers and a variety of tasty toppings using several locally sourced ingredients.  The burger menu offers something for just about anyone:  classic beef, buffalo, lamb, turkey, ahi tuna, or a veggie patty.  The fry options range from plain potato, sweet potato, parmesan truffle, or topped with &#34;the works,&#34; which I highly recommend.  I would also suggest finishing your meal with one of the many thick, creamy and delicious milkshake choices.  This location wasn&#39;t granted a full liquor license due to neighborhood opposition but local beers rotate in and out and a decent, reasonably priced wine selection is available.

The food is always terrific but the area where Park Burger needs to step it up is the service.  We have some kind of issue every time we eat here.  Servers are unavailable, rushing us out the door, or there are so many attending to our table that nothing gets done.  We voiced our complaints to the manager during our last visit and she was very generous in her response.  The place is always packed during family dinner time and I know service must be firing on all cylinders to turn over that many tables on a nightly basis.  Maybe we just have incredibly rotten timing here but the food is just too yummy not to return.  So we will be back and keep trying for a wonderful all-around experience."

It&#39;s also nice that you can sit on the patio.
I had a turkey burger once, which was fine. I think my second might have been buffalo and was over cooked. It wasn&#39;t until this third time I noticed that all burgers are cooked medium unless otherwise specified. OH!
SO I order a bacon cheeseburger raw. My favorite. Sadly this burger was like other burgers I&#39;ve had where I believe that maybe the patty isn&#39;t seasoned? It was cooked perfectly. The bun, the toppings, everything was totally fine, yet the burger was a meh. We also got the works fries which I was hoping would be a bit more sinful as the toppings were a bit on the light side.
*Shrug* We&#39;ll still go here, but it&#39;s not in the rankings of best burger joint."

Our server was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered the monthly special, the burger with a bratwurst on top. We also ordered a basket of fries, half sweet potato, half regular. The burgers came out undercooked (not just rare, but probably dangerously undercooked), and our server immediately apologized and took the burgers away. They&#39;d also screwed up by bringing us the wrong fries, but they corrected that right away as well. So I guess they still have to iron out the kinks in the kitchen, but that comes with the territory of a new restaurant. When the fries and burgers came out properly, they were delicious! 

The patio looks nice at first glance, but when you sit down for a while you start to notice all the noise on the otherwise quiet-looking street: a dump truck passed by three or four times while it picked up trash in the neighborhood, a few semis came by and parked, and there was generally a lot more traffic than I would&#39;ve expected in that area. That, combined with the multitudes of yelling kids running around, made this patio lunch the least relaxing one I&#39;ve had in recent memory. It&#39;d probably be a much better patio around dinner time. 

They don&#39;t have the liquor license quite yet, so I wasn&#39;t able to order my favorite drink (the Tan Line, the perfect summer cocktail), but I&#39;m told they should have it soon.

Aside from the hiccups in the kitchen and the noisy patio, Park Burger is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner, and I plan to return as soon as they get the liquor license."

The place was just about empty, my friend and I had their current burger &#39;special&#39; and the parmesan french fries, and it was delicious. The burger was top quality beef, a generous size, and the toppings were fantastic. He and I are both a bit health conscious and normally wouldn&#39;t tuck into french fries but these were freshly made and we cleaned out a pretty large basket of them between us. Evil fries!!

Good selection of draft and bottle beers and wine, a nice clean setting with a lot of windows and natural light. Very friendly outgoing staff.

Very reasonable prices too. Apparently they&#39;ve opened a location in Dubai, now that&#39;s one I&#39;d really like to visit!

It&#39;s a burger place so you can&#39;t knock it for a limited menu. And a lot of big screen tv&#39;s showing sports - love it.

So, I&#39;ll be back anytime I&#39;m in the hood. I put the burger up there with Beergarden on first in Lowry and others I&#39;ve reviewed since moving to Denver.

In both cases, I found the burgers to be overly greasy. Additionally, side options including salad and fries are nothing to write home about.

On the evening of New Year&#39;s Day, I called at 8:15pm to ask whether they were open until the normal weekday schedule of 9pm. Brandon, who answered the phone indicated that the kitchen would only be open for another 30 minutes because it was snowing outside.  Completely understandable. 

My brother bundled up his month-old baby. We threw on jackets and walked less than a block from my bother&#39;s house, arriving at 8:30.  Upon arrival, a young female hostess ran to the door, stood in the doorway blocking us out in the snow, and told us that the manager had just told them to close the kitchen because &#34;it was too slow.&#34;  There were 3-4 tables of patrons seated in the restaurant and a waiter was visibly taking an order. We told her that we called just 15 minutes ago and were told that the kitchen would be closing at 8:45. She could not have attempted to care less. We were sent on our way without so much as her checking with the manager.  

I understand that it was a holiday and a snowy day, but blocking the doorway on a frigid night with a baby in a carrier was uncalled for. 

After making the short walk home, I called the store wanting to at least inform the manager of the situation. The phone was answered by a female. When I asked to speak to the manager on-duty, I was promptly hung up on.

Nightmarish service and a horrible first impression."

BUT, and this is a big but for me, their veggie burger has ruined my experience both times. I wonder if the chefs at restaurants try all the dishes they create... Although I like that their burger has a bit of texture to it, it sadly doesn&#39;t seem to have much in the way of flavor, healthfulness or protein. It is comprised of a few veggie pieces and rice. That&#39;s it.
Then they take this rice patty and they put it on a bun with your basic pickles, lettuce, tomato and onion. It is flavorless. Even when you don&#39;t go out for a really healthy meal, it somehow feels weird to eat a carb loaded patty on a carb bun.
I can&#39;t comment on their meat entrees, but the veggie option needs an overhaul!"

It&#39;s a snowy day and the restaurant is very close to our home so we thought lets use the gift card and hope that things have changed in the few months since our last visit. 

I&#39;m extremely disappointed that I have to update with such negativity, however this particular restaurant is in need of some staffing changes immediately. We ordered our food for pick up due to the fact that it takes so incredibly long to eat here because of their continued service issues. Issues such as slow service, orders not correct and overall not organized or friendly. 

When we called to place our order the girl answering the phone sounded like she wasn&#39;t sure they could do that, then proceeded to say ok what would you like. 

We ordered the following: 

1 - 1/3 pound burger on Mixed Greens with a fried egg and Pepper Jack cheese
(It came on a Bun with no mixed greens which we paid extra for and swiss cheese not pepper jack) 

1- 1/3 pound burger with cheddar, extra Park Burger sauce on the side 
( there was no extra sauce included) 

1- Truffle Fries 
(We received 2 orders) 

Let me note I&#39;m currently on a high protein no carb diet, hence the no fries and no bun and paid more for the burger on mixed greens. I was looking forward to a decent burger with an egg, no bun and the cheese I requested. I could not cut the burger with a fork and had to use a steak knife to cut it up as it was obviously super overcooked. 

The past 2 times we ate here the burgers were just average and the service was our main issue each time. We picked up our food, there was no one in the restaurant at the time so the fact that they can&#39;t get 2 simple orders done correctly is amazing to me. 

We are burger junkies and always try new places and I&#39;m a firm believer of giving a place a 2nd chance, this was our 3rd and last time we will ever go here, I&#39;d rather drive further for better burger, better service and an overall better experience. 

This place can not even put themselves in the same burger league as Bad Daddy&#39;s, Smash Burger, Freddy&#39;s, Lark Burger, and Smokehouse Burger to name a few of the many burger joints in Denver. I could honestly say with the taste and lack of proper cooking on my burger today that the fast food chains such as Goodtimes and Wendy&#39;s would have been a better choice. 

I would hope at some point the owner will look into some training at this location because it truly is in a nice location and it&#39;s to bad they can&#39;t get it right, still since opening in May of 2014."

For a burger place they were actually fantastic. Yum. For entrees we ordered The Scarpone which was 
1/3 lb. patty, provolone, crispy pancetta
giardiniera &amp; truffled garlic aioli. Side are a la carte so we ordered truffle parm fries. Everything was pretty tasty but I will have to say the buns are not yummy. They fall apart when you ate the burger. Truffle fries we had refired because they were burnt and cold. A little quality check goes a long way.

I&#39;d heard Park Burger was it, but I&#39;m not sure (a sneaky way to allow my future self to fall off the veggie-wagon when I hear of a better one). Our server was accommodating and attentive. My roommate and I couldn&#39;t decide between two of the same burgers so we opted to get both and split them so our server brought them out in courses. First course was the scarpone (garlic aioli, provolone, pancetta). Pretty good but we both liked the royale better (cartelized onions, blue cheese, and bacon). The truffle fries were really good, but they should probably come with a garlic aioli sauce to complement them. Not to disrespect ketchup. 

The burgers were rather good and the servers were fun."

Nice enough burger but lacking in the proper proportions, ok fries but I can&#39;t smell or taste any truffle oil, which is a remarkable smell/taste. $3.50 for a bottle of root beer--ahem. This place would do better if it checked out Vine Street Pub&#39;s version of the bacon blue cheese burger, which puts the cheese in the meat rather than on the top (on top it overpowers the burger entirely). I did like the bacon that came on my burger, I&#39;ll say that. And the burger itself was a bit too thinned out and the taste was unremarkable. The bun looked good but tasted cheap/processed. The actual hamburger needs to be grilled with more fire/grill/charring. Nice enough environment but I assure you it would better serve us as an order-at-the-counter joint. I walked out of there at $18 for just me. For the quality, it&#39;s worth more like $12 and over-the-counter."

I&#39;ve put in phone orders to pick up on my way home from work and they&#39;ve mixed it up a couple times, so now I check my order before I leave. No big deal though. I also wish they&#39;d stop giving us park burger stickers with every to go order. It&#39;s pretty wasteful.

I ordered the BBQ burger which was 1/3 lb with BBQ sauce, haystack onions, lettuce, tomato and pickles. My husband ordered the Royale burger that came with blue cheese and I can&#39;t remember what else was on it.

Walking in, the host was a bit short with us, which I have come to expect. Our waitress arrived soon after to get our drinks. Thankfully our order was correct and in a very timely manner. The french fries, were still soggy and flavourless but at least fresher than last time. Not in any way impressed with the burger my second time around. Sure, it is a greasy mess like you might see in a movie, however it is entirely bland and unappealing when it arrives at your table. On the plus side, the waitress was decent.
It was not in my agenda to return to Park Burger in the near future, then with the several of messages I have received and the gift card they sent to lure me back. I returned.

1) Kale Tonic: Delicious especially if you&#39;re a green juice lover. Unlike many green juices the lemon was not overpowering and actually was sweet thanks to the fresh Fuji apple juice. Definitely would recommend.

2) Eggs Benedict (Florentine style): Definitely needed more seasoning, it was pretty bland. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Only problem was it was overpowered with leafy greens. Spinach came with the actual eggs but also came with a side spring mix. Perhaps ask for a side of potatoes instead. Not well balanced with the greens. Will not be ordering this again.

3) French Toast: My favorite dish I ordered. Had a crust of crisp wheat germ and topped with fresh fruit. It was not overpoweringly sweet so I recommend asking for syrup. It came with a berry compote that tasted like store bought jam. Skipped on the compote.

Overall, not a terrible experience. Nice and speedy service. Also nicely decorated inside. May be returning and ordering something different."

+5 For nice items to tie patrons over until their table is ready such as coffee and an orange cranberry bread. We had to wait for a table for 25 minutes but expected to because it was a Sunday and the food is very good.
+5 For a great waitress, attentive, left carafe of coffee twice and got the order right the first time as well as the chef offerring great specials for the fall.
It went downhill right after we got the bill.
-2 for the manager who came to the table and literally told us we had to leave because there was a &#34;a table of 8 tapping their foot wanting the table&#34;. The table next to us had cleared and there was a large enough tablr on the patio to seat them at but because I had just spent $85 invluding buying three loaves of their bread we were expendable. 
-2 because he didn&#39;t concern himself with why we were there which was to celebrate two birthdays for two of us. My son and I had not seen each other for weeks and each drove an hour to meet up in the middle. 
-2 because we had patiently waited understanding that they don&#39;t take reservations. I tip very well often too well but I left with the pledge to not to return if I can&#39;t spend more than an hour having a meal after waiting almost a half hour myself.

There were several available tables. The restaurant had free water and coffee in the waiting area which was really nice. They also have chocolate mints which are tasty.

Our server was terrible. We were a table of 3 but there were only 2 water cups and 2 coffee cups on the table. I asked for a 3rd water cup AND my husband ordered a drink. 30-40 minutes later... the waitress brings out our food... First of all, she never brought the 3rd water cup. Second, my husband never got his drink. Third, she did not refill our empty water jug. Furthermore, when she brought my friend&#39;s food out, she said &#34;you asked for no onions right? was that because of an allergy? they had to put the onions in.&#34; Luckily, my friend is not allergic... but like shouldn&#39;t she ask him about that prior to putting in the order? The waitress never said sorry about any of the above and never came to check on us.

I got the bacon/avocado skillet but instead of bacon, I got chorizo. There was hardly any chorizo at all in my dish. I had to ask my waitress where it was- she didn&#39;t even know. She went to the kitchen to ask and then came back to show me the tiny ant- size chorizo pieces in my dish. I needed a magnifying glass to see them.  It was mostly just potatoes, which was disappointing.

My husband got the chorizo chile dish. He said it was pretty good.

Our server was a total careless butt munch so that ruined my experience there. I will not be returning."

Now let me, Seandre 3000, drop some knowledge on you about why First Watch really is first in the breakfast game.

Their juices are top notch. That Kale Tonic? Had me feeling so fresh and so clean. Day Glow? Got me all glowed up, finally showed up, and goin&#39; up. 

Their pancakes were the business though. They were thick. Thicker than a bowl of cold oatmeal. Thick in all the right places. Delicious too. My eyes were too big for my stomach when I ordered two of these beasts cause no way I was finishing both of them. I coulda named one pancake Godzilla and the other one Goliath but my name ain&#39;t David so I couldn&#39;t conquer it. 

Uhh bad service? Really? Here? Yeah, right. Pretty much zero complaints on my end. Like, my pancakes were too big. That&#39;s my only complaint. What kinda complaint is that? Service here was uber friendly and chill. Sure, we waited hella long to be seated but that was mentioned to us before deciding to eat there so we took that in stride. 

And I too went there on Father&#39;s Day and they were awesome! One of the managers was even handing out free little coffee packets to all the dad&#39;s that were enjoying meals that day. If dad&#39;s happy, then we&#39;re all happy. What&#39;s that phrase, &#34;Happy dad and you won&#39;t be sad&#34;? Although, I&#39;m kind of glad they didn&#39;t give me one because I don&#39;t wanna be old enough looking so that people assume I&#39;m a dad...

Everything I&#39;ve tried so far has been delicious and I love how there are side alternatives! 
Fresh fruit is always that.. Absolutely fresh
Lightly dressed greens.. Dressed just right for flavor.
And who doesn&#39;t love potatoes? 
Last time around got the Eggs Benedict and the eggs and hollandaise were perfect! English muffin was a little too over cooked and crunchy for my liking though. Of course things like that happen whenever you&#39;re not cooking your own food so no big deal.

But we were celebrating (yes, at 1 on a Sunday) so what the hey. 
YOU GUYS. 
It was amazing. 
First of all, get their kale tonic. It&#39;s phenomenal. 
Second. The service was really great, and someone I assume was a manager/owner came by to make sure we enjoyed everything and that was lovely. 
Third..THE FOOD. It was fresh, it was inexpensive, it was prepared well, it was unique, and it was excellent. I got the chickichangas and my friend got the smoked salmon something or other. Mine was delicious and (obviously) I tried a bite of hers and it was so so good as well. 
In conclusion: go here."

However, the name is cute but the name throws people off into thinking its a security company and not a breakfast/brunch establishment. Moving on, I liked how the interior was decorated. Very open  and clean looking, the restaurant had that look and feel of farm to table. We chose to sit outside, it was a fall day but still fairly warm out. 

The menu is fairly simple but they still offer a variety of your normal breakfast entrees.  I decided to go with the key west Crepeggs away from my normal order of Benedicts or French toast. Oh man, that was a huge mistake. Majority of the time when I&#39;ve had crepes, it&#39;s been savory and sweet. To be honest, this wasn&#39;t my favorite because I kept thinking that crepes are dessert tasting. The crepe was a little dry and it simply was missing something, can&#39;t put my finger on what that something was. This crepe had turkey, avocados, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, and eggs with a side of English muffin and potatoes. 

Although my choice wasn&#39;t the best, my fiancée loved his. He got the 2 for you deal that runs from open to close. Basically you get to choose from a list of sandwiches, which you&#39;ll get half of and either salad or soup. He ordered a Reuben with the pecan salad. The pecan salad was quite flavorful and appetizing! I loved everything about from the fresh greeneries to the dressing. I didn&#39;t get to try the Reuben but my fiancée said its one of the better Reuben&#39;s he&#39;s had. He&#39;d definitely get that order again. 

Lastly, service could be better. Our table specifically only got checked on once or twice. That being when our food was brought out to us and when our check was ready. So, I was a tad disappointed when I&#39;ve read rave reviews about their service. But compared to the table next to ours, their waitress came out about 4-5 times to check on them. 

I still want to come back and give this place a 2nd chance."

We waited in line for 2 hours... You would think we would leave but the food is always worth a wait. We had to wait another 45 minutes for the food to come... No sure that was worth the wait but we were seated and we had our drinks so we were happy. They also gave all the Mothers a little box of chocolates. How thoughtful that was.

Additionally, they sent us a $20 dollar gift card asking us to give them another try. Well we gave them a second chance and they redeemed themselves, even though they were down a cook due to a no-show in the kitchen.

The waitresses are nice enough so I am not sure if they are over worked, under paid or what the problem is. EVERYTHING anyone of them does takes foreverrrrrrrrrr. At one point we talked to a manager of some sort about not getting our sides until after we finished the rest of the meal and his response was &#34;well I&#39;ve never heard anything like that before...&#34;, then he stopped talking.

I took my husband and kids there for Father&#39;s Day breakfast. So disappointed in my experience! I was told there was a 45 minute wait, and went outside to wait. Noticing the patio area I went back in and asked. Even though the place was teeming with people, the patio was open and available. Was it being offered to anyone? It wasn&#39;t offered to me! She sat us and we moved an umbrella for some shade. More umbrellas are needed. There&#39;s barely any shade out there. 

Halfway through our meal, which was perfectly fine, I noticed our water bottle was *very* dirty. Like it had been washed in a dishwasher with something that had paper. I hope. Yuck. I asked for another and the server obliged but said nothing. No apology no nothing. Didn&#39;t offer to get us new glasses or empty out the dirty water from them that we had apparently been drinking. 

Then another table near us cleared out. It sat empty with dirty dishes for the longest time. Finally some elderly women (customers) came out and, it being the only open table with shade, decided they&#39;d have have to clear the table themselves so they could sit there. I&#39;m sorry but I think it&#39;s inexcusable for customers (especially elderly people) to have to bus the tables themselves. 

I went in after we were done to pay. I saw a man in front of me try to give his signed receipt to the hostess. His wild waving could not get her attention despite her only being a few feet away and talking to a customer parallel to him. So he tossed the receipt on the counter and left. 

Then it was my turn to be ignored. I waited, standing right at the counter, as customer after customer came up next to me and received attention with questions about being seated, but I could not have been less important. I said excuse me and got more assertive and was directly ignored. She did not even glance my way or say &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in just a moment ma&#39;am&#34; or anything else you&#39;d expect. I physically did not exist. Finally a customer left and she turned my way. Oh I DO exist, you were pretending not to see me!!! She asked how she could help and I said rather brusquely, &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting here to pay!&#34; She said only &#34;ok&#34; and rang me up without acknowledging what had happened or my displeasure. No &#34;I&#39;m sorry for the wait,&#34; or anything else.  

It&#39;s pretty rare to receive customer service as bad as this. All the servers and hostesses had sweet and friendly attitudes, but ignored customers, and didn&#39;t seem to have a single clue about protocol and etiquette. What to say when things go wrong, etc. And I don&#39;t take kindly to being ignored. That was the final straw. The whole staff needs training. I may give you another chance because I love that I can drink fresh veggie juice there and there healthy options, but if it&#39;s like this again I won&#39;t be back. 

It kind of ruined Father&#39;s Day."

The manager knows our family  and announced &#34;we&#39;ll make I right this time&#34;. I had high hopes. We both got the ham and tom bennie and were served it hard boiled again. They immediately came over and took the plates back to re make them. Once we were given a proper bennie, they came over too many times asking if it was okay, and the manager gave some horrible excuse about how that table and that table and us all ordered bennies at the same time....to which I replied &#34;I&#39;m sorry.

Hubby and I were in the mood for a different breakfast place instead of the usual chain food and Yelped a location and boom - we ended up here.

Yes, there will be a wait, it&#39;s expected.  There&#39;s a hotel or two in the nearly vicinity and continental breakfast is boring so I&#39;m sure most folks are referred here.  We waited 20 min for a table and had no problem with it.  I was hangry as heck, but read reviews beforehand and anticipated the wait.

Our server, Alex was great.  For being slammed and seemingly understaffed (2 servers and 1 busser), he rocked his service.  Our order was taken quickly and received quickly, believe it or not and there was sooo much food involved.   We ordered the biscuits and gravy w/ham steak, eggs benedict, and shared 2 pancakes that were as big as the whole plate.   Everything tasted well, but my only complaint would be the potatoes.   They were a little bland and mushy, and really need some crisp to them as that would make the plate much better.  Try the pumpkin and pecan pancakes as a combo, you won&#39;t be disappointed, they work well together."

I&#39;ve tried First Watch several times because I think their food is fresh and good for this area of town. But come on! Their service is terrible! 

The first time I ate here we sat on the patio and waited 10 minutes to be greeted. I had to go inside and tell a server that we hadn&#39;t been helped outside. When a server finally came she seemed timid and awkward like she thought we were mad at her. She avoided our table. Watching her with her other tables she was warm and friendly. She even had another server deliver our food. We weren&#39;t even mad at her! 

The most recent time I ate there was this Memorial Day. I expected a wait but it wasn&#39;t bad at all. The manager was there helping out the hostess. I have to say I&#39;ve seen this manager each time I&#39;ve been to the restaurant and he really looks like he has no idea what he is doing. He&#39;s very abrasive. Anyway we got a table and I ordered a hot water with lemon and a kale tonic. I&#39;ve had the kale tonic before and it&#39;s very tasty. This time the kale tonic didn&#39;t make an appearance. My server never brought it out or mentioned anything about it. I&#39;m lucky she didn&#39;t try to charge me for it. My mother and I both ordered the avocado toast. (Thanks by the way for adding this to the menu!) it was good maybe a bit too much lemon in the avocado. But I enjoyed it. The avocado tasted fresh. Our server however never came back to check on us to see how everything was. Not a refill. Nothing. She dropped the check off and we waited for 15 minutes for her to pick it up. When she finally came around she was reaching for what I thought was the check but quickly retracted her hand away and said &#34;you have to take it to the front&#34; and preceded to clear our table. That would have been nice to know 15 minutes ago when you dropped off the check. 

Good service here is hard to come by. I like their food but it&#39;s hard to consider coming back with such spacey servers."

My boyfriend loves their pancakes and French toast, he&#39;s not big on whole grains or healthy stuff, but the pancakes are really fluffy with a slightly crisp layer on the outside- you can&#39;t even tell they&#39;re healthy. I&#39;ve tried most of their savory breakfast dishes and they&#39;re all good, although I typically go with a skillet hash. Their bacon is delicious although very pricey for a side.

The hostess said she would let the waitress know we are back there. Ten minutes later we still haven&#39;t been asked for drinks, so we went and found a server. She acted so incredibly frustrated we were even there. Like we bothered her.

The drinks arrive and both sodas were completely flat and tasted like water. We let her know and she brings us new ones, but again they tasted like water. She didn&#39;t bother to ask if the second drink was better nor if we wanted to try something else. We also asked twice for orange juice. 

The food was cold and bland. Honestly, you&#39;ll get better food and service at any of the other restaurants in this center. Save your money and time."

It started by having to wait 40 minutes to be seated. After placing our order, it took another 35 minutes to get our food. I recognize the restaurant was busy and our server was overwhelmed, but to wait almost an 1 1/2 hours to get eggs seems a bit much. 
Finally, once the food did arrive, their was a long black hair in my wife&#39;s fruit and my eggs.

We stumbled upon First Watch on Yelp and when we called in(Easter Sunday) to see how long the wait was, we were told there wasn&#39;t any. After seeing all the great reviews, we were really excited to try out this place. Upon arriving, we were greeted right away and seated.

I ordered decaf coffee and was given a personal thermos pitcher for refills. When I took a sip, it was cold which means it wasn&#39;t fresh and had been sitting around for a while. This wasn&#39;t really a big deal to me. The server was nice and we ordered eggs benedict, chile chorizo omelette, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. When I dine in at a chain restaurant like this one, I am looking for consistency. This location totally missed the mark. My husband&#39;s eggs benedict was bland with runny hollandaise sause, it had layers of deli ham, and was COVERED in parsely. My omelette was a bit better, but it was served with underseasoned pico de gallo and both of our potatoes were undercooked. The pancakes came in a large portion with some sort of lemon spread that was lacking in lemon flavor. I wish there was some taste of ricotta in my pancakes. 

Here is the main reason why I can only give this restaurant a 1-star rating. We were the only table seated in the back room, which we liked because we like a quieter area. However, this was truly unlike any other brunch experiences we have had in a long time. Three servers came in and started sweeping and filling up the condiments. I used to be a server before and this was understandable until all three of them started having really loud personal conversations among themselves. It went on until they swept the floors, refilled the condiments, rearranged the entire back room, and wiped the table tops. After a good 10 minutes or so, they left and we were relieved. Enter another server who came in to roll silverware. Of all the empty tables she could&#39;ve chosen to sit, she chose the one table that was looking directly at our table. It was so awkward to see her roll silverware and play on the phone while we were trying to finish eating as fast as we could. I would have loved to talked to a manager, but the entire experience was so terrible that we had to get out of there.

The two of us spent over $40 here for less than mediocre food and we are quite puzzled with our bizarre experience!!"

The waitress was sweet when she was there, but she allowed drinks to go empty and left us waiting for the check for so long. The food was just &#34;ok&#34;, my bread from my benedict was almost too hard to cut with a knife and I nearly resulted in eating it caveman style.

Well while waiting for a table, my husband noticed many tables not bused and just sitting their.  Once we got sat , the waitress seemed a bit frazzled.

The cheese wasn&#39;t melted, the bread was so hard I couldn&#39;t bite through it and the one corner that was toasted was the soft part which tells you they used bread that had been out all day and uncovered.

The kale salad is also good although the kale doesn&#39;t marinate so it&#39;s more tough than other places which might add lemon juice or another flavor for 24 hours to soften the leaves and infuse flavor.

Looking at the menu, there&#39;s a good selection of classic breakfast items, as well as a few unique items. I went with the Florentine eggs benedict. The wait time was reasonable for the food even though it was the busy lunch time rush. The presentation of the benedict is nice, however, it is probably not the most practical. The potatoes were on a large plate, and then the benedict was on a smaller plate. When I tried to cut through the benedict for a bite, the English muffin is so toasted, that it was very hard to cut through, so the benedict pretty much fell apart. And since it was right next to the other half in a small plate, the other benedict fell apart too from me trying to cut the other benedict and it sliding everywhere. So, perhaps they can make the English muffin less toasted or provide better platting? Regardless, the taste was delicious and so were the potatoes. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try their other menu items."

Hubby had the pick 2 with tomato basil bisque and turkey sandwich. Again-lots of food and meat on sandwich. Bread was ok, not delicious.

I went with my family this past Saturday and they were on a wait.  We were told that it&#39;d be 10-15 minutes for a table of 6, and it ended up being 35.  The food took quite a while to arrive (20+ minutes), but they were pretty busy, so it&#39;s understandable.  Everything tasted really good.

My wife finally went and got menus. Our server did come promptly and took our order. That was about ten minutes ago. Still no drinks. No silverware. Bare table.
While I&#39;ve been writing this our food came. Still no drinks. My wife went and got us silverware.
Oh, and we&#39;re here with gift cards because the last time the kitchen burnt our food. Burnt it twice.
We&#39;re done."

Had to ask the manager for refills, and then had to ask for refills again and our bill long after we were finished. The food was great though! We have a pancake addiction now. It&#39;s becoming a problem. 

I have to give five stars for the usual service and food. I&#39;m hoping today&#39;s service was a fluke (or we don&#39;t get this same waitress again). That can ruin an experience."

The yelp page says full bar but we were informed that it was only bloody Mary&#39;s and Mimosas which was exactly what we were looking for any way so it was no big deal.

Alex quickly got my drink order, and returned shortly with my water and chocolate milk. &#34;Is that chocolatey enough?&#34; It was. He took my food order and moved on.  A few moments later the clipboard wielding  manager strolled by also checking to see that the chocolate milk was indeed brown enough for my taste. I like that they bring an old fashioned milk bottle filled with chilled water instead of the typical one glass at a time. 

I ordered the Monty Cristo French toast sandwich which came out hot and fresh and yummy, with a nicely dressed spring mix on the side.

Not even a hello, I&#39;ll be right with you. When we were finally approached, we were told it would be another few minutes and then we were ignored again for another 10. The manager was incredibly unfriendly from the get go, as was the staff. Finally we were shown to our table. It was missing a seat, we weren&#39;t given enough menus and there were not enough place settings. After another 10 minutes of being totally overlooked without so much as a water to start with, we decided to walk out. No smile was delivered in all that time!

I came in this last time while on a restrictive diet- not eating grains, dairy, sugar or legumes (the Whole30, which is similar to paleo) and was expecting to order a dry chicken breast and lettuce- but the server was so polite and accommodating. I was relieved to not make a big deal out of what can occasionally be an embarrassing interaction. I had a perfectly cooked filet of turbot, with tasty veggies and an incredible pesto they made for me- that&#39;s class.

We made it there during happy hour and enjoyed $4 beers and the green curry mussels($5) off the happy hour menu. The mussels were pretty tasty, had a nice kick, and the waitress was happy to get us as many refills of gluten as we wanted-my kind of lady! 

For the main event we got the Lamb Chops and Braised Bison. The veggies were nice and buttery, mashed potatoes on point, but sadly the meat didn&#39;t live up to its potential. The Lamb Chops were cooked a perfect medium rare, but lacked in the flavor. The bison was the opposite, big on flavor but a little over cooked.

Service was awesome and there were definitely more great things on the happy hour menu that we didn&#39;t venture to try this time around. I&#39;d definitely recommend hitting this place during happy hour to try some tasters before diving in for the main"

The time before last, I went for happy hour. The mussels are absolutely wonderful... perfectly sized and the broth is a nice balance of flavors. Great for bread dipping too (which is a must, obvi!). We ordered the calamari as well, which was a good size (as far as each piece), nice breading, and the right bit of chewiness and tenderness. 

The real prize (for me) of any restaurant is brunch, which I experienced yesterday at the recommendation of my friend Chris. I started with a Hummingbird cocktail, a nice blend of champagne, st germaine, and soda water... incredibly light and refreshing (it was a little warm in there due to the facing of the windows). I moved to bellinis--you can order mimosa or bellini for 2$ a pop (a steal)! I ordered my eggs benedict which was paired with their &#34;brunch greens&#34;. My bene was way above average and the greens were a nice match since they lightened the heaviness of the dish.

We were sat a two long tables in the main dining room, which was fine for the group and our late reservation. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere and getting to sit near each other. After polling the group, everyone enjoyed the meal, including the pickiest of eaters, which is often hard with such a large group. 

The table was serve the Beef Filet Carpaccio, which was one of my favorites, but not many at the table enjoyed it, as they like their beef overcooked and prepared incorrectly IMHO.

While the service was great, I was very disappointed in the food.  The regular chef must have been out-for-lunch himself or had the day off because my adult son&#39;s burger was so overcooked he could not eat it.  While I did not complain, my lobster quiche was also grossly over cooked, and consequently very dried out. My mother and her friend both ordered Ramen.  Apparently my mother had nearly all the noodles and her friend had hardly any.  I wish I could recommend the fish and chips, but my husband thought the breading on those was too thick.  On the flip side, I can say the soups were very delicious. I would definitely recommend the sweet potato and clam chowder.  Our family is generally very easy to please, so I am not sure what happened last week. Given the overall ratings, I can only think we must have come at the wrong time when the chef in training was in charge.

They were very accommodating to our large group, and didn&#39;t even bat an eye when we requested separate checks.  The server was very good, handling the large table pleasantly and efficiently.

So the food. Myself and a couple colleagues all had the Braised Bison.  Absolutely delicious flavor to the meat and thai bbq sauce.  The bison had a pot roast like quality, fork tender and was very lean and was accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked winter vegetables.  It was the perfect portion of food.  I did not try anything else, but those around me ordered the Sesame Shrimp salad (huge) and the bass.  Both looked very inviting and i didn&#39;t hear any complaints.

I would definitely return to this restaurant is I was in the area."

It&#39;s a classy space without feeling pretentious, and the specials, from 3 PM to 7 PM every day, are a pretty good deal.  You can get a glass of house white, red or rosé for $5, and all three options are pretty good.  They have a few discounted cocktails and beers as well.  I also really enjoy the small plates: the fig &amp; prosciutto flatbread is interesting, and I&#39;m a big fan of the empanadas and the potstickers.

It seems like there&#39;s always open tables in the bar, and the free parking lot across the street makes this an even easier choice.  I haven&#39;t been here for dinner too often because it&#39;s a little pricey, but they have a very happy happy hour."

The food was ok, but a little pricy considering the tired look of the restaurant.  Our server seemed to care less about us. He was short and suggested the &#34;good&#34; items on the menu were the most expensive. After our meal we waited 20 minutes for him to finish up laughing and talking to another table to get our check. I doubt I&#39;ll return to this dated, over priced restaurant."

Our waiter performed all of his duties just fine, but there was no warmth.  I felt like I was wasting his time each time he stopped by our table.  That being said, he was thorough, and did check in to make sure we were doing alright, but his attitude was enough to make me have doubts.

The food: my girlfriend and I ordered the same item - the seared ahi tuna.
Neither one of us were able to enjoy it.  I took a few bites and got a strange burning sensation on my gums (I know the tuna is served with some wasabi - this was different).  My girlfriend had similar sensations, but when I stopped, she pressed on.  I left a full 75% of my tuna on the plate, and our waiter didn&#39;t ask me if there were any problems when he cleared my plate - again, he just seemed happy to be rid of us.  We left, and as we walked home, my girlfriend experienced a moderate allergic reaction (no swelling or difficulty breathing, but she got incredibly itchy).

Neither one of us have any allergies.  When I called to inquire about the menu item, and described that my girlfriend was having an allergic reaction (but that it wasn&#39;t life-threatening), I was given a list of all of the known allergens and repeatedly told to take her to the hospital.  I understand they were looking out for us, but there was no attention paid to my comment that neither one of us are allergic to any foods.  Rather, the hostess repeatedly told me to go to the hospital (she didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing, I repeated).  No interest in figuring out why this happened, just a CYA.

Maybe we just got a bad break, but with the amount of money I wasted on two tuna dinners, and the lack of interest from the staff, we won&#39;t be returning."

On New Years I came here with my family, ordered the filet minion with lobster tail and it was outstanding, melt in your mouth amazing!

Then recently I went here with my guy for restaurant week and it was delicious! I had salmon and he had the bison, the portions weren&#39;t small like I had been warned about restaurant week (my guy is 6&#39;4, he would have been devastated!). I also had the mussels which were incredible, he had the very rare beef small plate and loved it

Katie was our server and she did a great job, the person refilling waters also refilled my glass nearly every time I took a sip, I felt very well taken care of here!

For some reason both times I have come here the place isn&#39;t very busy, the crowd does seem a bit older, maybe it is just fancier than the surrounding uptown restaurants and bars (I mean it is across the street from Hamburger Mary&#39;s after all..) But hey, still doesn&#39;t hurt to make a reservation.

This place is a great value, still a bit pricey, well worth it for special occasions. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Let me start by saying that, up until this moment, I have always had a wonderful experience at Avenue Grill.  It pains to me give a rating below 5 or 4 for one occasion, but I think it&#39;s an important charge.  It keeps businesses like this one on their feet; and, it is beneficial to you, the customer.  

Meghan, my server, was 100% pleasant and on point.  I have no qualms with her whatsoever.  I ordered the Grilled Ribeye (Dark soy jus, mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables) paired with a glass of Pinot Noir.  I asked that the steak be prepared in a medium-rare fashion.  Instead, the ribeye was well-cooked and over seasoned.  Way too heavy on the seasoning!  The mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables were delightful, however.  In addition, the wine was superb.  Aside from the main entrée, my only complaint would be that the service on water and ice tea refills was lackadaisical.  When I&#39;m at a more prestigious restaurant, I expect first-rate service with the entire staff, and that includes the bussers.

This is a wonderful place for a special meal.  One subpar experience will in no way deter me from future visits.  As I said beforehand, I think it&#39;s important to include and record every occurrence for the benefit of the business and you the customer.

Have a great meal!"

I initially was a little worried since the only reason I picked this place for dinner on such a busy night was because a week before, it was the ONLY place with a reservation available. 
Usually I&#39;m a bit more picky with places I&#39;ll eat. 

Buuuut, AG had pretty decent ratings and very good reviews so I thought; &#34;Well, we shall see!&#34;...  

Our reservations were later, around 9:30. 
We were about 15 minutes late and had called ahead to let them know we were on our way. 
They had no issue with it and when we did get there they sat us right away. 

MY FELLOW YELPERS DID NOT LET ME DOWN! :)


Our server was great! He was attentive and very, very efficient. Especially for such a busy night of the year. We were impressed.  The food was really good as well, I had sirloin with mashed potatoes and my best friend had their ravioli of some sort, which looked equally delicious. 
I had wine, of course :) and she had a Cosmo, which apparently is what they&#39;re known for! Totally a must try! 

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back again soon. Good ambiance with great tasting food are hard to come by nowadays, and Avenue Grill has just that."

I&#39;ve had the same waiter several times, and that dude is a pro. You&#39;ll know him by his limp, which is endearing and I hope doesn&#39;t cause him a ton of pain...

The many dinners I&#39;ve had here with dates, groups, and small parties - they&#39;ve all been high-pro and awesome. The food is fresh, the waiters are great, and the menu is pretty much perfect.

I generally get the ahi tuna, since that&#39;s the kind of dude I am. It&#39;s always been fresh, rare, and delicious. I recommend it highly.

We went today (my wife and I) for brunch, and that&#39;s where the star is lost. The hollandaise was clearly homemade, but the sauce was cooked too long and turned out to cook the egg slightly. I hesitate to criticize that since a local establishment serves a shameful powdered hollandaise next door (see my recent reviews), but hollandaise is really not that hard to make.

Go here for dinner. Go on a date, go with a buddy. Don&#39;t let my lack of a star slow you down, their dinner service is amazing. Even the brunch was not bad; maybe I caught a bad morning (even though there were only three tables sitting). Seriously, the place is pretty awesome.

Fix your hollandaise, and you have five stars by me. The eggs were unexpectedly correct, the &#34;brunch greens&#34; were fine. I loved the light beer sidecar to my bloody mary. If this place can nail hollandaise, it&#39;s a perfect five."

We walked in, were seated, and our waiter came up to us after a couple of minutes to take our order. Well, after one person ordered ONE appetizer(out of four people) he quickly left! I wanted to order the clam chowder but he was in a rush to leave us. 

Then he comes back to bring us plates and silverware and literally threw my plate at me smashing it ontop of my cell phone. Still, ignoring me and rushing off to speak to other people.

When he comes back to our table with our calamari appetizer (which was plated really messy) this waiter saw a French fry on the plate, says &#34;Whoops&#34; and grabs it off our plate with his bare hands. I was so dumbfounded by his unprofessional, unclean, and rude demeanor!

That&#39;s not it, he then walks to the table right behind me where it seemed to have his friends seated. His friend asked what did he just do, told them he grabbed food right off our plate, and laughs about it right behind me. I haven&#39;t felt that disrespected before in a restaurant with a 4 star rating on yelp.

I am extremely disappointed in the service here. He came back to apologize and took off the appetizer, but I definitely won&#39;t be coming back here EVER AGAIN."

Be sure to pop in for their delicious happy hour complete with $2 mimosas and Bloody Mary&#39;s.

Our server was so awful that I had to speak with the maitre d&#39; on the way out - something I&#39;ve actually never done in my life.  I had a bad feeling when he arrived at our table in full dreadlocks or whatever that was on his head to take our order.   After ordering, we waited somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 minutes to get our drinks after ordering.   

On a Saturday night at 8PM the place should have been hopping but is was more than 1/2 empty - same with the parking lot which was the only reason we went there that particular night as all the other restaurants in the area were jammed.  The food was excellent so I can&#39;t fault the chef in any way thus the 2 instead of 1 star rating.  We had to ask for our drinks several times before they finally arrived and after the meal the server asked if I wanted a box to take home the rest.   I had purposely saved more than 1/2 the meal including the delicious sauce, feta cheese and pile of vegetables that came with my Sauteed chicken - a $20 entree.  I said yes and could we please have the check.   

Well when the box came back - without the check - it seemed small and very light when I picked it up - there was a full meals worth on my plate and so I opened it to find they had thrown away all of the vegetables and sauce and just tossed the one piece of chicken and polenta I was saving to go.  I complained and the server said he&#39;d get them to make up some fresh stuff to take with the other box - well it came back - with the check - we were stuck and couldn&#39;t just leave - 15 minutes later - no offers of a comp&#39;d drink while we waited, no offer of a free dessert - the box had no cheese, no sauce, just a few steamed vegetables.  After I complained to the maitre d&#39; all she said was yes, yes, yes, yes.  Like a robot.  No offer to comp any of the meal, no gesture to make good on any part of our experience. So we are done here.  We gave them multiple opportunities to make good and they decided not to make good.   I can now understand why the parking lot and restaurant were so empty at prime time on a Saturday - seems they just don&#39;t care anymore - I just feel sorry for that poor chef who worked so hard to prepare that excellent food."

ATMOSPHERE:
Classy, dimly-lit room that&#39;s perfect for a special occasion. Not too loud, but also not too silent. And upscale without coming off as pretentious. 

SERVICE:
Very polite, very prompt, and honest about what options on the menu are the best, and what you probably shouldn&#39;t order (i.e. the tiramisu). I guess it also helped that our server was extremely attractive.

FOOD:
I was very impressed by the food here, even considering the $22-$26 entre prices. I would definitely recommend the Cioppino, and having moved from San Francisco, I&#39;ve had some great Cioppinos in the past. (It&#39;s a slightly-spicy tomatop-based stew with fish, mussels, and shrimp - normally $22). The fondue appetizer was also delicious (smoky melted cheddar with porcini mushrooms), as were the key lime pie and nut tart.

HAPPY HOUR:
I wasn&#39;t here for happy hour, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out they have one M-F 3-7pm &amp; Sat 12-4pm: $3/$4 beer, $4/$5 wine, $5 cocktails.

Turns out, this place has the ultimate Monday night deal, a $16.00 Prime Rib dinner! (thanks Yelp!) I made very early dinner reservations just in case, but we arrived to a pretty empty dining room. 
  
We were offered the best booth in the house and enjoyed our entire meal with everyone seated on the opposite side of the dining room, hello privacy! We both opted on a caesar salad and the Prime Rib meal. The salad was perfect and when our entrees arrived, we were both squealing a bit....it looked so comforting I almost crawled onto the plate for a nap. The 10 oz cut of meat was cooked wonderfully, doused in a nice au jus with a great side of creamy horseradish sauce. The mashed potatoes and vegetable medley that accompanied were also very good. I highly recommend this steal of a meal, especially for a cure of the Monday blues.

*we came during happy hour, ordered lemon drops from that menu ($5.00) that came in a shaker glass that&#39;s poured table side and left there with enough drink in them for a second helping-score! The service was very nice, crisp professionalism without pretension. I loved the look of this space, 1940&#39;s supper club style. 
**here is another great special they offer, on Sundays there is a 3 course meal option for only $24.00 per person-and the menu changes weekly.

Definitely try it out.  The service isn&#39;t always very timely which is the only downside."

She chose Avenue Grill.  It would not have been my choice but it wasn&#39;t my birthday.  It&#39;s OK but that&#39;s about it.

The Good:  Gabriel (consummate server who has served me many, many times), the place - it&#39;s bright and clean - white tablecloths and napkins - professionally attired staff - I like the whole vibe.  They also know how to make a real adult beverage - some of the best martinis in town.  Gabriel offered to comp a dessert for her birthday but we had a cake waiting - sweet of him though.

The OK:  When we finally got it, the food was OK but nothing special with the exception of the chicken and spinach pot stickers that were awesome.  The lady friend and I shared a reuben at the waiter&#39;s suggestion.  Tasty enough but really tiny - literally 3 bites each (fries were lame as was the cole slaw).  Our other friend had the burger and it was huge and looked delish - should have gone that direction since we were sharing.

The Not So Good:  Service today was S-L-O-W.  We arrived at 1:45 p.m. and departed at 3:45 p.m.   They simply could not get the food out of the kitchen and we were one of three tables at this late lunch hour.  Seriously, two hours for lunch with a couple of appetizers and a couple of sandwiches?  Prices at lunch are high.  We had a round of drinks,  shared a cup of chowder and the pot stickers for starters, and a reuben and a burger for lunch and it was almost $100.  Not worth it in my book."

Excellent, excellent Martini menu that got the dinner off to a wonderful start. Mussels were very good and the steaks were excellent. The place has a great local feel to it and is upscale without ridiculous prices. The neighborhood is trendy lots of fun bars and restaurants in the area. I will go back here again.

We were told about this place by the concierge at the Warwick since it was walking distance from the hotel and they could accommodate our group of 11 on short notice for dinner. 

I&#39;ll start with the positives, while we were late to our reservation, the table was ready and we were seated right away. The ambiance was pleasant and the menu looked good with some specials that sounded delicious. When it came time to order, our waiter was really rude and wouldn&#39;t explain their policy to not accept a valid driver&#39;s license that was vertical (instead of horizontal which I still don&#39;t get). Since we weren&#39;t going to let a glass of wine deter our dining experience on our mother/daughter trip, we let it slide and tried to enjoy our meal but then he proceeded to give us attitude the whole time he was taking our order. 

When the food came out, the presentation was nice and the wait time wasn&#39;t long despite the large group. The taste was okay but nothing spectacular or even memorable especially since the poor service already put a sour taste in our mouth. Our waiter never came around to refill water glasses even for the two he refused to serve alcohol to that settled on some simple h2o. Then, the real problems occurred after we received the bill, and our credit card was already swiped. We didn&#39;t make things complicated with separate checks or splitting the bill with multiple cards. One transaction, should have been no problem. When he returned the bill and it came time to sign the receipt our waiter hovered over our table watching us write in a tip. Where was he the whole time we needed refills? Mind you, we still gave the customary 15% (despite all the problems) but he lurked over us like we were doing something wrong. As we were sitting with the signed bill, deciding where to head next and waiting for our uber he was gossiping about our group to the hostess. We saw her turn around and look over everyone at our table. The two proceeded to watch us like hawks as if we were going to dine and dash even though we had just paid and there were no people waiting so they didn&#39;t need to turnover the table to other customers. I wish I remembered the servers name but he was a middle aged white man who walked with a limp. If you dine there, and he happens to be your server, ask for someone else. He doesn&#39;t deserve to be a part of your dining experience in Denver.

For a large group on a Friday night, it was really disappointing for everyone. I gave this review two stars because the food wasn&#39;t terrible and if it wasn&#39;t for our server, the experience might have been better."

The food was good, it wasn&#39;t earth-shattering, but it was solid. I liked the zuchhini bread they put on the table a lot. I shared eggs florentine (tasty) and the salmon BLT (ok) with a friend.

I ordered the special, which was halibut with some vegetables and it tasted like a campfire.it was supposed to come with soba noodles but came ou with some rice. When we told our server he said he did not notice and asked if it was okay. At that point I was starving and a different starch would not have made it not taste like camp fir.

Last evening the stars aligned and we had a chance to stop by.  The attire is casual, but the place looks formal with the white table cloths and the very attentive wait staff. 
Fortunately we arrived at 6:45 and were able to enjoy the last few moments to Happy Hour with a glass of wine, some pot stickers and of course, bread with whipped butter.  All were very tasty and a great way to begin the evening.
Then we moved on to the main course.  I was tempted to try the burger, but was persuaded to try the Slow Roasted King Canyon Buffalo, only with mashed potatoes instead of potato salad.  It was a perfect choice.  The Cabernet was the perfect wine with this delicious, tender delight.
After dinner, a creme brulee served with a small tuaca finished the evening with a smile.

As I was leaving, I was pondering 4 or 5 stars, and really wanted a 4.5 rating available.  I&#39;ll go with 4 only because the meal was a little on the expensive side.   But oh, so wonderful tasting."

Our server was very helpful with recommendations and attentive without being overbearing.  My mom and I split the Spinach Calamari Salad and the Sauteed Chicken Breast.  They split the plates evenly so we could share them without making a mess - we didn&#39;t even ask for that.  Bonus!

The calamari salad was my favorite.  It wasn&#39;t overly greasy and the dressing was perfect.  Our chicken entree was a little fried and chewy, but my mom enjoyed it.

Came for an early dinner on a Saturday night and there was no wait.  I would definitely make reservations though just in case since this restaurant is located in a pretty popular restaurant area. 

The restaurant looks like a old by-the-ocean San Francisco restaurant.  The menu is a mix of American, Asian, and Seafood entrees.  Very unique!

Started off with the Oysters Rockefeller.  Although tasty, I couldn&#39;t even taste the oysters!  Also ordered the fondue.  The cheese tasted good but was rather flat.  Felt like it needed another cheese or seasoning to make it really pop. 

My entree was pretty amazing though.  I got the BBQ Thai Tempeh.  For people who &#34;hate&#34; on tempeh dishes, this was amazing.  Tasted just like general tso chicken.  Sweet and sour and crunchy.  The wasabi mashed potatoes that came with it were also buttery and had just the right amount of wasabi flavoring to make it edible yet slightly hot!  THIS is how tempeh is made delicious.  Watercourse Foods take note!

My husband got the Chinese porkchop and licked the plate clean.  Every flavor was right on the mark.  

The service was great too!  The waiter was chill and accommodating and there were constantly 2 other busboys coming around to refill our drinks and clean our table! 

Can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t read more about this place before.  I will definitely be back to try more of their dishes!"

In particular, Avenue Grill is a good place for a classy, yet inexpensive brunch.  Mimosas, bellinis, and bloodies (served with a PBR sidecar) are $2 each, so you don&#39;t have to break the bank or go bottomless.  Brunch entrees are reasonably priced as well and their benedict was shockingly delicious!  I went for the eggs sardou.  I was a bit reluctant at first as the description made this dish sound incredibly heavy....creamed spinach AND hollandaise?  Lipitor, anyone?

The result was actually not as heavy as the description implied, and very good.  The English muffin the eggs sat atop was sliced very thin so there wasn&#39;t an overwhelming amount of bread in every bite.  The egg yolks were perfectly runny.  The spinach was not overly rich and creamy.  It was served with a side of nicely dressed greens to balance out the overall gluttony.

Our brunch server was very stressed though.  We were part of a very large group (two tables worth) and people were shifting around and throwing back mimosas like it was their last brunch ever.  He did his best though and drinks and food came out as quickly as could be expected given the circumstances.

Worth noting is their very classy cocktail list.  While we didn&#39;t peruse this given there were $2 brunch drink specials, I sampled some at dinner about a year ago.  They&#39;re all expertly crafted and use a lot of local spirits.

This place is often passed by, but I think it&#39;s a great spot for brunch or cocktails as well as a Denver institution."

We were excited to grab a booth at what seemed like a nicer, upscale eatery. Although the decor and price points were certainly high-end, the service and food product really fell short. 
   Our server couldn&#39;t be bothered and we had to pry questions and answers out of him. The one time he stopped by,was nearly ten minutes after entree&#39;s were dropped he half asked how things were,.... but turned and continued on his way before we could answer. For a place that was relatively slow, he really did an awful job making us wait over &amp; over. 
   I&#39;ll be honest it wasn&#39;t all his fault though. The chef sent us an Oyster Rockefeller, that I think all 6 oysters could have fit in one shell of my favorite Rockefeller from Durants in Phoenix Az. They were literally demi-tass fork fulls per shell at $18 for the plate. On top of the that our ribeyes which were ordered midrare came out blackened and medium. Now bear in mind that their ribeye is also a1/3&#34; at most tall, and really lacks in many companies options for a ribeye. Reminded me of Columbine over on Federal , or Denvers famous Swifts style cut,where a ribeye is like 10.95
   Avenue I&#39;m sorry you really fell short as my girlfriend was celebrating a promotion and we would have stayed and spent. Instead we were really turned off, and adding insult to injury,  the server did one of my pet peeves.I had already laid the credit card out on the table, and as I said no thank you to dessert he placed the menu over the credit card, upon where I thanked him and insisted we were done. 
   Maybe if you like being seen at white table clothes through their fishbowl windows in Uptown this is the place for you. However if you enjoy prompt, courteous, friendly warm service with great food,I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find it here."

I organized the group and made our way inside. They serve brunch until 4 pm on the weekends so yes, you can have breakfast food at 2pm....along with a $2 bloody marry (with beer back), a mimosa or a Blinni (like a mimosa but a different juice). The staff was also cool when my friend asked for his mimosa in a goblet rather than a champagne flute (no extra charge). Further, he asked for both ham and salmon on his eggs Benedict and he got that with no extra charge either. 

Now for the not so great things. One of my buddies got the Reuben with potato salad. Reuben was great, potato salad...way too much dill. The eggs Benedict were also not the best I&#39;ve had because the yolk was not runny. I like letting the yolk drip on the plate and then soak the English muffin in it. No can do here as this dish is made so the yolk is hard and doesn&#39;t drip at all. This probably shouldn&#39;t go in the &#34;bad&#34; column, just not what I&#39;m used to. 

Finally, we started out with one waiter and after bringing our drinks and bread (he dropped the butter on the floor), we never saw him again. A different waiter served us for the rest of the time. If the original guy was going on break, I would think that he would tell his tables he is leaving and introduce the waiter that would continue serving. Maybe I&#39;m wrong? In any case, I thought it was strange. 

Overall, not bad and the interior is decorated nicely. Good change of scenery from Steuben&#39;s or Hamburger Mary&#39;s, which are both a lot more casual."

We had their happy hour drink, I can&#39;t remember the name-- sorry. It was so tasty, though and at $3, just all around perfect. It was happy hour all night, too! Who does that?? Avenue Grill was last night...

For food we ordered:
1/2 dozen oysters...really tasty, not too much sea taste..
Beef Carpaccio- my first time, but my partner in crime insisted, and wow...AMAZING!!
Risotto Cakes- garnished with mango and sooo brilliant
Fried Prawns- huge prawns fried perfectly with a great sauce

Overall, I thought the experience was perfection. (Although it didn&#39;t hurt that I was on a date with the most wonderful man.)

I can&#39;t wait to return.

Oh, on previous visits I have had their fries....really? Yep. Just a basket of fries. And they are worth it. Trust me."

One of our waters had a dead fly floating in it - a verbal apology by waitress but nothing from management or any compensation.

One of us is a vegetarian; the initial response to our non-meat substitute was balked at -  &#34;Sorry, It&#39;s against the law.&#34;  Later we were offered yogurt and fruit.  Lastly, it wasn&#39;t crowded, but the waitress still seemed very scattered.

Basically - food was good, but service by both (host and waitress - not so good)"

The place was pretty crowded on a Saturday morning. I got the French Toast slam 800ish calories (2 slices of French toast, 2 over medium eggs, 2 slices of bacon &amp; hashbrowns). The French toast slices were much smaller than I expected them to be but they tasted good. I tried the Minute Maid triple berry juice that came free with the meal. The meal seemed small but it was enough to fill me up. 

I like Denny&#39;s because they have tons of menu options, the layout and food is consistent in all of their locations &amp; this place opens late (great for late night drunchies)."

Dennys has became the &#34;is there anything else?&#34; food joint. I&#39;m not saying it has to be like a fine dining steak house, but they have to give it an effort. 

I ordered the French toast with bacon, sausage and over-medium eggs. I didn&#39;t end up eating my eggs because they were undercooked. If I see egg whites uncooked with over medium, I&#39;m not going to attempt them. The bacon was soft (I like a little crunch) and the sausage I gave to my husband because it wasn&#39;t good with flavor in my opinion. The French toast was good, no problems there, but I did wake up three hours later with a bit of an aggravated digestive system. 

My husband wasn&#39;t overly impressed either. It was a late night stop because it was the only thing open on a Sunday night past ten, but I&#39;d prefer to steer clear here. There are good dennys and I&#39;m just not feeling this one. Sorry guys."

My recent experience was on a Saturday morning at about 11 am. My wife and I approached and saw about 20 people waiting around the entrance inside and overflowing outside. We waited in line near the counter as the hostess(?) took money and processed credit cards for customer&#39;s paying their checks and leaving. We waited for about 5 minutes and we noticed there were at least a dozen empty tables, already cleaned and ready! We wondered how there were 20 people crowded around the lobby waiting with so many empty tables. When she finally got to us and asked if there were two of us, we inquired about how long the wait would be. She said, &#34;oh, it shouldn&#39;t be too long. I just haven&#39;t had time yet to seat these people.&#34; Taking money in no special hurry, she just hadn&#39;t had time for any other customers and had no other help? The customer service situation seemed so ridiculous we cut our losses and left. 

My previous experience was at about 1:30 in the morning. We had called ahead and asked if we could place an order for take out so that we could come pick it up. The night manager was a 20-something year old kid that came across really cocky. He had no concept of customer service. When we arrived to pick up our order, he had a look like, &#34;oh shit&#34;. It was obvious he didn&#39;t put in our order. He went in the back and told the chef to start making some food, then came out and made up some excuse about why it was delayed. This was too long ago to remember the details of our exchange, but in the end, the order was wrong, probably because he was going off of his memory of 30 minutes earlier and very much delayed. He made no attempt to be polite or apologize for the delays. 

How many chances does a restaurant get to make a decent first-impression with a customer?
This Denny&#39;s blew it twice. I&#39;ll avoid it conscientiously from now on."

      Check please!          Charged us full price without even one single apology.      Walking back to the table to leave her very undeserving tip.    I notice all three tables next to us,  still uncleaned, all three had full plates of food and to go boxes on the tables.  Ours being the fourth."

We actually had a great experience. My plate was free since it was my big day and the food was great. Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was exceptional. Our server was super funny and very patient with all of us being in an intoxicated state. I would most def return to this Denny&#39;s for a late night food run!"

Or so the special cheese menu proclaims in a burst of yellow and orange laminated tri-fold.  The Mac &#39;n Cheese Big Daddy Patty Melt was something I had to try.  It starts as a basic patty melt but then adds mac &#39;n cheese as a topping on the sandwich in addition to a zesty red sauce.  The sandwich itself presents kind of messy, but is a wonderful taste sensation.  I suspect that the &#34;zesty Frisco sauce&#34; was just Russian dressing a la Sysco, but still good when combined with the other flavors.  Cooked to temperature perfectly and out in a jiffy, the meat was above average for this type of place.  The bread was toasted flawlessly and the plate overall looked right.  Some of the mac &#39;n cheese fell off the patty melt but that&#39;s why they give you silverware, right?  If you have to ask if I had the fries, then I may have already lost you. Side salad substitution?  Fool, please. It&#39;s all balanced out though. I had a DIET Coke instead of a regular, so I&#39;m good.

My waitress was clearly a part timer but on the case nonetheless.  She sat me, waited on me and had my order out fast.  She was quick with drink refills and got tipped generously for her efforts.  The restroom was clean, as was the restaurant and my table. The Muzak overhead was playing a Kinks tune (not a hit and I was kind of hoping to hear Lola, but it was not in the mix) and the odd also-ran 80&#39;s R and B number &#34;you dropped the bomb on me, baby...&#34; (was that Hall &amp; Oates also?  &#34;Whoa oh here she comes, she&#39;s a man eater&#34;).  

It&#39;s Denny&#39;s so don&#39;t expect too much, but if you need to get in and out quickly it might just be a good spot.  Catering to the meat and potatoes crowd may seem simple, but the aforementioned patty melt is a stroke of genius proving that even standard diner fare can be improved upon with a little imagination, improvisation and sheer grit - or cheese.  I think Denny&#39;s knows their target audience well.  Hell, I may have just become part of it.    

A family of six dropped in as I was leaving. 
-&#34;Stop hitting me.&#34; 
-&#34;Mama I want wa-wa.&#34; 
-&#34;Order whatever you want, just stop all that whining.&#34;
-&#34;Shh-shh, that man over there is trying to enjoy his meal...&#34;

I almost forgot, I learned that the senior club sandwich has only two pieces of bread as opposed to three.  That&#39;s what I get for eating dinner at 5pm."

While I can understand that during busy periods you have to wait. My initial wait was over 15 mins then I decided to sit at the bar. I waited another 25 mins for my food.  The coffee was good. I ordered sunny side up eggs with bacon, sausage and pancakes. The eggs came scrambled, the sausage one taste you can tell it was bad, when I told the waiter he told me the manager told him to subtract a dollar off the plate. The pancakes were dry like cardboard. And I also got served hash-browns. The only thing I was able to eat were the hash-browns.  While the waiter tried, I agree with another poster that said you get what you paid for. This was the final straw. I will never go back to Denny&#39;s."

I&#39;ve ordered delivery a number of times from Honey Bee. As far as timeliness, it&#39;s hit or miss. It&#39;s been a half hour and it&#39;s been over an hour on a busy night for them, however, they typically advise of the estimated time when ordering.

As far as the packaging, everything is always packaged well and the portions are big. One dinner can easily feed two. We even ordered a couple of boba drinks and they came to us perfectly intact.

Their food: I will say some entrees are much better than others. Of what I have tried, I&#39;m a fan of the garlic sauce (either chicken or pork in garlic sauce), their beef and broccoli, and their moo shu chicken. Those never disappoint. One of the reasons is the balance between meat and veggies with a delicious umami sauce. 

Some items I wasn&#39;t a fan of was their sesame chicken. It&#39;s mainly the fried breading you taste (not much chicken) and an overly sweet sauce with no veggies to balance it out. We&#39;ve also tried the salt and pepper pork chops and also lacked the balance that I want (lots of fried food). 

Their egg rolls and soups are decent. It satisfies the craving but there are places with better appetizers. Additionally, we have tried the boba drinks and while the flavors are delicious, it was a tad overly sweet. If that&#39;s what you like, definitely try it. 

Lastly: the fried rice you can get with your meal is basically just soy sauce and oil added - they don&#39;t add eggs or veggies or meats, it appears. While it may seem like that&#39;s a bad review of the rice, I actually ended up loving it. It&#39;s simple but tasty. Overall, I think it&#39;s definitely a place worth trying if you live in the area."

The restaurant was clean. The staff was friendly and greeted us we walked through the door.

The food was so-so and seemed processed versus being authentic.  The orange chicken  was heavy breaded. The rammen noodle lacked favor and it seemed like it had noodles and oodles in. The chicken  was bland and seemed to be frozen chicken.  The was minimal vegetables in it.

The rice was served in cracked bowls.

The staff did not offer us chopsticks  with our meal and we had to ask for our water to be refilled.

It would be a good last minute last grab something to eat place....but it would not be at the top of my list."

It was common where in my old home of DC, but seems rare here.  One place was super tough, and hard.  This place wasn&#39;t bad, but the General Tso&#39;s was more like.. sweet and sour chicken.  The veggies and everything, are pretty much what you get with sweet and sour chicken.  Green peppers, onions, and such.  The chicken was pretty heavy on the breading, and minimal on the actual chicken inside the bulk of breading.  It wasn&#39;t terrible, but wasn&#39;t great.  I&#39;m still on the hunt for the &#34;Just right&#34; General Tsos.  Eating half, I started to feel sick, from the overbreading of the chicken.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back.

I like their fried rice, soft, and delicious.  Other spots around here tend to have the fried rice be more.. hard, almost al dente style.

Generous portions as well.

Update - I got sick from the food here.  After posting, I ended up in the bathroom a lot...  Also had terrible stomach cramps when I tried to sleep, and felt woozy.  I ended up throwing away the entire 2nd full dinner portion I bought as extra, for lunch today, because of my experience.  Not sure if it was the rice or chicken.  Taking a star off."

I&#39;d never eaten here before, but really needed a simple night where I didn&#39;t need to worry about dinner.  At 6:20pm I had to call the restaurant to see where my food was.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but when I order something with a delivery time, I expect the delivery to happen at that time, not that the food hasn&#39;t left the building until that time.  I was told when I called that the delivery man would probably be there soon, within 10 minutes or so.  It was just over 10 more minutes until our food arrived, just after 6:30pm.  It was cold and extremely late.  I understand if you call the restaurant to place your order that it may take some time for delivery.  But when you order online and do so in plenty of time for them to make the delivery when requested, they fall far short on meeting customer expectations.  For the cost and hassle, this place is not worth it.  I&#39;d rather go to Panda Express:("

I recently moved to Aurora and have been trying out new places right and left. This time, I wanted to check out Honey Bee and see how their Chinese food is. I decided to go with my staple of Kung Pao chicken.  I base all Chinese restaurants on their Kung Pao. Brian got the orange beef and we got a side of spring rolls. The food took a bit longer than I would normally expect, but it arrived piping hot. I laid out a plate of white sticky rice and poured some Kung Pao on top and started to chow down. The flavor was a bit bland and the chicken was tough. So was the beef.  Neither were really that good.  Both of us were not impressed at all.  After talking to a friend about it later, they stated that Honey Bee has good pho, but not good Chinese food.  I guess I will be back to try the pho then!"

At first I was a little skeptical but it wasn&#39;t bad. I was not however a fan of the brown rice that came with it. I also got the jalapeño wontons. Those were on point. Some of the best I have ever had. My wife got the chicken Pad Tia. She wasn&#39;t a fan of it but I didn&#39;t think it was that bad. Overall not a bad place.

The only thing better than RAW BEEF was the customer service; almost as disgusting! After being delivered raw beef and disgusting Pineapple Curry for a 70 dollar take out meal, when I called to see if we could get something edible the manager conveniently hung up on me. Then after reconnecting I was going to ask if we could possible pick up something different since it was not for humans to eat. Instead I was &#34;educated&#34; on how terrible my choices in chinese food were! Sorry we have a dietary restriction in the house-- just so we are clear I have had beef with vegetables (sauce on the side) on many occasions and have never been served such disgusting unseasoned, old, under cooked beef in my life... 

In addition, I dare you to ask the manager if she recommends the Pineapple curry she doesn&#39;t suggest it . In her words&#34; its very flavorless and I wouldn&#39;t suggest it to anyone&#34; ... Can someone please advise her to take it off the menu!!!! Wow thats easy! 

Also I have def had this as well... Most places just serve Panang Curry with pineapple in it, sorry yours is not that and I agree one of the more disgusting items I have ever thrown in the trash.

The sweet sour shrimp was pretty good and I really enjoyed the sauce.  However, the pork lo mein was super bland.  No taste whatsoever.  Even the pieces of pork mixed throughout had zero taste.  I ended up having to dump Chinese hot mustard all over it.  I also ordered some fried dumplings.  There was way too much ginger which made it inedible.  Sad face.  I love me some dumplings, but these were just horrid.  I will say that I don&#39;t normally eat egg rolls from any Chinese place in the mainland as they usually taste bad, but the ones that came with the meal were surprisingly tasty."

It was located a few doors down from The Movie Tavern in Aurora.  Almost all of the booths were occupied.  A gentleman came out from the kitchen and seated us in a booth.  The cloth napkins were folded in the water glasses.

The interior of the restaurant wasn&#39;t very attractive.  They had live and artificial plants all over, a little &#34;office area&#34; near the coke refrigerator towards the back of the restaurant with nick nacks.

The food was 5 star (at least my food)!!!  We started  with an order of Potstickers.  I knew by the photo off the internet menu that I would like them.  They were made with a thick dough, not a thin wonton wrapper like a lot of places use.  The potstickers were perfectly browned on one side.  The meat inside was generous, moist and well seasoned.  The dipping sauce was served in a heart-shaped bowl.  I would come back just for the Potstickers!

My husband ordered the Thai Peanut Chicken with Fried Rice and Egg Roll ($6.95).  The chicken was all while meat slices stir-fried with snow peas, carrots, and potatoes.  It was like a light sweet and sour sauce.  No peanuts, just a hint of peanut flavor.  
The Fried Rice was very plain and bland with a few bits of egg and scallions.  
The Egg Roll was the standard vegetarian version with a side of sweet and sour sauce.

My Panang Chicken Curry Thai Hot came out in a beautiful ceramic bowl with 2 red chilis on top (see posted photo).  It had generous slices of white meat chicken, green and red bell pepper, snow peas, potatoes, and broccoli in a thick sauce.  I would definitely order this again.  The server asked how the heat was on the curry and I said, not Thai Hot.  So maybe next time she&#39;ll remember me and tell the chef to really make it Thai Hot.

My husband also ordered a 16 ounce Taro Smoothie with Boba ($3.99).  It came in a plastic cup with a melted on plastic lid that a lot of Boba places use.  They also had a 20 ounce size for ($4.99) which I thought was a little pricey.

Most of their lunch entrees were $5.95-7.95 which included an Egg Roll and rice.  Dinner prices were a few dollars more.  My husband usually likes to order the Pad Thai, but it wasn&#39;t on the lunch menu.  He could have ordered the dinner portion for $9.95 but he wouln&#39;t have gotten the Egg Roll.

On our way out, I asked for a To Go menu.  I may have to order more of those Potstickers!"

No one here.
Why is the service so slow?
At least my beer was cold and the glass ice cold.
3 stars for the beer.
Then the food.
Barely 1 star.
Where is the flavor?
My Mongolian beef was so stringy, I couldn&#39;t eat half of it.
The vegetables and rice...Panda Express quality.
Hmm.
I didn&#39;t like it.
Don&#39;t waste your time or money.
Luckily we had a Groupon.
What is that funny soup stuff?
Good-bye."

I&#39;m not, but I thought some of you might be.  So, anyway, I had this Groupon and I went to the Honey Bee Asian Bistro to make use of it . . .  I had read the pretty decent reviews and thought is might not be a bad idea to pick up a deal in this part of town.  We showed up about 1:30pm on a Friday afternoon.  There were only two other sets of customers in the restaurant.  The hostess immediately greeted and seated us.  She dropped off water and menus and we proceeded to wait for our server.  I took a little longer than I would expected, and when she did come out, she took the order of a customer who had come in after us first.  But, other than that, the service was pretty good.  Using the Groupon was a tad more complicated than usual, but not terribly so.

They were offering a special where if you send them a text, you get a free beverage with your meal.  That was kind of nice.  We ordered the Mongolian Beef, the Lettuce Wraps with Chicken, and the Tom Kha Gai soup.  I had a diet Coke, and my friend had a beer.  The Lettuce Wraps (Chicken, green peas, carrots, and bibb lettuce--enough for 4 of them) were probably the best part of the meal.  The lettuce was nice and crisp and was the right shape for the task.  The chicken and veggies were nicely seasoned.  This may not have been the best lettuce wraps I have had, but they were quite good.  The Mongolian Beef (w/ hoisin sauce, green &amp; yellow onions) looked great, and was a generous serving. It had tons of onions and came with fried rice at no extra charge.  The sauce was pretty good, but much of the beef was on the fatty side, and this was rather off-putting.  The Tom Kha Gai soup was some of the worst I have ever had.  The paper menu said &#34;Tom Kha Gai&#34;, but I see the online menu calls is &#34;Chicken Coconut Soup&#34; (Chicken, mushrooms and onions in a Thai styled coconut milk based soup).  This is probably more accurate.  I would call it &#34;Thai inspired&#34; if I were being generous.  It was not very authentic in flavor.  It had no heat and no sourness to it.  It was very bland and was 90% milky broth with some chicken, onions and mushrooms.   Its only positive aspect is that it was a rather large serving,  The irony, to me, was that from where I sat looking out the window of Honey Bee, I could see the Pearl of Siam in the distance, and found myself wishing I were eating there instead."

Perhaps I was so distracted by not being welcomed by staff, having to seat ourselves, squeaky vocals playing overhead, and poor and hard to understand menu explanations, that I was disillusioned. In my hard to mess up dish the carrots were marinated in an awful sauce, the tomatoes were far below the average grocery store tomato in flavor, and the noodles were slightly soggy. Our waitress did not check on us a single time so we sat without water and had to track her down just to pay our bill. The eggless egg rolls were great but with such a bad experience otherwise I cannot rate this spot as even decent this time around. I will try ordering Chinese before I write it off. Maybe a good Chinese dish delivered to your house would be different but the on site restaurant service is bottom rung."

At times like these, I&#39;m thankful for the plethora of options at Honey Bee Asian Bistro here in Aurora.

Good Lord, I could spend ages just on the Appetizer section alone! Healthy Edamame (young soybeans still in the pod) with sea salt? Cha Siu Bao (steamed buns with barbecued pork)? Egg rolls? Spring rolls? Two, count &#39;em, two, types of cheese wontons (one with cool avocado, the other with zingy jalapeño)? Should I just order them all, and let the lipids fall where they may?

Wait, let me compose and collect myself. I still need to think about my main course. Ooh, that Thai Sriracha dish sounds chili-hot but intriguing. But now that I think about it, I was always kind of partial to to the dried-fish-and-garlic sauce called Sa Cha too. Mango? Mushroom? Orange? Broccoli? And now you&#39;re telling me I have to choose between chicken, pork, or beef too? Ooh boy, I may be here a while.

Oops, I didn&#39;t even see this part of the menu. Thai curries (panang, red, green, pineapple)? Egg noodles with my favorite vegetable-protein-based flavor enhancer, Maggi sauce? Tomato fried rice? Sesame tofu? String beans with garlic? Yikes!

Well, since I&#39;ve looked at everything else, I might as well see what they have for dessert. Sugar donuts? Hmm, that&#39;s interesting. Almond cookies? Well, yea, those sound pretty tasty. Maybe a smoothie with a variety of flavors and add-ins (we like the boba... the boba that goes &#34;pop&#34;)? Wow, they even have a variation of Patbingsu (Korean shaved ice with fresh fruit).

Hmph. Apparently, I may be here all day. Hopefully you&#39;re not as indecisive as I am. But no matter what your finger points to, you can&#39;t go wrong with the varied vittles at Honey Bee Asian Bistro."

That was around 4:53 on Grubhub. My friend arrived 6:00, and I was hoping that the food would have been there by then. However, it soon came to be 6:36 PM and I was wondering where my food was. I then called the restaurant, they put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and they came back on the line stating that they did not see my order in, so it should be on its way. They then said if it is not to my place in 15 minutes to give them a call. Fifteen minutes passed by and still no food. (Mind you I live only 10 minutes away) I then proceeded to call the restaurant again, and they said that they had delivered the food. I confirmed the address with them, and they said they had that address. The person I spoke to went and checked with the manager. They had not changed my address, and delivered my food to the place where I worked. At this point I was not very excited my food had been delivered to the wrong address but also the manager proceeded to tell me that it was not their fault, and that everything was in my hands now. She said what I could do was to call my work, tell them not to eat my food, and then they will have a driver pick my food up from the hospital and bring it to me. Now I was not happy, and I admit that I was a little hangry at this point, and having a manger tell me that it was now in my hands to fix THEIR mistake, I insisted that I get my food remade, and sent to me as soon as possible. This is the only reason why I gave it two stars is they had my food remade and delivered it promptly. The food was decent, however I was not impressed with how the manager is there."

I have over looked the many times they forgot things in my order and would just call and ask for them to bring it out.  (Hoping for no special sauce ) Tonight i ordered crab cheese wonton&#39;s and they forgot the sweet and sour sauce, I immediately called them. I ignored the fact our soup was cold. The female manager said it was a new delivery driver and he forgot it,but it would be right out. After 30 mins i called back to tell her to disregard, it&#39;s cold and taste gross reheated. She said it&#39;s to late the driver has been sent and i can eat it without the sauce. I wanted my money back for food i won&#39;t eat, she said no and i offered to give the cold appetizer to her driver. She interrupted me to tell me i have called in several times to complain. She couldn&#39;t tell me about what, but i reminded her that each time was because they forgot my soup or entree. One time they didn&#39;t process my order off the online ordering. I told her that&#39;s not complaining, that&#39;s trying to get my order. I suggested if they can&#39;t deliver food right, maybe they shouldn&#39;t offer delivery. She didn&#39;t  care how often we ordered from them either. After a long argument i got my money back, the sweet and sour sauce, inedible wonton&#39;s and was insulted."

Would of been nice if they let me know of a more realistic time frame. I ordered sesame tofu and the walnut shrimp. The sesame tofu was pretty plain none of the sauce was actually on the tofu but sunk to the bottom and leaked out even through the paper bag. Proves the sauce is too watery. Walnut shrimp was decent. Walnuts still had the skin attached so some were kind of bitter.

We took my husband&#39;s mom and step-dad to eat here. Service was terrible. Our waitress ended up taking another tables order before ours, even though we were ready and were seated long before the other table. She said she was going back to get paper and a pen, but went to the other table instead. Nothing irks me more than when someone says one thing and does the complete opposite. She should have told the other table that she would be over in a minute. On a positive, I ordered cashew chicken and thought it was probably the best dish I&#39;ve had there. I would order it again, but don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back. We&#39;ll go to Pearl of Siam from this point forward (even though it&#39;s a different cuisine). Or maybe even The Golden Wok at Chambers and Hampden."

I think you have to ask them to cook your food the &#34;authentic Chinese way&#34; if you don&#39;t want Americanized Chinese food. We always ask for that and it always tastes great. I would say it is one of the top Chinese restaurants I have eaten in Denver.  

I would recommend their Thai Basil Fried Rice and Beef Chow Fun- remember to ask them to cook it the Chinese way!

The lettuce wraps, honey bbq spare ribs, and lemon chicken are also really good. Oh, and they also have thai iced tea!"

We recieved the menu for Honey Bee in the mail and decided to try it.  The food was delivered in a reasonable time and was freshly made.  The chicken fried rice was a big hit with the kids.  The crab cheese wontons were crisp and did not give the impression they had been pullled from under a heat lamp.  The lemon chicken was ok,  I felt the sauce didn&#39;t pack enough lemon flavor.  The sesame chicken was a better dish, a bit sweet with a little bite.  The Mongolian beef was a good proportion of beef to veggies.  The price is a touch higher than the other resturant, but the food was a much better quality.  Will definately order from them again."

I have had the experience of eating in and dinning out about 2 times monthly. Now that I have the best forget the rest of the perps... 

Oh, the wonton soup is very flavorful. The portions are so large you need two other people to help you eat. They do have smaller portions for around $8 and you still need 1 more person. 

Talk about delivering the food to your table with flare. Flower shaped rice, wasabi and ginger in a flower and the flavoring of all their foods POWWWWWWW.... 

Beef and Broccoli was to die for, favorite is Sesame Chicken oooolllllaaallllaaaa. My husbands is the Kung Po or Mongolian. The apps are a lot of fun.... 

I tell everyone on the street to go eat here or they are missing out on the best in town."

Honeybee Asian Bistro off of Tower Rd and Hampden is one of those places.  They serve  Asian Fusion, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese. So needless to say, there is bound to be something that everyone will find to their liking. 

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a smile and a hello. The décor is very relaxing with little whimsical items like a ceramic lettuce with wheels scattered through the place. They do have a small bar for those that would like to have to have a few drinks while they wait for a table.

My husband and I love our appetizers. Honeybee actually has a number of appetizers that range from the standard Egg Roll to Edamame. We picked our usual, Crab Cheese Wontons and Pot Stickers.  Our Waitress brought our the Crab Cheese Wontons first and let us know that the Pot Stickers were still being cooked. The Crab Cheese Wontons were perfect, nice and hot and without the left over oil. They were a nice golden color and not over cooked, served with a thick sweet sauce.  The Pot Stickers were just as good. They were meat stuffed with just a hint of cabbage in them, pan fried to the perfect crispiness. Like the Crab Cheese Wontons, they weren&#39;t served with left over oil. 

My husband ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles, with eggs, chicken, tofu, and vegetables in a curry sauce. The dish was pan fried with the curry sauce, making the chicken and tofu nice a crispy. It was spicy enough to clear the sinuses but not over spicy that makes you reach for a drink after every bite, so it would be good for those that don&#39;t have a very high spicy threshold.  

I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken. You have your choice of chicken, pork or beef. I love beef but mango didn&#39;t sound like it would go with it very well so I picked the chicken. I&#39;ve never had a Thai Mango dish before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. When it arrived it was large mango sliced mixed in with green, red and yellow peppers and chicken.  The sauce was a sweet sauce, like the one served with the Crab Cheese Wontons.  The mango melted in my mouth and the peppers countered the sweetness of the sauce. One thing that drives me crazy is that there are a lot of places that will have more veggies than meat in their dishes to save on costs. Honeybee didn&#39;t do that. There was enough chicken mixed in with it to have it with the mango and pepper slices.  I asked for white rice and mixed it in.  I had asked for their lunch size and it turned out to be perfect for me. As I got full, the sweetness of the sauce started to get to me. However, my husband and I ordered Iced Milked Tea with Boba and it helped me clear my pallet of the sweetness. 

For a dessert we ordered smoothies with boba. My husband ordered a Avocado smoothy with a hint of sweetness that he wasn&#39;t expecting. Now this isn&#39;t something that is on the menu so if this sounds good, you&#39;ll have to ask for it. I requested a raspberry one and it had just the perfect blend of tartness and sweetness. We had asked what they did to find the balance in both drinks and our waitress said it was just a certain amount of sweetener and asked if we like them as she could add more sweetener if we wanted. We both loved  what she made. 

Honeybee Asian Bistro offers something that is different and we recommend going. They really don&#39;t have a kids menu so we recommend only going with kids that aren&#39;t very picky eaters. The prices are fairly reasonable for the portion size that is given. They offer take-out and delivery services for everything on their menu."

So far I cannot comment on the dine in experience, but the delivery one was great.  The food was delivered promptly and as ordered.  It beat the pants of off certain other nearby chinese places.

I just went here this evening and was very pleasantly surprised with the food.  Coming from San Francisco one of my favorite dishes out there was Tomato Beef Chow Mein (more of a Cantonese dish, and almost impossible to find out here).  Honey Bee however had a &#39;Tomato Fried Rice&#39;, and simple change to make that Tomato Beef Lo Mein and I was set!  Not quite the best I&#39;ve had, but more than satisfied a long overdue craving.  On top of that, had their yummy scallion pancakes and a boba tea.  

The decor and music are nice, tasteful, and very welcoming- not the new &#39;fusion&#39; style, and not the dark and dingy feel either, just warm and classy.  

The waitstaff is pretty quiet with broken english (wouldn&#39;t have it any other way), and our food was brought out of order, and our check came quick too.

The tables had butcher paper with some crayons on the side...regardless of age,  I&#39;ll still take the opportunity to play some &#39;dots&#39; when I can!

Last Thursday I ordered from them one final time, hoping that maybe I had been catching them on an off day or something but I was wrong. I ordered Tso&#39;s chicken and my husband had the Singapore noodles. We also had some won tons. The chicken was over cooked and hard like candy, and the rice was mushy! The noodles were OK, but the veg was overcooked too.Our won-tons were raw and chewy. The only edible thing was the one egg roll I had. I emailed them and gave them a chance to fix the situation but no one responded. There going down hill and seems to be making there food cheaper just to fill the box....sad."

We ordered the beef and broccoli, which my wife liked, but I thought was somewhat rubbery. The orange chicken was super fried and you didn&#39;t even taste the chicken, just the fried batter and orange sauce, which was decent orange sauce. We also had pad thai which was the best part of the meal. It wasn&#39;t great pad thai but it was good enough to like. I&#39;m not sure I would go here again unless I was desperate for some pad thai and wanted it delivered. 

As far as the service goes, our waitress was awesome. Very friendly and she answered all of our questions. We did have to wait for about 30 minutes for our food, which was ridiculous. Luckily I have an awesome wife to make the time fly by. I wouldn&#39;t recommend dining-in to anybody not married to my wife.

If you want chinese food and you aren&#39;t in a time crunch, go check out Blue Bay Asian Cafe. Tell them Noel S. sent you. When they look at you funny, say never mind, and then just order. You won&#39;t regret it."

I really like the restaurant itself. The booths are super comfy, where are other fav Asian Restaurants are Uncomfortable !!! 
Hate eating on hard chairs-- Yes, I&#39;m turning into my Mother. 

The restaurant also has a liquor license -- Yeah, but before you get too happy, the Vodka is Gordon&#39;s if that tells you anything. 
Although I hate beer, I stick to a TsingTao here. 

I find the prices about on par...maybe a buck or 2 more, but not crazy high. 
I also find portions a bit smaller, and no soup with lunch, but you&#39;ll get more meat vs filler here, so it depends if you like more protein ( me) or filler ( hubby). 

It&#39;s more like a 3.5 for food, but the comfy booths up it to a solid 4.

Older review:

Honey Bee has much better food than the previous Chinese restaurant that was at this same location. So if you used to not like Yangs, give this place another try since it is not the same. 

I live nearby and have always did a pick up instead of eat in. Today I actually ate in the restaurant. I have always had a good meal here. Normally my favorite dish is the Tropical Fried Rice and my wife likes the Pad Thai. Today I went with a different dish, I ordered the Thai Peanut Pork. My food was good, but the peanut sauce was a bit sweet and syrupy for my taste, and is not something I think I will order again. Don&#39;t let this dissuade you if that is what you want, since the sauce was good enough, just not my taste. My sister ordered the teriyaki chicken. I tasted the teriyaki and I thought it was a bit salty. Still, everything was cooked correctly and had good flavor. The rice was good. They added an eggroll to the meal that was a bit greasy. The portions seemed a bit smaller than what you get with takeout (however I did order off the lunch menu, so it may have been smaller due to that instead). 

One thing I have consistently noticed with this place is that the food is fairly good, but it does take a long time to get it. I notice this more when I have done pick up and have always had to wait even after giving them 20 minutes before even going over there. Today was not as bad, however there was only a few people in the place (maybe 5). If you are on a lunch break from work you would really be taking a risk going here due to the slow nature. Our service was good, but the waitress thought that Mr. Pibb and rootbeer were interchangeable drinks, we had to explain that Mr. Pibb is similar to Dr. Pepper and not rootbeer. There was also a mix up in the tea, where they served unsweetened tea and then refilled with sweet tea and so that had to be replaced, but they were very gracious about it. 

Also a note the lunch items were mostly priced around $7."

Why we love the owners and staff, always attentive friendly and before they even had Pho on the menu they would make it for us.  Now they have it and it is the real deal. Not made from bullion powder mix, but whole chicken cooked all day long.  I swear by it, if I feel a cold or like I might be getting sick, I hop over to Honey Bee get a good helping of their chicken pho and what ever ailment that was looming is gone the next day. Better than moms chicken soup, really!"

This restaurant made me feel the most welcomed during my trip to Denver and I enjoyed coming here. Coming to Denver, I was told that brunch is a very huge deal and coming to Jelly Cafe on a Sunday morning, I could easily tell that this is true because the wait was long. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The 30 min+ wait will be worth it though!

When we were finally up, we were greeted by the most friendly server ever. I believe her name was Katie if I can remember correctly? Sweetest server ever and really knows how to make the customer feel welcomed and comfortable with asking her anything! We ended up ordering some alcoholic beverages, such as a bloody mary and this drink that comes hot and tastes like apple cider, which was recommended to me. I personally thought they both tasted great and we especially really enjoyed the apple cider-y one. 

In terms of food, I decided to get the Basic Breakfast which consists of 2 eggs of your choice, bread, potatoes, a meat option, and pancakes/waffles/french toast if you want to pay extra. Simple breakfast, but deliciously made. My friends got some more exotic type of dishes and they were delicious as well. I remember my friend getting the Breakfast Burrito and it was MASSIVE! We definitely had some for later. 

This place is also very popular for their mini donuts that come in a variety of really interesting flavors. One of the flavors was even thai based and came out with sriracha on it! I LOVED the donuts here and I&#39;m not even a huge donut or sweets person. They&#39;re amazing.

Overall, although a very popular and hectic establishment with tons of people around, the customer service here definitely tames all of this. Everyone who works here comes off very friendly, open, and willing to do whatever they can to make your stay here enjoyable. You were my favorite for sure, Jelly Cafe!"

The food is not bad. Its not amazing however, which I was expecting based on the high marks. 
It does win for creativity however and use of green chili. I had the classic biscuits and gravy, southern style, with a side of green chili. The green chili was good with its pulled pork and general green chili flavor. The gravy on my biscuit was too thin and not sausage-y enough which was disappointing. The home fries on the side were also meh. It looks delicious externally however, making for great pictures.

The donut holes are very thick for donuts. It feels like they use the biscuit dough and just fry them and cover them in special sauces to make them special. I didn&#39;t actually like the donuts themselves but that is a delicious lemon sauce. 
I got all of them to try them and after splitting three I was over it. 
The Mexican chocolate is kind of underwhelming but I guess I can see that if they used actual chocolate made in mexico instead of a chocolate cinnamon type of mix.

So overall they win in creativity. But they don&#39;t win in food deliciousness."

We had just finished hiking Red Rocks and decided to pop in for breakfast on the way back to our Airbnb. 

When we walked in, the place was packed, but there were a few open spots at the counter, so we sat there. We started with a couple of coffees, which were great. I&#39;m not sure what roaster they use but it was pretty good. My wife ordered the corned beef hash and I ordered the ultimate biscuits and gravy. Both were fantastic! My only complaint was that I asked for no sour cream on my plate and I got it anyway. It&#39;s not an allergy thing for me, so I just ate around it. The guy working the counter did offer to make me another, but it&#39;s fine.

The interior was fun and hip with old cereal boxes adorning the entire length of the wall.  The service was friendly and personable and with our Yelp check-in, coffee was on the house.

We ordered the Boulder Scramble, Breakfast Burrito and 4 donut bites (Salted Caramel, Mexican chocolate, Lemon filled and Cinnamon sugar.) The Burrito and Scramble were both delicious.  The green chili sauce on the burrito was the right amount of hot and the scramble which contained mushrooms, spinach and feta was a nice healthy option.

However, the donut bites, which appear to be their specialty, were just ok (a bit dry).  The toast that came with my scramble, couldn&#39;t really be called toast (who knew you could mess up toast.) It seemed like bread that had been heated for a few seconds.  If the toast had been &#34;toasted&#34; and we were more blown away by the donut bites, this would have easily been a 4 star review."

Besides the hostess, the service was awesome and the wait wasn&#39;t too bad (15 mins). They have a giant connect 4 game outside which made time flew by.

We ordered many flavored of their famous doughnuts and I had the Salmon Benedict which I loved. Lots of flavor, decent portion size, and a fun atmosphere. The waiters were very nice and also gave me great recommendations of other place to try in the city. try this place!"

Come early or expect 30 min wait on the weekends. During your wait, you can order beverages at the coffee bar and if you&#39;re a creep like me, people watch and stare at all the cute cereal box decor from the small waiting area. Or if you&#39;re less creepy ;) just walk around Cap Hill, check out nearby vap shops, and wait for that &#34;your table is ready text&#34;. 

I seem to enjoy their sweet stuff more than savory. I&#39;ve tried their Benedict (didn&#39;t blow my mind), sweet potato hash (amazing), pancakes which are my fav and they&#39;re always having new specials. And of course the donut holes!! Try all of them, seriously."

Sunny Saturday&#39;s make me want brunch. Okay, I want brunch pretty much any day, but warm weekend mornings definitely increase the feeling. 

On this particular Saturday morning, I grabbed up the fiancé and some friends for a brunch adventure. Due to fond memories we decided on Jelly. 

When we arrived there was quite the wait (not unexpected for a spring Saturday). The host put our name into his magic tablet and said he would text when our table was ready (I still think this is way cool; why don&#39;t more places do that?). We waited around the bar so we could order drinks and donut bites (hey, we were hungry). 

The bartender was a little snippy and told us if we weren&#39;t ordering we couldn&#39;t sit at the bar, but I give them a break on this since they were very busy and I get that the bar can&#39;t become a waiting area. 

Anyway, we ordered Bhakti chais and the fiancé got a huge Bloody Mary with the salad add on (pretty much an entire garden on top). We also ordered three different donut bites to try: green tea, Mexican chocolate, and jelly filled. Luckily these came out quick since we were hungry. 

The drinks were great. They know how to make a spicy bhakti here. The donuts were alright. They seemed kind of cold to me and the donut part was nothing special. The sauces were tasty though, particularly the green tea and Mexican chocolate. 

Eventually more chairs opened up at the bar and the bartender let us order our whole meal there. 

I ordered the Sweet Potato Hash. They let me swap out the chorizo for spinach to make it vegetarian (props!). Let me tell you, this hash is AMAZING! Sweet potato, red potato, onion, celery, and poblano pepper in a tasty mix with two eggs any style and the lovely biscuit on the side. This is the thing to order. The flavors were amazing and it all went away way too quick. Who knew something so simple could be so good!

Also, just to real hit home on this: GET THE BISCUIT! It&#39;s the best you&#39;ll have and the jelly is the perfect accompaniment. 

The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place the fifth star from this visit was the donuts under impressed and the staff was not as friendly as remembered. Could have just been a hard day for them though. 

I will definitely be returning plenty to update."

Well, I would have to agree with her.  We came here and waited for about an hour, yes it&#39;s that popular.  The best time to dine here is after the morning brunch rush, unless you want to enjoy one of their delicious Bloody Mary&#39;s, Caramel Apple Ciders or Mimosas while you wait.  Mrs. Mimosa (Janet D.) didn&#39;t care for their traditional Mimosa, as she likes them stiff These were tall and lacking the champagne kick.  I really enjoyed the Apple Cider infused with caramel vodka and served warm, perfect for a winter day.  Once seated the food was delivered timely and piping hot, and the staff was wonderful.

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash, as well as, the Lavender Blueberry Pancakes.  Ordered both for the experience, knowing I will be bring leftovers home.  The corned beef hash was prepared the way I love, strands of beef and not the canned cat food, as I describe it.  The only thing that was a bit disappointing were the eggs, a tad overcooked, but nothing disastrous.  I was a bit reserved when I ordered the pancakes with the lavender, but the lavender was very subtle with the blueberries flavor being dominant.  The pancakes were fluffy and moist, and the accompanying biscuit was flavorful.

Overall I was pleased with the experience, especially the delicious meal.  The long wait is expected with this place, so be prepared to wait.  The bar is open for single diners during the weekend, which helps with tables for couples or more."

The only thing that sucks is the long waits on the weekend (sometimes an hour +) but that&#39;s why I make it a point to come on a weekday. My most recent visit was on a Monday afternoon and although it was busy, it wasn&#39;t packed. I sat at the bar, where I ordered the Boulder scramble, add bacon per the bartender&#39;s recommendation with a mimosa. The mimosa was surprisingly made with what tastes like freshly squeezed orange juice--yum!  The scramble was delicious and I really love the potatoes that come with, especially with the Sir Kensington ketchup that they have. Their homemade jelly on the biscuit is definitely worth trying too!!"

For me it&#39;s their Cinnamon Roll pancake! It came highly recommended by the server and rightfully so. I had the three stacker but I am sure that I would actually go for the five&#39;er today with a side of bacon. Best pancake ever! It&#39;s not too sweet but oh so yummy! It comes in two, three or five stacks. 

Today we tried their Caramel Apple Cider. It comes warm and damn good! I also went for their mimosa. I&#39;ll skip this next time.

The staff here are fast and on top of their game. Being the weekend and their no reservation policy is not my favorite portion of this review. Beggars can&#39;t be choosers. Here I am a beggar alright! A happy one!"

We (myself and 3 friends) came for brunch on a Saturday. It didn&#39;t look too busy, but the host informed us the wait was an hour. We put our names in and decided to hang out at the bar and have some of the donut bites. If you decide not to stay in-restaurant, you can provide your phone # and they will text you when your table is available. 

Initially one of the bar-tenders was a little rude to us. They said we, &#34;could not sit at the bar if we were waiting for a table.&#34; I found this odd since we were planning to order food/drinks while we waited.

After a while, a few more seats opened at the bar and we decided to eat there instead of waiting for a table. At this point, the bar-tenders became significantly more friendly and accommodating. Odd, but understandable I guess. 

The food was great, as usual. The donut bites are an excellent starter. I highly recommend the green tea anglaise; it was a group favorite. 

I had The Northwest Scramble. It was cooked perfectly, although the chef seemed to have forgotten the goat cheese. There wasn&#39;t any to be found. The biscuits are a personal favorite and I highly suggest substituting one for toast. They&#39;re made in-house! The potatoes are also very good--cooked to perfection and topped with sour cream and chives!

I also had a Bloody Mary (w/salad). It&#39;s definitely a unique drink and I enjoyed the flavor quite a bit. It was a little weak on the alcohol, though. By the time I ate the &#34;salad&#34; and reached the lower 1/4 of the drink, it just tasted like watered down tomato juice with a little pepper in it.

Overall this experience wasn&#39;t the best. Even the greatest restaurants have off days from time to time. I hope next time our service is a little better and my scramble is prepared correctly!"
jelly-cafe-denver-2,AmyRae S.,tnYUY2uuRbbKAGyRZ6X3CQ,"Thornton, CO",1,1,1,60,12,UAVBfEeP5c9bI9C2YHVXPQ,2.0,2016-10-17,"I&#39;m sad that I didn&#39;t end up loving this place. The decor is so cute and I really wanted to love it. 
The whole experience started off badly. I was the first to arrive in our three person party. I was seated and eventually the waitress came by and asked if I wanted anything to drink while I waited and I said no. She then ignored me until one other person in my party showed up...it was only about 5-7 minutes so not a huge deal but still not great. 
When it really got bad is when my friend showed up and informed our waitress that our last guest was running rather late, stuck in traffic, but that she would be here. I guess our waitress took that as &#34;We would like to be ignored for as long as possible, thanks.&#34; 
We eventually had to force her to come over and take our orders. When our third showed up she asked the waitress what would be quick because she felt badly we had to sit so long as she was stuck in nasty traffic. The waitress then proceeded to give our third guest a blank, bitchy stare almost like &#34;really? you&#39;re not asking me that&#34; as if she had asked her something completely absurd. 
She then kind of flung the menu onto the table under our third&#39;s face and pointed at something and said &#34;this is easy.&#34; 
In addition to all this, our water glasses sat empty for at least 20 minutes. We actually had to ask her for more water. She never asked us how the food was or checked up on us at all. She just dumped the check off, which is when WE had to ASK for more water. 
I would consider giving this place another shot because the food wasn&#39;t bad (it wasn&#39;t fantastic either), because one waitresses inability to do her job doesn&#39;t mean the whole place can&#39;t. However, there is a huge difference between not being great at your job and being HORRIBLE at your job. I don&#39;t expect breakfast places to come with a fine dining wait service experience but I expect to not be ignored and I expect that my water glass will be filled."

Also, recently tried their White Russian w/ an espresso shot - amazing!

Everything on the menu is superb. DONUTS! All the hashes. The biscuits are damn delicious. The jelly. Swoon.

Last time I was there, I decided to try lunch. I got BBLTT which was great but I would request it toasted to melt that sweet sweet brie. Bf got Cuban - fantastic!

The place was still super packed though. The inside decorations were great. They had these really old school cereal boxes surrounding the wall, and some other hipster decor. It&#39;s a bit cramped inside but nothing you can&#39;t work with. 

The jelly donuts we started with were really good. I got me a haco chili Benedict that came with a stew of chorizo poured over the biscuits. It wasn&#39;t my typical Benedict order, but it was really flavorful. I gotta say though, the best thing about this breakfast was the bottomless coffee, especially because of the chilly and snowy weather!"

I don&#39;t know why everyone&#39;s standards are so low they thought this place was good.  We were told 45 min wait, which we did with smiles on.  We had bloody marys while we waited which I thought were delicious but weak (um, did I order virgin?) but it was good so it wouldn&#39;t have bothered me had we been seated - but we were seated AN HOUR AND A HALF after we arrived. Then another 30 minutes for food.  Don&#39;t come hungry or without an old friend to catch up with and a new person to get to know at the same time. Or 5 crosswords, or the entire Harry Potter series, or a Rubix cube, or the encyclopedia.  I&#39;m not sure why we continued to wait, but we were just committed at that point - were we supposed to start over somewhere else after hours of wait?

I&#39;m vegan, I know - have a meltdown and groan about bacon.  But for me there weren&#39;t amazing choices.  I&#39;m used to happily and politely rearranging/requesting though so I got a scramble with no eggs no cheese and requested there be extra potatoes and vegetables instead of the left out eggs and cheese  (ahem, in exchange for the more expensive ingredients I&#39;m leaving off can you give me extra cheap o potato). Got a teeny snack size pile of oily potatoes. Not impressed. 

The staff wasn&#39;t particularly offensive, but they sure didn&#39;t go out of their way or feel remotely bad about our wait. Complacent hipster vibe. 

I wouldn&#39;t go again and I wouldn&#39;t recommend.  Seems like there was potential but first impressions are everything and they blew it spectacularly. No one in their right mind would spend a total of 4 hours going to brunch. And I left hungry. 

I forgot to mention the hair! (long eyebrow sized not head sized) - but did not even say anything to them because I&#39;m not that squeamish and how much time would that add to the ordeal? Not worth it."

Probably my favorite thing about it besides the food, is the ability to get doughnut holes and coffee while waiting for your table. 

I cannot really make a lot of menu suggestions. I have had the Haco Chili Benedict. What puts it over the top is the Poblano Pepper and smoked paprika flavor along with serving on a biscuit. If it were on an english muffin, I think it would get soggy but the biscuit adds texture and holds up throughout the meal.

Also, while sides are usually afterthoughts I do love the seasoning on their breakfast potatoes. So go there, grab some doughnuts and coffee, eat the Haco, go home stuffed and happy!"

SERVICE: the service is excellent! Hostesses, waiters, and waitresses are super duper friendly.

FOOD: My wife didn&#39;t like the breakfast burrito since the sauce was a too intense and the seasoning was subpar; but the veggie Benedict with poached eggs were AMAZING!!!

I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict and even though I hate Hollandaise sauce, this one was described as having a dill hollandaise which I hoped would detract from the usual butter taste.

**here is my actual review of the breakfast.  The salmon Eggs Benedict is a fillet of fish on top of sourdough bread, topped with a poched egg and dill Hollandaise sauce.  Honestly, it was PERFECT. The dill really evened out the tartness of a typical Hollandais, the salmon although unconventional for a breakfast dish was AWESOME. 

My friend got the French Toast which I&#39;m assuming was good since he cleaned his plate. 

All in all I dig this place and would definitely be a regular here if I lived in Denver.

The decor and ambiance is fun and and colorful- there are even awesome vintage cereal boxes decorating the walls. The donut holes are amaaaazing! We couldn&#39;t decide so we ordered one of each. They are larger than standard donut holes and are made-to-order so they are insanely fresh and oozing with a variety of delicious savory sauces and sweet creams. My favorite is the Thai peanut! We had a plate of 8-10 between 2 of us and were almost full after just the donut holes and mimosas- I would drop in for these alone if I lived closer! 

The one thing that reeled me in was the bottomless mimosas- which were good. They are served in a tall, milkshake-type glass (instead of the standard flute) and actually got me fairly tipsy from the first 1 1/2 mimosas! It was $12 per person, which seems a bit steep compared to your average $2 or $3 mimos, but I guess averages out since there are prob 2 to 3 standard mimosas inside one Jelly glass. If you can handle your own and plan on getting a few refills- it is without a doubt worth it. If you&#39;re a lightweight and only plan on drinking 1 or 2, I would skip on the &#39;bottomless&#39; option"

And, the other day, patrons seated at the counter enjoyed fresh and creative breakfast cocktails as well as vegetarian Eggs Benedict with slivers of portobello (and sour cream dolloped taters on the side). Of the cocktails, the Bloody Mary (overflowing with pickled veggies) and the White Russian (+ shot of espresso) were particularly palatable. The White Russian, served in a rather bulbous flute, is creamy and swirly with coffee liquor, a perfect indulgent pairing with Jelly&#39;s made-to-order donut holes. The holes are uniformly divine, though they should be eaten warm as they tend to dry out rather quickly. In sum, you&#39;ve simply got to Jelly if/when you visit Capitol Hill.

I got the Eggs Benedict because I&#39;ve never had one and always have wanted to try it.  They put it on sourdough bread, and the ham is shredded a bit and it tastes so good.  Once I was done I got to use the rustic potatoes and my boyfriends biscuit to soak up the yolk &amp; hollandaise."

However, a trip back home reunited me with deliciousness and I couldn&#39;t be happier! They are located in Capitol Hill, not too far off from downtown Denver, and have another location off University blvd. There is only street parking at this location, so do leave a little early to scout for parking spots. 

My friends and I went on a Monday morning, so there was no wait and was seated promptly. The interior is bright, inviting, and eclectic (there&#39;s old school cereal boxes lining the wall). Besides the typical breakfast drinks, they have additional specialty drinks to fit everyone&#39;s taste buds. I ordered a Bloody Mary to start (because no brunch is complete without one). I was elated to receive bacon with my drink! My friends were happy and content with their choices as well (chai tea, juice).

Being that it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve eaten at Jelly, they still had most of the dishes from the past, and have expanded on others. Our group ordered a variety of doughnut holes to start and the ones that stuck out to me were greentea, maple bacon, custard, and jelly. Made to order, they&#39;re delicious and bite sized! In the past I&#39;ve had their Eggs Benedict, and Biscuits&amp;Gravy. This time I went with a more traditional plate - Basic Breakfast. It was simple but hit the spot, and the jelly they served with toast is homemade and tasty! My friend got a similar plate, and the other ordered a breakfast burrito. The burrito was huge and described as &#34;sinfully filling&#34;. All good, and satisfied with our choices.

Service was great, and prompt. Our waitress was friendly and helpful when choosing items. They offer lunch as well, so check out those plates if you get a chance. This place does get packed over the weekend, so arrive early! If not, put your name down and explore the neighborhood. Next time I&#39;m in town, I&#39;m trying the Bacon Pancake, and a few other items that caught my eye. Happy Brunching and shall update when I get back to this lovely establishment!"

LIE #2 hidden sour cream on potatoes. Being a non-dairy person this was not so great. 

LIE #3 &#34;Jelly&#34; made my the restaurant Jelly is actually a close resemblance to a cup of peaches made for children.

I looked at the menu the night before and there were several items that stood out to me. When I arrived, I was notified of a few specials including the Fruit Loops French toast. No, that&#39;s way too much sugar for me.

I ordered the harvest hash with packed eggs. The eggs were cooked perfect and the strawberry rhubarb jam for the toast. The hash was rather underwhelming and greasy. My tea was actually pretty bad. It was some label I hadn&#39;t heard of but it wasn&#39;t any good. I also got some donut holes but they were just kinda blah. They are made to order but basically they are just fried dough balls with your choice of sauce drizzled on top. Ho hum.

It is also quite loud in here, can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like on the weekend. I don&#39;t plan on returning."

Pablo&#39;s Coffee
8 Donuts - Jelly Filled, Crème Anglaise, Green Tea Anglaise, Mexican Chocolate, Lemon Filled, Maple Bacon, Cinnamon Sugar, Thai Peanut
Bacon Pancakes - Buttermilk with Bacon Crumbles
Lavender Blueberry Pancakes - Topped with House Made Lavender Blueberry Preserves and Fresh Blueberries
Cinnamon Roll Pancakes - Drizzled with Sweet Cream Cheese Glaze
Housemade Buttermilk Biscuit with Housemade Raspberry Jelly

Told by locals and friendly travelers that the decision between Jelly Cafe and Syrup was largely a matter of personal preference and whether family-friendly or hip-and-trendy was most appealing it was actually location that took me to Jelly Cafe on Wednesday morning, the 80s Soundtrack, Man-buns and Sleeves of Ink confirming comments about the scene, though everyone from host to servers was actually far more pleasant and well trained than similar spots in other states.

Featuring a fun menu of Breakfast and Lunch favorites plus a handful of Daily Specials in a Diner-Style room with Old-School Cereal boxes decorating the walls, it was a young woman in glasses and a skulled apron that served as my waitress for the morning, coffee from nearby Pablo&#39;s filled repeatedly with even a cup to go.

Unable to pass on the fresh donuts, each hole either topped or filled with something quite distinct, a &#39;large&#39; order of eight was selected to the tune of $5, the Spicy Peanut and Matcha Anglaise each unique and inspired while the Maple Bacon and Cinnamon Sugar were both unfortunately a bit too heavy with grease.

Offering several breakfasts, both sweet and savory, the majority offered in a la carte portions for those willing to invest a bit more in variety than just one thing, it was with little indecision that three individual pancakes were selected in addition to a housemade biscuit, the later separating in layers of soft buttermilk while each flapjack was light and fluffy, the Bacon-studded version not particularly imaginative while the spiraled Cinnamon Roll and Lavender Blueberry rounds were both quite pleasant, the toppings adding to their respective bases without overwhelming the aromatic subtleties."

I finally walked past on Sat morning and there was no line so we went in. I am glad I did and although there maybe too much hype on this place it is really good and step up from typical diner food.  It is a cool place and I get why its so popular.

Having went to Kentucky and it being Derby Day I went with their version of a Kentucky Hot Brown. They did it justice.  Feel like for the price it should come with eggs or potatoes but overall I was pretty happy with it.  Their coffee is good, hot and they continually refill your cup.

Biscuits and gravy and corned  beef &amp; hash. Very good food. The seasonings were different but delicious and i was able to tell it was not a mass produced slop. 
Overall a great breakfast place. If i lived in Denver i would come back.
The only reason i didn&#39;t five star is because i bought a hot sauce and there was some price changes. I was told it was $7.00 at the counter and then was rung up for $8 plus tax.

They offer a lot of variety on their menu, and when we checked in on Yelp, we got a free coffee! Instead of creamer, I asked for almond milk, which I thought was awesome that they had it available. Although I really wanted to love it, my order was only average. I ordered the veggie biscuits and gravy. I was expecting there to be more vegetables on top of the order, but it only came with a side of potatoes. Maybe they can swap out the red potatoes for sweet potatoes to make it a little healthier? Or add some greens somehow. It still tasted delicious though and it&#39;s rare to find a veggie version of biscuits and gravy.

I sat at the counter both times and the girl working the counter is honestly a dream. She&#39;s so nice, super attentive, and personable.  The cutest.  She was working both times, and was super friendly.

I enjoyed a medium well-done burger with jalapeño jelly (something they make in the house, which gives it a hell of a good kick) and the most delicious baked bread and fruit on the side.  Who would ever think of jalapeño jelly? What a way to knock the ball out of the park!

When you check in on yelp you get a free cup of coffee.  So of course I got it. I have to admit, their coffee is absolutely wonderful. My friend enjoyed eggs Benedict and said it was one of the best dishes she had ever had in her life of eggs Benedict. I highly recommend this place and will return when I come back to Denver."

There is typically a wait at Jelly and unfortunately, they do not take reservations or calling ahead. But while you wait, you can place your order of jelly-filled doughnuts or order coffee/drinks. The time goes by fast! Or you can provide your cell number and they will text you when your table it ready, so you can meander off into the streets of Cap Hill. 

On to the menu! I&#39;ve tried a few of the breakfast items, including the eggs benedicts, scrambles and hashes. All good. My most recent visit, which is also what prompted me to write this review, I ordered the Molly Hot Brown! I noticed it was on both the breakfast and lunch menus and the server confirmed with me that it&#39;s their &#39;special!&#39; And boy, was it a good choice! The dish includes: house roasted turkey served on savory french toast smothered in green chili cheese sauce topped w/ bacon and griddled tomatoes. Don&#39;t be fooled to think that this is a sweet dish because of the french toast, it is definitely still savory! But highly recommend it - as it is a one-of-a-kind dish at Jelly! Comes with the rustic potatoes which are good, a little bland, but the splash of green onion and sour cream helps! You really can&#39;t go wrong with any of the dishes here!"

For my ACTUAL food, I had the northwest scramble with smoked salmon, chives, chèvre. Potatoes and wheat toast on the side. It was to die for.

Against our better judgement we stuck it out. The app they use to keep tabs on your place in line is pretty great, but I&#39;d rather rave about the food than the app. 

Jelly is a cute space on the surface, very retro with cereal boxes from my childhood lining the walls. Once you sit, you see the wear and tear. But whatever, we were there for grub. 

Our friends ordered french toast and a breakfast burrito, my husband had the corned beef hash and I had the tres leche pancakes. We sampled four donut holes to start, each picking our favorite flavor. After the long wait anything should have been tasty for as hungry as we were, but I didn&#39;t even finish my lemon custard donut. The first bite tasted like a grease bomb, I had no interest in a second bite.

Unfortunately, the disappointment didn&#39;t end there. The french toast was so soggy, it was inedible. The hash was sad looking, with a few dry corned beef scraps. The accompanying biscuit was dry as bone. With a name like jelly you&#39;d think there would be a variety of jellies, but no, our waitress said there was only the mango pineapple. My husband doesn&#39;t care for pineapple so it was a lost cause. My pancakes were edible, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it and its certainly not worthy of a 45 minute wait. The breakfast burrito appeared to be the best choice, but even that was pretty lackluster. From start to finish it ended up being a two hour ordeal... Never again."

Known for its donuts but we weren&#39;t impressed sadly. Some were technically filled but it felt just doused in some sauce. The texture of the donut hole itself wasn&#39;t soft or dense. I wouldn&#39;t purchase them again.

The food itself was not too shabby. The breakfast burrito is crazy!! Huge! The sliders were okay.

We were told a 10 minute wait which flew by and defiantly was faster than 10 minutes !!

The environment is loud, fun and colorful !! All pink and orange and vintage like . Love the decor and vintage cereal boxes on the walls . All servers and staff are Very Friendly !!!!! 

On the Food note I got the 4 gluten free doughnut holes ; available in 4 or 8 and gluten free or regular... They have 8 different flavors to choose from !!!! Also made to order so they come out hot ! I got the cinnamon sugar, jelly, and chocolate Anglais. My dad got the breakfast burrito which he was Overly Impressed with!!!!! HUGE BREAKFAST BURRITO with green chili, potatoes, meat and eggs, also cheese and a tiny bit of sour cream !! He said hot and great, not to spicy and full of flavor !!! defiantly a meals worth . I got the tofu scramble Thai Peanut Style and was pleasantly surprised !! Cubed tofu with veggies and a mild thai peanut sauce with huge potato home fries and a gluten free toast with jelly ... Lots of menu options vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and others !! Only thing is Is wish they had vegan pancakes .. They do however had gluten free ! Would love to return though ! 

I recently came to Jelly again to try it when I was in the neighborhood, This time came in around 10:30 and no wait ! Our waiter was very friendly and refilled our drinks as well as asked how our food was. I got the iced coffee with soy milk, that was very good ! Then to try something new I went for the Gluten Free Pancakes. You can order 1,3 or 5. I did 1 gluten free pancake of the blueberry lavender with a side of scrambled eggs. My dad did the Apple Almond French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. The pancake was amazingly fluffy for gluten free and the fresh blueberry compote on top was great !

I would highly recommend eating brunch at Jelly.

They have a good atmosphere too. It seems to get a little disorganized when it gets busier. There was a long wait for tables, but the hostess wasn&#39;t writing any names down. A table would open up, she&#39;d just walk up to the lot of us and ask, &#34;who&#39;s next?&#34; While I have faith in the honor system, my faith in my memory as anything more than ephemeral is nonexistent. It fostered that feeling you get at the grocery store when you&#39;ve been waiting in line forever and a new checker opens up and asks, &#34;who&#39;s next.&#34; You know which feeling I&#39;m talking about. 

Anyway, we sat down and ordered some Mimosas and food. The food was simply ok. I ordered the Chili Benedict. The biscuit sort of thing it came on was very stale. The section that wasn&#39;t covered in sauce was almost rock hard. The chili was tasty. Unfortunately one of the eggs was almost inedible. I ordered my eggs medium but of of them showed up with runny, raw whites. Eek!  That is too undercooked for me. 

I think the waiter may have sensed this because he sent us out a plate of donuts, on the house. It was a nice gesture and the donuts were delicious. I especially liked the crème anglaise."

Between this and all the other breakfast / brunch eateries, this one is definitely on par.  The crowd is what I have come to expect, larger and louder then I would like.  (I would now like to state that I am not expecting an instant seat, nor a library style silence).  The food was good, but again, with the plethora of breakfast eateries, solidly on par.  

The location was convenient, but I would have liked better parking, which is more an issue with the area then with the restaurant in particular.  

Seating was slightly delayed and service was what we expected.  Again, it was on par.

Food was good, but unless you frequent and love Denny&#39;s (not judging you ... honest) ... it is the type of breakfast foods you would expect from a modern (ok, maybe judging a little) breakfast eatery.

I will return if I happen to be in the location, but likely would not go out of my way to dine with them.

On a side note, their collection of cereal boxes is whimsical and fun.  Some of which I am sure I ate years and years ago."

Most people are regulars so there is a very homey feel to the place.

The place is a little loud, so be prepared to yell! Loved the vintage cereal boxes from the 80&#39;s on the walls, really nostalgic.

I really talked this place up, again, because I&#39;ve had great food and service at the other location. When I finally got the chance to go this weekend (late Saturday), it was very busy.. and busy in the way where it was painfully loud and chaotic. This could be due to the size of the restaurant, or that it was a weekend.. or that the music was incredibly loud. The music we ate our brunch to was early 2000&#39;s rap.... so its always a great experience to be eating your toast and to hear Lil Jon singing &#34;Get Low&#34; and seeing people grind on each other next to your table. I don&#39;t know what that was all about.. 

We had the type of server that you could see talking to other servers, and sitting down talking to customers, that they are clearly friends with.. all while you are waiting to place your order. 

The coffee was pretty bad. We had 2 lattes, and both came out less than desirable. One had to be remade, and the revision came out pretty bad too. There should be a balance of coffee and flavoring .... this is something that&#39;s hard to find... I don&#39;t know why. 

The food was fine.... similar to Village Inn or something."

We probably won&#39;t come back again if there&#39;s a line out the door. It was probably an hour wait. The nice thing about it was you could order coffee and donuts while you wait but would have to stand eating or sit on the uncomfortable benches near the window if you&#39;re lucky enough to get a seat. 

I ordered the stuffed french toast and the cornflake French toast. The cornflake French toast was soggy so I didn&#39;t eat much of it but the stuffed french toast was delicious. It was stuffed with a strawberry cream cheese which was great. 

Their donuts were also really good and reminds me of stuffed malasadas from Hawaii except much smaller and not coated with sugar. 

If it wasn&#39;t for the wait, I&#39;d come back for the donuts and stuffed french toast. Also interested in trying the salmon benedict."

The first time we tried to come to Jelly we left because the wait for two was over an hour - this was at about 9am on a Sunday. This time we got here at 730am and there was no wait time.

We both had eggs Benedict - the original and Haco. They were good but not mind blowing. It&#39;s hard with so many great breakfast places in Denver. The potatoes seem a little bland - just roasted no seasoning.

Finally the famous donut holes. I&#39;m not typically a donut hole person but these I actually really like. They would be the reason for me to come back. But between the wait and the food (besides the donut holes) I&#39;m not sure this has been my favorite breakfast place in Denver."

As for the brunch food, it was your typical fare. I had the special of the ultimate biscuits and gravy and it was good, but I was only able to eat half since it was filling.. And I had the donuts prior. The biscuit was so fluffy which I liked but I wish there were more meat in the gravy or the dish overall. 

Remember to check in and get the free coffee. The coffee was delicious!

Cute little cafe. Fairly intimate. We arrived as their day was coming to an end so though they were still fairly busy - not so busy we had to wait to be seated, which seems this is the kinda place that would have long waits I imagine especially in mornings and on weekends! 

After tasting the food you would agree with me, I&#39;m sure!! Though, I did not try their more popular Jelly donuts (I defiantly plan to next time). I had the most delicious biscuits and gravy, with haco chili. It was a mix of a little sweet and a little savory. The biscuits came with just the right amount of potatoes a big hefty dolap of sour cream and I added two eggs &#34;sunny side up&#34; Yummy! 

It was defiantly hard to decide what to choose as there were many appealing choices. Next time, I defiantly plan to try their corn flake French toast!

The handmade donuts, that&#39;s why. They have 8 kinds of delicious, still warm donuts that you have to try all flavors of. (You don&#39;t HAVE to...but cmon!) I like their Corn Flake french toast, and they have some good hashes and pancakes here.

MY wife and I had made it our Saturday morning ritual to go there every morning for breakfast and mimosas.  We had been doing it for about four months. We started out loving this place and the service, but things have sort of gotten shaky. 

The service (even with our usual waitress) have started to become hit or miss. Some Saturday&#39;s it&#39;s great service wise and then two more weeks in a row it will be so bad we debate about even tipping. 

The food quality has definitely slipped. They changed the menu and removed some of the items that drew us to the spot in the first place.  As an example they removed the Tres Leche pancakes, and substituted it with a blueberry lavender pancake which tastes like the bottom of someone&#39;s feet.  As well the Benedicts are now consistently overly soggy and most often have numerous eggshells in them.   

It is really a shame that things have slipped so badly as we really did love our little neighborhood spot. However now we find ourselves going to Snooze more often.  However we will still try once in a while and will gladly return to religious attendance if and when things improve."

Upon deciding to branch out from my usual scrambles and hashes, I got the Molly Hot Brown. Reading it on the menu - French toast, roast turkey, green chili, bacon, tomatoes - sounds weird. But I was intrigued. Upon the waiter&#39;s face when I ordered I knew I did well. And the first bite proved it. Wow! So flavorful. Sweet, salty, tender, flavorful, fluffy - all good. This dish would get 5 stars. The donuts are good - lemon curd and jelly today. The scrambles and Benedicts are solid but nothing to write home about. Fresh squeezed OJ though - definitely another winner (a tad pricey though). Of course I&#39;ll be back to try more and indulge again!"

We were helped and served coffee right away, and our server was not shy about continuing to fill our coffee cups. I had a combination of the cinnamon roll pancakes (YUM!), scrambled eggs, and a biscuit, as well as an assortment of donut bites. Everything was excellent, and the serving size was plentiful.

We waited over half an hour for our food, which was brought out by someone in the kitchen, and my eggs which I ordered over-medium were completely runny. The bartender never checked back with us to ask how our meal was or even if we wanted another drink.

The food was dry and disgusting.  
There was next to no choices.  

They call it a buffet, but all they had was an omelette bar, run by a nice kid who&#39;s probably never made an omelette in his life.  The line at the omelette bar took around 20 minutes to get through. 

The &#34;buffet&#34; was two tiny tables crammed together with unlabeled trays with dried bacon &amp; sausage, cold hashbrowns, Green Chile, AND THAT&#39;S IT. They also had a beautiful chateaubriand that was cooked so well-done it wasn&#39;t even edible.  

Then they had smoked salmon that was truly revolting.  The head chef later admitted it was frozen cold-smoked Atlantic salmon and he wasn&#39;t happy with the quality, but he served it anyway. 

This meal reminded me of a breakfast at a Holiday Inn when you get there right before they clean-up.  Not in any way, shape or form worth what they were charging.

On top of all this, our waitress was terrible, never checked on us once.  I had to tell her to clean off the plates.  Then, after we were clearly done, and I made her take all the plates, she never brings me a check.  My girlfriend and I sit there waiting for almost 10 minutes, trying to wave her down.  Finally, I asked to speak to the manager.  She informs me there is no manager or owner there.  She proceeds to bring me the young kid from the omelette bar.  

Don&#39;t get me wrong, he&#39;s a great guy, but not even the head chef.  He admits to only being there 2 months.  Finally, I tell him I want the head chef.  I wait an additional 7-10 minutes for him to arrive at the table, he was a nice guy as well and finally comped the bill.

I will never be back.  If you want a good brunch, go elsewhere."

To kill two birds with one stone, after shopping at this vicinity, we decide to have Dinner @ EMART Restaurant, since I don&#39;t feel like going out anywhere else.  Though I cannot deny, Hubs does not really fancy about the idea.  The service was slightly slow, since this is a Mum &amp; Pop shop in the E Mart Supermarket itself, at least, the lovely lady is inviting and welcoming.  When I ask for the SPICY level, YES THEY DO Deliver To My Liking.  

I like the SPICYNESS that they offer.  My Kind Of SPICY!  Hubs wanted to order the Sesame Chicken, UNFORTUNATELY they do not offer it, that evening.  *Hubs Sad Face*  Therefore, Hubs opt for the Beef Fried Rice, though he said just A-OK.  Yes, I can see several chunks of Beef cuts on the Beef Fried Rice, just a normal kind of Fried Rice, nothing fancy at all...   At least the Beef Fried Rice comes with Peas, Carrots, some Tofu pieces and Bean Sprouts.

I opt for the Spicy Squid and The Galbi.

*  Galbi ($15.99)
*  Spicy Squid ($9.99)
*  Beef Fried Rice ($9.99)

The Spicy Squid comes with several vegetables like carrots, cucumbers and green scallions.  The Galbi though came out HOT, it was put on top of Raw Onions, sprinkled with Green Scallions and several sesame seeds.  I am indeed torn about E Mart Restaurant.  All in all its A-OKAY Dinner, though I so wish if they could offer more Banchan offering.  DO NOT MIND RETURNING when needed....  The total cost of our Dinner from E-MART Restaurant was $38.85 with tax.

E MART Restaurant only offer like 4 different kind of Banchan, that evening.  If I could recall properly they were Baechu Kimchi - Spicy Pickled Cabbage Kimchi, Radish Kimchi, Cucumber Kimchi and Slices of Egg Tofu with Onions.

3.5 Stars for the Spicy Squid &amp; Galbi.
Hubs rate it as 2.5 to 3 stars. 
3 stars for service.  Overall 3 Solid Stars. 

**Hint Hint**...  This is BY FAR the ONLY KOREAN establishment in Denver Metro Area that can cook the SPICY LEVEL to my liking.  Like Like ALOT!  PERIOD.  While having our dinner, the Chef managed to strike a conversation with us.  He mentioned that he can cook anything from the Menu to our SPICY-Ness Level aka to our SPICY Liking.  This I like.

This place is exactly that!  

I had read the positive reviews, and decided to check it out.  I literally interrupted the owner&#39;s dinner.  They jumped up from a table to take my order, whipped it up, and served it with a bevy of sides.  Very tasty!

Throughout the meal, the gal regularly checked on me, offering to bring more of the sides if I wanted.  The portions are big, so I politely declined, and continued stuffing my mouth.

The restaurant itself resides inside a large Asian supermarket, which is in itself an adventure.  Once you are done eating, allow another 30 minutes or so to roam aisle after aisle of uncommon and unusual food stuffs...

The owner&#39;s have changed so i was a bit skeptical, but he is super sweet and even helped me decide what would be best since I&#39;m shy trying new foods..  His menu is fairly small,  but the  portions are crazy huge and its definitely affordable.  For all 3 of our meals it only costed $30 which is not bad for Korean food.  My mom in law got the seafood soup, I received the chicken and my husband got the black bean noodles.  The portions were big enough for 5-6 people! Huge bowls and a huge plate for my chicken!  My chicken was the best chicken i have had at a Korean establishment.  OMG, it was grilled to perfection with some sweet marinade! We frequent tons of Korean restaurants and i have to say this was the best I have had.  Seoul BBQ is good and our favorite but its a little pricey. My husband&#39;s noodles were cooked to perfection and my mom in law&#39;s soup was super good.  I hate seafood but they had me try it and i was impressed because it was not a fishy broth and the squid was very good.  Overall, i will go back to this restaurant again and again.

Although located inside E Mart in a warehouse-like environment, don&#39;t let that deter you! The owners are friendly and helpful and the menu is easy to read. I usually get a Soondubu (tofu soup) which comes with 4-5 different banchans (mini dishes) and rice, and it&#39;s definitely worth it. You can ask the owner to adjust the spiciness level and they will gladly do so for you. I like my Korean food nice and spicy and it surely hits the spot.

I&#39;ve only been here twice, but both times I&#39;ve left feeling like I can&#39;t wait to come back!  This is a family-run business that makes some very tasty food and the people that work here are super nice and make you feel welcome.

The first time I went, I had the Cochinita Burrito and it was amazing.  The pork was very fully flavored (in a good way) and the other fillings complimented the meat.  I did get it smothered, but would not again - at least not this particular burrito since the meat already has tons of flavor.  The second time, I had the Chicken Enchilada Plate and it was delicious, as well.  There was a choice of mild or hot green chili that covered the enchiladas. I went with mild (didn&#39;t feel like sweating in public) and would order the mild again.  It was one of the best (if not the best) green chili sauces I&#39;ve had in Denver.  The accompanying beans and rice were also yummy.  Also on the enchilada plate was a small dollop of their guacamole.  Delicious and super fresh!  I&#39;ll probably order a side of that next time.  BTW, prices here are reasonable and portions are generous.

This restaurant is fairly small - maybe 8-10 booths along a couple of wall and about 6-8 tables in the middle (give or take).  The eat-in section of the restaurant has a bit of a sports bar look to it, but not overly so and there is a large window at the front to let in a lot of natural light.  The first time I walked in Quijote&#39;s, I was a little confused as to what to do.  For starters, even before I walked in I had a little trouble finding the right door to go in (was walking up from the south).  Once I got in, it looked like it was strictly a take-out place but go through the doorway on the left and seat yourself at a table if you want to eat there.  Someone will bring you a menu and take your order.  After you eat, you don&#39;t get a bill but rather walk back over to the takeout counter and tell them what you had and pay.  Interesting system, but if it works for them - groovy.

For me, Quijote&#39;s is a great find.  For some reason I&#39;ve had hard time finding good, casual Mexican food (other than tacos) since I moved to Denver and this place reminds me of the tasty offerings I used to have many moons ago when I lived in SoCal.  Kudos to Quijote&#39;s!"

The menu features the usual suspects (fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, burritos) as well as an above-average selection of non-alcoholic drink. I went with a smothered (with green chili) carnitas burrito and a horchata while Lara tried the cochinita (marinated pork) burrito. Both burritos were large, fully stuffed, and well-seasoned, the meats were not dried out, and even the requisite accompanying tortilla chips had a nice lime zest.

Neither service nor pricing left any room for complaint. Food arrived and drinks were refilled quickly and our server was helpful. The burritos ($8.25 + $1.75 more for a smothered) were a good value given the quantity, and a $2.75 horchata with free refills is tough to beat.

There are plenty of places to get Mexican in the Denver area, but Quijote&#39;s has the right combination of food and pricing to really stand out."

The staff is always polite and very friendly. Since I come here at least once a week, the owner knows my usual order, and makes it perfectly. The ingredients taste clean and fresh and the service is usually very quick.

Having an onion allergy can make eatting out challenging to say the least. At many other restaurants server staff usually seem a bit annoyed when I ask for no onions please, but not at Quijotes. When I order my usual steak burrito with no onion they never have any problems and I never get onions by mistake. The staff are also very helpful in letting me know what items on the menu have foods that I can&#39;t eat. Which is nice because the staff at most restaurants just assume I am ordering no onion out of preference and not necessity.

The restaurant itself is always very clean and has a very well organized dining room. The kitchen is open for guests to see, and appears to be kept immaculate which is good.

I love Quijotes and will continue to fequent here."

I picked up a smothered chorizo burrito with &#34;choice of heat&#34; green chile for a co-worker and checked it out- (sorry has to pass muster)- and had my hair blown back by what I saw. A light green smothered breakfast burrito that actually had the  nerve to be paired  with a scoop of sour cream and guacamole- unreal and extremely audacious and appetite bewitching, (btw coworker was ecstatic and happy post devourment and split it with the boss haha). A few days later,  I got the chorizo burrito with a happily supplied side of green chile sauce and guiltily drank the green chile after what was left of the devoured burrito. You know you might do that too if you are a true chileophile. In the end: if the venerated Chubbys had this type of passion you might see a culinary nationwide spread of green and red chile como nosotros Americanos que viven y amor!! You ask for service like this at Chubbys, not withstanding others and you might see the ugly side of some hombre or gringo!!"

Not even a block down you&#39;ll find this more authentic (Torchy&#39;s is not meant to be authentic, so it&#39;s no insult), very cool little joint. 

The food is great. The ingredients are fresh and the service is good. I ended up getting a barbacoa burrito which was huge and delicious. They also have horchata which is always a huge plus in my book. 

I really loved their guacamole. It&#39;s simple, fresh, and had a wonderful texture. Probably my favorite thing I had there. My friend had amazing slices of avacado on her dish, so it&#39;s obvious that they purchase good produce and make their guac freshly in house. You&#39;d be surprised with how many &#34;Mexican&#34; places use premade, bagged guacamole. Not Quijotes!

The prices weren&#39;t bad, either. I&#39;m looking forward to trying out their breakfast burritos since they looked amazing and were very cheap.

Could go 4 stars for the food and the friendly service but it feels a little like amateur hour.  I think they&#39;re pretty new and took over someone else&#39;s space and they just haven&#39;t quite settled in.  Plus no hard liquor = no margaritas - boo.  So, we were stuck drinking very pricy micheladas (really $6 something for a beer and some Clamato at 2 pm on a weekday?)

I will say that at some point there has been a Mexican in the kitchen because the flavors were pretty spot on.  Shared the guac and chips (salsa on the side) and it was good.  I&#39;m sure the chips were commercial but they were thin, perfectly crisp and warm.  The guac was good and a little chunky which I like and the salsa was clearly a Mexican recipe not the usual tomato stuff you normally get here.

They have quite a diverse menu - botanos, tortas, burritos, caldos y ensaladas, breakfast specials, plates and a couple of desserts.  We both had plates $9.99 and it was a lot of food.  She had the chicken enchiladas and I the chile rellenos.  We were both quite pleased.  Even the beans and rice on the side were tasty.  The chile rellenos were the real deal - not something wrapped up in an egg roll wrapper.  Quite delicious but our lovely server asked &#34;mild&#34; or &#34;spicy?  I opted for spicy and it wasn&#39;t at all.  In fact nothing we had was even bordering on spicy including the salsa.

So, lunch netted out at $41 plus tip.  Maybe a tad high for a little store front kind of spot on Broadway but, as I said it was a lot of food.  I&#39;d probably order differently next time and I&#39;m sure there will be a next time."

I wanted to give this place a couple tries before reviewing it, both times I&#39;ve stopped in were pretty great. I ordered the standard breakfast burrito, once with sausage, once with bacon. I do like the fact I get to choose what kind of meat I&#39;m feeling like in my burrito. Unlike Santiago&#39;s where you can only get the &#34;burrito of the day&#34;. They also have a few different breakfast burrito choices, they have a steak and eggs burrito and a chicken and avocado breakfast burrito. The prices are a little higher than say Santiago&#39;s. The standard breakfast burrito is  $3.50. The size is good, and it always has lots of eggs meat potatoes and cheese. Green chili is good, but not too spicy for those of you who love spicy green chili.

I have yet to try their other lunch/dinner items, but I can only imagine they would be just as tasty as the breakfast burritos.

This is not a snack, this is a meal.  I can&#39;t speak for anything other than three of the breakfast burritos, but they all rocked my world.  The chicken avocado burrito was packed full of both, an amazing amount of fresh, delicious avocado, in fact.  The meat lovers burrito is loaded full of meat and cheese, all of it fresh and tasty and plentiful.  Seriously, these things are HUGE. Today I had the chorizo burrito, and I am pretty sure that I made ooing and ahhing sounds the whole time I ate it.

I have to point out that almost everything has pork green chile in or on it.  This is really good green chile, truly.  In a city in which every damn restaurant claims to have the best green chile in Denver, and 99% of the time they are completely lacking, here&#39;s a place that doesn&#39;t bother to claim to have the best, but certainly has a mighty fine green chile.  

Nice atmosphere, super clean kitchens - hell, even the soda out of the fountain was awesome, and while that might sound ridiculous, 9 out of 10 times I get a fountain soda it&#39;s pretty gross.

I am thrilled that I live as close as I do to this place, because this will definitely be my go-to breakfast burrito joint."

So this review is based solely on that.  I like all the variations and really like the chicken and avocado breakfast burrito.  It comes with Green Chile on the side.    I have had several of their breakfast variations they are always fresh, have a lot of egg which I like and are pretty tasty.  They have been pretty fast almost everytime to which is a plus when your trying to get to work."

Tasty as hell, cleaner than any place serving three dollar burritos has any right to be, great staff, and juices to ease your guilt at ordering two burritos because they are so cheap.

...Take the breakfast burrito challenge: what is $2.50 or $3.50 here beats any seven or eight dollar burrito in the city. Takes less than three minutes to make and now you are headed out the door with twice as many of them.

...Or get any breakfast burrito smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce and eat-in with a endless basket of warm chips and a huge veggie juice.

I prefer the chorizo breakfast burritos with the sauce; they are amazing.  As a previous reviewer indicated, these burritos are a decent size, so you will not be disappointed.  Incredible quality and good quantity make this my go to spot for breakfast burritos.

Apparently consistency of service has been an issue in the past considering these reviews, but my colleagues and I have been going there pretty consistently for the past few weeks without issue, and have been very pleased.  Can&#39;t comment on the hours since I only visit there in the mornings and occasionally for lunch, but things have been operational.

I rarely order it however, because stateside, it&#39;s often too greasy, breaded and dry. But now that I&#39;m 8 months pregnant with my second child, I know how important it is to feed your cravings. So I walked in to city pub today with the plan of eating some crappy fish and chips and reading Shonda Rhimes&#39; book. 
I also ordered a salad so my baby has some tiny idea of what a nutrient is supposed to taste like. 
The salad comes and I&#39;m pleasantly surprised. It&#39;s just a house salad, mind you, but this is a pub. So when I taste the crisp mixed lettuce and fresh juicy tomato, I&#39;m happy. Everything in the salad was wonderfully fresh, even the mushrooms! I enjoyed every bite. 
Back to Shonda, who is so obviously an excellent writer, (she owns Thursday nights for a reason). I&#39;m always lost in her book. She thinks just like me and I feel like I&#39;m reading my own diary, from a parallel universe where I&#39;m fabulously successful and glamorous, of course. 
So when the fish and chips come, the smell that wafts up to my nose brings me a sense of joyful anticipation, but I know from past chippy fish encounters not to get too excited. I nonchalantly take my fork and sink it into the fish. The crunch that followed broke my book hypnosis. &#34;that sounded pretty crunchy! Oh it must be breaded. No no, it&#39;s not! It&#39;s just crunchy!&#34; I take a bite of the plain fish first as I like to know what I&#39;m dealing with before marrying it with tarter sauce and malt vinegar. It&#39;s really the perfect crunch. The fish is also wonderfully cooked. It&#39;s moist and flaky, not dry or chewy in the least! Usually the fish is way too chewy and dry OR the crust is soggy. Very rarely do I get to sink my teeth into a crunchy moist piece of fish. The taste was also outstanding. I didn&#39;t even get back to my book for another 5 bites. I mean, how rare is it, in this day and age of overstimulating media, that one actually pays attention to every bite of a meal? The perfection of this fish gave me no choice. I can&#39;t wait to go back for more. The fries and coleslaw were also good but the fish was a show steamer.
The pub itself is lovely. This afternoon it was pretty quiet. They seemed to have lots of different channels available. The beers all looked mouth watering but I am creating a stupid baby so I&#39;ll have to wait on that for another month.  
The waitress was incredibly attentive and kind.
Bathrooms were clean. 
They definitely need to repave the parking and driveway but I&#39;ll gladly mess up my suspension for another bite of that fish!"

Stopped in last night for dinner and the restaurant side was almost empty.
Our waitress, who I&#39;ve never seen before
Did acknowledge us and took our drink order quite promptly, but it was all down hill
after that.
Took awhile to get the drinks, our food took
even longer.
The burger and chicken sandwich were good as always but can&#39;t help but notice how skimpy they have become with the condiments for the burgers....tiny piece of onion and tomato, not to mention the fries
and tater tot portions that are about half the size they used to be, although the prices continue to go up!!!
Was asked if we needed a second drink and never saw our waitress again.
Never got the second drink or the green chili that we requested as a to go order.
Needless to say when our waitress finally
decided to check on us, we weren&#39;t happy.
We asked to speak with the manager who wasn&#39;t there, and we were pacified with &#34;how about 10% off your meal&#34;
Really? What a insult!!!
How about try providing better customer service for patrons of 20 years!!!
Or better yet all patrons!!!
Seems as though the patrons on the bar side receive the best service!
If that&#39;s how you want to operate you should close down the restaurant side.
In closing, we refused the discount.
Not looking for free or discounted food!!
Want to spend money for good food and good customer service.
Guess that&#39;s too much to ask for."

Our waitress, a bit overly familiar and distracted when she came to our table, she actually commented &#34;sorry, distracted, oh look! A squirrel!&#34; Realized quickly we were just looking for a quick meal and expertly took our order and read it back with no errors.  

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which came on very fresh bun with a side of a surprisingly good coleslaw. The pork was juicy and the sauce was excellent! If we had more time I could&#39;ve eaten entire second portion. 

What I found quite interesting is that there were six TV screens in the dining room area one of which had been commandeered by a customer to whom the remote control was given. Luckily he turned it to a NBA game but I thought that was quite odd. No matter, it did not detract from our experience and actually the waitress came over and indicated he was not able to keep the sound on so it would not bother other diners.

Again, our overly familiar waitress made some kind of comment about making sure we got the correct bill which was again a little odd and honestly took so long to bring it that we opted out of getting a slice of pie which is the main reason why we pulled in... There was an advertisement about how good their pie was on the outside. I recognize that she was the only waitress for the entire dining room but it was not that busy. I think she may have been chatting with some of her coworkers in the back.

Again, outstanding pulled pork! Highly recommend! Kudos to the cook... He or she earned all the stars on this review."

Keep in mind only two other tables were eating.  we  Placed our order.  A couple comes in sits next to us, and gets drink right away.  Ten minutes goes by and out comes food...THEIR FOOD.  I ask the waitress what&#39;s taking so long, she apoligizes...another 15 minutes goes by,  the bartender come up and apologizes and offers to by our next round. So we thank her and ask if our food is ready yet, 47 minutes after we order, our burgers and fries come out.  Mine was ordered medium comes out, burnt ,dry, and more like a slider not even 1/8lb, my friend ordered medium well and his comes out rare? with out what he asked for; cheese (extra $)  and bacon ($extra)  then I get the waitress and tell her,she says she will let the cook know.  we then wait another ten minutes and get the check.  $35 for 4 beers and burgers?  not worth the two hours we spent here.

Here in the Denver area, there are lots of good places to enjoy a solid burger.  Recently though, I tried a burger at CityPub and, in my opinion, it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had here in Colorado.  Before I wrote a review, I wanted to give CityPub a second try and again, the burger was awesome.  So good, in fact, that I&#39;m now hesitant to add much to it because the pure flavor of the beef is so good.  I enjoy burgers at The Cherry Cricket and other fine hamburger spots but, I really think the CityPub Steakburger is still a notch above the rest.  Give them a try on Tuesdays, in the evening, when they offer a burger, side and a beer, for $10.


Great Burger, Rude Owner

I&#39;m sorry to have to update this review but here&#39;s the story...

CityPub and Burger, near Yosemite and Hampden in Denver, had an email sent out on their behalf. It was for corned beef and cabbage today, March 12th and St. Patrick&#39;s Day, next Thursday. Since I wanted to try the dish, I called today to find out when they would begin serving the entree (maybe dinner only?). I was informed they would not be serving the dish at all today. The irritating part was when I asked the owner about the change, he said the email was a mistake but was extraordinarily rude asking &#34;so, what&#39;s your point&#34;? My point was, and is, if you&#39;re going to send me an email asking me to come and enjoy a meal at your restaurant, you might want to fulfill the offer, but at minimum, not go out of your way to be rude.

I will not deny myself their truly great burgers. But, I can say that my opinion of CityPub has taken a BIG hit. It&#39;s hard for me to believe that Rich Salturelli, the owner, is willing to be so rude to, a once loyal, customer and fan."

Came here on a hot evening recently, annoyed by my broken A/C, a long day outdoors, and was two hours+ past hungry.

And hot damn.  CityPub.

Never even heard of this place, and have no clue why.

The beers were ice cold and refreshing, their whiskey lemonade was strong and tasty and cheap for what you got.

The prime rib was pretty darn bomb.  And I hate using that word.  It was filling, delicious, and the sides made it even better.

The bill wasn&#39;t bad at all, and came out spending less than I had anticipated.

The staff was crazy good too.  Two little girls, my nieces, hungry and tired and a bit cranky, and the staff was perfect for them.  Brought waters in kids cups right away, extra plates for them to eat off of, extra napkins, and some stuff to color with.

Got the nieces fed, got out of there happy, and generally pleased.

Been back for a burger since... awesome."

I ordered the steakburger with cheddar cheese and their special sauce. My fiance got the steakburger with cheddar and avocado. After waiting for almost half an hour, we finally got our food and it was wrong. Missing cheese and avocado, we asked that they take it back and correct it.  They brought it out again and one had swiss on it.  At this point we were starving and didn&#39;t care.  The burger was amazing.  Cooked perfectly on a sourdough bun.  The side salad was tasty as well. The server was great for being extremely understaffed.  The place was busy for a Thursday. If they were not understaffed, it would have been a 5 star visit."

My experience on two separate occasions were widely different, and that was the premise of the previous review.  I have been back two times since my last review with better results.  To his credit, Rich, one of the owners, tried to personally contact me to discuss my review.  We were unable to connect, but it was impressive to have him personally reach out.

As I indicated, I have been back twice in the past month.  The first time was just a quick trip to the bar for a bowl of Green Chili Stew.  I sat at the bar, and received fair service.  Sitting at a bar in a restaurant frequented by regulars is always a little difficult because the server is often more focused on their regular customers.  And, while this was the case that night, it was not horrible, and I never felt completely ignored.  Plus, it was very busy that night, so considering all, the service was adequate.

The Green Chili Stew  is the best menu item that I have tried at City Pub, and is some of the best I have tasted in Denver.  I would recommend it to anyone, anytime.

My second trip was a recent Sunday afternoon.  There were a couple of football games I wanted to watch, and didn&#39;t really want to do it at home.  City Pub is close to my house, and .  Wings sounded good, and I checked their menu on the web. It suggested that they had some of the best best wings in town.  While that is a little bit of a stretch, they were certainly good, to a little better.  They had plenty of decent tasting sauce, but was not drenched in it.  I asked for the wings to be extra crispy, and our definition of crispy must be a little different.  Next time I&#39;ll ask for them to be a little more done than last time.  This, of course, is just my personal preference, and I would go back to City Pub for wings again.

I was a little surprised at how sparse the crowd was, but it was the holiday&#39;s, so maybe that was the explanation.  I sat at a high top, and had good service.  They even changed one of the TV&#39;s so I could watch both of the games that I wanted to see."

To be fair, the burger was pretty good--once I could get past the grease-saturated bottom bun.

I raised my shield just in case of flying glasses or punches.

1. Ordered my draft beer and loved the frosty pint glass. Extra star.
2. Signature Citypub burger with coleslaw was delicious. 1/2# burger with bacon at $10.25

I will be back to enjoy the frosty glass of favorites. Check out the daily specials and special deals on their easy to navigate web site.

** nice to see that Yelp review for this place is monitored personally by the owner.  If any of you got any compliments/complains.. makesure to leave them!

The place is a gem off the beaten path serving great food with a solid laid back atmosphere.
The food is way above your typical bar food fare in quality and taste.
Asking around I found out that the owner is a long time restaurateur with the Bay Wolf, City Grill and the Manhattan Grill as some of his accomplishments.
It&#39;s pretty obvious this guy knows what he&#39;s doing when it comes to running a resturant and bar.
Staff is friendly and you can tell they actually like their jobs.

They have good happy hour specials and a $3.50 beer of the day, every day, all day.  Tuesday is Trivia night and each night of the week they feature a different meal special (I.e. burrito night, burger night, etc.).

City Pub is know for their green chili and &#34;best burger&#34; in Denver.  Knowing this, a friend and I shared the hamburger and the rellenos.  The green chili on the rellenos was on fact amazing and a good contender for the best in Denver (Bull &amp; Bush also on top of my list).  The dish was very good, deserving of 4 stars.  The steakburger wasn&#39;t too great, however.  Both my friend and I thought it was dry.  Good thing we added cheese for $1 but it just wasn&#39;t that great, not very flavorful, deserving of 2.5 stars.  IMHO, Finleys on Pearl deserves the &#34; best burger&#34; in Denver award.

Service is always friendly and fast, 4 stars.

These guys used to own CityGrille. The menus and food are similar, but the prices here are lower. It&#39;s well worth the drive; our hopes were amply rewarded. The salad was great, the prime rib was delectable and massive for a 12-ounce serving, the grilled broccoli/red pepper strips/red onion was a lovely accompaniment, and i think my baked potato weighed more than a pound! It was seriously massive and very tasty. My son brought home a box of meat, and I brought home lots of everything. The beer of the day was 1554, which I really enjoyed.

Then to dent one&#39;s confidence in the food, a delivery guy shows up with a food delivery for the staff from some other restaurant. That was friggin&#39; hilarious and kind of frightening. If the employees won&#39;t eat the food, why should I?

Food arrives, hamburger bun is stale on one side, plate is cold, so burger and fries weren&#39;t hot.

I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not alcoholic, this place seems like the kind of spot where those whose lives are dedicated to lots of cheap booze go to feel pretty.

Oh yeah, warning about the bathrooms: they&#39;re a horror show and might have been sanitary before the turn-of-the-century, but overflowing trash cans and filth at 2:00 in the afternoon aren&#39;t good signs. One can only imagine how the kitchen looks."

They seemed to enjoy them.  I had a beer, played some tabletop shuffle board, and then left.  It was the middle of a Saturday afternoon, and the place was only moderately busy.  Despite not that being the busy, it took me a while to get my beer.  My beer was put in a glass that had come straight out of a rack from the dishwasher.  As expected, cold beer, plus hot glass, equals a barely cool beer.  I did not have the energy to make a big deal about this.  But, seriously, it is pretty crappy bartending to not make the minimum effort to serve a cold beer.

As a kicker, the men&#39;s room was rather gross.  It smelled bad, did not appear recently cleaned, and the fixtures need replacing (large chunks of porcelain are missing)."

May be the best roll in Denver add a real good burger and you leave happy.  Service was a bit slow but polite.  The restaurant was clean.  Leave the kids home as it is noisy and more of a adult bar.

As other reviewers have mentioned it is closer to a local watering hole than a restaurant. There are tv&#39;s in every corner with sports playing. Our waitress was Melissa. 

We went on a Tuesday evening and there was quite a crowd. Atmosphere with the crowd, music playing and tv&#39;s made the place really noisy and an intimate conversation was near impossible. Too bad. 

I ordered the Steakburger medium done with swiss and my girlfriend ordered the Reuben. 

The Steakburger brought out was medium-rare and dry. I can eat it medium-rare but I ordered it medium. Melissa, our waitress, was not too attentive so I just ate it because I was hungry. Putting the medium-rare thing aside I think my burger was sitting under a heat lamp for a half hour. The exact same way the quarter-pounder from McDonald&#39;s tastes after 
you arrive past the lunch rush. You know the burger I&#39;m talking about. Barely edible, right. 

The Reuben was very salty and not great. The sides of slaw for her and fries for me were pretty good so we focused on that as the main meal. 

To top it off, my girlfriend couldn&#39;t finish half of the sandwich and asked Melissa for a box when she brought the check. And we waited and waited but no Melissa. She had forgotten us! 

This was my first time there and most likely :the only time."

I come here irregularly but I like it.

It has a true neighborhood sports bar feel to it, and there&#39;s usually some kind of special for a a home team&#39;s game.  There&#39;s a small patio out back which I feel could be better , it&#39;s not terribly clean, a little cramped, and also doubles as the smoking section which isn&#39;t too cool, just because you can&#39;t escape it when you eat.  The burger is the only thing I&#39;ve ever had, because that&#39;s what I go there for, and the fries are tasty as well, as most other reviewers have mentioned.

There are two major differences between this place and City Grille. The first is the fact that instead of Cesar dressing on the signature burger, they use what I think is 1,000 Island?  It&#39;s not very flavorful, but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  The second is the service.  It&#39;s so much better here than at the Capital Hill spot, which consistently pisses me off.  Makes me happy that they do it right here.

Besides that, the menu and recipes seem to be the same.  It&#39;s a good spot, and I need to come here more often."

We also ordered the bacon mac n cheese tater tots. The cheese and bacon came separately and it was ok. The veggie burger said it would come with fries and a salad according to the online ordering system. I only got a salad (which ended up being ok because of the tater tots), but  I was a little disappointed at first.

I just driven from Richmond, VA to Aurora, CO helping my brother move, and this pub was just around the corner and open late.  After a long 3 days of being in a truck and unloading said truck, I needed cold beers and burgers.  Hidden behind a gas station, this place can be hard to find, but you must find it.  Walking in, it was a typical bar, all wooden interior, posters for music events in Denver, bar games, etc.  The waitress was gorgeous and also knew her beers.  Opening the menu, I went straight to the burgers section and saw the CityPub burger, which pretty much changes my view on burgers from that point onwards.  I&#39;ve had burgers before, but wasn&#39;t ready for this.  Also, this was back in 2011, and I&#39;m writing this now, in 2015, so it was memorable.  The thick steakcut meat was placed between ciabatta bread (the most crucial component of the burger here) and each bun was slathered with a homemade 1000 island dressing, and of course topped with the usual, lettuce, tomato and onion.  The bread though, was able to hold this burger for the whole meal.  It didn&#39;t fall apart, soak up the sauce and get soggy or just flake like usual buns do.  It was th e real deal and only the ciabatta could handle this burger patty. Biting through the warm bread into the juicy meat was an unforgettable moment, since the burger paired perfectly with the typically used as a salad dressing sauce.  The gooey cheese (yes, I forgot the cheese) stretched from my mouth the burger has a tried to put the burger back down, but then decided I just couldn&#39;t let go of it.  I ate the whole thing without sitting it back in the nest (basket) it was delivered to me in.  Paired this burger with the Raging Bitch IPA and had this memorable night I still think about 4 years later.  If you are in CO, near Denver or even Boulder, definitely make the drive down here, you wont forget it and probably will be talking about it for the next 4 years, at least."

It was slightly overcooked for medium (was more like medium-well), but was still very flavorful. The sauce on the City Pub Burger was kind of like a chipotle mayo - nice little addition. The bun was a fantastic ciabatta bread that was nice and soft on the inside. Honestly, that took a solid burger and made it very tasty. The fries were also very good - nothing special, but just right.

The beer selection was a little weak, although they have a stellar selection of Flying Dog beer, including one on special each day for $3.25! The service was fantastic. The bartender certainly knew how to work a bar. I must have been the only newbie there, because she pretty much knew everyone&#39;s name. She even the birthday of the guy next to me.

Although not the best in Denver, they do a tasty burger. I&#39;d say 3.5 stars on the burger, but gets bumped up to 4 for the service and dive-y atmosphere.

It&#39;s much smaller than I thought, pricier than I thought, and not as fun as I thought.  Granted I went in on a Sunday early in the afternoon to watch NASCAR so almost no one was there, but it was just sort of &#34;meh.&#34;  It has the feel that it could be an awesome dive bar, but I&#39;ll have to go back again on like a Thursday night or something to try that out (and I&#39;m planning on it!)

The staff was very helpful with making sure we could get the race on the big screen.  A very important nugget: they have Sounddog Speakers, the little speakers you take to your table to make sure you can have the audio to the particular tv you want. So if you&#39;re far away from the Patriots game on tv, but the bar sound is on the Donkeys, you can bring your little speaker with you to your table and still not miss the game you want to hear.

The server seemed almost a little surly, but stopped short of being downright rude. She was reasonably fast, but didn&#39;t feel inclined to answer any questions or...well, smile.  

Other than that, it was spectacularly average. I do plan on going back for trivia or something like that, so I&#39;ll be sure to update my review then!

But for now, a regular three stars for good food, okay service, and an interesting feel in an empty pub."

Get the 411 at their website http://www.citygrille.com/citypub/    

The City Grille Burger at $9.95 is a delicious creation with a half pound of good quality beef, Swiss cheese, bacon,and a zesty sauce all piled up on a fresh ciabatta bun.  I must confess, I still added mustard &amp; ketchup at the table, but really enjoyed it.  The burger came with thin French fries that were hot, crispy, and salty just the way I like them.

City Pub is a dive-y neighborhood bar with an olde world flare.  The service is not really very good.  One guy, with a dry personality, covering the entire restaurant on a busy Saturday at Noon.  He was not goofing off but we got our drinks and food than we were kinda on our own.

I&#39;ll put it this way, we live over 10 miles away and although I&#39;m a fan of the food the scene and service are not special enough to make it worth a trip out of my way.  One final comment, comparing City Pub to the $4.50 burgers at Freddy&#39;s, 5 guys, or Steak &amp; Shake is like comparing apples &amp; oranges."

I learned that my memory failed me....this 1/2 lb burger was certainly not thin, as I said in my earlier review. It was probably about 3/4 inch thick and piled high with toppings, I could barely get my mouth around it.

Food review:  City Pub is another place that I consider a part of my Denver burger elite.  I don&#39;t live so close anymore but it was still a worthwhile trip here again today.  The one thing I really like about the burger here is the patty.  I think it&#39;s about the tastiest burger patty in town.  Unfortunately, today it wasn&#39;t as tasty as I remember it but it was very good regardless. Actually ordered a side of salad with the burger and wasn&#39;t expecting it to be much but I ended up being surprised with the quality of what I was served.  Overall, it was very enjoyable experience.  It&#39;s just not as high up on my top 5 anymore.  :-s 

Service?  No complaints.  I mean.. it&#39;s typically always slow no matter how small the crowd but I&#39;m always ok with that if they make it right and they most always do.

Other thoughts:  This place brings back memories.  I used to live a few blocks from here and this was always a good standby.  I&#39;m a little sad they got rid of most all their Flying Dog tap selection.  They used to have 3-4 on tap and now they&#39;re down to one. Oh.. I do still like this place better than it&#39;s sister bar that gets all the credit... CityGrille... I think part of that is just location"

Only downside was the service as it was a little slow.

Totally do NOT agree.  Take me to 5 Guys any day instead.  There was nothing wrong with the burger itself, but it was totally not worth a special trip.

The atmosphere was rowdy.  Not a big deal in a bar.  But don&#39;t bill yourself as kid/family friendly on your own website if you&#39;re not.  Having crayons and a kids menu in and of itself doesn&#39;t make you kid friendly.

I realize this was probably an isolated incident, but the table behind us got into it with the table behind them, loads of yelling and cursing, to the point the manager had to step in twice to break up the almost fight.  Not expecting that at 7pm on a Weds night, not much fun for my kids- or me.

Our service was nearly non-existent.    The same manager who was breaking up the fight ended up having to take our orders after reassuring us several times that a waiter would get to us &#34;soon&#34;.  He eventually made it in time to deliver the food, which also took way longer than seemed necessary for 2 burgers, chicken tenders, and mac n cheese.  The food was fine, but nothing special.

When we finally were able to pay the bill, we did get an apology for the lousy service...but it was too little too late.  Between bad service, too long a wait for food, and the near brawl next to us, we won&#39;t be giving them another chance.

It seemed like a perfectly fine place, maybe they were just having one off night?  Hence 2 stars instead of the one my gut wants to give them."

It&#39;s the coldest day of the year, so far. I had just finished a workout &amp; food shopping, and realized the Broncos are playing, and I was famished. Headed over to Citypub for a burger to tide me through afternoon into the evening.

Citypub is a step above hallowed dive-bar status, in a good way. It&#39;s a no nonsense bar with top-notch food. I used to visit this place for lunch when it was the Toby Jug, grooving on the burritos. The space has two sections; a bar with two pool tables, a shuffleboard game, and a couple of dart boards. The second section is seating for dining. Lot&#39;s of television screens for all the NFL games complete the package.

The place is known for its burgers, and it did not disappoint. My cheddar steakburger (1/2 pound!) was cooked medium, with just the right char, juicy not dry. The burger arrives on a ciabatta bun, accompanied by pickles, tomato, lettuce &amp; red onion. My side was fries, crispy with the right amount of salt. A Coors light draft completed the scene.

Didn&#39;t think I could finish off the burger, but somehow I did. No dinner or dessert tonight! Too bad the Broncos didn&#39;t live up to my meal! Oh yeah, in the market for a $10 burger, Citypub sets the standard."

Many people suggested City Pub as a sure solution to my craving... and they were RIGHT! I called my order in ahead of time was told it would be about 15 minutes. The woman on the phone was courteous and thorough with my order and took the time to note my modification requests. My food order was executed perfectly ( including the medium rare temp that I had requested :-)  ) The burger was AWESOME! Not anything out of the ordinary but still everything that you could ask for in a burger . This place was such a pleasant surprise and I will for sure be reccomending it to my friends.  After writing about it I may just have to go back for a burger tonight! 
P.S. The fries were great and so was the price!"

Awesome burgers (love the turkey burger with sage mayo) and wings (blueberry habanero sauce is the best)! Love the $1 taco night in the bar. Decent beer selection (they&#39;ve got Dale&#39;s on tap, what else do you need?) and fun bar games like trivia, bingo, pool tables, etc. If you want excellent bar food for a great price and a low-key bar atmosphere, go to City Pub!!"

try every sushi restaurant within the 5 mile radius that my hotel shuttle would drive me to (yeah, I love sushi). 

I tried four places total and Okinawa was the best by far. I ate here THREE TIMES in a span of less than two weeks.

I only ordered nigiri, sashimi, or chirashi. The fish is fresh and you can taste the difference in quality compared to some of the other places. The complimentary appetizers during dinner were also really good, and I&#39;m not talking about edamame or miso soup. They give you really good, seasoned sashimi. 

To be honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting much out of sushi in Colorado (or Lone Tree to be exact), BUT Okinawa totally set the bar high and even beats some places back home in the Bay Area."

i peruse the sushi menu and pick 6 items for nigiri - they were out of there - otoro, maguro, and uni. awesome.  waitress was not very apologetic about it.  i picked a few other items and a roll (which is uncharacteristic of me but the chef was making one and it looked aweosme). i recommend the titanic roll.  food came out reasonably fast, and it was pretty good.  but the service is a little disappointing and the nigiri selections are underwhelming.  again, chefs are nice, but how they handled the food and ingredients was a little concerning.  threw around sushi pieces, etc., and just didnt seem to respect it that much. 

i will make the trek downtown to sushi den next time for sure."

My whole family loves sushi... I would even go so far as to say that we are sushi snobs. This place used to be a Thai restaurant, and we loved it. We were in the area decided to stop by and saw that it was sushi.

In all sincerity it was some of the best sushi I&#39;ve had around Denver. I know that someone will be disappointed in this place because that just happens. Even the best places make a mistake once in a while or have something they don&#39;t like.  

However the nigiri was right, the quality of the fish was on point, And the creativity of the rolls along with the size of the rolls... Was just really good.  They have really done well with decor, it was clean and the staff was attentive.  

I can&#39;t remember the names of the rolls that we had, but I&#39;ll put a picture on here. They were done with creativity and Percision and were absolutely delicious. 

We love some of the high-end sushi restaurants around Denver, but I can tell you if we are in the area around Lone Tree we will be back for lunch or dinner.

AS I LEFT I THOUGHT: What a great find."

They were doing a photo shoot while I was there for the new menu. The photographer ate the food after taking pics of it - needless to say, I was super jealous.

Salmon was super fresh. I changed some of the rolls up and they gladly accommodated. 

Staff is friendly and attentive.

Decor is super modern and elegant. Even the bathroom is pretty. 

Highly recommend the roll with mango inside, fresh salmon on top and mango drizzle.

I just flew into Denver that day and was looking for some fresh sushi nearby my hotel for dinner. Pulled up to a shopping strip and walked into what might as well could&#39;ve been a sandwich shop. I sat at the bar and started ordering all kinds of nigiri and they didn&#39;t have uni!!! I was pretty pissed off. 

Spent $80 on myself and no uni. The fishes were not very fresh and the cuts should be thicker. The only compliment I can give this place is that the service was good."

End cap space means windows all over and seems like a patio.  Lunch specials are great deals which include sushi and sashimi plus soup or salad.  Enough food to make feel like you just ate lunch (sushi specials ever does that).

All of the sushi and sashimi was very good and tasted very fresh.  I&#39;m a mackerel lover, and this was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. However the super white tuna is unbelievable.  Consistency, taste, and color all great.

I moved here from an ocean town so I really miss great sushi.  Not only was the sushi great, but the presentation of the to go order was on par with any sushi bar visit I have had.  In addition, the service was outstanding.  So friendly for a pick up.  
When I arrived back home, my husband agreed with the presentation score, but then shocked me by stating this was the best sushi he has ever had.  He rarely joined me at sushi back home and now he falls in love.... In Colorado?!? 
I am not ready to say it&#39;s the best ever, but it is by far the best I&#39;ve had here.  This is a new regular stop and I can&#39;t wait to try more rolls soon.

The downside was the service. It&#39;s lazy at best. For $150 dinner I expect a basic level of professionalism. For example, all three water glasses were set on one side of the table. Even though there weren&#39;t many tables our server couldn&#39;t be bothered to take 2 extra steps and place them in front of us. Same with the Miso soup. Set is lazily on one end of the table and let there customer sort out. Our kids split an entre, yet we had to flag them down to get an extra plate to split it. 

Those small details could have gotten by but the end was the worst. We needed 2 to go boxes but only got 1 and a check. While waiting for 2nd box and to pay them, our  server went outside and sa try at a table to chat with a friend and never came back. When I went to pay the bill and get another box, some of the staff was apologetic and some smiled as if they knew our server wasn&#39;t good but she still keeps her job there."

I noticed Okinawa due to its great location on Lincoln near Yosemite in the Safeway Plaza. As we entered we realized this place was not your run of the mill, fly by night sushi stop. (Thank goodness- I&#39;m picky) First, whoever designed it, selected very nice finishes for the space and thought out the space planning well. It&#39;s small, but there is plenty of seating. 

Sushi Bar: for such a small restaurant this place has a gorgeous sushi bar! The sushi chefs also thank you and bow when you get up to leave. It&#39;s lovely.

The wait staff is courteous and timely. Menu: This place has something for everyone. I&#39;m a true sushi die hard, and they aim to please! My daughter is vegetarian, and they have a great selection of vegetarian rolls. For the non sushi lover, they have a great menu of teriyaki and other cooked items.

The fish: fresh... The rolls are not too small either. I expected them to be small, since they prices are very competitive! But they make nice large rolls. And they don&#39;t skimp on their fish pieces. The sauces add flavor, yet they do not try to hide poor fish quality with gopping of sauce like some restaurants do. 

Overall: I am very impressed and can&#39;t wait to go back next week!"

Mochi ice cream was ok. The strawberry was perfect, but the green tea mochi was dried out. For five dollars for an out-of-the-box dessert they should have been more careful. And I probably should have returned it, but you don&#39;t get five stars if you put that on the customer."

Plate design was an added bonus. There was an error with one of our rolls, but they quickly remade it without much fuss. Overall a good meal. Glad we gave this little strip mall joint a try."

Fishy Sushi I thought.  Waiter poured water in my wife&#39;s 7 up to refill it.  We asked for a to go box with tons of sushi left and he brought this tiny box.  So the service was annoying because the servers barely spoke English and the sushi was not great for the price.  After tip we paid $80 no alcohol.

We have been coming here since the place opened and I thought I had written a review. I must not have posted it. At the time I wrote the phantom review, I thought Okinawa was the best sushi I ever had. Very, very fresh and the presentation was the best ever. The staff was attentive and friendly. The prices were average, which makes it quite a bargain considering the quality. We would go to Okinawa once a week. The place got busier and busier so we had to start going in the middle of the afternoon or late at night. We got to know everyone there including the owner. I asked her why some places are so fresh and others are not. She explained that most sushi bars in Denver buy their fish from brokers (my word - I don&#39;t remember what they were called). Osaka buys their fish right off the plane at about 4 am. She said that they and Sushi Den are the only ones that consistently buy right off the plane. She explained that if you buy from a broker, you have no idea how fresh the fish is (sometimes, not very). That explains why their sushi was so awesome. Sooo, fast forward to around late May of this year. We actually go sushi at Okinawa that was only OK. What just happened? Surely it was a fluke. We went back a week later and it was only OK again - not as fresh and no presentation skills. We were sooo disappointed. We went a few weeks later and it was much better. we have found that it is kind of hit and miss. At the worst, it is only OK. At their best, they are still not up to their own previous standards."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, this place is not horrible, but in no way could anyone who knows anything about sushi rate this with 5 stars. The Jalepiño Yellowtail was excellent. The sushi rice was not good. The Gyoza were above average. The quality of the fish was average at best.

My last two recent visits (early October) I was served sushi that was anything but fresh. I dismissed the first time I got some sushi that was a little off as a fluke. Second try at giving them a chance to redeem themselves I could &#34;smell&#34; my sushi choices as they set my entree on the table. There should never be a fish smell coming from sushi. I took one bite and knew for sure it was not fresh. I did not touch the rest of the order and asked the waitress for my check. A manager came over to inquire why I did not like the meal and I told her that this was the second time I had been served unpleasant tasting and smelly sushi. She asked me if I wanted to try anything else and I declined. I paid the bill in full and left. I have not been back since. This is typical of places starting out strong and then they start to cut corners on ingredients and freshness. So sad because it was convenient and fresh tasting in the beginning.

If I had written this review after those first two times, it would have been five stars. But the third time definitely wasn&#39;t the charm. The problem wasn&#39;t the food, which was excellent as usual. The problem was the indifferent service even though the restaurant wasn&#39;t full (as it was the first two times we visited). 

The hostess never gave us menus, so we were waiting for about 10 minutes with no menus and no checkins from any of the staff. We had to flag someone and request menus. The food was pretty slow coming out. First my husband got his salad, then after a long wait our potstickers, and finally our entrees (I had the unagi bento, he had the sushi lunch). My water was never refilled during the entire hour I was there, and no one ever asked us if we liked the food or needed anything else. Just dumped the check on our table. 

Okinawa, I thought you were the answer to my sushi prayers, but it looks like I will have to continue bumming meals off my richer friends at Sushi Den. Sayonara."

I did a to go order as I was in a hurry for lunch. I got the sweet potato roll and crazy tuna roll. I will have to say I&#39;ve tried sweet potato at many places and most are hard and subpar. Omg this place has done it right! The sweet potato was soft so it was kind of like a sushi melt in your mouth texture. The tuna roll was also maxing and also a melt in your mouth kind of roll. Rolls are best where it&#39;s not too chewy (and I&#39;ve experienced that with many places around Denver sadly). I hope they start a happy hour soon and don&#39;t lose their touch of goodness after a while like most places.

When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised. The place is clean, chic, well decorated, and intimate. It looks like a great date place or dinner place for friends. 

The service here was great! We loved our waiter, how personable he was, his willingness to give recommendations, especially as a vegetarian with not many options on the menu, and their openness to feedback. They have a seasonal menu, so the menu we were given was released 2 days prior. After our meal, he asked for our opinions and for any areas of improvement, which we thought was great! We gave him our honest opinion and he said that he would relay the message to the chef. 

We ordered the sweet potato, egg&#39;s nest, the tagliatelle pasta entree, and the chocolate cake dessert. The presentation was great on all of the dishes brought out - they definitely get 5 stars for that! I&#39;m not the biggest fan of potatoes, so I may be a bit biased here. The sweet potato dish I would give 3 stars - the dish itself was a unique blend of flavors which I appreciated. The main piece of potato was a little under cooked, however still edible. I enjoyed the dish, but not order it again. The egg&#39;s nest was also interesting - the main thing is that it lacked a bit of flavor/seasoning. A bit more salt may be upped the taste of this dish. 

The pasta was my favorite - there is nothing I would change about this and wish we had actually ordered two. I could definitely go for a second plate and would have if I wasn&#39;t so tired and ready to go to bed. The chocolate mouse cake with the graham cracker crust and pomegranate jelly on top - I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan, however I didn&#39;t dislike it. The chocolate was salted chocolate which was delicious, however a bit heavy that I couldn&#39;t handle more than a few bites. The homemade pistachio gelato on the side was the best part of this dessert. I could have eaten another scoop of that on my own! 

I enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely revisit. The ambiance, the great customer service, and the ever-changing menu make this place a must visit!"

This place should be getting crazy word-of-mouth, but I hadn&#39;t even heard of it until yesterday, when I was trying to find somewhere to eat near the Curious in the restaurant semi-wasteland that is the Golden Triangle. I&#39;m not the hippest guy in town, but only 13 Yelp reviews seemed to reinforce the point. GO, and then tell your friends about it. If there is any comparison in Denver, it would probably to the &#34;old&#34; Squeaky Bean up when it was up in Highlands. 

From prior reviews it sounded more like a a cocktail bar with tasty snacks, but this is a real restaurant with really great food. I&#39;ll start with the cocktails anyway. Two of the three we had were on the more adventurous side of what many (fantastic) other cocktail bars are serving right now. This comes with a downside, which is that you might straight-up hate what you get, so ask questions. 

I had something that sounded like a play on a gin fizz, but would up being remotely unlike what I&#39;ve had before. I was too confused to enjoy the first few sips, but I happily would have ordered a second by the time I finished. My wife got some mezcal drink. On account of activated charcoal, it looked unlike any cocktail I&#39;ve seen before. Very drinkable.

The food was the real surprise; it was inventive while still being something you actually want to eat, not an easy balance. My wife had the beet salad. She&#39;s a vegetarian and thought it amazing. As for me, this is a &#34;love it or hate it&#34; dish; White Lies isn&#39;t playing it safe. The Elote was creamy and delicious. Anyone would love it. 

On the entrees, my wife had the Risotto. The cherries and mushrooms were like a vegetarian play on what you might do with duck. Loaded with vegetables, it got raves.

Chicken was also a great. I&#39;m not sure what inspired the chef to mix warm jaicima and cherries with a classic southern chicken-and-cornbread dish, but it worked.

Service was very friendly if a tiny bit lackadaisical. I wouldn&#39;t come here if you&#39;re in a hurry, but just fine compared to the Denver baseline. 

I&#39;d skip dessert; get another cocktail or a (fantastic) cappuccino instead. As novel as mezcal balls are, inventive desserts tend to fall flat, which these did."

I met a group of friends there, after they waited 45 min for the food... I just wanted a cocktail, but I think it was forgotten and took a little longer than what a cocktail should take.

I really wanted to like this place, and maybe next time I&#39;ll sit at the bar to watch the drink making and for faster service.  My friends enjoyed their food, but maybe getting some nibbles first elsewhere."

I saw White Lies in a random search for some place new to eat. It&#39;s gotta be right next to Black Eye Coffee I said. Well it actually is Black Eye Coffee---after hours. This is a visually interesting place anyhow, but it really looks good in the evening. This particular &#34;warm&#34; fall evening the windows were all open on the 8th avenue side. It was just a perfect night. The earnestness each staff member had for White Lies was impressive. The host explained the back story and mentioned a few things to be sure to try. The waiter educated my wife on the extensive Rose wine list. She sampled and found a the perfect choice. I stuck with the Amongst Thieves cocktail. It was &#34;stout&#34; indeed, just as I prefer. We tried a variety of smaller plates such as Short Rib, and Bird&#39;s Nest. Both delicious and creatively presented. We then had the Steelhead salmon, and Tagliatelle large plates. Again, excellent. We shared an order of &#34;Pumpkin&#34; for dessert. Savory and very unusual---a real twist on dessert. The waiter made sure we were good with savory dessert before suggesting it. I can&#39;t say enough about the server. There&#39;s a &#34;Trust Us&#34; section on the menu, which suggests putting the ordering in the hands of the server. I would definitely do that next time. They can pull it off. The only thing we didn&#39;t try is some pours from the sherry cart. There are a lot of different varieties of sherry. That I know. But this is an entire cart and with your own guide to finding one that&#39;s right for you. It&#39;s on our list for the next visit. Bottom line, this place is really cool. They&#39;re all about expanding your horizons and love to educate. That in a setting that&#39;s comfortable and relaxing---it&#39;s a winner. Only downside: parking. It&#39;s limited in this area so you might have to park on the street a few blocks away."

It is a sports bar attached to a golf course.  You are probably thinking golf course food is gross, and you are right, but Noonan&#39;s is not golf course food!   Their menu is huge with so many options spanning different types of food.  They have great happy hour and specials throughout the week. The staff is hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a great server and other times you get a server who loses your card and makes you charge another one. Smh.

The food is where it is at. I haven&#39;t had a single bad thing here from tacos to crab cheese wontons and they even have breakfast! Again, huge menu! Excellent food.  They also show UFC fights there at no cost and have drink specials. You are welcome!"

Generally golf course restaurants have had some impressive selections on the menu, but Noonan&#39;s was slightly different. 

When I set my eyes on the menu, all I could ponder is &#39;why is the menu so simple?&#39; I&#39;m not sure if I was just being picky or not, but I was looking for something that shouted &#34;PICK ME! PICK ME!&#34; But I had a hard time. So I decided to pull my usual stunt and ask the server what her favorite dish was. She proceeded to inform me about the green chili and that it was crafted in house each morning. I decided to order the loaded fries so I could feast on a plate full of spuds and green chili and I ordered HOT! Well... 

The green chili wasn&#39;t all that. It had a healthy amount of pork which was to my liking, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as scorching as I wanted it to be. Because they had mild and medium options, I was hoping something that would leave some serious char in my mouth. I got what would be considered medium at most places. It also tasted as though it had been sitting for a while. 

I peered over at other plates and couldn&#39;t find one dish that I was curious about. I also had a friend&#39;s fish taco, which was good, but I&#39;ve had better. All-in-all, this place is an excellent choice if you just wanna pound a few drinks after work and play some billiards, but I&#39;m not sure the food is worth it."

There is some event happening almost every night of the week, with poker nights, beer pong, ladies night, karaoke and a trivia night as well. The beer pong night is easily the busiest, but I&#39;ve noticed that they have more staff that night, so service doesn&#39;t suffer one bit, though it does get crowded. 

There are lunch specials, and I believe they are still doing the lunch-punch, where you can earn free meals by eating lunch there. A really good deal if you are doing a front or back nine, or you just happen to live nearby. 

The food is quality, especially considering that this is a bar, and I would recommend that tater tot bowls, the fish tacos and any of the burgers. Some of the food is of course made from frozen prepackaged, like the cheese sticks, but a surprising amount of the food is made fresh, surprising for any bar. 

The staff is friendly, and after even just a few visits will remember you. This is a really friendly place, and fun to eat and drink at. I&#39;ve gone here for holidays, football games, just for lunch, and even to just hang out on the patio drinking and reading when they have a mid-week slowdown.

When I walked in to this dark place I didn&#39;t have high hopes. The menu seemed pretty standard and I decided to go with my old late night stand by: chicken fingers. 

The menu claimed the finger were breaded to order and I scoffed. 

But sure as shit they were:

For 8.95 you get three small chicken breast that are freshly breaded and lightly fried with a dipping sauce and fries. Though it is listed in the appetizer section it is clearly a meal. And a damn good one at that. The chicken was seriously delicious and filling. You are better of eating like a chicken breast with a knife and fork otherwise the breading may just fall off because the chicken is so juicy and the breading is so light.

Had to flag her down to get anything. Gave us a plate of green chili tots we had to toothpicks because we got no silverware. And got tired of waiting for her to show up.. Waited 45 mins for refills (which are a $1 each after paying $2 for a drink ) I don&#39;t know how you can mess up tortilla chips. But half the order was uncooked soft/greasy chips.. They offered to replace them but after an hour they never showed up. I guess they just aren&#39;t staffed for really busy nights. The food is decent buy very inconsistent.. One order of chicken strips can be good and juicy and the next order is thin dry and chewy. The atmosphere is very good its roomy and open tons of TVs for events but the sound comes from one speaker in the back of the room so you can&#39;t hear commentary..

Came here last night to watch the UFC fight and learned that you definitely have to show up a couple of hours beforehand to get a seat. Especially if there are tons of holiday and birthday parties going on.

We sat at the bar and found it to provide a great environment. There are plenty of tv&#39;s around and bartenders are very attentive. We got a free shot shortly after sitting down and our drinks were never close to being empty. They&#39;re great with drink recommendations and evening drink specials offer a wide variety of options. If you&#39;re stumped on what to order and like grapefruit juice, try the El Jimador margaritas in a can. $3 on Fridays and delicious!

I haven&#39;t had the food here but with the plates whipping past us, it looks like everything is quite popular. Our friend had a beef burrito and it is absolutely huge. The cheese dip looked a little wonky and more like sauce you would serve over broccoli. But, prices are right and it would be a great place to enjoy your evening."

You might think that being a country-club bar it would be snooty, but it isn&#39;t.

They have great drink specials for happy hour, and if there&#39;s a UFC fight on they&#39;ll have specials for that, too. And that&#39;s really what you should visit Noonan&#39;s for: some type of televised sporting event. They&#39;ve got big screens up all around the place, and the vibe is very laid back.

I didn&#39;t try the food, but the menu was pretty full, and I noticed a lot of other people grubbing out. Nothing special, bar food, but my friends liked the wings a lot."

It starts at 9pm on Saturdays, unless there&#39;s a game or fight going on, then it gets delayed a few minutes.  There&#39;s ample parking and clean bathroom stalls.  There&#39;s also a nice smoking patio.  It may be a little small, but it&#39;s one of the cleanest bars I&#39;ve ever been to.

I&#39;ve had the beef sliders and fries here and they were really good.   The burgers are a generously sized for sliders and the fries were fresh and crisp.   I&#39;ve also sampled their soft pretzel and found it to be yummy.   This is one of the few places that has a kitchen that stays open until closing time.

For drinks, they usually have some specials.  If you like iced tea and want one with a kick, try the Danny Noonan cocktail.  This sucker is dangerous!  You can barely tell there&#39;s alcohol in it and it&#39;s only $3.50 each.  I suggest you avoid getting the Jager Bomb cocktails.  They charge you separately for the alcohol and the redbull (which I dislike when bars do this) making this drink way too pricey at approximately $14.00 per cocktail.   

I like the atmosphere here.  It&#39;s not ghetto or divey, but it&#39;s not pretentious either.  It&#39;s very laid back."

Noonan&#39;s offers mostly Colorado made beers as part of its philosophy on supporting Colorado brewers, they Colorado Native for cheap which is a nice surprise.  They also feature Colorado made liquors (Stranahans, Breck Whiskey/Vodka, etc.).  I haven&#39;t ordered a cocktail here yet so I don&#39;t know if they pour generously.  

The thing that makes this place great is the food though.  The menu has a wide range of types of food and everything I&#39;ve had so far has been great for bar food.  Their burgers seem to be highly regarded, but I haven&#39;t tried one yet.

The inside of the bar has a ton of TVs so finding your game to watch is easy.  They do poker, beer pong, trivia, and bingo on various nights of the week which is pretty cool.

I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for happy hours and to watch some games.  There isn&#39;t a TON of seating so if you are coming during an event I&#39;d be sure to show up early."

The service was prompt and well done except for a couple of dings: 1) my water was never once refilled, so I had to steal my buddy&#39;s; 2) the bus dude was either too eager or was trying to get us to leave - he kept coming back to take our empty plates, but in the process, he took away my wings which I was still working on... not cool.  I was too fixated on the tv to notice and when I turned around, they were gone.  
The food in general was a-ok.  The buffalo wings were decent, but not as hot as I expected.  Some friends tried golden-something sauce and that was rot-yo-teeth sweet.  If you ask for extra sauce, they charge you extra... it was only 50 cents, but I didn&#39;t appreciate that the waitress didn&#39;t bother to tell us that and let us find out upon inspecting the bill.  We also tried one of their &#34;bowls&#34; that they make with tator-tots as the base.  Ours came with some ground beef, cheese, green chili &amp; sour cream.  It was not bad, but the tator-tots were luke-warm and soft... not crispy and hot as expected, so another star gone.  

It is somewhat unfortunate that this place has so many good things going on that they can easily get a 4 star but ultimately, too many small mishaps add up and not make it so."

Noonan&#39;s offers your typical bar food and drinks, but with a little extra quality, and at a decent price. The &#34;boomers&#34; are awesome (get those if you want some of the best battered mushrooms around). For those who like thick-cut bacon: Noonan&#39;s has it on their burgers. And the buffalo eggrolls are a nice change to get the buffalo flavor in a different delivery system.

For the main course, the burgers are also pretty good - the Black &amp; Bleu was a nice surprise with taste and quality! And the wings... oh, the wings... grilled or fried, sauced or dry-rubbed, these aren&#39;t the skimpy &#34;small&#34; wings like you&#39;ll find at many other places.

Bottom line: Order the wings and boomers to start - you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

My friend arrived before we did, told her we&#39;d be in a little hurry (45min) because I had a plane to catch. Fast forward a few minutes when she and I arrive......the waitress is NOWHERE to be found. It took far too long to find her and get her attention. When she did appear she assured us that &#34;their kitchen was faster than Jimmy Johns&#34; so despite us now having barely 30min to eat, it would be A-OK. 

I ordered the mile high huevos rancheros with homemade chorizo and scrambled eggs. Friends got the chili mac and the two egg breakfast. Despite her &#34;freaky fast&#34; claim the food took nearly 15minutes. Slow/inattentive service was an issue for this entire visit.

The food was just good. My friends were happy with it......I thought it was ok. I&#39;ve never had homemade chorizo served to me in patty form. The cheese sauce with the chilli mac sort of screamed Velveeta to me as well.

They had a nice bloody mary bar set up. Too bad I&#39;m not a fan of bloodys. I chose to get a $2.50 mimosa, which was ok but I only needed one.

They have a million TVs- most of which were tuned to different games (Bears on one...Broncos on another) but the sound they were pumping through the place was from the Steelers game (odd). 

It was cold in there and pretty loud (a little too loud for conversation).

The main draw of this bar is during the week is a poker league and bar trivia. My friends and I have been playing both and watching sports at the bar since it opened in March of 2011. Sometimes we were at Noonan&#39;s 4 to 5 nights a week, a conservative estimate would be that we spent a few hundred dollars a week here. Basically we thought of Noonan&#39;s as our neighborhood bar. 

In the past two months there have been multiple problems with the management not honoring prizes for poker and trivia or changing the policies without notifying players. I understand that policies change but when we asked the manager to honor the previous weeks prizes since they didn&#39;t notify us the change until after we had raked up our regular three digit tab he was less than helpful. He basically responded by telling us that the new policies were not new and it had always been this way. When we asked him how he could say this when we had been been patrons for the entire life of the establishment he got combative and insulting. 

We won&#39;t be going back to Noonan&#39;s and would suggest that if you are looking for a neighborhood bar you go somewhere else."

I love this place! 9 times outta 10 we always have a great time here!

You almost ALWAYS will get a few free house shot and there has been several occasions where and owner, or regular has covered my parties tab! 

Noonan&#39;s has really stepped up their menu! Now the usual pub fare has gone kick ass! Green Chili is spicier, the chicken tenders are mouth watering and damn those wings are massive (and that&#39;s a good thing!) 

Don&#39;t get me wrong this place get crowded, it just sometimes looks like bingo bus dropped its cargo off at the wrong location. The servers make up the majority of the youth and they are great! 

Most nights they play host to a decent special and fun bar activity as well! Though they seem to be rotating out some of their specials as some are not even available (ex: Crispin deals, etc)  

So if your looking for a chill and cheap night of drinking with your close group of friends in A-Town, Noonan&#39;s is the place to be....

Otherwise if your looking to party I would try a few other places first and keep it as a backup until the A-town crowd realizes Legends is gross and has poor service.

Things started fine. Our orders were taken relatively quickly, though we had to correct the waiter/owner a few times. And then we waited. And waited. And tried to get another server while they all deliberately looked away every time they passed our table (we were next to the kitchen, so it happened a lot). And then we gave up and got a pitcher from the untended bar to fill our own waters. After an hour, we finally managed to get someone&#39;s attention. She gave us an excuse about the owner going to cook and not telling her we were one of his tables, but no apology, and then brought our food.

Shocking to no one, the food was lukewarm at best, and had clearly been sitting out for a while. The alfredo tasted ok, but was congealed, and the chicken others had was rubbery and practically floating on all the oil in the accompanying vegetables. The waitress again disappeared, and when she finally came with our check 30 minutes later, she didn&#39;t ask how it was. I guess the half full plates spoke for themselves.

The owner reappeared to take our payments, and had the nerve to tell us not to worry about leaving a tip (on our full priced meal, by the way). For what, the 3 times in 2 hours we spoke to a staff member? The dry bread and cold food? We could&#39;ve tipped ourselves for refilling our own water, I guess. He also told us that a few people had called in so they were very busy, but again no apology, just a lot of excuses.

The BF and I stopped in a few weeks ago - I was starving and craving the carbs that come from delicious, delicious pasta.

Started with some bread and oil - very tasty. For an app we had the Polenta, Capocollo e Funghi (polenta cakes w/ capacollo and mushrooms). I was a fan - great flavor and texture.

The BF and I both got specials that evening. He had the spinach ravioli with mushroom sauce and I had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. The fettuccine and Alfredo sauce was wonderful, though there were only 4 small/medium shrimp and those were overdone. The BF&#39;s choice was heavenly and very filling for a meatless dish.

The service was a bit slow - I felt bad for our waitress who seemed to be taking care of everyone in the place. I thought the food and Chianti were just a bit overpriced for the neighborhood and quantity, but the quality was definitely there. I&#39;d head back when I need my next pasta fix."

I stumbled across this gem on the way home. It&#39;s a little tucked back and hard to see, but boy am I glad I found it. 

For dinner I&#39;m a huge believer of eating off everyone&#39;s plate that I&#39;m with at the time, not the most admirable trait, but I have to taste everything. I had the special, spinach stuffed ravioli with mushroom cream sauce, i really liked the mushroom sauce because the mushrooms with chopped very small and the texture was perfect. My mother had a mascarpone pear stuffed ravioli, it was an interesting mix but paired so well. And my daughter had her favorite fettuccini Alfredo, I loved they already cut her noodles before it came out. 

I loved everything i tasted. I loved that didn&#39;t have to take a drive to the city for great flavor. I think I found my new Italian spot. Our family will be back!"

I feel like Yelp nation totally let me down on this one.  Caesar salad tasted like iceberg lettuce with soybean oil, the minestrone ordered by my counterpart ended up being some kind of greasy potato soup, gnocchi was mushy, and literally the worst bolognese sauce I&#39;ve ever had. Watery and completely bland.  Our Eleanor Rigbyesque waitress was also a little strange, inattentive and skittish--In her defense, she was working alone and could have been a little pressed about that. Hate giving local businesses such a low rating, but the only good thing I can say is that it was quiet, which was conducive to conversation  It really was that bad and we would have been better off keeping it klassy down at the Olive Garden or another one of the garbage chains."

From the moment my daughter and I walked in, we were glad we decided on this restaurant for dinner. Homemade pastas, out of this world sauces, yummy desserts and friendly staff. What more could you ask for? We started with the homemade bread and olive oil (yum) and a simple, yet wonderful, side salad. My daughter ordered fettuccine with pomodoro sauce on the side and she said it was the best pasta sauce she has ever had. I ordered the first pasta dish on the menu (the name escapes me) and it was stuffed with pear purée and topped with prosciutto in a marscapone cream sauce. I was worried it would be too rich, but it was just perfect. For dessert, we shared a fruit dish comprised of strawberries and apples and topped with homemade whipped cream and crumbled cookies. 
It is a little hard to see from the street, but it&#39;s in the same building as Key Bank. If you&#39;re in the area, I highly recommend giving this family-owned restaurant your business. You won&#39;t regret it!"

The sauces were wonderful and the salads were done nicely with a light dressing that enhanced the lettuce rather than covering up the flavors.

We both got house salads with our entrees - for the extra $4, I was disappointed by the insipid bed of greens with maybe 1 or 2 tomatoes.

I ordered the meat ravioli, which came with an astonishingly low quantity of meat - thin little strips of a mediocre ham which, for all I know, might have been Oscar Mayer.

My girlfriend got pasta carbonara, which wasn&#39;t heated up properly (and also tasted bland)

Maybe this restaurant was having an off night, but if you desire high quality Italian food, I&#39;d say go to Denver or Boulder."

Actually, it was the best part of the meal for me.
The atmosphere of the restaurant lacks that little personal touch that would make it more inviting.  
They do not have a full bar, but offer a decent selection of wine.
The plates are very generous and the food average.  I had the Fagottini alle Pere con Prosciutto e Mascarpone, which is basically a ravioli filled with mascarpone mixed with pear.  The prosciutto on top looked more like a different kind of ham, I wonder if it&#39;s because they cooked it, it was more the color and consistence of white ham.  But the dish was good enough.  I tasted my friends plates, and I would have the same comment. Good, but borderline boring. 
The selection of desserts if very limited (3 I think).  I had the Tiramisu which was more of big amount of (too) runny cream with a little bit of the biscuit at the bottom.  My friend had warned me, I should have listened, skip the Tiramisu.
I guess if you live in the area, Scalzotto might be an option, they seem to try and the bread is wonderful.  But definitively not a first choice for me."

Pasticcio was a little bit overcooked on the top, but was very good.  Only advice I might suggest is to put some sauce on the top once it&#39;s served.  However, I did get it to go, so they may normally put sauce on it.

I haven&#39;t eaten the Fettucini, but I did taste it.  Very good, indeed.

The tiramisu was also very good, and comes recommended.

All in all, not superb, but definitely very good.  I&#39;ll be back to try them again.  I would suggest anyone in the area who is looking for good Italian, give them a try.  You&#39;ll be glad you went here, and not Olive Garden.

Ambiance - I think the store is pretty, it&#39;s your typical store front restaurant but it&#39;s an end store and does have a small patio. It has a bar and was very clean and pretty. 

Food- I like the varied menu, not your typical Italian (although they do have some typical items). It seemed very authentic and the food was hot and delicious. I ordered to go (I was working from home and couldn&#39;t be away for long enough to sit down). I ordered the lunch special Pasticcio (Lasagne). It was a large piece, very filling and still hot when I got home. It came with a side salad and some bread for $8.50. I thought it was a very good deal. 

Service - Since I ordered to go this was hard to rate but my order was basically ready when I got there (not sitting and getting cold but back in the kitchen ready to be bagged). I was greeted immediately and when I asked if they had a To Go menu for next time, he handed me a printed one but told me to be sure to check the online menu as they had expanded their selection since they opened and LOWERED the prices. 

Overall, I am not sure what kinks they had early out but I had a great experience and hope they do well. I will be back for sure. I am saving the 5 stars for an inhouse dining experience. :D"

We ordered two of the gnocchi dishes, one in bacon cream sauce, the other with garlic and tomatoes.  The gnocchi dishes were both delicious!  We shared a caprese salad to start, sliced tomatoes with fresh mozzarella slices on top and basil with olive oil, served on a cutting board shaped like a map of Italy!  The salad was delicious.

The salad was very fresh and the dressing was very good. I did ask for Parmesan. :)
The sauce was thin, not what we are accustomed to. I grew up on thick rich red sauce but it was tasty. Lots of garlic.
The meatball however was very tough. Not sure how you make a tough meatball.

The chicken marsala consisted of two thin cutlets and should have come with mashed potatoes and a salad, instead we got greasy bell peppers and zucchini and no salad.  The linguini bolognese was not bad but nothing special.  The house salad is simply mixed greens and three small cherry tomatoes -  very meh.

Italian is a good choice when trying to satisfy diverse tastes. It was nice that they took reservations and not only day of but future dates/times as well. We had a pretty good sampling of the menu between the seven of us so I can say the gnocchi was good but the one with bacon ruled our preference, fagottini was good and different with the pear purée and marscapone cheese sauce, fettuccini with mushrooms was good as well. Two concerns mirror other reviews was the meatballs were the worst of the things we ordered and getting our order placed took awhile. The food was worth the wait!"

Last night, The fettuccine is definitely not  home made and neither were the spaghetti noodles.  I  didn&#39;t even see ravioli on the menu, the bolognese looked nothing like the photos and was very, very oily. The minestrone soup looked like baby food because the were no recognizable vegetables or pieces of pasta, if those ingredients were present, they were thrown in a blender before serving. It was the texture of applesauce, color of pea soup and the most distinct flavor was an over powering black pepper. I give a 3 because the server seemed to be trying and was friendly and the bread was pretty good. Sorry, but very shocked at some of these easily impressed restaurant-goers and needed to post something more realistic. Before you decide that this place is &#34;excellent&#34;, try Firenze a Tavola, Patsy&#39;s, Stella or Papa Mazzottis to give yourself a true gauge for &#34;excellent&#34; Italian food."

Then we had a bad experience and took a break for 2 months. Gave it ONE MORE TRY yesterday and did carry out. I decided to try the Gnocchi and my fiancée got fettuccini with bolognese. We added 1 side Caesar as well and asked for them to add fresh basil to the gnocchi. While calling it in, my fiancée even confirmed that we wanted fresh basil because I really like it (and any real chef should prefer fresh basil over dried).

Anyways, picked up our order- we were charged for 2 side Caesars and another $6 caesar salad. We had to get the extra 2 salads removed and unfortunately didn&#39;t check the rest of the order. No fresh basil, which was so frustrating since the person taking the order made it a point to ask us about it again. We are done with this place  and am just so surprised that we&#39;ve now had 2 bad experiences in a row."

Unfortunately she had to be apologetic several times because of the kitchen problems. we both ordered lasagna and were told it would be 1 1/2 hours before they could make it. Mom ordered an Arnold 
Palmer and it tasted like watered down tea and unsweetened lemonade. Waitress kindly brought another and no change. The bread and olive oil was brought out next. I thought the dipping oil was good but the bread was uninspired and bland. The salads did taste very good and had nice flavorful Italian dressing, though I would have liked more varied ingredients like maybe black olives and some peppers. Our meal came out before we finished our salad.

On a positive note, the ravioli and espresso were excellent.

We sampled the red sauce and I thought it was good

The tiramisu came in a bowl with concentrated coffee at the bottom and a single large lady finger; mix it up if you get the chance, it was excellent.

Our waitress was extremely pleasant and efficient, in spite of waiting on five tables, two of which had 4+ people!  

The food....what can I say?.....it was excellent!  I had the gnocchi w/cherry tomatoes, lightly &#34;bathed&#34; with olive oil, garlic and basil and cheese on top!  Yummy!  My husband had the ravioli with mortadella covered in a light Gorgonzola sauce....another excellent dish!  We both had a salad dressed in the house oil and vinegar dressing....light and very fresh!  We were served a basket of fresh bread and a small dish of seasoned olive oil for dipping, once we ordered...very tasty!

We thought the prices at this restaurant were quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food!

On the contrary, this place is definitely one of a kind.  The Owner is native Italian and is bringing true Italian fare to a nice Denver suburb.   He takes great pride in their menu and the pasta is made daily on the premises.

A coworker and I were in town for the week and stopped by at around 8 for a late dinner.

We were quickly sat, and handed menu&#39;s and asked what we wanted to drink - we both stuck with water.

Once the hostess found out it was our first time, she gave us an overview of the food - what their philosophy is, and where it&#39;s from. 

It&#39;s Northern Italian, so it&#39;s more light sauces, white sauces, etc..

I had the fettuccini alfredo and my coworker had the meat lasagna.
The noodles were perfect - clearly home made; and the meat lasagna looked phenomenal.

   Tonight, Lisa and I had dinner at the restaurant, and, in our estimation, it was wonderful.
   We started with a simple house salad, made first-rate with the addition of a very particular extra Virgin olive oil, Altomena, of which, only 1,000 barrels per year are produced.
Give it a 10!
   We shared a minestrone soup, but we don&#39;t know anything more than it was outstanding. You will have to ask for it, since we don&#39;t see it on the menu).  Another 10 for our taste buds.
   Fagottini alle Pere con Prosciutto e Marscapone, for our entree, came highly recommended, through our grape vine.  We give it a to-die-for 10 (so, you go, you order, you eat, then you will know what it is, and just how good it is!).
   The Cannoli we shared may have been the best I ever tasted, so, yes, another 10! 
   And, I would  say neither of us claims any particular gourmet-type palette, but, we were, honestly, this impressed with what we experienced at Scalzotto. We think you will be, too!
   Oh, yes, Jeremy, our waiter, was very knowledgeable, and helpful, answering our questions, and making our dining experience, there, a lot of fun.

Enjoyed the bread basket with dipping oil. House salad had a unique dressing - - very light. My husband loved it. I liked it but will try the Caesar next time (looked good). Also happy they offer Moscato. 

I recommend going on a week night until they staff up and break into the place a bit more. It&#39;s a small space and they were busy on a Fri night. Would love to see this restaurant stick around so my review has nothing to do with service while they adjust to their success."

I was craving Italian food the night before Valentine&#39;s Day and found this restaurant on Yelp. We called ahead to get our name on the list and only had to wait about 15 minutes when we arrived. I have to say I was a little dismayed by the restaurant&#39;s unassuming location and small size. I did not have high expectations when we entered, but I was quickly reminded to not judge a book by its cover. The staff were very nice and attentive. We ordered the caprese salad to start and it was delicious and well proportioned for two people. My husband ordered a house salad and we were surprised that such a simply dressed salad could be so flavorful. For the main course I ordered the pasta carbonara and my husband got the spaghetti with Italian sausage. We split our meals which turned out great since the carbonara was so rich and the sauce for the sausage dish was light and fresh. We were too full for dessert but the surrounding tables seemed to all be enjoying a chocolate dessert in a martini glass. I don&#39;t remember the total cost of the meal but the entrees weren&#39;t more than $12 each. Two days later I can&#39;t stop reminding my husband about the delicious meal and can&#39;t wait to go back. Oh! and they gave all of the ladies a red rose when they left, which was a sweet gesture."

First thing you notice when you walk inside is it&#39;s rustic and small.   I think there were more chairs at the bar than tables in the dining area.  It&#39;s not the kind of place to take that special someone on that special occasion.   We have the certificate so we stayed to take a look at the menu.  Things began to look better once we saw the prices.  Not bad!  We decided to order lunch, how bad could it be, after all we do have the certificate.

If words like homemade, fresh, decent portions, hand cut fries, and delicious are what you covet, then give this place a try.  Ice cold beer on tap, lunch for two, and a Caramel Apple Blossom Ala Mode for dessert  for under $20.00 with the certificate.

We will be going back to sample some of that green chili and the Wisconsin Cheese curds with sliced apples.

Staff is out of this world friendly.

Could have easily given four stars but the place is a little rustic and very small.  Add some outdoor seating and this place becomes a five."

Ain&#39;t it good?  Ain&#39;t it right?  That there are cheese curds here at Whispers tonight?  Karaoke&#39;s playing, the green chile is fine (is fine, is fine, is fine).   

So my old karaoke buddy is here from out-of-town and we all meet up, old singin&#39; friends together again at Whispers.  My first time here.  I ordered a beer (nothing fancy here, but at least they had a Fat Tire) and then asked the waitress what she recommended to eat.  Without a hitch, she said they have the best green chile.  We ordered a plate of nachos with the green to share.  They were decent.  What really stood out was the salsa.  Awesome kick to it made delicious with fresh tomatoes and plenty of cilantro, which I like.  

Then, there was cheese.  Cheese curds.  They arrived as a melted pile of cheesey goodness spread out on half of the plate, perfectly browned on top, with sliced apples as an accompaniement.  &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; I ask myself.  Pull up some hot, melty cheese, wrap it around a slice of apple, bite.  Close your eyes as you savor the light, nutty flavor of the cheese against the slight tartness of the apple.  Bite again.  Move the plate closer to you and hope that your table-mates are next up to sing.  Eat it all up before they get back from the stage.  This dish made me very happy.  

Even though Whispers is on the other side of the world from where I live, I can now make excuses to drive over to Aurora to have a cold one and that little plate of cheese heaven.  Cheesiness rules."

I ordered a quesadilla which Im told was good, I don&#39;t really remember devouring it though.

She recommended a great summer strawberry spritzer, and when ordering she was so sweet, and personally engaged that it felt like I was in her kitchen and she wanted us to enjoy and relax.

However, when we go anywhere, because both my husband and I have had server positions, we tip well; even if we don&#39;t order a ton of food.  We are fairly low maintenance and easy to please.  

Both of us felt like we were immediately dismissed from having good service because we didn&#39;t order alcohol because we both don&#39;t drink.  From the second we ordered a fountain drink and water, service was horrible.  It took forever, the food was mediocre at best and our server was so distracted with too many tables that our soup and salad...yup, soup and salad took almost 40 minutes to arrive to our table. The claim was that our soup needed to be made fresh so ate least it was hot.  Our child&#39;s food was lukewarm.  

The food is severely over-priced and under-whelming.  It is just another reminder why we try to go to local non-chain restaurants...better service, better food, and better prices."

The fact, though, is that service really matters when you come to a chain restaurant like this.

As I said, the food was great (consistent with every other Olive Garden), but the service is what brought the experience down. We were seated at a poorly-lit table that wasn&#39;t clean; we had to ask 3 or 4 times for someone to come over with cloth. We ordered our drinks, but one person&#39;s iced tea wasn&#39;t included.

A guy tried to place a Togo order and the bartender seemed irritated and went to get the host. The host then went to explain that she had tried to help the man at the front and he walked away, but made sure to show the man she was irritated.... obviously it was his first time ordering togo here, he was not going out of his way to annoy anyone.

Walked into this location around 8:40pm and was seated right away (for three). I chose from the &#34;lighter fare&#34; option and got the baked tilapia and shrimp with the sauce on the side.

The salad comes out in a big salad tub for the whole table, and it&#39;s unlimited! Got the dressing on the side because, you know, we&#39;re all trying to be a bit healthier.

Food took a while to come out (around 40 minutes), which is ... A long time. I guess they forgot to put the sauce on the side for my dish, so it took longer ... I wouldn&#39;t have minded, but it was nice of them to remake it.

Our server was wonderful, lovely, attentive. All you can ask for in a server!

If you&#39;re trying to be healthy, or watching your calories, you can ask for any sauces on the side and dip the salad (or whatever food) in the sauce, which will help cut some cals. Also, the portions here are huge during dinner, so maybe split it or box half. Okay, this review turned into a &#34;health tips when eating out&#34; post. Apologies. I do that."

Walked in and was offered a table. I said great, my friend is parking the car and I will use the rest room. Be right back. We come back in just about 3 minutes and they gave away our table and now we have a 15 minute wait. How ridiculous is that!

Then they forgot our appetizer completely so we got our lunch, finished lunch and then finally got the appetizer with no apologies or corrections for this mistake. 

Water was not refilled until we asked. I didn&#39;t even get silverware until after my soup so I had no napkin. 

Very poor service"

Good food, decent price and usually friendly and good service. However, I went into this location the other night and recieved the worst treatment ever.  

My friend and I along with my little girl (3 months) went in on a weekday night. My lil one was a bit fussy but we managed. Our waitress was beyond rude! Unfortunately, I believe she was not pleased with the color difference in our skin... myself a white woman with a black man and small child were not welcome. It took her a whole to get our drink order, she was rude while serving our food and when we asked for our meal to be put in boxes since my daughter was getting too fussy and we didn&#39;t want her disturbing other guests the waitress threw them on the table and left with a dirty look. My friend spoke with the manager and he didn&#39;t even apologize! We packed up our things, paid the bill, and left. 

I was a loyal customer, especially during my pregnancy cravings and after this incident I will not be eating there again and will recommend my friends and family go elsewhere as well."

Unfortunately, we did not receive that at your restaurant.  Its started bad from the get go when we where seated next to the kitchen and your staff yelling &#34;corner&#34; every other minute.  I understand why they need to do this but it really don&#39;t help the noise level.  Then things just kept getting worse.  It took forever to get our breadsticks and when we did no one had any plates to put them on.  And we not offered cheese on our salads.  After that we have to flag down a different waiter to try and get our drinks refilled. 45mins later... we finally got our refills.  By this time, I was extremely unhappy and had even asked 3 different staff members to get the manager.  He never appeared.  Just about the time we were needing our 2nd refills on drinks I left the table to find the manager.  He claimed that he never heard of any complains and that he would talk to the server and dessert was on him.  After that I expected the service to get better but no.  It got worse.  The wrong food was sent to the table, still no refills on drinks, soups...  And when we asked for our food to be boxed up the server just gave us the boxes instead of boxing the food up for us.  And he didn&#39;t even enough boxes.  We had to keep asking for boxes.  And to top it all of the food wasn&#39;t that great and the positions have gotten smaller.  I work to hard for my money to spend it on an experience like this. I deserve better! .  I expect better from Olive Garden!"

We were seated promptly upon arriving. Then we waited. A table near us was already seated. Their server greater them, then brought out their drinks. We still had yet to see our server. Then our neighbor received their appetizer. Still no server for us. 
When she finally arrived, she offered us drinks. Asked if we were celebrating anything. I told her it was my daughter&#39;s birthday. Asked if we were ready to order. I asked for a minute because we were discussing an appetizer. She returned promptly with our drinks. The menus stacked on the end of the table. She walked away. We ordered our appetizer via the ziosk. 
She came back to take our order. Our appetizer arrived delivered by another server. Then our soups and salad. Followed by our dinners. Our entrees, as always, were nice. Delivered by yet another server.
Then came time for dessert. She asked if we had room. We declined. 
She thanked us and told us that we could pay using the ziosk. 

Then, she walks into the dining room and presents another table with a birthday dessert, on the house she said, in a carry out box. 
My daughter was noticeably upset. So, I paid and we left. 
There was no one by the front door. No one to complain to. 
We will NEVER return to this location.

Let me start by saying that I think there are way too many hostesses at the front.  It&#39;s very intimidating when 6-8 employees are standing there - I don&#39;t think you need that many people to greet you.  If anything it, it&#39;s uncomfortable.  
I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and Olive Garden&#39;s regular salad (with extra peppercinni&#39;s).  The order came out in less than 10 minutes.  I appreciate this.  
The salad was fine.  I wish there was more meat sauce with the spaghetti - I had many plain spaghetti bites even after mixing everything together.  They forgot to pack utensils - this wouldn&#39;t be a big deal if I was taking this home, but I&#39;m staying at a hotel.  
I&#39;m 50/50 about returning - maybe if I was craving the salad, but I&#39;ll skip the spaghetti with meat sauce next time."

I had Eggplant Parmesan, He had Mixed Grill.
The Mixed Grill spice was bland and the &#34;gravy&#34; (It looked like it whatever it was supposed to be) was not delicious. He kept wiping it off with his napkin to eat the meat.

Eggplant parm was just inedible. It was rock hard. The spaghetti it came with was old. Half of it was rock hard like it sat out for hours. The other part was super gummy like when it is about to rot. You could not break it between your fingers it just smooshed kinda chalky like but remained intact. The teaspoon of sauce was sugary sweet, which I hate. I like pasta sauce zesty, not sugary sweet. Ew!

I did not eat past a bite of the parm as I was afraid I would break a tooth. The waitress quizzed me on why. She sent the manager over who seemed irritated with me about it. I am not going to eat something I don&#39;t like. He was only really interested in getting me to order something else. My appetite was blown though. To receive old pasta, and rock hard main dish why on earth would I want to chance it on another item? No way! 

The waitress was pretend nice which I don&#39;t care about. What ever. The manager did take it off the ticket but he seemed rather annoyed the whole time and it wasn&#39;t like I was rude about it. I just matter of fact showed him the problems. I didn&#39;t expect him to be excited by it but I did expect him to be polite."

Not only was he very short with his answers, he was also very scatter brained when it came to looking after us. I asked for more breadsticks, which I never received, nor did I receive a refill of any kind on mine or my boyfriend&#39;s drinks. When I went to pay for my bill it seemed as though it was a very big burden to find me change (I put $100 down on a $50 tab) because when it came to give it me he merely tossed my change on the table as he was talking by with a very bothered &#34;Have a Good Day&#34; while he was walking away.

I thought &#34;Hey, my girlfriend and I can go and get a mediocre pasta dinner and call it a night.&#34;  Boy, was I wrong.  Upon arrival, the parking lot resembled that of a traveling carnival; utter chaos.  The cars totally ignored the lines and were parked every which way.  

The inside of this establishment looked like a Guantanamo Bay prison cell.  The walls and tables were bare and there was a sticky film on every surface in sight.  We were seated and waited 15 mins for anyone to acknowledge our existence.  A teenage waiter finally came over to take our drink order and give us menus.

I ordered the braised beef gorganzola-alfredo pasta dish.  It looked nothing like the commercials.  My girlfriend ordered the sausage and peppers marsala pasta disaster.  The peppers in her dish were raw and it looked like they just scraped the whole thing from someone elses half eaten meal onto another dish.  I was not surprised at all to find a 5in x 5in piece of wax paper mixed in with my pasta.  We ended up going home and both getting food poisoning (I pooped 3 times within 1 hour of walking through my front door).

I can&#39;t even think about this horrible experience anymore.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  Just don&#39;t go to this restaurant, please."

We got here early, a bit before 5 pm and it took a reasonable 15 minutes to have our party of 5 seated. 

Our server took our drink order-ice tea and cokes-but we&#39;re informed they were out of diet Coke. Wow that doesn&#39;t happen often. They did not have any other diet soft drinks available -so water was ordered by my daughter.

It took a good 15 minutes for the salad bowl to be brought to us. Usually it&#39;s about  5 minutes. It was a long wait and during this time did not see our server at other surrounding tables.

Food was good-never had a bad meal served at Olive Garden. 

We ordered  one desert-took over 15 minutes for it to be brought to us-again untypical. 

Lastly our bill was mixed up with another table, but it was caught by our server (or the other table that had just 2 in their party) and brought to our attention by her. 

Our server was probably new and if she was, she will get better with experience. 

At the Westminster location where we usually go, the Manager usually comes around the tables and asks how the food and service was. Didn&#39;t happen tonight at the Aurora location as we were there for almost 1.5 hours and so folks coming and going during this time. Mgmt should incorporate this at this store.."

Every time I visit it&#39;s a pretty good experience! Usually the waiters and waitresses are kind and the food always comes out warm and delicious. This time though, it was a little bit different. I went out for dinner last night with my family to this Olive Garden, this is the Olive Garden we usually go to and I love it always. We came around 5:30 ish and it was pretty crowded because it was a Saturday and it was dinner time. We only waited about 15 minutes so nothing to complain about there. We were seated at a pretty good place and the waitress was very kind. The problem started when the food came in though.

When the food came in the portions were definitely smaller. I also noticed on the menu that the prices went up, probably about 2-3 dollars more, that made me angry. But I guess it&#39;s the economy messing the restaurant businesses up. We got out appetizers, which were the calamari and the mussels. The calamaris came in a smaller portion than usual, the mussel were okay, but some of them were closed and we asked if they can replace the mussels with a new set. So we get the new set of mussels and they were cold and disguising..I was pretty pissed at that point. I ordered the grilled shrimp caprassi, my sis got an alfredo, and the others got something else. The actual meals came in great portions so I was happy about that. Overall it was an okay experience."

I might have a slight bias because when I was young (like 19), I lived in a town that didn&#39;t have anything like an Olive Garden and I started dating a guy who took me to big cities like Tulsa, Ok and Dallas, Tx and treated me to fancy dinners at places like The Olive Garden and The Macaroni Grill. (when you are from the south, like me, you add &#34;the&#34; to everything.) Also, I usually only eat one thing there - soup, salad, and breadsticks. Their soup, salad, and breadsticks is pretty darn tasty. I honestly don&#39;t know anyone that doesn&#39;t like their salad. Some of their other stuff is decent too, like their spaghetti. I think it&#39;s when you get into their more complex menu items that things start going downhill. Their very basic menu items are pretty tasty. 

This Olive Garden is pretty typical. The service isn&#39;t very good. The last time we were there the server had the personality of a potted plant. He was also very slow. Still, The Olive Garden is a place I wil no doubt return many, many times."

When I checked in at the front door they were eager to seat me even though my entire party hadn&#39;t arrived. As soon as I sat in bar I was offered tastes of wine and bread sticks. The drink recommendation was terrible given my preferences were specific. Food at our table was extra slow to arrive and super over cooked. The staff made it right without my having to ask. The lemon dessert was fabulous. The food could use more sauce!! There are lots of other places I would rather eat than here but they tried hard. I hope they get their broken parts fixed. OG is an American staple.

They waited on us pretty quickly and also brought out the salads and bread sticks right away.  Food was served hot within 15 minutes. But mine (chicken Parm) was overcooked and there was not enough red sauce.  
Others with us were generally positive about the meal, although a few people didn&#39;t care for their seafood dishes. 
Overall it was a pretty typical experience for Olive Garden - 3 stars,"

Goods-
Free sample of wine, 1st red I have ever had that has not made me shiver. 
Breadstick refills, I could eat my weight in carbs, which probably explains my weight.
Zuppa Tuscanna (sp?) Sausage and Potato soup so good, I will always get this. 
I had Tour di Mare- or tour of the sea. Shrimp fett alfredo, some battered shrimp in a garlic lemon sauce, and crab ravioli. All devine! I wish my fett and ravioli had more sauce. My man had Chicken with Peppers dish (cannot remember name) again MORE SAUCE, he felt like it was dressed with olive oil and not the garlicy sauce it was supposed to have.
Of course dessert, see carb statement above. I like the little cups of dessert. I always get amaretto one, and I ordered caramel cake one too. My man got Tiramisu. 
Server pretty attentive. 

The Bads-
Awkward seating- 2 people on a 7 table top. It was us and chairs lots of them. 
Lack of sauce. Will need to ask for more upfront. 
Dessert mix up. I got my amaretto cups but not my caramel one, they gave me chocolate instead. Sad face :(.


Next time want to try Peach Sangria. And make sure I get my caramel cup!!!"

A friend and I went here after a movie one night to grab a bite to eat. We were seated immediately, but we did not get our complimentary breadsticks or any sort of attention from a server for 10minutes. By the time the waitress came &amp; took our order we had not only decided on drinks, but also food and then had time to change our minds-twice. LOL. I ordered an Italian soda, and she a pop. Her pop came almost ten minutes later..and my soda did not. Still no breadsticks or talk of appetizers/taking orders. 
Unfortunately, at this point we had been there over 30 minutes without having our orders taken, and decided that we wanted to eat sometime that day. So we got up and left. They comp&#39;d my friend&#39;s drink and the host at the front was very polite in offering us to speak with a manager. We declined..and left to eat somewhere else.
I have eaten at other Olive Gardens and have only good things to say about their delicious cuisine. However...service at this one...terrible. :( I mean 30minutes without a drink or breadsticks or taking our order? Ehhh...will take my $$ elsewhere. I will try back again eventually hopefully quicker service so I can enjoy your tasty menu."

The salad and soup are probably my favorite things at Olive Garden.

House wine is just alright for the price, food is always pretty good for the price.  Nothing exceptional, but always predictable.  I guess predictability is kinda good because you pretty much always know what to expect.

Just three stars because I only go here if someone in my family wants to, its never a request by me."

So I ordered the steak gargonzola and it was terrific.  I can&#39;t complain at all about the food.  So why only 3 star rating?  The answer is simply a combination of having to wait so long for a seat (not a big issue) but the service was TERRIBLE!!!  The guy&#39;s name is Victor.  He is a foreigner that for some reason has no manners whatsoever.  He would walk away while we were talking to him and at the end of our meal he even grabbed the credit card right out of our hands (LITERALLY) before we even put it in the little book they provided.  He watched over us as we wrote in the tip and as he walked away he was already opening the book and looking how much we left him.  Once he was gone, I never got another refill or checked on (we were there only an extra 5 minutes, but still!!   I will return, but request that I do not get Victor again."

i have tried almost every dish on their menu and each time, i wonder why i ordered it. the food is very mediocre. there is either too much sauce or it is too dry. the food is just consistently just okay. i never go away with the feeling that wow that dish was good. but if youre having that pasta craving and need a place that can hold a big group and is fast, i guess this is the place to go. but i can do without. 

their service here is quite good and i have no complaints. but the food doesn&#39;t really satisfy me."

I had spaghetti with meat sauce, about as good as what you would get out of a jar or can for the sauce.  Too bad, have eaten good food there in past.  Maybe it is simply &#34;stay away from any specials they advertise&#34;.  The best part of their salad is the dressing.  Whole bowl had maybe 2 small pieces of tomato plus a few croutons on the lettuce. Bread sticks used to be warm and garlicky - they were neither.

I always come here with my family for dinner. It is packed mostly during the hours of 6-8, so you might have to wait a while before you get a table. It&#39;s worth it, though. The waiters are usually attentive and friendly. I asked for no ice in my drink, and when my waiter realized they had made a mistake, they immediately took my drink back and got me another one with no ice.

And although an easy, and somewhat &#34;stock&#34; birthday present, we were thrilled, none-the-less, to get a free meal! As the old, &#34;Big Country&#34; hit goes, &#34;I&#39;m not expecting to grow flowers in the desert,&#34; such was our attitude of dining at such a seemingly blase&#39; corporate Italian restaurant. In fact, the last experience we had at a similar type of restaurant (who&#39;s name is a particular elbow shaped variety of pasta, followed by the word, &#34;Grill&#34;) was not so good. I was pleasantly surprised at how well everything turned out for us at the Olive Garden. We were greeted and sat right away. The hostess said something to the extent of, &#34;Welcome to the Olive Garden, I really hope you have an amazing lunch today.&#34; Kind of a mundane detail, I know, but she really seemed genuinely sincere. We ordered a large bottle of San Pellegrino, and quietly chuckled when the server repeated and mispronounced the product as &#34;pennegrino.&#34; It was really more cute then anything. Anyways, the rest of the meal was delivered hot, and in a timely fashion. We never felt rushed, nor were we ever left hungry, and longing for the next course. We always had everything we needed, and nothing that we didn&#39;t need. The server was a little in-the-weeds, but did a great job at managing our table. Several different employees dropped by to either refill our water, clear, run our food, or just check in to make sure everything was good. The food was just as we had hoped for it to be. Nothing totally amazing, and I didn&#39;t call my parents about it, but it hit the spot, and it was definitely tasty. We both left full and happy. For what they&#39;re trying to do as a restaurant, we honestly had no complaints."

Having to wait for a table so your employees can sit on the floor in some back section and shoot the shit is not my idea of exemplary customer service.

I&#39;m not only talking about the servers either. Some days we would have amazing servers but then someone in the kitchen would mess up an order or the bartender would forget about our drinks until our main course has already come out. Most of the seating are booths or tables that seat 4 or more and of course they have seating for even larger parties. This place is good for families, dates, and just dining with friends.

I guess because he had two jobs to perform. Anyway, there was another server there who was helping another table, (Chris). He took care of his customers. We decided to ask him for bread and butter, he did so with a smile. My waiter was too busy making drinks to help us. If Chris was my server, I probably would have given my visit more stars.

The last time I&#39;ve ever dined in an Olive Garden was on my homecoming night when I was in high school. I remember when we walked in our fancy, Vegas style dresses inside a fancy Olive Garden where everyone stared at us.  It was a precious night and I ordered the fried shrimp platter going across. I loved it so much, I ordered it twice. This location was fancy as well. Definitely recommended for the romantic couple who is out looking for a date ideas. Vince took care of us tonight. Let me tell you how impressed I am that he was the first and only to meet my list of standards of what a perfect server should be. He not only made good recommendations in the menu, he also had a great attitude while doing it. For a Friday night, it was packed! The wait was 35 minutes tops. It was worth it when Vince hung out with us that night. In a little corner while Vince was on his two feet, Kyle took care of us briefly as well. Great young gentlemen. 

The food: none of us had finished the dish meals provided for us. The tossed salad was filled with a mild, yet none-visible sauce that tasted great at first, but either to sweet or sour for my likings. Not in between at all. The main course entree was not the most fantastic and i didn&#39;t finish my Shrimp dish. The dessert was phenomenal! Tiramisu cake is the best and should be tried by everyone. I thought the food tasted better the first time around. Not the second time, but the service made it splendid. We will be returning."

The staff is always friendly in restaurant and Togo also very attentive and Always refilling your water . Fairly quick service. Salad and breadsticks are always right out; and because of my food allergies they are always very generous to bring me a bowl of it with no cheese, dressing or croutons . The gluten free rotini is excellent !! I love it with marinara !! Only complaint is I wish they would get gluten free bread sticks but other than that I have always had good food and good service ! One time my meal was wrong and they made me a new one nice and hot ! Also the fried zucchini appetizer is delicious as well as the peach Bellini ice ice tea ! Good for occasions, family, kids, parties, or just dinner !"

Dining at a table is very good or very poor depending on whom you&#39;re selected to be served by.  Food is consistent. I tend to dine alone often and prefer to sit at the bar. It&#39;s a huge mistake here every time I try it. I have tried 4 times now. It&#39;s better for me to pick up my food and take it home.

This is the worst olive garden I have ever been to. We had a party of twelve. I called ahead to see if we could put our name on a waiting list but was basically told no. When we get there we were told a forty minute wait. End up being and a half. They comped us appetizers and drinks and kids meals. It ended up being a three hour ordeal.

We dined here last night and arrived about 4:30, as we wanted to get there early so we didn&#39;t have to wait forever for a table. We got there at 4:30, the restaurant was pretty empty, and we had to wait 10 minutes for the table. After we sat down, after about 15 minutes of no service at all, (no one came and offered us drinks or anything) we were greeted by a woman who wasn&#39;t our server, but she got us our drinks and breadsticks as she claimed our server was &#34;catching up.&#34; As she brought back the drinks, she told us to order our appetizers through the Ziosk machine, and we ultimately didn&#39;t do so, leaving us to wait another 15-20 minutes for our server to finally show up. He got our orders, and then we waited for another 20-25 minutes, but we were out of drinks and didn&#39;t want the breadsticks because we didn&#39;t have some olive oil to accompany them. After being told 4 separate times, the server came back with the olive oil, and we were left with some cold breadsticks. Then we received our food, which was alright. My mother asked for no peppers and extra sauce, and she received her food with peppers. We told the server twice to get her the meal without peppers. I had a &#34;breadstick bun Italian meatball sandwich&#34; which sounded pretty good, but it was just awful. The &#34;breadstick bun&#34; was so stale that I couldn&#39;t bite into it, or stick my fork through it, so I was forced to eat the meatballs, which were ok. Finally, the server came back and asked if we wanted refills, however, every time he returned, he forgot someone&#39;s drink. My brother told him 5 times for a cherry limeade. After bringing the bill and forgetting our mints, we let the server know that we wanted mints, leading to him to say &#34;we are all out.&#34; My whole table said &#34;oh&#34; and he then began to laugh and say he was &#34;just kidding.&#34; I didn&#39;t really get a laugh out of that joke. We eventually got our mints.

So, either Olive Garden had some really dumb staff that night, (3/27/16) or this guy was just too focused on other things to serve us correctly. The rest of the people eating were served promptly, but we were stuck waiting for long periods of time. Even though it was Easter, not one of the staff members here bothered to say happy Easter to us. I hope the management will read this review, and I will be updating it later after I find out the servers name. Pretty awful experience, something we are not used to when we go to Olive Garden."

It is gross that people are touching them before they eat dinner and I think it takes away from the personalization of having the server at the tables. Plus for a restaurant that is known for trying to promote family meals, you put a device on the tables that has games for children to play, it sure doesn&#39;t promote the family values you say you have. 
The food is decent same as any other Olive Garden that you go to. 
The service is hit or miss.  one time while we were there we were charged for waters that we ordered for our children. When asked why we were charged for waters the server stated &#34;because there is no button for children&#39;s water&#34; it then unfortunately took longer than it should&#39;ve to have that issue resolved. 
Once their service is routinely exemplary and they take the electronic menus of the table the star rating would move up significantly"

However the staff in the bar is ALWAYS awesome. They are fast, they keep us well hydrated, the drinks never stop and the food is hot and delicious every time. All the bartenders tend to be very fast and know how to make a drink perfect every time.

We were starving and with a 2 yr old and 6 yr old, late on Sunday. I would have gotten up and left if not for this. When did Olive Garden go so downhill? The breadsticks were hard, the salad had way too much dressing and olives. I ordered a steak med/rare. Got it well done, zero pink. Tasted like a steak from Denny&#39;s. Mashed potatoes were bland and gooey. I would have sent it back, but was afraid of how long it would take. My 2 year old was brought Alfredo sauce , when we ordered tomato sauce.

The hostess said there was a 30-35 minute wait.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were called after 20 minutes.

I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana with Spaghetti and my husband had the Spaghetti with meat sauce.  They were average.  The salad was the best part of the meal.

My husband presented his Retired Military card and I presented my DD Form 214 for my Discharge from Active Duty.  When the bill was brought to the table, the server had only taken off one entree.  I showed him my papers and he promptly took off both of the entrees and we owed nothing.  The server even brought us a bag of warm breadsticks to take home with our leftovers.

I&#39;m a fan of the Chicken Scampi.(But NOT at this location)  First time trying it here, I was NOT IMPRESSED.  Gave it a second chance a few months later, same deal.  Don&#39;t know why the taste is different (comparing to the one on Havana which I&#39;ve had a handful of times over THERE and never a complaint or issue) but there&#39;s something wrong with that dish.  Otherwise anything else I have had has been EXCELLENT.  Unfortunately on Mother&#39;s day (5/10) it was overwhelming and staff was very unorganized.  On top of having a full house, people were doing ONLINE ORDERS as well as calling in TAKE OUT&#39;s.  I made my ONLINE order around 5:15pm that Sunday afternoon with a pick up time of 6:50.  My honey went to go and did not get home til almost 8.  He waited pretty much 45 min or longer for our food.  I realize it&#39;s busy, but in the future I would recommend a better system and getting the wait times a little more accurate if you are going to offer ONLINE ordering and figuring out the TAKE OUT orders to accommodate the customers in a more efficient manner.  
Everything was great except in getting my &#34;tour of Italy&#34; dish, my chicken parmigiana was kinda soggy.  Will always be a fan, just needed to get my review out there so they know what they need to do to better their service!"

We did have to wait about five minutes when we arrived, but that was totally fine.

The food was delicious and although the service was prompt, it was not what is should have been. We ordered an appetizer, and it arrives at the same time as our food, which meant is wasn&#39;t really touched. Call me crazy, but I think the app should be served before the meal.

Olive Garden has simply become way too commercialized.  There is no quality to their food anymore.  When I was a kid I remember walking into Olive Garden and seeing someone making pasta fresh.  That alone set the tone for what you were about to consume.  Also, the famous bread sticks were infinitely better back then.  They tasted fresh, and could have been a substitute for dessert.  Now, their bread tastes like frozen dough that was baked in the oven.  Really sucky I must say.

If it wasn&#39;t for the unlimited soup and salad this place would be a complete after thought.  The people you routinely see in there now are people who have underdeveloped pallets, who enjoy rather bland food.  That comes as a knock, however, I challenge people to explore the flavors out there that will spin your taste buds into frenzy.  Please, don&#39;t settle for a generic Italian place such as this one.  It has forgotten its roots, and has fallen victim to corporate mediocrity."

The breadsticks are usually hot and fresh and made just right. Sometimes they&#39;re a little hard but that&#39;s the rarity rather than the rule. The salad is always excellent.

I always get the spaghetti and meatballs and I can never finish it (after the salad and God knows how many breadsticks) but I always try. It&#39;s always made to perfection.

This would be a 5 star review if it weren&#39;t for the fact that sometimes we go there and they don&#39;t look THAT busy yet we still have to wait for a table. There&#39;s nothing worse than waiting for 10 minutes and then having a hostess walk you thru a dining room full of empty tables."

They have little fresh made donuts too for dessert!  So good!  Also not to be missed is the Italian Margarita (comes with an Amaretto sidecar), it is a sweeter cousin to the traditional Margarita.

It was actually better than the Nero d&#39;Avola (but bottles are usually always better than wines by the glass).

I still love the breadsticks here.  I don&#39;t know what it is about it that is just so darn tasty!!  I had 2 but wanted to eat about 6 of them.  One of our guests rolled up all the leftover breadsticks in some napkins to take home with her.  She must have had about 12 of them. LOL!

I ended up ordering the Parmesean crusted fish with angel hair pasta.  I was actually very surprised at the delicious flavors.  I usually put more Parmesan cheese on EVERYTHING I eat but I didn&#39;t need to with this entree.  VERY cheesy and delicious.  It came with some vegetables as well.  I&#39;d definitely order this again if I ever return to an OG.

I tend to prefer not frequenting chains when at all possible, but sometimes it&#39;s out of my control, and when it is, I&#39;m rarely dissappointed with OG."

The restaurant was really busy so we decided to sit at the bar.  There was only 4 other people besides us at the bar.  There were 2 bartenders, a female worried about dishes and cleaning, and a male, worried about flirting with 2 girls.  We sat there for a good 10 minutes without even eye contact, menus, no acknowledgement whatsoever.  Finally, the female bartender asked what she could get us to drink.  I stated that I would like a menu to look at.  The male bartender (right in front of us the whole time flirting) started mumbling something of &#34;I didn&#39;t see you sittin&#39; there&#34; and through menus at us.  We sat there again for another 10 minutes without another visit from either one of them.  The male bartender was really drunk and stumbling around.  Never leaving the girls and giggling the whole time.  We finally just got up to leave.  We called the manager 30 min later to discuss and they never came to the phone.  We were hung up on by the host staff.  I wrote into the Olive Garden website and never had a response either. I am really concerned about the drunk bartender.  He was wasted."

I don&#39;t know what it is, perhaps my tastes have changed as I&#39;ve gotten older because I used to love Olive Garden as a kid/teen and now I&#39;m kinda take it or leave it. You have to wonder about the wine that they offer at the start of your meal, so we tried it and it was pretty gross.

I swear the breadsticks have changed slightly over the years (not as good as I ever remember them), but you know that&#39;s not really what got me. They offer &#34;unlimited&#34; salad and breadsticks but they only give you one serving of each and then they don&#39;t come around after that (how can you ask for more?) until your food is delivered. 

Speaking of food being delivered, the wrong food that is... I ordered Chicken Parm, because it was Veterans Day and it was part of their &#34;free for veterans&#34; menu. The waiter and I had had a whole conversation about my service, and the fact that I would order off the free menu; he proceeded to order my meal as Eggplant Parm (which wasn&#39;t even on the menu).

It&#39;s a good thing there wasn&#39;t a wait to be seated when we arrived, but there was one when we were leaving. This is not the kind of food I&#39;d wait for that&#39;s for sure."

WAKE UP people, this is a CHAIN and they are a modeled mold of about 750 just like it. They must provide the same exact lack luster over cooked pastas and way over processed sauces that you can find at any other nationwide or world wide for that matter! You get what you pay for. You want fine dining, go to fine dining Italian and then complain that you just paid too much for pasta and bread! $25 for Two dinner entrees and bottomless salad/bread sticks.. Or that take a free entree home for lunch tomorrow deal. Com&#39;on maan, this is a deal! Stop bitching about or go some where else!!
I went last night and had great service, decent tasting food for the price. This place is consistent in their efforts! As long as they have these decent deals for dinner, we will continue to go back. I owned an Italian restaurant for years and can cook better Italian food, but its nice to be able to go out and be served at a reasonable priced dinner and NOT HAVE some way out of reach high expectations of what it should be. We go in knowing we get what we pay for! Very simple.
 Keep up the good work O.G. and the consistent efforts!"

i ate it all. it didnt make me sick. it was very tasty. the bread was soft and hot. the salad was green, fresh, and crisp. the eggplant parmigiana was cooked deliciously, and there was plenty of food at a very reasonable price. 

staff was friendly and we were seated immediately. good sized crowd for an 8:20pm dinner. i always get nervous if we&#39;re late, a business is going to go a little lacidasical on the food service and preparation. not this place. left feeling full, good, and well-served til we walked out the door.

parking plentiful and convenient. clean. well kept. 

cant wait to eat here again."

We only went to Olive Garden to &#34;fat load&#34; before doing the HCG diet. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been a fan of Olive Garden since maybe 1999. Since about 2007, I&#39;ve eaten lower salt and lower fat foods. Wow, was my body in for a shock here.

To be honest, I think if someone eats here more often than once a month, they&#39;re probably on the express train to hypertensionville if they haven&#39;t arrived already. The salt content of EVERYTHING from the salad to the soup to the breadsticks to the entrees is excessive and unhealthy. The only thing that I&#39;d consider going back for is maybe spaghetti and meatballs; hard to go wrong there. The kids loved it, of course, but I couldn&#39;t feel good about seeing them stuff almost 1000 calories into their mouths at a sitting. It&#39;s restaurants like this that have America kids turning into blobs. 

Can&#39;t complain about the service, really. It was quite good. Our waiter was attentive, nice, and personable. Much better than we usually get at mainstream chains these days.

Pros: Price, parking, atmosphere, and consistency
Cons: Just about everything else"

It&#39;s an Olive Garden in the middle of suburbia.  It tastes like any other Olive Garden I&#39;ve been to and the service is the same.

It was too cold to sit outside when I went, so, I sat at the bar.  They have very reasonably priced drinks and 33 beers on tap.  The menu is somewhat limited, but, they do have good choices.  I had the fish and chips.  I have to say, it was one of the best I&#39;ve had.  It was fresh, crispy and they have great fries.  The coleslaw was also very good and they make their own tartar sauce, which was also excellent.  

The service was also great - the bartender was a little awkward - I&#39;m pretty sure he was new - but he was so nice and attentive.  When I left, he thanked me for coming and keeping him company.  He was very sweet.  

They had live music - a duo - not too loud, playing at 5 p.m. on a Saturday and they have Geeks Trivia and yoga events, which I think I&#39;d like to try out sometime.  The only reason I&#39;m not giving this place 5 stars is because they hardly have any TV&#39;s and they&#39;re all small.  If they had more televisions and larger ones, this bar would be perfect.  They already have the beer and good food - why not add the televisions and we can watch the games here!!!!  This area desperately needs more upscale places to watch football.  I&#39;d love some Bingo, too.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to 2 Penguins.  The fish and chips alone will bring me back."

Their food is mediocre at best. We got the spinach dip, which was spicey. We also got a burger and their Margarita pizza. Both were pretty average. Like a step above bar food. I was expecting a lot more from this place.

The burger was pretty standard. Im pretty sure it was frozen. Got fries, cheese and bacon on it for $12. I think that&#39;s a lot considering the size of the burger and the fact that the fries are not fresh. The sauce on the pizza was crushed up tomatoes.

Impressed with the beer selection but that&#39;s it. Unfortunately, their food brought my review of this place WAY down."

I gave it 4 for the ambiance and beer, albeit quality of the food. They&#39;ve added a shuffleboard and ping pong table (fun!) But the food.... fries came out soggy (sad panda), burger patty cooked well but while the bread was buttered it did not taste fresh... it was a bit crunchy/tasted old and not soft and sweet like you would expect from a potato bun.

And I chose to swing by and give 2 Penguins a try. We both wanted to like this place so much, but our experience left us underwhelmed.  

It was about 6:30 on Sunday evening and as we pulled up we questioned if they were even open. There were 3 other cars in the parking lot. We ordered 3 appetizers to sample between us. The cheesy spinach dip was for sure our favorite. The basket of chips was alright for $1, but I wouldn&#39;t order another. The bar nachos genuinely made me sad. The cheese seemed like it was from a can, yes a can.  

With us being the only people in there the atmosphere was odd. The music seemed loud, yet between the songs there was a long silence that really made you aware you were the only ones there. 

The other perk, aside from cheesy spinach dip, the brews. They do have an extensive beer listing that I will give another chance on and evening where I&#39;m seeking out new drafts."

The fare is typical casual food (burgers, pizza, wings, etc) but they also have a make your own salad option! For $5, you get to pick 3 items on your choice of greens and dressing. This comes with a little basket of seasoned bread triangles, too!  So if you&#39;re not starving. I&#39;d definitely recommend the &#34;medium&#34; salad. 

They have beer! Lots and lots of local beer, including a gluten free raspberry ale by Bonfire, and (my personal favorite), the Grist Berliner Weisse. You get to pick a fruit flavor to drop in, if you, like me, like fruity sours. 

The staff is also super friendly! They&#39;ll let you try a sample or two to help you decide what kind of beer to go with your meal.  Throw in the cornhole station on the back patio, and you&#39;ve got a winner in this place."

I have gone to 2 Penguins twice now and both times, they did not disappoint. The first time, I went late at night on a weeknight with a friend. We ordered appetizers and beer and everything was amazing. The serving size was way more than enough and we took a lot home. 
The second time I went with my husband and brother during standard dinner hours on a Tuesday - turned out to be Trivia night! The place was busy, but not long wait busy (we didn&#39;t wait at all). And we were seated far enough away from the Trivia area that it did not bother us in the slightest. The food was delicious and the beer was good and interesting (lots of different kinds to try!). 

We will definitely return here!! The reason for not the full 5 star is that is can get rather expensive when there are a lot of people in the party. And there were a lot of kids there that night that kept rolling a ping pong ball under our table. It wasn&#39;t a nuisance but very slightly detracted from the full experience."

We stopped by the first week. . .and we had pizza (for kids, and it was pretty good) and Fish N&#39; Chips ( - really good, considering it was the first week)

HEEEUUUGE props to this place. They serve nothing but Colorado craft beers. When I drink beer, I don&#39;t want one or 2 large beers, I want to try a little bit of everything. And that&#39;s what I did here. PS, bring a designated driver. 

Colorado, in my humble opinion, is the best state in the union for craft beer brewing. Exhibit A: 2 penguins. A fantastic selection of unique beers and a wide assortment. Want something light and lagery? They got it. Want a stout so dark it blocks out the sun? They got it. Want an IPA so hoppy it tears the enamel of your teeth? They got it!

We had the basket of chips for $1, I am telling you, you cannot spend a better dollar. Freshly made and crisp. Our niece had the kids mac and cheese, and we nibbled a bit. My wife and brother had the onion ring and swore by it. 

We hung out out back and played cornhole and the large Jenga well after we had finished drinking and eating and just had a great day with no one pressuring us to pay the bill and get out. 

One of the most fun days we have had in a while.

it&#39;s a summer Friday (look at the date) been here for about an hour, the patio is relatively empty and I just wanted a couple of beers, enjoy the heat wave, in the shade of course, and read my book a bit. don&#39;t judge me you don&#39;t know me. 

so I had a red beer off of the servers recommendation and it was tasty, not crazy to make me go all in but worth it nonetheless. then ordered four 4oz. two of four were worth getting larger glasses one worth a single glass and one I would pass on. 

after looking at the menu also ordered the double BLT. between this and the turkey sandwich I ask and the server said the turkey was great but he has had the BLT for a week solid. Sold I said. 

a BLT is pretty simple and really hard to go wrong. it wasn&#39;t crazy but the bacon, and I really should capitalize bacon because there was a massive amount. it wasn&#39;t just the quantity but it was crispy and sandwich perfect. definitely give it a shot. 

the beers on tap, of which I had 6 picked by descriptions were tasty and service was friendly, responsive and really just had myself a great little relaxing afternoon."

 I walked in and was surprised at how big this place is and it has an awesome patio! Immediately I noticed that the staff was hard to tell apart from the customers, because they just wear whatever they want. There were a couple of servers with baggy pants and towels hanging out the back pockets and some with dry dock shirts, the rest of them blended in with the customers like secret agents. We ordered several options off of the menu, including the chips, fries, hummus app, nachos, fried chicken etc. Let me tell you: they were all horrendous, bland, frozen and most likely out of a bag. The nachos in particular were left untouched, the queso on top was SOUR indicating that it was OLD OLD OLD! I&#39;m sure some of it was mental when I felt sick immediately, however - it was confirmed by my vomiting the next day that I and my girlfriend had in fact ingested bad food. On a separate note, the service was also very VERY slow, I mean: it took over 30 minutes for our order to be taken and believe me, I wish I was exaggerating. Out of the many other things we ordered, 2 of them never came out but we still payed for them because everyone was just ready to get the heck out of there.

My end thoughts: another place with great potential, but poor execution. Nothing on the menu we had was proprietary to the restaurant&#39;s image, or demonstrated a unique craft. I would be surprised if there is even a chef involved here.

I know this review was harsh, but the ball was dropped through the floor."

Finally did for Happy Hour this past Friday, which is apparently the time that everyone else comes. 

A friend and I walked in to the packed restaurant and weren&#39;t sure what to do with ourselves. There wasn&#39;t a hostess and so we just filed in and looked around. We ran in to the GM, who was very kind and offered to put our names on a list for a table, with a wait time of 20-30 minutes. We confirmed we could sit on the patio, but learned there was no table service out there. Aok as it was empty and inside was packed.

Only two bartenders were working and the seating all around the bar makes it tricky to place an order. We snagged a bartender and I ordered the Colorado Glider Cider and my friend had a tropical Epic brewery special that was recommended. Even with $1 off for happy hour, my drink was $6 and my friend&#39;s was $7. We ordered fancier local options so that&#39;s understood, but still higher than what we were expecting.

Convenient location as it is super close to where I am working! I&#39;ve been wanting to try it out for a few months now, and yesterday was the day. The place is beautiful. Very spacious and well designed. If it were nicer outside, we&#39;d have opted to sit out in the seating area outdoors. 

The food was okay..nothing to really write home about. I had wings and fries. Me being the wing snob that I am..I wasn&#39;t excited bout my choice. The flavor was good, I had a whiskey bbq flavor, but they really needed to be more crispy. The fries I had also needed to be more crispy as I am not a fan at all of limpy fries. Kiddo had mac n cheese &amp; fruit which looked good. My brother in law had the fish n chips. He just said &#34;it was okay, too much breading&#34;. And the hubs had pulled pork which he said was kind of dry. 

The drinks were yummy though. 36 different CO beer on tap?! yes please! I tried this raspberry flavored beer and it was delicious.a nice and mild brew. The hubby had Dads n Dudes Dank which he always loves. Next time if we come back, we&#39;ll be more adventurous on the drinks!"

It&#39;s close to our house and it would be awesome if it was decent, but it wasn&#39;t. We ordered a margarita pizza, boneless buffalo wings and green chili fries. 

The pizza was about on par with Chuck E Cheese but more expensive. It was in NO way a margarita pizza... It was a crappy cheese pizza. The boneless wings came out cold. We sent them back and they came back warm(er) but we lost our celery and carrots. The pizza and wings weren&#39;t nearly enough food for two barely hungry people so we ordered the green chili fries. This was the most maddening part. The chili was ok, but there was WAY too much and it was hard to find the fries. They had a roasted jalapeño on the plate, but it was COLD! Seriously?! COLD?! Microwave, flat grill while you&#39;re deep frying the Cisco fries. Jesus... The only good thing we ate was half assed. Drinks were fine, but not out of this world and regular priced.

We went during opening week, and had a great time. Beer was great, food was great, servers/mangers/bartenders were very attentive.

We then went back three more times within a two month period...and it went downhill fairly quickly. The food was lackluster and while we had spoken to the manager many times at the bar, we came back with friends and while we were eating we saw him make his way to say hello to every single table...but ours. Not sure if it was intentional...but we felt a bit slighted. Especially as the service was not as good, nor was the food.

There were four of us at our table, and the server took three of our drink orders and didn&#39;t ask the fourth person what he would like.

We decided to sit at the bar and patiently wait for the bartender to finish chatting with the other couple that was in the middle of a couple beers and burgers. 
When she finally greeted us I ordered a wine and my fiance got a rum &amp; diet. We looked over the menu and were so happy to see that they served calamari, as we always order them whenever we see them on a menu. After a few minutes the Calamari came out and it looked ok. But after the first bite, we looked at each other and he asked me &#39;are they serious?&#39; 

The calamari were greasy and so old (at least that&#39;s the way they seemed) that one of the tentacles broke off...like a freaking potato chip. They had no taste. NO TASTE!!?? We ate nothing past our first bite, finished our drinks and asked for the bill. 
The bartender brought us our bill, looked at the full dish of calamari and did not ask one freeeeaking question! 

-Was there something wrong?
-Is everything ok?
-Wow you must have come in super full...did you want a doggy bag??

I mean she had no idea why we basically didn&#39;t touch the food, and she didn&#39;t even bother to ask. She dropped the check and swooped the platter away. We left vowing not to go back again.

So when we went back (lol) about a month later, we decided that we were just going to have a couple drinks. NO FOOD. 
It was a Saturday afternoon, and once again, including us there was a whopping 4 people in the whole place. How are they paying the bills?. This bar is freaking huge and I never see any customers!!
Anyway, we sat at the bar again, there was a different bartender, we ordered a couple drinks and left out of sheer boredom. Talking among ourselves was fine...but you know, when you go out you expect to maybe interact with other human beings...people watch, whatever. 

There was no one to mingle with and there were no people to watch!

:( 

About a month ago, we thought it over and decided to give them one last chance. We went and sat at a high top this time. We ordered a couple drinks and decided to get an order of their fries. Lo and behold the fries were very good :), but the waitress was not. After she gave us our first order of drinks and brought out the fries, we really didn&#39;t interact with her again. We literally had to wave our arms to get her to come over, but after she noticed us waving like a couple of imbeciles, she made a special trip to print our check before coming over...and presented it to us with not so much as half of a smile. She did say &#39;thanks&#39; as she dropped the check though...

But no...we weren&#39;t done. My guy just wanted another beer.

I seriously have no clue how this place has such positive reviews. Maybe Saturdays is when they schedule all the people that seem to not care?? Who knows."

You can&#39;t go terribly wrong with 36 rotating taps of Colorado craft beer. However, you can go wrong with experimental home brews. I really hate to say it because I like to support up and coming brewers, but many of the home brews on tap were unfortunately mediocre or just plain unpleasant. Bad batches happen, and that&#39;s how you learn and get better, but I personally wouldn&#39;t have served some of them to the public just yet. Props to our bartender, though -- whenever we ordered a taster of a brew he knew we wouldn&#39;t like or that he could tell we didn&#39;t like, he would bring us samples of others we should try and this led to a few tasty discoveries, like Steamworks Brewing Co.&#39;s Tiramisu Stout. The green chili cheese fries hit the spot, but the margherita pizza was a bit lacking. I found it too thin and the bottom of the crust had a layer of raw flour. I still give them 4 stars, though, because I came and probably will come back for the beers, not the food."

We were impressed at their extensive use of local foods and beers. Local doesn&#39;t ALWAYS mean better, but in this case it definitely did! Our burgers were quite tasty and the fries good enough that we didn&#39;t leave a single one on our plates... And that&#39;s not even mentioning the beer. 

For a place as new as this, they had an extraordinary selection of local beers, and all of them were on tap. The beer menu was separated by type (very handy) and all were offered as 4 oz tasters in addition to 10-16 oz pours. We tried about 8 of them, some at the advice of our lovely and enthusiastic server Mal, and each had our favorites. Some to try: The Grist Brewing Berlinner Weisse with the raspberry syrup, which sounds weird but is delicious, or the Former Future Brewing Company&#39;s Golden Feather if you like sour beers. If not, don&#39;t worry...There are 20+ more! 

They even have a hard cider on tap for those of you who are gluten-intolerant...

The patio is sure to be a winner, and I learned there is even more to the place behind the sliding wall on the north side.

One thing I REALLY liked is the low-key approach to TV screens. The last thing we need in the &#39;hood is another sports bar, and this is not formatted to be that. This is a place where you can enjoy some native brew and good conversation with those around you -basically what a Tap and Grille should be.

I was immediately greeted and the staff was friendly and informative regarding all the craft beer and food options (most other reviewers have covered this). I ordered the burger with a side of chili and both were superb.

Arapahoe Road has been long overdue for a new place (well, unless you like 2-story mega complexes) and Two Penguins is a hugely welcome addition. There is no question word is going to get around and this place will be very busy during all seasons."

First of all, and kind of random, t smells really good! I love that they pride themselves on only having colorado beer, I had the pikes peak devil head red which I had never had before and was excellent. The beer list however was mis printed and said you would get 16oz for $6 (happy hour is $1 off) and when I got my beer it was in a ten ounce glass. I inquired with the bartender who gave me another beer at no charge! For other companies reading this, that is how you get five stars, excellent customer service. Not that I was mad about the mis-print in the first place. We also ordered the spinach dip which was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. We sat at the bar and even though there was not an empty seat our bartender was fast and friendly. I will definitely be returning with more friends and family, just hope they open for lunch soon."

The last experience was pretty bad. We usually order the large salad, but it is clear that they have drastically reduced the portion and the toppings were microscopic. Not to mention my chicken was over cooked and my wife&#39;s salmon was raw. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."

We tried the homemade chips, chicken sandwich &amp; fish/chips.  The chips were okay, the chicken was dry and not tasty, the fish and chips was okay.  The set up seems like its a school cafeteria not a restaurant.  Not sure I would ever go back as nothing stood out."

Not that it was awful, but they&#39;re definitely lacking in too many areas to pick up business (they just opened less than a year ago). The location is sort of strange, inside an industrial park, but that could work to their benefit. Inside is nice, great banquet hall, bar seating, outdoor terrace. The food was sort of overpriced. My french toast and eggs looked measly compared to my friend&#39;s breakfast burrito (almost the same price). Bottomless mimosas at $9 is a deal, but they need to add to their extremely small brunch menu. We were the first patrons there since they opened at 11 and even though they were very nice people, being the only ones in the restaurant should&#39;ve guaranteed exceptional customer service, but I sort of just felt like an afterthought. I&#39;m hoping they do well as they have a lot of potential, I may try them again sometime for lunch or dinner."

But they allow smoking where food is being served. When I asked how they get around the smoking law, the waiter said he knew it was against the law and I was welcome to complain to the three tables smoking if I wanted. Awesome. Also, we waited 30 minutes for the dessert we paid for before finally giving up and leaving. Too bad because it&#39;s a beautiful location with a great beer selection."

It looks like a great place to take your coworkers for happy hour. I love the indoor/outdoor beer gardens feel. They have beers from local breweries that are still relatively small. The beer menu is sectioned out by styles which is probably because the service wasn&#39;t very knowledgable of beer. The Dr ordered an 8 Second Kolsh 3 times before she realized he wasn&#39;t saying &#34;Give me a second&#34;. The service was good, otherwise. We had appetizers and sadly, they were all bland. The spinach dip tasted like just spinach and cream cheese. Some parm mixed in would have given it the saltiness needed. I&#39;ll be back to try the pizza next."

I would&#39;ve never seen it if it weren&#39;t for the guy in the penguin costume waiving a sign around. Glad I was able to plan a happy hour with some friends. 

To start, this place has a great beer menu. Lots of great craft brews on tap I&#39;ve never tried and some I&#39;ve never even heard of. For the average tap house that would be enough but this place decided to go above and beyond and put together a great food menu. Everyone in my group really enjoyed what they ordered. 

Along with the food and beer the atmosphere is great for large groups or just a couple friends. The service was quick and all the workers were friendly. Needless to say, I&#39;ll definitely be returning for round 2!"

The beer selection is amazing.  Every Colorado beer that has won an award in the last year is on tap.  You can get 2 oz sized beers and try lots of them.

Fish and chips were a little  overdone  and lasagna was pretty good. The burgers were average. Would like to see options for bison and other weights than 1/3 lb. Boneless wings were Ok, would opt for the traditional next time. Standard kids menu  (mac and cheese is not Kraft FYI ). The floor plan is very open with high ceilings so not super intimate. Some TVs  with sports on in the background.  The big draw is the beer selection which is one of the best in the area for local tap beers. I would come back based on the beer selection."

We arrived and they were really busy. I wanted to sit outside, but the patio was overflowing with people, so we sat inside by the bar. The beer choices are all local and the liquor is  made local.  I already loved this placed based on that.  There were too many beers to pick from, so I was going to do several 4oz pours.  The server came up and mentioned that it was supposed to be an Epic Brewing firkin Friday, but they failed to send the kegs.  So in that case, Epic was buying everyone&#39;s first beer.  The catch was, you had to pick from 4 beers. One was on my list, so I went with the Wit&#39;s End Banana Hammock. We were a little hungry, so we figured some appetizers would be enough to fill us up.  Selected the crab cakes, calamari and  onion rings. All extremely great choices, even though not great with presentation.  The calamari was my favorite. Not too chewy, and covered in a tangy batter. The server was fantastic.  He was on the ball with suggestions and never let us have an empty glass.  I need to come back to try more local brews and other tasty items on the food menu."

There was energy mixed with after work relaxation. Sadly I wasn&#39;t all that hungry so I had the hummus appetizer. Finally a restaurant got the ratio right for veggies and pita! The friend had the pulled pork sandwich which he unselfishly shared a delicious bite of. The fries were awesome too, yum! Our server was friendly, attentive and excited to serve first time customers.

Located in a former event center, the space is large, airy, and completely transformed. A huge pergola inside, reclaimed wood everywhere, and pops of burgundy accents, creates a feel of modern meets western meets country chic. Because they just opened, there are a few service bloopers that occurred (long wait for service, messed up orders, no water refills), but our waiter was incredibly empathetic and comped a part of our meal to compensate. The manager also came up to us and had a conversation, which was nice! The food is good, and the variety of beers is great.

Sometimes you get really good food and other times you get food that is not prepared as you have ordered. Tonight I ordered the salad with your choice of five toppings plus the grilled Salmon which I wanted &#34;medium-well done. My salad arrived with two of the five toppings I ordered, and my salmon was RAW! The waiter came back and asked if everything was ok...I told him three of the toppings were missing and my Salmon was raw and inedible, so I would need a box to take it home and cook it. He was very sorry and gave me my box and asked if he could give us dessert on the house. We are not dessert eaters since we like to eat healthy meals. He did give my husband a free beer...and I left furious and hungry. I don&#39;t dare send food back as you never know what will upset the chef and what will be in your food when it&#39;s returned.

I have tried them out on many occasions, and am usually disappointed.  The food isn&#39;t that great.  I usually get the BLT, because it has so much bacon and is crispy.  Sometimes the artichoke dip pizza.  I like the idea of the rotating taps, so there is always something new when I go in.  The happy hour specials aren&#39;t that great either.  But my real problem is the service.  You can go quite a while without seeing your waiter.  I waited tables and I hosted, so I get the concept of being busy, but you can still make your customers feel like they matter.  The staff here hasn&#39;t figured that out.  And last Friday was the final straw.  Several of us have already said we won&#39;t be back.  We had a going away Happy Hour for a co-worker, so there was about 20 of us there.  They did reserve us tables outside, which they say they normally don&#39;t do.  But we had the worst server that I have ever had, and I am 40.  There were several times that we had nothing to drink...not even water.  We would have to ask him multiple times for things when he did happen to come by.  One of the girls had to ask him 3 times for her bill, and he acted like each time was the first time he had heard her.  He was rude.  Him and I got into it because he wasn&#39;t around and we had no drinks plus a lot of empty glasses and dirty dishes on the table.  He told me it wasn&#39;t his only table.  No, but he had 2 others and they saw him 4 times between times that we did. Since I was a waitress, I started watching.  Inside was dead.  The patio was full, but there were at least 3 other people waiting tables.  He got real friendly when he brought us the check, since he added 19% for the tip.  There is NO WAY I would ever tip him 19%.  I understand we were a huge party, so adding a tip is the policy, but for the service we got, I would probably have gave him 19 cents.  There were people who stopped by for a drink and left, and they even said they felt like he didn&#39;t want to wait on us, and we weren&#39;t important.  I have news for him, if you don&#39;t want a big table, then ask someone to switch or tell the manager and see if they will switch the assignments.  I worked with a girl who never wanted to wait on big tables, because she was so stressed, and they always made sure she didn&#39;t have to.  I have told everyone I know at BBH and Oppenheimer about this experience since we are right across the street...I don&#39;t want them to have the same experience."

We honeymooned in Italy, and as Cinque Terre was one of the highlights of our honeymoon I was thrilled to find a place in Colorado (or anywhere in the U.S.) that specializes in Ligurian cuisine. To our delight, the pasta we had here was nearly identical to pasta we enjoyed in Cinque Terre. If you have not been to Italy, I can only say that pasta is an entirely different experience there than we are accustomed to in the U.S.  Lo Stella got everything right from the taste and texture of the pasta to the flavor and consistency of the pesto.

For our appetizer we really enjoyed the beef carpaccio on a bed of greens with baby artichokes and lemon. We tried the chocolate soufflé and Panna Cotta for dessert and loved both. My wife also really enjoyed the two cocktails she had. To top it off, we heard frequent exchanges in Italian between the staff and almost felt like we were back in Italy. I give this place my strongest recommendation!"

I came into the place thinking that it has a great ambiance and cute lighting. Come to find out I was very disappointed with the service. As a woman, I felt discriminated against and will never go back. The waiter with a pony tail was extremely rude!

Reasons why I will never go back:

1) The food was mediocre with no real flavor. I had the pasta with seafood and it was missing flavor. My boyfriend had the walnut sauce ravioli and hated it.

2) Our waiter didn&#39;t come to the table for 20 minutes and forgot to even give us water at the begging of the night (with water glasses on the table)

3) When I asked the waiter for a third time for my Pinot Grigio he glared at me and said it was coming!

4) When the owner came over at the end of the night because I asked him to, to let him know it was a little undercooked and we didn&#39;t love it, He said &#34;Because I was a woman I didn&#39;t have the right to speak up!&#34; 

Welcome to 2016 woman have rights and we have the right to speak up when things aren&#39;t going well.

This is my first and hopefully last bad review ever on yelp. I just thought it a disservice not to tell women in Denver, DO NOT GO HERE!"

Not only is it quaint, but the vibe is just right for spending time with someone special. Plenty of good stuff going on here. For a small hidden place it sure packs a big punch of personality.

The menu is fairly robust with a lot of interesting items to try. Just as you would expect from an Italian restaurant, you get all kinds of pasta and anti-pasti (they are not diametrically opposed), in addition to meat, seafood, and veggie options. There are new menu items all the time so it&#39;s best just to come in and check it out.

While the prices might seem a bit steep you definitely get what you pay for. The portions are just right - not too big and not too small. Great tastes and pretty good wine to choose from - I&#39;m a fan for sure.

I really like that you can have an intimate conversation and a table and feel totally comfortable ordering a bottle of wine. The décor is inviting and relaxing so there&#39;s no rush when you dine. Just sit back, enjoy the experience, and everything else will be taken care of."

I&#39;d say the worst part was the service without a doubt.  Our waiter, pony tail guy, was far more interested in the table close to us with the barely dressed 22ish year old.  Here&#39;s why he sucked and the reason we won&#39;t be returning:

1) We had to ask what the special was.
2) my wife asked a question about one of the dishes only to have him in a dickish way correct the word she pronounced wrong. 
3) she also asked him to pair a wine with her dish, which he did, BUT when he brought it to the table he didn&#39;t say one word.  Not a &#34;enjoy&#34; or this is &#34;fill in the blank&#34; type of wine. Nothing, he set them down and before I could ask what she was drinking, he was gone.
4) He brought our food and again, not one word. Dropped them off and was gone. I barely caught him in passing for Parm cheese 3-5 min after the food was delivered. 
5) never checked in for any part, salad, main dish, nothing. However, 22ish year old girl, oh he checked in with her every time he passed. 
6) Upon completing our main dish, we had to ask for the desert menu. Again, filled with arrogance he responded. 

In my opinion as advice to the owners and management: 
In today&#39;s world that&#39;s fueled by reviews, you need to stress to your staff the NEED for relational and personal service.  The reason we keep going to places like Root Down, Shells and Sauce and Lola is because the staff takes the extra couple minutes to make you feel welcome.  We never once felt that at Lo Stella!  Lastly I feel no need to share any part about the food because in our humble opinion if the service sucks the food doesn&#39;t matter."

They have a large by the bottle wine menu and a few beer taps. Their by the glass menu is small but the montepulciano d&#39;abruzzo was excellent. 
We started with the burrata and prosciutto which was fresh and great. We continued with the tagliatelle bolognese and the wild herb ravioli in walnut sauce. Both were excellent - though I feel the ravioli could I have benefited from a touch of black pepper. It still was quite good!

The place was very clean, organized, as well as providing a very calm/romantic setting. It&#39;s great for people on dates! Our waiter was amazing as well, props to the waitress who served us on 10/11/16. Our food was brought out on a timely manner. She checked up on us regularly as well. The only problem I had here was the price. I understand the I ingredients are most likely higher quality, thus the price. It wasn&#39;t the most breath taking food, but within it you could taste the rich flavors. The spaghetti sauce &#34;my grandpa&#39;s sauce&#34; contained the best spaghetti sauce I ever had. But My father ordered the &#34;seafood ravioli&#34; (with three fish) and the proportions were too small for him. Perhaps a warning would be nice, but it&#39;s a good thing it was super delicious! I would go back to this place, but with just one person or alone. Couples would enjoy this place for sure though."

I&#39;ve been going to Lo Stella since July.  I&#39;ve gotten to know not only the food but the staff. Both truly exceptional. It was this evening when faced with going somewhere else I had to trump all other offers and come to Lo Stella.   

After being greeted like long lost family members, we proceeded to have one of the best dinners ever.   Caprase , Muscles, Pasta. Then on to the DCAP symphony, or we would have stayed for dessert.

However, I think we like LoStella&#39;s even better. 

In an out of the way neighborhood, the first thing I like is the easy parking. But that&#39;s not why we go there.

When you walk in, the place will remind you, if you&#39;ve ever spent time there, of a homestyle European family restaurant. While the atmosphere is comfortable and modern, you still get that sense that mama is going to come walking out of the kitchen with a big wooden spoon in her hand, yelling at somebody to get off their ass and work. 

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and half of them speak Italian. Probably for some of them, their Italian is better than their English.  :-) But in my book, that&#39;s a great sign!

My wife and I have had a number of different dishes here, and we&#39;ve been very happy with all of them. The wine selection isn&#39;t extensive, but it&#39;s very good, and the desserts are to die for. The tiramisu in particular is a favorite of mine...

Yes, this has become a new favorite with an old feel. I don&#39;t see anything changing that anytime soon - always fantastic to find a new fave!!"

The family has been in the restaurant business for many generations &amp; they pride themselves in their authentic Italian restaurant experience. You are not permitted to substitute anything in any of the dishes (for instance you cannot ask for &#34;no cheese&#34; if the dish claims to have cheese in it). I am assuming that they have the pasta dishes pre-made and ready to serve. I had the fish ravioli pasta dish that was perfect in flavor, portion size, texture &amp; presentation. The ravioli didn&#39;t have a &#34;fishy&#34; flavor &amp; the ingredients tasted fresh. The bread they give @ the beginning as an appetizer was different. I didn&#39;t care for it too much. On top of the bread basket were square chunks of salty (cheese) bread with olive oil while the bottom of the basket had plain white bread. I had a Amaretto &amp; seltzer cocktail here that was delicious but small. I really enjoyed the ambience here &amp; the menu items (carpaccio, frutti di mare) but our waiter was really impatient with our table and made some obvious remarks about his annoyance. It was understandable that he was annoyed because we had group members come late but it made for an awkward dining experience. 

I have been to Italty &amp; can appreciate the authenticity of the ingredients &amp; recipes. I like the simpler/fresher sauces (not overly done in cream/salt, etc) &amp; the scope of menu items.You can order food online for pick-up. Reservations can also be made online. 

I wouldn&#39;t mind coming here again. I am assuming that our waiter would have been kinder if my group came exactly on time &amp; if we ordered in a straight-forward (exactly as the menu reads) fashion. So tip: do not ask to substitute anything &amp; do not ask to add anything to a dish (Ex: chicken, mushroom, etc.). They like their dishes the way they prepared them &amp; expect for you to appreciate/respect their taste/judgment."

What bugged me the most was the prices. Lo Stella obviously does not care about their customers overcharging for below mediocre food. The ambiance is nice. The service is fine. But the best thing about Lo Stellas food? The complimentary bread.

A glass of the house red and white kicked the meal off with memories of being back in Italy. The prix fixe option is a particularly good value for high quality food.  The salami, prosciutto, and blue cheese on the meat and cheese antipasti were especially delicious and the focaccia was a new twist than we&#39;ve seen before. 

The beef tagliata was a generous portion and cooked well.  Under $30 for essentially a nicely done steak and a side of porcini mushrooms is pretty good in my book.  The wife got the herb filled hand made ravioli in a rich, but not overpowering, cream based sauce.  We were too full to do dessert this time, but we&#39;ll be back to try the other savory and sweet items and recommend you do the same.

Btw, I thought the lighting was fine having seen both bright and dim lighting used in fine dining establishments. This place actually feels casual, but could easily feel sophisticated enough for a business dinner as well. Give this very authentic Italian new kid on the block a try!"

Really brought back some nice memories.  I have always liked this restaurant space. Wish someone would land and stay put.  Good luck to the owners.  Tiny bit of advice though.  There is obvious tension between management and staff.  Customers notice that.  It&#39;s kind of like being in the room when mom and dad are fighting and they don&#39;t think others are tuned in.

They are very new, so I offer two pieces of constructive criticism: get better bread-either make your own or find another supplier.  The generic squishy white stuff you are serving now is not up to the standard of the rest of the food.  Also, turn off CNN during dinner service on the big TVs.  It is distracting and unpleasant.

Lo Stella is supposedly the American branch of a real Italian family owned restaurant in Portofino Italy.    The pastas and the pasta sauces certainly lend some credibility to this claim, as the pastas were handmade (at the least the tagliatelle, the ravioli and the trenette were) and the sauces had the authentic taste of northern Italy. My daughter had the bolognese which she pronounced as the best in Denver, which is high praise coming from her.    I had the &#34;grandfather&#39;s special&#34;  marinara sauce, which was simple and delicious, with a perfectly cooked al dente spaghetti.   Some issues with the food, as my wife&#39;s shell fish was undercooked in her pasta.  The seafood and potato salad was delicious while the mozzarella and tomato salad was nothing special, especially with a hard, unripe grocery store tomato.  And their pricing is a little off; the pasta was a bit too light to be a full entree, but too expensive to be a primi first course.  I think they are sort of straddling the middle, unsure which direction to go, where the secundi entrees are pretty expensive so they come with sides.  They should scale back the secundi and lower the price of it as well, but make clear that the menu is designed so most people will want to order both.  I asked our waitress specifically,and she said the pasta was entree-sized, which discouraged me from ordering anything else.   And it&#39;s not fancy or special enough to support the same prices as places like Panzano or Barolo Grill.   As some people pointed out, the widescreen TVs are on over the bar. The place was pretty quiet, which I kinda like, but some patrons felt comfortable sitting with laptops open at their table.  Lo Stella has to decide which direction to take--if casual, lower the prices and increase the pasta portions.  If fine-dining, take away the TVs and rationlize the prices and portion sizes to implement that primi secundi menu."

Atmosphere was good - TV&#39;s had european sports and basketball on w/no volume, which was fine.

OK: sat at the bar.  while bartender was friendly she disappeared for long (5-10 min) duration of time. We sat for a long time with empty wine glasses.  Pasta dish was a bit bland even with the pasta prepared and cooked well.

Bad: chicken dish while tasty was not fully cooked (one end where the breast meat was thickest).  We were offered a new plate but the dish was largely finished and another full plate would have been a waste.  A discount was given though only 50% of the dish.  It should have been 100% as uncooked chicken can make you sick.

Some tables had bread and when we asked our waitress for some, she said she thought they were out, but she never returned to confirm.  The food tasted just okay (very oily eggplant parmesan) but the portion was very small and the presentation weak.  A giant plate of homogeny - no garnish, no side of pasta, nothing.  Boring.  The owner was asking other diners if they wanted fresh parmesan and how they liked their dining experience.  We were not included in his rounds and we were essentially ignored by all staff.

The place is incredibly overpriced. I got the special chicken entrée which was something like $19-21. It was literally, a pounded out piece of battered chicken breast, served with dry baby greens and a lemon wedge, shouldn&#39;t have been priced more than 10. Their menu is in the traditional primi/secondi style but if they expect folks to order primi and secondi, they better lower the prices because what they offer is a complete rip-off. Someone in the group had the 29. filet mignon. The meat was good, the balsamic sauce was good but maybe a little burnt-tasting, and then it came with maybe half a cup of roasted potatoes that tasted like they hadn&#39;t been salted. For a group of five it was over 200. and we left still hungry. I know restaurants in Italy are known for ripping off Americans but it&#39;s pretty brazen to try to rip off Americans in America. Totally NOT worth it. Not only were the portions too small, but they weren&#39;t delicious. And an obvious sign of an arrogant chef is when there are no salt and pepper shakers on the table, &#34;because everything is seasoned perfectly&#34;, but it wasn&#39;t. The chicken was one of the most bland things I have ever had, I felt fortunate for the lemon wedge. The grilled vegetable appetizer was 13., I think and it had three or four sliced vegetables on it ( a tomato, some endive, some zucchini and eggplant maybe).  The bread that came to the table was stale. The lady fingers in the Tiramisu had stale, hard ends which is unusual considering they should be dipped in espresso before being put into the dessert. Sorry to tear the place apart but the prices were appalling for what they served and I left feeling like we had been ripped off. The few items worth having were the mussel/clam appetizer, the pizza (which was reasonably priced), and the chocolate soufflé. They have only been open for a few weeks but they boast about having other restaurants in Italy. They need to get it together or they aren&#39;t going to last here because no one will be back after such a disappointing experience that costs so much. If the prices were about 30-40% less than you wouldn&#39;t expect so much and the bland food and tiny portions would have been less offensive, but combined with being over-priced, it was just too much."

Much to our pleasure (and no less surprise), this place was open late into the evening! The inside of the store itself is not that impressive (somewhat dark and dingy), but the selection was pan was fantastic. We of course picked up a few pieces of our old favorites (conchas, marranos, and empanadas) in addition a few new things we had never tried. The palmera was unbelievably buttery, flaky, and and crispy. We also tried cajetas (caramel empanadas), which were AMAZING. We grabbed nearly a dozen pan dulces for only a few dollars.

We rarely go out and we mostly eat vegetarian,  but decided to splurge and have a good steak. Service was very slow. It took them a long time to acknowledge us at the table, although we were seated quickly. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, which makes the sloooooow service throughout our dinner all the more puzzling. 
On the plus side, our server was pleasant and tried to make everything right.

On the downside: The roasted broccoli was ice cold on the inside. The baked sweet potato was barely warm, the butter wouldn&#39;t even melt. They told us they were out of baked potatoes, but then midway through the meal (after not bringing the substitute mashed potatoes) &#34;found&#34; one. We also overheard that they were out of mac&amp;cheese (on a Friday night?!) There was a small hair on my plate. The steak itself was cooked properly and tasted fine, but had a lot of fat and gristle. Their forks are gigantic and awkward and unpleasant to eat with - unless perhaps you are a linebacker or a teenage boy. I was offered a plastic fork instead,  but then she forgot to bring it. After asking her to bring the bill right away,  there was an interminable wait. I just went and sat in the car while my husband dealt with it. All in all a pretty bad experience;  we would definitely never go back!"

Many tables empty but not cleared or cleaned. Out of things like carrots, baked potatoes and sweet potatoes per the waitress. Plate came with an undercooked sweet potato and. Ton out plates had veggies that smelled of burnt plastic. Rib eye was not the usual... definitely not on their A game tonight and spending $89-100 for date night for sub par food is a major let down.

Unfortunately I have to say on Wednesday night though the steak filet had much to lack. No flavor and burnt on top for a medium rare steak.  Hate to give bad reviews but hoping they step it up on that for the future.  The sliders were good along with the gumbo though. So overall normally they get a 4 star on other plates we have ordered like the pot roast or meatloaf.

However it only gets three starts because they are always out of everything!!!  I know that being out of prime rib happens at a lot of places, but it always happens here. Tonight they actually had prime rib but they were out of chili, brown gravy and horseradish sauce. Last time I was here they were out of chicken and strawberry shortcake. Again, I understand that when a restaurant makes everything fresh, this happens. However, the management needs to really be better at their prep and numbers because WOW!"

We were here on a Friday night and the wait was kind of long. I think we waited about 45 minutes before we were seated? So I don&#39;t think I would come back on a Friday night unless we had a lotttttt of time to kill. 

The bison nachos were the perfect appetizer. I would definitely order it again! 
I had the Red Rock bison burger and it was pretty good.. but it wasn&#39;t flavorful enough for me.. I usually love savory burgers FULL of flavor where each bite makes me say &#34;mmmmmmmm!&#34; hahaha.. the Z-sauce in this burger is supposed to be sweet like jam?.. but I barely tasted it. I don&#39;t think I would order this burger again. 

I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back to Ted&#39;s.. but if I was craving a burger.. there are many more burger joints that come to mind first.. 

But the service was super great! The manager was walking around asking everyone how the food was etc etc.. and our server was super helpful and nice. :)"

The burgers are pretty good, slightly over priced for both the beef and buffalo versions but their large selection of options for burgers attempt to make up for the price over their competition. The highlight is the roasted chicken with Sam Adams beer and cranberries. It&#39;s usually always moist and is generally a better value than the burgers.
Another highlight is the nachos, they are huge and with buffalo can be considered a meal in itself.
Before some competition moved into Southlands it had a pretty good niche covered but now it&#39;s starting to get a little over shadowed after a few years."

First off, we ordered onion rings to start and they came with this disgusting horseradish dip that made us beg for ketchup two minutes in. After that, I got my Kitchen Sink Bison Burger and my godmother got the salmon salad. The Bison was incredibly gamy and after two bites I couldn&#39;t stand anymore of it. The salmon was undercooked and the salad had bacon in it, which my godmother expressly said she did not want. 

And now I&#39;m at home sitting with one of the most upset stomachs I have ever had over TWO bites of the thing. I might be dead if I had chosen to politely choke it down.

Honestly, it was just a bunch of terribly made food by people who could care less about what they are sending out. Do yourself a favor and just make bison burgers at home."

We lived in Aurora for 32 years &amp; have eaten at Ted&#39;s occasionally for a few years. Since we don&#39;t have one where we are now, we were excited to go back to get a burger. I have to say that the hamburgers that we were served tasted old. We ordered them medium and all of us received burgers with no pink &amp; they tasted like they had been sitting in the refrigerator for awhile. There was also some lettuce in the salads that wasn&#39;t very fresh. After the meal 3 of the 4 of us had upset stomachs. We were disappointed with our meal; the service was only okay."

We came here to celebrate their arrival to Denver and were greeted by a wonderful staff.  Our waitress was so nice and helpful and really went above and beyond.  Everyone knows Ted&#39;s has the best pickles and to say my family overindulges on these would be an understatement. Our waitress probably brought us 5 rounds of pickles before our dinner came and didn&#39;t even charge us.  She gave great suggestions on the menu and wine. 

The blue creek is one of my favorite burgers.  You can&#39;t go wrong topping a burger with blue cheese and bacon.  The heavenly combination really shouldn&#39;t even be aloud here on earth... it is too sinful! This time a branched out and got the Canyon Creek.  I have never had an egg on my burger but it was pretty good. I also got a side salad which was fresh and delicious.  

My dad got a bison burger with cheddar cheese paired with onion rings the size of his face.  They looked amazing. My mom got the crab cakes.  Let me just say, Ted&#39;s outdid themselves on the crab cakes.  They aren&#39;t all bread based like most crappy crab cakes are.  These are meaty and delicious. I would get them next time. 

Overall, a great evening out.  Our waitress even let us take some pickles home.... :)"

They did a great job being attentive and making sure that everyone was satisfied with each component of the meal. Sara was our server both times and I was impressed! She is great if you need someone patient but kind and attentive to needs. 

The food is outstanding. I had the No11 burger that was great but I needed extra horseradish sauce to get that &#34;bite&#34; and both the appetizer and desert were amazing. We got the house chip and the Kalua brownie. I also have had the huckleberry margarita twice now and both times it was worth the price.

Finally, my friend spilled her drink and they used paper tole to clean  it up which was kind of awkward and really needed a mop. That&#39;s my only suggestion for safety and guest comfort to avoid a sticky floor."

I have had everything from bison burgers, to cowboy ribeye (of the cow variety) to chicken.  It is all good!  I love the fresh homemade pickles they give us to start.  Plus they have great mixed drinks (margarita is the best, they use fresh lime juice).  Also, the chips and dip should not be missed.

Twice we have been here and they have been out of Prime Rib. Once on a Friday evening, once on a Saturday afternoon.  When Prime Rib is only sold Fri-Sun, you&#39;d think they would have plenty in the oven on a constant rotation. 

Tonight, not only were they out of the Prime Rib, they were also out of Pot Roast, Cranberry Chicken, Baked Potatoes, Clam Chowder and Chocolate Chip Cookies.

Im not sure we&#39;ll be back after tonight. The service was acceptable, but the unpredictably of their menu takes a lot of the pleasure out of spending an evening at one of the &#39;finer dining&#39; establishments in the area. 

When bringing guests from out of town, I&#39;d recommend looking at any of the other restaurants in the Southlands area. There isn&#39;t much worse than promising your father Prime Rib and then having to watch him eat fish."

Time was about 18:35hrs ish.  Since it was 4th of July &#34;Weekend&#34;, and after driving around and ALL the eatery in this part of town are closed, thankfully Ted&#39;s Montana Grill is open.  Right after we enter this establishment, we choose to have the booth for our seats.  Thankfully when we arrived its &#34;before&#34; the Dinner Peak Hours.  Our server his name is Adam.

The Menu seems simple and have a variety of food to choose.  That evening, we ordered these following items :

*  Bison Nachos ($8.00)
*  Bison Meatloaf Sandwich ($11.00)
*  Salt and Pepper Trout ($16.00)

Hubs opt to have coffee ($2.50) and fountain drinks ($2.79) aka COKE for his beverages while I opt for just water.  At least our server offer refills for both the coffee and the fountain soda.

The Bison Nachos was just A-OK.  The Bison Nachos comes with Pepper Jack Cheese, Bison Chili, a &#34;Dallop&#34; of Sour Cream and fresh toppings such as Tomatoes Fresh Jalapenos and Green Scallions.  I don&#39;t really fancy the &#34;beans&#34; in the Bison Chili Nachos, though I cannot deny those Nachos are indeed addictive.

The Bison Meatloaf Sandwich with Fries were just A-OK.  The Meatloaf Sandwich comes with &#34;Thick-sliced&#34; Bison Meatloaf, melted Monterey Jack Cheese and Grilled Onions.  &#34;Barbecue-y&#34; for our taste bud.  Sufficient for Hubs that evening.  Though I cannot deny the portions were tiny for the price.

I opt to have the Salt and Pepper Trout as my Main Entrée.  It was just A-OK.  At least the fish was cooked properly.  The Salt and Pepper Trout was grilled in olive oil, lightly seasoned with fresh lemon and salt and pepper.  It was topped with corn and tomato salsa.  I also opt to have my main Entrée to be served with roasted asparagus and vine-ripened tomatoes.  I ask for tartar sauce as well as fresh jalapeno on the side for my Dinner.  It was an Adequate aka Sufficient Dinner to fill us up though I cannot deny with the smaller portions but NOT SO with the Pricing.

*Sigh*

The service was prompt and efficient.  The food came out fast.  Left this establishment at about 19:30hrs ish.

Every time I come here the place is empty. I am not sure how they are staying in business. Today was the same, only one or two people in the restaurant on a weekend. Started off with the chips. Today the chips were extremely greasy and ice cold. There were several stacks of at least and inch and a half of stuck together potatoes soft and cold in the middle. I also ordered a Moscow Mule. Here they make it with gin, but I asked for a substitution of vodka. When the waitress came back we asked to see the manager about the chips. Without even acknowledging us, the manager brought a new basket of chips. When I tried to tell him the problem with the chips he said &#34;well, they were made fresh this morning.&#34; Had I known they don&#39;t make things to order I would not have ordered them in the first place but anyway... When the manager was there the mule came and it was made with gin. We said, you know what, maybe we will just go. And the manager said, &#34;Ok, bye. Thanks for stopping in&#34; Nothing else. He didn&#39;t seem to care at all what was wrong with our food. After this experience I am not at all surprised that the place is always empty. Good luck Ted&#39;s."

The burger was cooked exactly right and was both juicy and well-done, which it seems no one else can ever actually do Bacon was thick and crispy and the fries were almost perfect, too (could have used a little bit of seasoning).

Service was good as always, and even though the prices are high, they&#39;re no higher than OC just down the row."

Holly, our waitress, made our experience even better! The food was delicious. I highly recommend the Bison pot roast with garlic mashed potatoes and Parmesan crusted broccoli. My husband ordered the Bison filet, fries and Parmesan crusted broccoli and enjoyed every bite. There&#39;s cool little touches and details at this restaurant that I really appreciated. We just moved to the area and we already know we will definitely be coming back to Ted&#39;s. So delicious!!"

Things went down hill slowly from there. The place was not very busy on this Thursday night and staffing didn&#39;t seem to be an issue.
 
1) Our waiter was slow to get our order just for drinks....plus one lime for a large bottle of San Pellagrino??? really? Plus it was 5.95, come on its fizzy water, not a brewed beer. 
 
2) A $17.00 Bison burger and fries was nothing better than the 9.00 bar burger and fries I shared with my husband last weekend. This is basically over priced bar food in a nicer bar. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  

3) When one of your main menu items is burgers and fries as a waiter/waitress wouldn&#39;t you ask if condiments are needed at the time of ordering? That way you can be prepared by having such condiments on the table when the meal arrived. He asked after our burgers arrived if we wanted anything. Then proceeded to wait on other tables and come back later with condiments for our burgers. 

With this poor experience including, overpriced bar food, over priced water and poor service, we will not be back. The atmosphere is not enough to make this place even a second chance kind of place."

The left side of brain told us to try something totally different and we were glad to step into this place.
It was start of busy night and put our names on the wait list and sat at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly and made us feel like we been coming her for years.  Well, the truth was that it was our very 1st time. We have been coming to this area ever since it opened and was never compelled to visit this place.  Well, we thought it was up scale steak place and we are not really into that too often.  

While sitting at the bar, we could see the cooks working on burgers.  they just scoop out the ground beef, weigh it and make a pattie and season and put in on the grill and put a cover..  appeared they were selling lot of burgers..

We sat down on the booth.. the service was immaculate, atmosphere was great, food was good.  I had bison meatloaf and ..  it was first time i think.. and was so so.. kinda on dry side.. and meat was very soft.. no texture feeling..  the sides were good.. the pickles that was served at the beginning was interesting..  i should went for the burger..  

oh well.. there is always next time!

My filet was just ok. About as good as Texas Road House.  My husbands Bison Ribeye had good flavor, but just ok.  The dessert a fudge brownie came out cold hard as a rock with unmelted fudge we could not pour out on to the dessert.  We sent it back.

I sat at the bar and was delighted by the freindly and fast servce and enjoyed the open kitchen where we watched everyones food made to order.  On thing I noticed was that everyone who worked there was watching each other making sure all the food and drinks xame out right.  No short cuts here.  
Price was a little high. $17 burgers and $5.5 micro brews.  This was ok due high quality of the fare.  I have spent $14 on a crap burger.  A happy hour would be nice.  All and all Teds at the southlands is were to go if you want great traditional American fair."

My parents and I came in before going to a movie at Southlands, and from the server to the manager it was a horrific experience. Maybe we should have taken the empty restaurant at 630 on a Sunday as a sign... But we wanted steaks. Let&#39;s start with the fact our server brought drinks, took orders and then checked on us once and never came back. So our drinks our empty someone drops off salads and we have to ask them to refill our drinks... Again the restaurant is empty so where she kept going is beyond me. Our salads have barley any dressing my dad has to get up and chase around someone to get us more dressing ... Oh and he has to sit there wait for the dressing to bring it back???? Really? No customer service!!!! So we get our steaks, first bite ok server ask... Never comes back as I cut into it more I notice it is rare! We are talking mooing .... I wait for her to come back and only once we have all pilled meat one plate does she return. We tell her how awful it was and not properly cooked and she goes ok I&#39;ll tell a manager. Well flipping great! We&#39;ve enjoyed none of our meals and have been waiting on you to come grace us with your presence. The manager comes takes one steak off and makes excuses for our server because she is new! I&#39;m sorry we should suffer because she&#39;s new??? Train more thorough because that excuse was ridiculous!!!! I&#39;m not paying $30 a person for the worst dinning experience! Not once was the apology from manager genuine or was she concerned if we would be returning. She was very unprofessional and I&#39;ve decided to write this in hopes a GM reads this since everytime I&#39;ve called I&#39;ve been unable to seem to reach them! Im here to tell you we will not be returning ever! And we&#39;ve warned off friends who ask for a recommendation  in Southlands area!!!! Terrible experience!"

Phenomenal food, with our favorite Buffalo prepared exactly the way we like it, and a wonderful large crab cake appetizer for our celebration of my husband&#39;s retirement were such a treat! The sides...garlic mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus and complimentary fresh refrigerator pickles were out of this world!  Our waitress, Daniela, was always right on it when we needed anything, and gave superb service all night long.  I recommend that everyone to go there to celebrate anything...even an evening out for no reason!  It&#39;s so well worth the prices and quality of the fantastic food.  Call first or go early and your wait might be a lot less.  We had no wait at all at 5:30 p.m.

Interestingly enough we always have great waiters (not pretending and seriously taking care of business) no matter if it&#39;s packed or not - very knowledgable and thoughtful. E.g. yesterday I order my burger (Montana breakfast burger) and asked to have it cut in half ... no big deal but a different waiter served it and it was uncut ... our waiter showed up later and excused the situation (at that time I&#39;ve done it myself) where in other places it would not be noticed at all...

We even had fish dishes here and they were pretty good - I know you dont go to a meat place eating fish but we tried it and it was delicious. The only thing on the menu I didn&#39;t really like that much so far are the Bison Nachos - kinda weak in flavor and presentation - it was missing guacamole, real amounts of Bison meat and sauce and had nearly no cheese on it - but I have to say that our waiter noticed it and brought more chili for the bottom nachos ...

Again I like the ambiente and burgers, the only thing I wish that they had a paper wrap 1/2 around the burger to keep everything under control (like Red Robin has...) but otherwise it&#39;s a great spot and great interior - I really like to come here even no lunch menu invites you and therefor I prefer coming for dinner.

Still have not been through all burgers but the kitchen sink is still my favorite!"

Their menu listed at least a couple of dozen burger (your choice of beef, chicken or bison) choices and a variety of salads and entree&#39;s. There was a good variety. (Sorry I can&#39;t expound because I was too focused on the great variety of burgers they had.)

I settled for the &#34;Kitchen Sink&#34; burger....bacon, fried egg, ham, cheese, beef patty and the usual garnishments on the side. I am pretty sure I left something out. Anyway, it came and it was huge! I could barely wrap my mouth around it to take a bite, but when I did it was worth it. Juicy and full of flavor.

Their fries were very good, thin and crispy with just the right amount of seasoning. It was also the first time I have ever been served home-made dill pickle slices for pre-meal gnoshing...very good.

I had the knife and fork chili cheese burger, and not only was the concept great, but it looked really appetizing when it arrived.  One SUPER nice touch about Ted&#39;s is that they serve pickles as pre-meal snack instead of bread... that was a super enjoyable way to munch and chat without stuffing my face full of carbs.  Good call!  The burger itself was good, but cooked (if I can use that word) WAY too rare -- I ordered medium rare and this sucker was cold and pretty much raw inside.  However, I actually prefer rare vs. overcooked, so I didn&#39;t send it back.  That was the only knock on the place except for the price of the burger:  $15.  I will be totally honest, the price:value ratio is very important for me at a restaurant -- I&#39;m not a cheapskate (I don&#39;t mind paying quite a bit for a great meal), but I&#39;m not the kind of guy that enjoys paying $4/gallon for gas when I can drive 500 feet up the road and buy it for $3/gallon.  Same with burgers -- if you&#39;re serving up a $15 burger, it better be spot-on otherwise, I can roll a half mile up the street and get something similar for $8.  The Ted&#39;s burger I had wasn&#39;t a $15 burger, but it was close enough that I still had a really enjoyable meal.  Will I give Ted&#39;s another shot -- absolutely!  The menu is creative, and the rest of my experience was top notch."

Dunno why.  I just naturally associated it with other chain restaurants which were decidedly mediocre.  However, our dining experience was a good one, so color me surprised.

I had a bison burger with mushrooms, caramelized onions and Monterey Jack cheese on a wheat bun and a baked sweet potato while my husband had the bison meatloaf.  The burger and the meatloaf had a very robust, savory meaty flavor.  The meatloaf was a bit sweeter because of the glaze they topped it with.  The squash casserole that came as the side with the meatloaf was pretty good.  It was nicely cooked, and the breadcrumb topping was a nice touch.  Best of all, nothing was overly salty.

Oh, and they have cool straws made from recycled paper.  Why don&#39;t more restaurants have these?

Our server was super chipper, and at the end of the meal, I told my husbad, &#34;She reminds me of someone, but I can&#39;t put my finger on it...&#34;

&#34;Jaime Pressly,&#34; he said.

&#34;THAT&#39;S IT!&#34; I said, probably a little too loudly since my exclamation made the bar patrons glance back at our booth.

To summarize, a good meal and a celebrity look-a-like waitress."

The hostess was courteous and friendly, as was the waitress. Ambient noise was at a reasonable level, and our booth was cozy and clean. 

We had the bison short ribs (special of the night) and bison meatloaf. Both dishes were excellent; it was my first time trying bison and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, our drinks arrived after our meal (including water); however in the defense of our waitress, our food arrived at our table no more than five minutes after we ordered. For as busy as the place was (and considering it was New Year&#39;s Eve), I did not expect such a quick turnaround on our food. 

Waitress was very attentive without being intrusive. 

While normally not a dessert person, we shared the apple crisp with ice cream. The waitress (who I wish I could remember her name) advised that it was a dessert that could be shared and she was correct. A family of four could&#39;ve shared that dessert and be satisfied. It too, was delicious. 

The bill was very reasonable, and they gave us a 15% military discount. We did not know they offered a military discount, and while I did not present my retired military ID, I am guessing because I used an USAA debit card, they correctly assumed I was affiliated with the military. 

I recommend this restaurant at this location and will definitely return. Would give 4.5 stars, if I could."

My same server that I&#39;ve had the last 4-5 visits here, (Rachel) was training a new gi and was obviously put out by this and it showed! Eye rolling and very unapologetic when the food took 40+ minutes to arrive and we asked for refills. You&#39;d think that a $95 tab and pretty usual $25 tip would help ease her training pain from us ( especially since she had a trainee helper..?) not the case. Very sad since in the past I&#39;ve called the locations GM on my 1st visit there to send such high regards on how great her level of service was! That has now been forever ruined.
Food came out, already had a bad taste in my mouth, well the entree tastes was even worse to wash it down!! Doubt I&#39;ll ever return to a Teds MG after this experience. Poor poor efforts on their part.. Would rather give my biz to Salt Grass or Outback which is sad, but true!"

After 15 minutes and no one had even said hello to us we left and went across the street to McCabes. This last time I went with my family and the hostess had us following her all over the place. She seems pretty scattered. Then the server was really nervous like she hadn&#39;t been there very long and was unsure of herself. All in all this last time was just ok. The food was terrific but due to service every time, i&#39;ll pass."

For those who don&#39;t know, patrons usually get a free, little bowl of cucumbers as they sit down. However, every so often, the waitress will say they are bringing cucumbers and it comes with the entrees or never at all.

This place is normally really awesome as far as the food goes (that&#39;s why the 3 stars instead of 1). I always order a medium rare prime rib here. However, the last time I went here (approximately a year ago), the prime rib was overcooked (dry and the color was past the usual red center). If I have to pay $21 for a 12oz prime rib, I would expect it to at least be within the rare to well done temperature range every time, not overcooked.

I have found another place that cooks medium rare prime rib properly, so I will be going there now. However, going to that place reminded me of Ted&#39;s, so I decided to post a review here now."

The homemade sweet dill pickles they served were too salty for me but others in my party loved them.  The onion rings are the best I have ever had. The perfect ratio of crispy crust to nice thick onion slice and served with a creamy horseradish sauce.  The ribeye I had was cooked to perfection and the leftover horseradish sauce was yummy on it, too!  The grilled asparagus had a funky taste (kind of like kerosene smells) so I didn&#39;t eat too much of that, but it didn&#39;t ruin the meal.

The selection of food is awesome, the prices are very reasonable (i.e. I thought this place was super-expensive for some reason) and it&#39;s great for kids.

We went early on a Friday and found it almost deserted which was great for two small kids.  They don&#39;t give crayons to kids...they give them some bendy toys that really kept the imagination of my 2.5 and 5 year-olds.  Something crayons haven&#39;t done in years.

I&#39;ve been there numerous occasions and have even taken my parents there when they&#39;ve come out for visits. I love bison meat. It&#39;s a bit leaner than beef, which I enjoy. Their burgers are huge though! I&#39;ve had the avocado bison burger and george&#39;s cadillac (with BBQ sauce, I think). I think the plain burgers are pretty darn good too. They all come with a side of hand-cut fries. Mmmm... yum! Their bison chili is delish too. Sounds like a perfect meal for a cold Denver day like today (34º this morning). 

Last time we went, we ate at the bar. It was neat watching them prepare all of the food in the open kitchen. I had a bowl of chili and a salad. I can&#39;t remember the type of salad, but it had cucumbers, tomatoes, some sort of meat (I want to say salami), and a vinaigrette dressing. There were other toppings too, but I just can&#39;t remember it. I loved it though! I would definitely order it again. Now I&#39;m craving a bison burger.

We had dinner here after a hard day of training (Darn you) and I can sure say it&#39;s well worth it.  

Walking in felt a replay of Disney&#39;s Story Teller&#39;s Cafe and a mix of Claim Jumpers. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. Music was playing - can&#39;t remember what was on - but I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t any of that yeehaw giddie up stuff that I&#39;ve been listening to on the way there. The best thing was that I was able to hear the people in front of me. Kinda hard for me to ignore folks nowadays. 

I had Salmon, and my colleague had Bison. I had a taste of it (not my first time) but it was pretty good. A little on the gamey side, but that was totally expected.

They are pretty typical with there service.  Though one man we were with said no he hadn&#39;t been there before when asked by our waitress.  This was a mistake because she went on a speech for what seemed like ten minutes about the restaurant, specials and such.  It became almost amusing.  Server was almost trying to hard that she messed up our drink order.  Brought one man water instead of tea.  Not a big deal.  So I love their house sour pickles.  Have had many different burgers they are all good.  Though I have yet to have one come out medium when ordered that way.  I tried the meatloaf  on my last visit, thinking it would be quite a helping of food based off of others restaurants I have tried it out.  It came out with just two little slivers and about a tbsp of gravy on it.  Not very impressed for a place who has lots of good ole home cooking meals.  The onion rings for an app are ok.  They breading is more homestyle than your typical ones if you like that.  Though I don&#39;t think you get much of the salt and pepper flavor they claim to be.

The first two times I had prime rib but my wife convinced me to try one of their burgers this time around.  We started off with crab cake which was delicious although a little expensive.  I ordered the beef America&#39;s Cup burger which has bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, and grilled mushrooms on it.  The waitress asked how I wanted it cooked.  My wife and I both ordered medium and the waitress wanted to make sure we were okay with some pink.

The burgers arrived after what seemed like a lengthy period of time, probably about 15 minutes.  Both of our burgers were well-done.  The biggest problem was the bun.  Both of our buns were soaked on the bottom.  I took a bite and the bottom half of the bun was burned on top and dripping wet on the bottom.  It was a horrible combination.  We agreed that Five Guys is more consistent with their burgers and also about 30% of the cost of going to Ted&#39;s.  I won&#39;t be getting another burger at Ted&#39;s."

I absolutely love good food and Ted&#39;s didn&#39;t deliver.  the service was horrible and the food just as bad....I even had to send my steak back.....it was awful.  However, given that it had only opened the month before, I thought I had better try again after it had been opened awhile. 

My hubby and I hit it again a month ago....for a late lunch before a movie.  I ordered the blue cheese something bison burger....can&#39;t remember the exact name.  It was awesome!!  It was so darned juicy and delicious!  I had trouble keeping the juicy thing together and I ate every damned bite!  It was truly a sight to behold really....I am not a big girl and the burger was definitely too large for me!  My hubby didn&#39;t even finish HIS :-)  I had the fresh squeezed lemonade too and it was awesome!

Yes, I can eat....and eat....especially when the food is superior.   It rather disappointed me the first time around but the second time was it&#39;s saving grace.  :-)

I just parked and looked for one of those Directory displays you see in every mall.  None to be found in a 3 block walk. I finally asked somebody who appeared to know the area and she kindly pointed me in the right direction.  I will say Denver residents are very friendly.

A big establishment that looks really nice inside.  Leather booths and chairs.  Cloth napkins. The whole nine yards.  A friendly staff greeting at the door.  I got there between lunch and dinner, so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all.  I was seated immediately.  Ordered the Red Rock burger medium with a side caeser salad.  The menu says it&#39;s an &#34;eggless&#34; dressing and that alarmed me a bit, but I can go with it.  When the salad comes out, it&#39;s not what I expected. First, the plate was very warm.  Right out of the dishwasher warm.  Not a good start.  The dressing is homemade, but it was just olive oil, lemon, and what appeared to be some parm cheese.  There was no anchovy to this dressing.  Also, the croutons are the cheapest croutons you can buy on the shelf at the local market.  There was also no fresh grated parm on top.  It was a disaster.  I should have stopped my order and walked out, but I figured let&#39;s give this place a second chance with the burger.  I asked for it medium which is pink in the middle.  The burger came out well done.  I called over a manager and said I would just like to walk out and I told him why and he said sorry and I left.  I would have spent about $20 in this place for a burger and salad and it was a horrible experience. 

I went across the street to McCabes and got a decent bar burger with caeser salad for less then $8."

I&#39;ve been here a few times now and usually I like to have a few appetizers. Their nachos are delicious, but I must say I&#39;m not a big fan of goopy cheese it reminds me of a crappy version of nachos at a movie theater so I was happy they explained in detail all the nacho ingredients so I could ask them to put the liquid cheese on the side. I&#39;ve been very happy with all my meals here, my boyfriend and I always have a good time here and at first were a little confused about the decor of the place it looks like a cheap-ish motel from the outside and then when you get inside they have a very nice, homey vibe that you would not expect from the exterior.

The drinks were on point as they had the right balance of alcohol, too many places are very stingy or water down their drinks these days, not Billy&#39;s.

The nachos were good, stacked high and had plenty of toppings on them, definitely not the best I&#39;ve ever had but very good nonetheless.  We also had a bowl of green chili for the table to try a little of that also.  The green chili had a little different consistency than I&#39;m used too, the flavor was good but lacked on the pork.

For my main I had the bacon and cheese stuffed burger with sweet potato fries.  No complaints here, well cooked, great flavor &amp; did I mention bacon.  The sweet potato fries were also very good.  Saw that they have brunch on weekends, will have to give that a try.

Barreling in without a reservations with 12+ people and they didn&#39;t even flinch, but instead accommodated us the best way they could - there&#39;s definitely something to say about that. 

Though I didn&#39;t indulge their margaritas looked pretty tasty, as well as the guacamole, which I did eat. A lot of it. It was a little bit of a bummer, however, to pay for chips and salsa, but for $3 it&#39;s nothing to really complain about. Just something I&#39;ve not encountered before. If anything I would return for the deliciously fresh guacamole. 

Landing on the Big Burrito salad for my entree - I was presented with a ton of flavor and color. An exciting salad indeed with tons of texture and delightful chipotle lime dressing. A salad that robust certainly warrants an entree price, but was still a cool $9! Billy&#39;s Inn is a great spot to take the fam, friends, date, or just to enjoy a marg by yourself on the patio.

First I must mention the $2 mimosas. That&#39;s very important. We also enjoyed some guac and salsa. The salsa was mild but still flavorful. The guac was not spicy, and not citrusy, but still yummy. My meal was the Mahi skillet. potatoes, veggies, nickle sized chunks of Mahi, and 2 eggs on top. I found all the flavors very complementary and the portion was probably perfect for a hungry bruncher - but more than enough for me. I reheated my leftovers the next day with a fresh egg, and it was not bad at all. the atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly. I loved that we were indoors but they opened up the windows and garage wall to enjoy the nice weather."

Met with a couple of friends here randomly one cold evening several months back.  The place was warm, inviting, and comfortable.

The beers were cheap-ish, and hit the spot after a long day at work.

The food was tasty, a bit unique, and filling.

The staff was nice, but our server was either new or nervous or both.  I&#39;m thinking both.  Might not have been a bad idea to have them shadow someone for a shift or two to catch on first.

Will probably be back at some point."

After the birth of Baby N2 Billy&#39;s was the first spot I enjoyed an adult beverage. All throughout my pregnancy I craved margaritas and so I was delighted to find and order the Billy&#39;s Coin margarita with Herradura Blanco, Cointreau, fresh squeezed lime juice and agave nectar. It was everything pregnant Tiffany hoped for. 

For food my friend and I decided to go halfsies on some serious appetizers so we split Carne Asada fries, chips/salsa/guacamole, wings (whatever), and a torta. Carne Asada fries, people! This is one of my most favorite California guilty pleasures and I&#39;m more than happy to know of a place in Denver where I can get my fix if I need it. In case you haven&#39;t heard of them, this is basically french fries topped with carne asada, nacho cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and pico. It&#39;s the stuff that (my) dreams are made of. And also, the reason I have to take spin classes.

Our service was friendly and the vibe is pretty casual. And while you may think it&#39;s a divier place from the outside, inside it&#39;s relatively well lit and clean. Like Arnold, I&#39;ll be back."

 That said, the only way Billy&#39;s Inn could improve in our view is if they gave away the food and drink for free.

 My wife and I have been in this neighborhood just a little bit longer than Billy&#39;s Inn has operated under their current ownership, and have been going there since they re-opened.
 
 A first time vistor could be forgiven for thinking the vibe and appearance are Just Another Friendly Neighborhood Tavern unless they notice the place is busy every night of the week, unlike most.
 
 After you&#39;ve had food there a few times, you realize they are something surprising.  The food quality is well above average for the prices and for the kind of place you expect it to be.  Their bartenders are pretty competent, and while they aren&#39;t trying to be a cocktail bar, they do a good job on drinks I judge very harshly, such as Bloody Marys. Good stuff.

 Next up: pie.  They have fresh-baked pies every day, and they are GOOD, too.  Fruit pies that are tart and sweet enough without being overly sweet, and crusts that are too good to have been made at altitude.

 Service?  Stellar!  I cannot recall having had anything even slightly amiss in around a decade, great attitude, and the manager (owner?) is _always_ helping his crew, checking in with regulars he recognizes to see how they&#39;re doing, getting feedback... THIS is how you manage a restaurant.

 unusually good house specialties to try:

* the fancy &#34;Boulevard&#34; (I think?) tacos

* jalopenarita (spicy margarita-like cooler with jalopena juice, 10X better than it sounds)

* the nachos.  I know, I know, but they make everything including the cheese sauce in-house as far as I can tell, it&#39;s piled with good ingredients, house-made fresh chips, and you can get things like mahi, pulled pork, steak, for toppings - honestly, I&#39;ve had a lot of nachos in a lot of taverns, and most are okay, some are meh, and very few are worth mentioning - these are really oustanding nachos!

* the burgers. Oh holy carp, the burgers.  I am not easily impressed by gourmet burgers - every bar has them.  Billy&#39;s are better than most.  The house maple-candied bacon probably helps a lot...

 As far as we&#39;re concerned, the only recipe they need for continued success is to CHANGE NOTHING.

 (okay, fewer or zero TVs would be nicer for my tastes, but I realize they&#39;ve got sports fan customers too, and it&#39;s a universal gripe of mine that many customers don&#39;t share)"

I gave Billy&#39;s 4 stars bc 5-star ratings seem like they&#39;re usually reserved for places with fancy/expensive food. Billy&#39;s isn&#39;t fancy or expensive, but in terms of a taco/burger/neighborhood hangout/bar place, Billy&#39;s is certainly a 5-star caliber establishment. 

The menu is fun AND the food is really good. Great menus are commonly accompanied by pedestrian food while places that serve great food can often have unimaginative menus. Billy&#39;s menu is awesome, fun to read, and everything on it is between good and awesome. There is so much variety, a few types of chicken wings, quite a few types of tacos, awesome and unique burgers, and the appy menu is legit (ranges from deviled eggs to outRAGEOUS nachos).

Ok, so if you enjoy a restaurant with quality food with and a kick ass menu, go to Billy&#39;s.  If you enjoy great service and a very hacienda/inn type interior, then go to Billy&#39;s.  If you love really good thick cut, maple bacon then go to Billy&#39;s.

Some of their unique menu items are the Skippy burger which is topped with peanut butter and that thick cut maple bacon.  I know, I know, peanut butter on a burger?  Trust me.  It is delicious.  Not in the mood for an awesome burger?  Try ordering their boulevard tacos with pork belly or fish.  Not in the mood for tacos? Order their chicken tortilla soup which is thick and creamy and comes with a lot of accoutrements including chiles, cheese, tortilla strips, etc.  Not in the mood for bar food?  Order the half roasted chicken.  And, above all the most awesome appetizer is their loaded nachos which they have at a great price during happy hour.  They jazz them up with green chile or steak depending on the day.

Another highlight for us is their service.  The wait staff is pretty attentive and very knowledgeable about their menu.  Most all I have spoken with have tried the various menu items and have their favorite.  

I am not a big beer drinker, but my friends tell me the beer selection is decent.  I did have a Bloody Mary and I thought it could have been better.  That was my only disappointment in the countless times I have visited Billy&#39;s.  

Try Billy&#39;s, you won&#39;t be disappointed with their food and friendly staff.  It is our neighborhood go-to spot and I think you will make it yours as well."

Even the best, is still lacking that home made, authentic green chili flavor. Sure, Chubby&#39;s is up there, Las Delicious, and a few decent little dives in town. That being said, Billy&#39;s is completely the real deal, closest to authentic, family-recipe style. Everything on the menu is pretty good.

I do remember in the not so distance past they had daily specials, but with my latest visit yesterday (06/18/15) I didn&#39;t see reference to these specials any longer.

The nachos are stellar!  Homemade chips, from-scratch cheese sauce, green onions, jalapenos, black beans, guac, sour cream, and pulled pork.  Oh god.  Too much for just 2-3 people, you&#39;ve been warned.

The tacos are bigger than street style and piled with awesome stuff, so the higher price is warranted.  The burgers are kickass and you should definitely give the Skippy (peanut butter, mayo, pepperjack and bacon) a chance at least once.  Also the tequila selection is amazing and they don&#39;t skimp in their drinks: they use herradura silver in their jalapenorita - yum.

Carly B. suggested this place when a bunch of us tried out a new spin studio on the West side of town. A bunch of us yelpers went to sweat, then came here to eat! and feast, we did.

That first time, I ordered the huevos boats. Potato skins with cheese, a poached egg, and scallions. Two of these boats rest on top of a bed of black bean puree, and there are two candied bacon strips laid on top of the puree. The only thing that could make this dish better is if they chopped up the bacon and mixed it all in (which I just do myself... but if they did it FOR me, I could start eating as soon as it hit the table). 

I&#39;ve also thoroughly enjoyed the burracho bowl. Jack scallion cheese grits at the bottom. Scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, and chorizo. Topped with a lot of crispy tortilla strips. SO GOOD. 

Buyer beware: if you make a substitution (such as, no chorizo but add avocado), you get charged. 

During brunch (weekends), $4 for a HUGE mimosa (you can sub other juices for the OJ.) $3.50 for a tasty bloody mary.

Yelp pro-tip: check in for a free delicious chicken taquito. They serve it with some black bean, cole slaw, guac, and a bit of crema fresca."

Tell me what&#39;s going on? Always recommended Billy&#39;s and live close by so always came in for dinner 2-3 times a month. Lately though the food has gotten a bit sub par.....the shortage of good restaurant staff in the metro area seems to have hit you hard? Or have Larimer and Assoc. taken your chef for one of there other many locations? 
Always loved the half roasted chicken plate but the last 3 or 4 times it has just gotten worse. Dry, lukewarm and waaay too much of the sauce, you trying to cover up something?? Did you change the recipe on the chicken tacos with your change of chef? The spices are over powering the rest of the taco.

Their tacos are delicious, the service impeccable, and their coin style margaritas out of this world. My tip - don&#39;t get multiples of the same taco; it&#39;s worth trying lots of different flavors. Crispy baja is hands-down my number one, but all of the others consistently compete for second.

If you&#39;re really hungry, start your meal with the shrimp. It never disappoints. And if you want to pretend like you&#39;re eating healthy, get the Burrito Bowl &#34;Salad&#34;."

On a recent Saturday some Yelp friends and I planned for brunch after a funtastic group workout.  Among a few suggestions, Billy&#39;s Inn won out in part due to location of where the workout was, and also their varied selection (both brunch items and regular menu).  With so many great sounding dishes, it was the obvious choice.

Despite being nearly noon on a Saturday, we called ahead and they said they could reserve the large table on the patio for us, no problem.  Even when we arrived, however, the place looked pretty empty for a brunch/lunch spot on a nice Colorado weekend morning.  Our table was already set with waters, and our server was good about coming over as our party had a staggered arrival.

For $2 you can get a small mimosa (think champagne flute filled to the top), or for $4 you can get the large mimosa (think regular wine glass almost filled to the top).  They have other brunch-type drinks, such as a Bloody Mary, a Bloody Maria (with tequila), and a Michelada with your choice of beer.  The regular drink menu is also available; The Dude ordered an orange mojito which was delightful (but also pretty pricey at $7).

The full menu and the brunch menu were available to order from, but my heart (and stomach) was set on brunch.  Billy&#39;s Inn has some of the standards: eggs benedict, Belgian waffle, strawberry cheesecake stuffed French toast (holy tacos).  In addition to these though, they&#39;ve also got some solid &#34;alternatives&#34;, such as chilaquiles, a Borracho bowl (featuring grits, scrambled eggs, crunchy tortilla strips, etc.), and the Huevos con Quesos potato boats.  Think breakfast-style potato skins.  Think zOMGyum.  Hollowed out, filled with poached eggs, and topped with queso and melted cheese, then served atop black bean puree (including two strips of bacon, if that&#39;s your style)... just typing that out makes me wish I had a plate or five sitting in front of me.

The wait for our food seemed a little lengthy, but good conversation was flowing, so that may have been the post-workout hunger talking there.  Everything was hot and delicious when it arrived, with everyone around the table ooh&#39;ing and ahh&#39;ing over each others&#39; dishes.  All reports on food were positive.  And truly, those breakfast potato boats were deeee-lish.

Our server was great about splitting the check, though a heads-up they can only split it eight ways.  The very fact that they attempted without so much as an eye-roll or sigh (as I&#39;ve experienced elsewhere) was solid.  Luckily the remaining payer had cash, so it all worked out.  Our water glasses never really went empty, and those who wanted more cocktails were served promptly.  We were checked on regularly, and overall the food, service, and experience was most excellent.  I&#39;m only taking a half-star off because I kind of feel like $7 for a mojito is a lot, but I don&#39;t get out that often (heh) so who knows.

Still... we&#39;ll be back.  If for nothing else than those potato boats.  Oh yes, we will be back."

First off, they are one of only maybe three places in all of Denver that prepared a burger correctly. And it was tasty. That&#39;s what my husband had, and he was happy with it, while I had the roasted chicken salad which honestly was delicious. I ate the whole thing, along with the free chicken taquito I was given just for checking in on Yelp. For what it&#39;s worth, that little freebie was wonderful! 

Our waitress was a little blonde who, like the taquito, was also wonderful. She moved us from a table next to four VERY LOUD women and also commented on how adorable our dogs are, which btw they ARE. Just very personable, welcoming and accommodating, and I thank her for that.

I&#39;ll definitely be back. I hope the quality and value is consistent. I would love to have found a place that actually makes a proper burger!"

I&#39;ve been here twice, once with friends who live nearby and another time with my aunt, both times specifically for dinner, and both times on a weeknight in the summer.  The place just screams &#34;summer patio drinking and fun&#34;!  It&#39;s nice and open inside, so I don&#39;t ever feel cramped up with other patrons.  The patio has less open space, but it&#39;s not terrible.  They have a community high top table as well, which seems to be a theme at places in this neighborhood.

The staff is always friendly, the drink list and happy hour specials are good too. I&#39;ve had burgers and tacos here, I&#39;m interested in trying the green chili upon my next visit.  

It&#39;s main draw is the feel and the HH specials, and I&#39;ve had a good time when I&#39;ve been here.  I&#39;m definitely willing to come back and try other menu items, it&#39;s be great if they had something that really stands out from other neighborhood spots."

Excellent service on a lazy Monday afternoon.
Tasty burger and fries.
Just a warm, relaxing place. Happy.

19NOV2011

$30 of free booze on my birthday. Just for signing up for emails. Exactly on your birth day (not the day before nor after).

I had a $21 tequila that was amazing. I am not a tequila fan at all, but, I thought: Let&#39;s see what a stupidly expensive (from my perspective) tequila tastes like. well, &#34;Woohoo! As good as it gets!&#34;

The bartender was very friendly and comped the soda my DD was drinking."

I will say that the name is a bit misleading. We expected a predominantly Vietnamese restaurant with pho as the highlight of the menu. When we arrived and looked at the menu, it looked more like the takeout menu of our local Chinese restaurant with a few sections dedicated to pho and other noodle dishes.   We were the only ones dining in but there was a steady stream of folks picking up take out orders.  The girl at the register/server was super friendly, took our orders and brought food out rather quickly. 

I had an order of fried veggie egg rolls. I decided on veggie pho and inquired about the broth (they normally use beef). The server made a point to make sure the would cook in veggie broth which I appreciated. If you have any dietary restrictions, make sure to ask. They didn&#39;t make an issue and were more than accommodating which I liked. The bowl was huge and loaded with veggies. Super delicious but you definitely need to add some sriracha to give it some heat. My husband had a bowl of the egg drop soup  which he wasn&#39;t very impressed by. And the chicken lo mein was not what he expected as the noodles they used were comparable to spaghetti noodles. 

Overall, I was content with my dish but it didn&#39;t blow me away. Customer service was friendly and I can tell this is a popular for quick/easy take out in the area."

It&#39;s not really a 5-star kind of place, but instead they crank out steady, good food. I&#39;ve never had their pho, but have been consistently pleased with their other dishes. Chicken, beef, lo mein, and fried rice are usually done very well. I have to hand it to them for their consistency from one meal to the next. Only rarely have we opened a container, eaten it, and felt &#34;meh&#34; about it (though it HAS happened once in a while). 

Their service is pleasant and they usually toss in a free app or two if you get 3 or more main dishes. All in all, definitely a solid choice for Chinese."

Check Yelp, find pho place that got good reviews.  

Pho 38 isn&#39;t a fancy restaurant.  It&#39;s a small, hole in the wall kind of place that looks like it&#39;s more of a take-out place than a dine-in eatery.  Doesn&#39;t matter.  The food is exceptional and the service is good.  

I ordered the Beef Stew with Wontons and Ho Fun Noodles.  The broth was top notch and super hot.  Just what the doctor ordered.  The beef was tender and they did not skimp on the ingredients.  There was a lot of beef, a good number of wontons and vegetables, and I was pleased to see that the bowl wasn&#39;t 80% noodle.  
We also ordered the Happy Family with Fried Rice.  I loved how the rice was just a side portion and not a filler to cut costs.  The ingredients are fresh and the flavors were great.

Part of it is my fault for thinking they would have &#34;bun&#34;, a Vietnamese noodle dish. When you call your restaurant a pho/noodle house, one can be forgiven the misconception that you serve Vietnamese food.  

The only thing Vietnamese here is the pho.  Their spring rolls are the worst I&#39;ve ever had;  soggy noodles, two sad shrimp, and lettuce. The peanut sauce is watery and uninspired. No sauce on the table to dress it up either.

The lo mein was just stupid. They use a kind of noodle that is cheap and goopy; and ORANGE.  They are  orange because they have food coloring in them.......I know because I&#39;ve seen them (and avoided them) at the market.  Tasteless, cheap, very little meat, limp vegetables.

The pho was OK but nothing special. Their selection of meats is minimal.   The atmosphere is strip mall-tastic,  which would be OK if their food was awesome.  But it&#39;s really just limp and tired.

The second star is for the service; they are really very nice here.  I almost hate to write a negative review, but I have to warn others,  that if  you have your mouth set for Vietnamese food, you will be sorely disappointed. This is bad Chinese hiding under a Pho name."

Their Hong Kong wonton noodles are the house specialty -- great egg noodles and a lot of wonton; getting it with beef just adds an extra kick.

These guys tend to know where the good food is at that doesn&#39;t cost you your left nut.  

The other reason I liked this place was the two women running the place.  For some reason, and judge me if you want, but I don&#39;t trust any &#34;authentic&#34; Asian food unless the people serving me have an accent.  Same goes for Mexican.  I don&#39;t want some white dude named Phil to be serving me my Pho.

Oh yeah the Pho was pretty good too.  Great flavor and as expected huge portions.  One of the only types of soup that can actually fill me up, and I prefer it to chicken noodle soup when I&#39;m sick."

(Basically fried noodles with seafood and gravy over it). It was a little salty, and the noodles weren&#39;t as generous as that at other places, but they compensated with the generous servings of shrimps on it. Cost: $10.50

I also had the fried chicken wings (you can opt for spicy if you like) which came with 3 wings and 3 drumsticks. It was great but not exceptional. Service was quick and even though this wasn&#39;t a prime area, there was a steady stream of customers who seemed to be regulars. Our server was also very prompt in constantly checking in to make sure we were doing okay, which was very unlike other hole-in-wall Asian restaurants. Cost: $6

I would come here again if I am in the area and crave Chinese food. 

Total: $16.50 (for two people)"

The family that owns this restaurant is sweet and so accommodating. We had a lovely time at lunch but quite honestly I was not super-impressed with the food. I would have loved some additional Vietnamese selections besides the pho, which was fine but really not great or remarkable. The rest of the menu is essentially fast food Chinese and that was really not what I was looking for on this day.

I could be wrong, but I think his mother brings the order out to me and tells me it is hot and to be careful...just like my mom. And sometimes, I get free Vietnamese egg rolls or something else.

However, what the food lacks, the family here makes up for as they are so sweet. We do come here because it&#39;s a bit closer than the Alameda/Federal area, but every time I do, I wish I had just gone to Hong Kong BBQ. Just had their Wonton here again, along with their dumplings, and greens. Their Wonton comes in the Pho broth...It&#39;s not terrible, and it&#39;s kind of like getting the good of both worlds (not the best), but it&#39;s just not real Wonton soup. The Wonton themselves are ok, and the dumplings here are actually really good. 

Overall, Pho 38 tries to do Pho, but the owners are the nicest Chinese family so it&#39;s really a Chinese restaurant. As for their Chinese food, it&#39;s pretty good. However, with the close-ish proximity to the great places on Federal and Alameda, I&#39;d rather go there. For a neighborhood asian restaurant though, they do the job just fine."

I&#39;m taking away a star. This time we ordered two chicken pho bowls, a side of steamed veggies, and a veggie lo mein, to go.

Got home and noticed our steamed veggies were actually ice cold, like they just came out of a fridge. Second, the chicken  was prepared in such a way that it was cold and slimy, it glistened, and looked just like frozen chicken out of a bag. I called and asked why it would be slimy (maybe a garlic sauce on it?) and the worker didn&#39;t know. It was so gross looking, I fed it to my dog. Third, the lo mein was just average, nothing special, but at least the veggies were not freezing cold. 

I can&#39;t believe people are giving this place 4+ stars. Have people lost all sensibility and taste? I&#39;ve never not eaten pho that was in front of me (favorite Asian dish). $30 down the drain, ended up scrounging around the fridge that night. 


(Original post below) 

Went on a whim, hungry for pho.

I&#39;d say the pho was pretty good, just limited options, like; meat combos, sizes, etc,. 
But my girlfriend skipped the pho and went for the Pad Thai, which was awful! It looked and tasted like cafeteria asian food. I felt so bad for her, but she wouldn&#39;t let me complain and order something else. 

The staff seemed nice enough. But, I probably won&#39;t go back for anything but the pho, and only if I&#39;m too lazy to drive to a true vietnamese noodle house."

The menu is small and generally looks like mostly fast-food Chinese dishes. The only Vietnamese food they have is pho and there are only a few options to choose from. I got the chicken pho and an order of veggie egg rolls. The egg rolls were gross. They gave me four and I had just two bites of one. They had a thick bread-like shell and were filled with a gooey vegetable sludge. I saw some green and orange hues, but the vegetables inside were unidentifiable. The pho broth was okay, but there were too many giant onion slices and the sprouts looked old and brownish. No cilantro or culantro. The noodles were overcooked too.

There is no Pho place up in the Highlands where I work. Sometimes during the work week a nice bowl of Pho is what I want, however, driving to South Federal is daunting especially on the cold days where Pho is usually the craving. I am glad that this place opened up and is up to the challenge to fill this void here in this neighborhood. 

The options are not as varied as you would find at the South Federal joints but they cover the basics. The broth is rich and hits the spot on a cold snowy day. There are other menu items that I have not tried but if you are not in the mood for brothy soup. I will say the people who work they are incredible nice and welcoming. They care about their business and want to make sure you are enjoying your meal.

I&#39;ve ordered takeout several times now, and every time the food is ready quickly and has been good.  Ordering and picking up is easy, and they&#39;re very friendly.  They also do a really good job of packing up the food securely and sometimes throw in some free eggrolls.  They also deliver, although I haven&#39;t tried that option.      

Steak pho is my most frequent order, and it&#39;s good--flavorful, a generous serving, and accompanied by the usual pho fixings.  The Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup, egg rolls, and dumplings are all good too."

Why? Because the menu is packed with Hong Kong style Chinese cuisine. I ended up ordering the Hong Kong style dumpling soup, which was absolutely delectable. The broth competes in complexity with your finest pho broths, the dumplings were delicious and there was a lot of it. I also shared an order of Vietnamese spring rolls, which were kinda your standard spring rolls, and some crab cheese wontons that were pretty good. 

My friend did order pho, however, and she said it was fine.... but it looked a bit disappointing. Too many noodles, not enough broth.

 I am totally going back to this place, and won&#39;t even bother with the pho... I am just pleased to find a Northside source of Hong Kong style Chinese food!"

The Singapore rice noodles were OK. I am used to having char-siu as the meat but this was chicken. The noodles were a bit more &#34;wet&#34; than I&#39;m used to, too.

The Hong Kong style wonton noodles were good. The wontons were packed with shrimp and perhaps pork?

The building itself is set across from the Anschutz Medical Campus which means there are a ton of health professionals who patronize this location. I was surprised to find a very large restaurant with a very cozy atmosphere.

Most Panera locations are pretty standard on their food items. I enjoyed a delicious sandwich and chips in addition to a thirst quenching green tea. The food is what it is.

I really enjoyed the spaciousness of this business. Apparently, the lunch hour is crazy busy which makes for a bit of a wait. However, since there is a ton of seating you&#39;re probably good to go no matter what time you arrive. Patience will be a virtue at lunch time.

I found the employees to be polite and quick. It is a clean place, relaxed and a solid go-to spot when in need of a bit sustenance."

They came up with a stained (but clean) ceramic mug.  Not everyone likes coffee in paper.  

Secondly, I ordered a cinnamon roll.  It looked pretty good.  The girl at the counter was pleasant but started to box it up in a paper box without asking me if I wanted it &#34;to go&#34;.  What is happening to customer service.  I was eating it there.  Finally, she handed me the cold roll on a plate.  I asked her to warm it up.  She said, &#34;there is a microwave behind you&#34;. Really, you can&#39;t warm up my food?  The microwave is poorly placed under the coffee service area, about one foot off the floor.  Do you really want your customers crawling on the floor to warm their food?  For the grand finale, the microwave didn&#39;t work.  It didn&#39;t have a ceramic place in it, but had the round &#34;spinner&#34; with the little wheels.  It sounded like it was running when I turned it on, but no heat was generated.  The staff did eventually heat my food, but never did anything about the microwave.  While I was eating, people continued to try to use it and the staff did nothing to help.  The food here is OK, but the management/staff is definitely &#34;meh&#34;."

I ordered a YOUPICK2 but decided to make my Frontega chicken panini a whole instead of a half. So they added $5.69 to the order.  

When I got home and started eating my first sandwich I felt more bread and cheese in my mouth so I opened the sandwich and found 3 thin scraggly pieces of chicken.

Absolutely adore it, even with the emptying of my wallet and caloric packing on.  But this one has missed the mark on more than one occasion.  

Today, my black bean soup was a salt bomb.  My panini was pressed but not even CLOSE to toasted.  In the past, my panini has had one solitary sliver of bell pepper.  A sliver.  No exaggeration.  This has occured multiple times with the same type of sandwich.  I went with a different sandwich this time around, but ... meh.  While we did place a large order today for pickup (a total of seven seperate orders, which they were very good about ringing up seperately), there were about five employees hanging out, chatting, not even pretending to clean or do &#34;busy&#34; work so I&#39;m sure there was little to no attention paid while assembling orders.  Which, I&#39;m sure, is how the soup ended up with WAY more salt than the Panera signature recipie calls for and how a &#34;toasted&#34; panini ended up on a cold press just long enough to get smooshed down. 

Thanks for being cool about the big order and all the seperate checks, but I can&#39;t continue giving my business to a place that simply bears the name &#34;Panera&#34; yet fails to follow through on the recipies that make the food so craveworthy.

I have never ordered the Cobb Salad before and thought it was a good decision for the hot day yesterday.  When it came to the table it lacked a little color but looked okay.  One bite and all I could taste was salt.  Salt, salt, and more salt.  Couldn&#39;t taste the ingredients at all.  I took only a few bites of the this $8+ salad and stopped.

She mumbled throughout - I had to ask her to speak up. I&#39;m pretty sure my kid&#39;s mango smoothie was 100% banana - if not, it certainly wasn&#39;t mango.

We decided upon Tortini Alfredo pasta with Garden Veggie soup, and Mediterranean Veggie sandwich with Creamy tomato soup. While the soups were quite nice the bread accompanying them was very hard. My mouth started aching from chewing it. (Is it supposed to be like that?). The pasta and sandwich were disappointing. The quantity of pasta was very less. Also Kraft Mac and Cheese tastes better.

But that has slowly changed over the last couple weeks. 

The staff at this location are always nice and pleasant. The reason why I gave them 3 stars is for multiple reasons. My main complaint is their (Panera corporate) choice to discontinue certain items on their menu and the replacements are by far the worse option they could have replaced them with. One of my favorite salads was the asian chicken salad. Well that&#39;s gone! While I should stay away from the pastries I have my favorites, but the shortbread cookie, and toffee nut cookie. I sure hope you didn&#39;t like them, like I did because those are gone too!!! And again the replacements suck! 

And for some reason this location is ALWAYS out of soemthing! I thought they bake their pastries in house! How is it the beginning of the day and you don&#39;t have muffins?! I&#39;m pretty sure those are popular items. This will probably be the last time I go here. It&#39;s just annoying at this point.

Definitely get a Panera card, you get free pastry just for signing up. Quite often Panera will just throw you a $2 off coupon, or give you a free drink or pastry--that&#39;s the way rewards programs should be! You also get food on your birthdays and every other month or so they&#39;ll let you get free plain black coffee just by swiping your card.

My only complaint is that their bakery is not as well stocked or elaborate as other Panera that I have been to-- the pastries seem to often be the same and the bagel/ bread selection doesn&#39;t sport anything unique.

Food seems like what you would make at your house. Order and get your food at the counter. Self seating area with dirty tables. Menu is limited to Turkey sandwiches, soups, salads and breakfast stuff. My wife had a salad and a sandwich. She liked it except for the chicken in the sandwich was literally one big chunk that was on one side of the sandwich that maybe covered 1/3rd of the sandwich. I really wanted a picture, but my wife had already started picking it apart and spreading it across her sandwich. My kids food was $5 which didn&#39;t include a drink.

Perhaps I should explain myself. I have a nut allergy, which I am always extremely careful about. 18 months ago I ordered the same bagel I had ordered countless times before. I even ordered it unsliced because I don&#39;t want my bagel going through a slicer that may have sliced a nutty bagel previous to slicing mine. Anyway, surprise! My bagel that day had a nut in it and I spent the next several hours in the ER focusing on continuing to breathe. This is not how I had planned to spend that particular Saturday.

Later, I called up the store to explain what happened.  I didn&#39;t want another person to have the same issue. I don&#39;t tend to get too overly upset about this kind of thing because humans do make mistakes, but in this case the result of the mistake was kind of a big deal. In that conversation I learned that Panera Bread does not bake their own bagels. They buy them from a local bakery.  I would think that a place with the word &#34;bread&#34; in their name would at least bake their own bread, but apparently that is not the case. Forgive me if I never eat another Panera Bread bagel.

Today I got a latte and a sausage and egg breakfast sandwich. It was OK, nothing special. At just under $10 for the breakfast, I certainly expected something a bit more special. It occurred to me that I could have gone to McDonald&#39;s and bought a very similar breakfast for about half the price.

I&#39;m not sure where some of the pictures on this Panera&#39;s Yelp reviews were taken, but my breakfast sandwich was not served on a piece of cloth on an old rustic wood plank.  Instead, it was served on an inexplicably huge plate, and it looked very, very lonely.  

Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better."

This is truly pathetic, in our view, given that we&#39;ve been able to obtain gluten free items that are of high quality throughout our travels all over Europe including Paris, Germany and on into Austria.  My wife has celiac disease and it is supremely difficult to find gluten free around Denver except in a few spots.  We&#39;ve always loved Panera Bread but can&#39;t go there anymore.  A shame.  Panera, like Kneaders, must just find it too hard to do gluten free which is odd given how easily the Europeans are able to do it."

Its very busy with a lot of teenage kids.  Those kids clearly don&#39;t care about quality and neither does the staff.  My husband got a sandwich that looked like my 10 year old made it.  Soggy and bland.
The two kids that were working behind the counter behaved so unprofessionally.  While we were placing our order the computer froze.  Instead of explaining it to us the gal at the computer started laughing and joking about what she was supposed to do next.  We moved over to the next register and the guy there was just as bad.  Shouting out to the, I guess, manager about how he should ring in our order.

Unlike many competitors that just give you some mushy instant oatmeal product, this is real slow cooked steel cut oats. I like it with pecans and strawberries and a nice cup of their hazelnut coffee.

UPDATE: I&#39;m reducing my Rating from 4 to 3 - Ignore what I said about the &#34;real slow cooked steel cut oats&#34;.  I found out that the oats are precooked and they just open a bag and heat them in the microwave - Very disappointing! I do like that they put pecans and strawberries on the oatmeal and if you ask, they&#39;ll add extra nuts and or strawberries... It&#39;s still better than the &#34;instant&#34; oatmeal trash that they serve at other places!

Don&#39;t like what I observed this AM. I arrived about 8AM on Sat morning and had to wait longer than necessary to have my order taken because one of the cashiers was too busy talking to her friend. Then when I went to get my coffee, the Hazelnut ran out, so I tried the Dark Roast and it was empty too. I tried to tell one if the girls at the counter that some of the coffee was empty and her response was that she wasn&#39;t &#34;open&#34; yet. When they finally did bring out fresh coffee, the tags in the front of the makers that are supposed to show when the coffee was brewed did not have the correct time on them.

The food is somewhat healthy (at least there are healthy options) and I like that the calorie count is on the menu. The pastries are good if you come early when they are still fresh but the bread is probably the highlight of the products they have. Seriously great sourdough bread. It&#39;s no San Fran sourdough but for Colorado it is the best you can get. I also like that there are plenty of places to sit even during the rush and free wifi. A great place to meet with clients and friends alike!

So why just 3 stars you ask? Well I have to say that I think that most Panera&#39;s are going a bit down in the serve and delivery categories. The last couple of times I have done my sandwich was pretty sloppy and the hot water for the tea had been out. The employees can be hit or miss.

Had I known the price, I&#39;d have just gotten a full and brought half home for later.  (I know a full panini is $7.29, but I wasn&#39;t expecting the half to be $6, minus a penny.  I was thinking more along the lines of $4 or even $4.50.)  That said, it was a tasty panini.  Just WAAAAAAY too expensive.

My birthday was this month, and Panera e-mailed me some time ago to tell me they were giving me my choice of a free bakery treat.  The pecan roll looked nice, so I picked that.  Brought it home (within 15 minutes) and started to eat it.  I was VERY disappointed.  The bread of the roll was the worst bakery roll I&#39;ve ever had: dry, tasteless.  It tasted like an over-two-weeks-old roll.  I wouldn&#39;t eat that if you gave it to me.  (Oh wait, they did give it to me.)  I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for it--that was $2.49 before tax.  I&#39;d have demanded a refund.  Picked the pecans off the top, then tossed the rest in the trash after only two bites (spat the second bite into the trash too.)

I needed an hour an a half between meetings to get some work done, and have my Pick 2 and coffee. I started working on my computer and was kicked off the Internet in 30 mins. 30 mins! That&#39;s less time than people usually spend in a restaraunt, less time then most working individuals get for a lunch break, and surely not enough time to do any work (that like two emails, maybe 3!!). How disappointing. There should not be a limit on Internet time. That&#39;s crazy. I would even be willing to pay for another cup of coffee, maybe a dessert if I could stay longer to work. You&#39;re definitely going to lose some of my business because of this and I am sure the business of many others. I don&#39;t know any other places that limit the Internet, so why would I chose panera over them? Love your food, but I am not going somewhere for a working lunch where I get kicked out after 30 brief minutes. Change your crazy Internet regulations!"

In my experiences, the service has always been prompt and friendly and the food delicious.  I&#39;ve had employees (and a manager) at one point, go above and beyond to make sure the price was right or to fix any tiny errors that may have occurred. I&#39;ve also seen them try to give me the best price possible for my meal. 
I love the French onion soup the best.  Try it in a bread bowl.  It&#39;s a great price and very filling and warming. 
It&#39;s in a great location and comforting to sit down in after shopping or even before or after seeing a movie at the Arapahoe Crossings theater. 
Also, if you get a chance to try their breakfast, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed. My favorite thing there, hands down, is the breakfast souffle croissant. I&#39;ve had them in all flavors and can&#39;t pick a favorite.

I handover my credit card and look at the receipt and somehow it&#39;s $7!  Seven dollars for a bowl of chili! I tried to argue with them but they were only interested in moving me down the line and out the door.  My cornbread muffin was instead crushed bits of cornbread in a bag that they must have had leftover from some other menu item.  Very disappointing.

Ted&#39;s Montana Grill has the potential to be Great, but after 2 visits over 2 days,  noticed what I call &#34;lack of leadership&#34;....

First and foremost, Im glad I wasn&#39;t going there with a date, because they did a poor job of acknowledging your existence when you arrive...Its really incredible to me that such a high overhead restaurant could afford to do this..after waiting a while...someone finally came up and ask me what i wanted?.......wow!

The second day I went back, this post date, same thing...but this time I walked out because that is just so rude. They were not very busy...it was around 330 pm...9-3-16..i almost stayed ...just out of curiosity as to how long it would take someone to get around to greeting me...but it wasn&#39;t looking promising and i was hungry...so i went somewhere else...i thought maybe they were just having a bad day on 9-2 so i gave them a second chance..my mistake...

When I did eat there on 9-2, i had a No. 11 burger...it was pretty tasty ..a bit strange ..prob would not order it again..ordered half and half french fries and onion rings on side...onion rings were cold, french fries ok...I wouldn&#39;t complain about the price if i thought the quality of the food matched..

I can just imagine this was a super nice place when new...and Its well presented on the outside...buts suffering from complacency or operations fatigue...too bad...esp. for the customers and owners...

One really unusual thing i noticed...the waitress would come up to within about a foot behind you and then say something really loud before you knew she was there....it made me jump several times....i still left a normal tip because she was friendly and attentive as normal..Im sure if i complained about the blah french fries and a rings...as for the sandwich that was my fault for picking it..."

First of all the place was packed with traveling business men &amp; women, so we sat at the bar for a while. 

We watched the show in the prep kitchen and I was amazed at the teamwork!!!

I started with the wedge salad and enjoyed the blue cheese &amp; bacon dressing. It was light tasting and perfect. So much so, I asked for more!!!

I had the bison meatloaf and gravy was great!!!  The French fries looked so good I had to try them and they did not disappoint!!!  They reminded me of my grandmothers!!!  Cut right there in the prep kitchen!!!  The carrots were good, but nothing phenomenal.

I ordered a mixed drink that was a solid pour, great way to start the evening!  I had the buffalo filet with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The steak was very good, but overcooked.  I ordered it medium rare, and settled for medium well, as I didn&#39;t feel the need to say something, as th flavored were good.  The asparagus were bitter, but the mashed potatoes were solid.  They also served a gravy with the meal, which was really bad.  They would do better not serving the gravy, as it cheapened the quality of the whole meal and experience.

Mostly an excuse for a decent lunch out, but we did have a few business items we needed to discuss. About 3 minutes worth. Nonetheless, it made me feel as though I belonged at Ted&#39;s.

Our server, however, was chill and very attentive and friendly. 
I opted for a fish sandwich and asked to substitute ciabatta instead of the hamburger roll. Mistake. The ciabatta roll was waaay too much bread and overwhelmed the fish. I ended up picking most of the bread off. I also subbed grilled asparagus with that sandwich. That was an A+ choice. Big pieces of fresh asparagus grilled perfectly.

I can&#39;t describe how impressed we were by the server at this location. Thank you for a wonderful experience Anthony.

I was working at an office building off of 40th and saw Ted&#39;s in the early morning as I passed by. I got to the office and immediately looked at their menu and saw an array of choices. It is typically more money than I like to spend on myself for lunch, but it was worth every penny! I ordered the skinny dip bison burger, added cheese and they let me substitute the tomatoes for asparagus. I called in promptly at 11am when they opened and placed a to-go order and it was ready in the 10 mins that they quoted. By the time I got back to work it was still hot and fresh and I am definitely a fan! I cannot wait to return and try some of the other wonderful sounding items on the menu!"

Like many other reviewers I was waiting for a flight and stopped in for dinner. Servers had fantastic recommendations on food and wine, as well as positive, upbeat, and attentive.

Food: Caesar w/salmon - cedar plank salmon was perfectly grilled and cedar taste = yum, dressing was good too....even if I like caesar w/egg.

Bison ribeye w/asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes...medium rare and perfectly cooked. Asparagus...cooked to tender without being mushy and mashed potatoes were good too. Ordered mashed on server recommendation. Not huge mashed potato fans here but the garlicky, buttery flavor were excellent.

Ambiance: Ted&#39;s Montana does it well, even within proximity to airport. Nice, warm, inviting atmosphere and reprieve from travel, travel, travel"

Surprisingly this was further than the one near us, but faster to get to because of traffic. This place sits closer to the DIA area and therefore is filled with a lot of business travelers. We walked in with blue jeans, sweats and not at all matching up to everyone else. But no one really cared. Thankfully it&#39;s usually a casual place, it&#39;s just the location that gives it a certain customer base.

This was my first visit to this place and wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect but my friend&#39;s recommendation said they enjoyed it and that they make pretty good burgers. 

They have quite a few interesting burger variations, many of which sound quite delicious. We all got a little unoriginal and all ordered the George&#39;s Cadillac but ordered different sides. 

The waitress asked how we liked out burgers cooked, but in the end they all just came back to us as well done. It was a little disappointing not to get my medium rare burger, but I&#39;m not one to send food back. The burger itself was delicious! Lots of flavor and filled me up quick with their big patties. I got the mashed potatoes and they were kinda dry and not much flavor for being &#34;garlic mashed potatoes&#34;. The fries were alright, but the onion rings looked good! 

When I went to the restroom though I was kinda surprised to see powder soap in the restroom. I haven&#39;t seen that in 12 years, especially not at a restaurant. 

The waitress was very pleasant and attentive when it came to keeping us hydrated and refilling our drinks. Over all it was a pretty good place to eat and will probably be my burger place of choice when I&#39;m too lazy to commute to my favorite places further west."

But, we had clients staying at a hotel nearby and ended up meeting them here for dinner. It was surprisingly good! I&#39;m a big fan of bison meat in general, and was impressed with the quality of the cuts of meat.

We started with the bison nachos (awesome, especially with fresh jalapenos), and the onion rings, which were tasty.

I ordered the bison Delmonico ribeye, medium rare, with fresh tomatoes and the kale salad. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was just so, so divine. Simply melting in my mouth! The tomatoes were a bit underwhelming, just big slices of tomatoes, but I&#39;m not sure what I expected ordering fresh tomatoes in Colorado in January. The kale salad was superb.

The ONLY downside is that I couldn&#39;t finish the steak and ended up throwing it away when I checked out of my hotel two nights later. It was too much steak for me. I think it I had been able to take it home (as opposed to back to the hotel), I would have absolutely made a bison steak sandwich. Oh man. I&#39;m literally salivating just thinking about it 

So yeah, it&#39;s a chain, and it&#39;s pretty standard, but if you happen to be out by the airport in Aurora, and you&#39;re looking for a meaty meal, go here!"

It was about 0 degrees outside and I found myself walking through the snow into Ted&#39;s Grill.  I got here around 6:30pm and the place was absolutely packed.  Luckily, I was able to snag a seat at the bar.

Since this was a Colorado restaurant, I expected some decent draft beers on tap.  FAIL.  They had coors, fat tire, stella, new castle, and blue moon.  Bummer.  #ColoradoBeerFAIL

I decided on ordering the bison steak ($30) which comes with 2 sides, in which I chose the onion rings and asparagus.  My order didn&#39;t come out for a whole hour.  I managed to flag down the waiter a few times, but the waiter can only do so much for this unorganized kitchen.

Speaking of the kitchen, it was a mess.  If you&#39;re wondering why the kitchen is so slow, it&#39;s because the kitchen is a tiny little grill next to the bar, the greasy mess exposed for all to see.  First off, I&#39;d like to tell you a little observation I made while watching the kitchen.  If you&#39;re wondering why your burgers here are dry, the cooks here press all the juice out of it while cooking.  I simply don&#39;t understand why people do this.  Just because you&#39;re squeezing out all the juices doesn&#39;t make it cook faster! This guy needs to be fired and take a class on grilling 101.  #rantOver

Anyways, when my bison steak finally came out, it was over-cooked (I asked for Medium rare), under seasoned and tasteless.  I guess the onion rings were the highlight of the meal if I had to pick something good.  For $30, I expected much better.

Skip this place.  Even outback can grill a better piece of meat."

The good:  The taste of the burger was absolutely amazing!  Perfect combo of spice and flavor made for a wonderful dining experience. My lips were tingling and I can&#39;t stop thinking about the fresh, clean taste of the bison. Yum!

It was cooked medium so as to retain some juicyness. It was cooked medium. The burger was good, however it had very very mild flavor, it may have been covered and steamed, which is done to keep Bison juicy at some joints. I dislike this.

I guess there was one other issue, my burger was brought out with sour cream on it when it wasn&#39;t supposed to have any. When the waiter saw it (it was brought out by someone else), he immediately offered to have it redone, but I said it was OK. When I got the bill, he went ahead and gave me a $10 off coupon for next time."

They specialize in burgers but all of ours were well done even though we specified medium. The fries were cold and the menu was pretty limited. The onion rings were the best part but nothing to write home about. It all seemed very promising but we were disappointed. The meat quality seems like it&#39;s there but the other ingredients weren&#39;t great so it didn&#39;t make the meal like it could have. Some people in our party were excited about the bison option. The jambalaya tasted like canned soup but the chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce was pretty good. 

The service was pretty good for our large party so we appreciated that. 

Overall this place left us wanting more. I was hoping they would have more options for chicken sandwiches and that there would be more beer on tap but it&#39;s mostly just mainstream stuff. Not colorado brews :( which would go very nicely with out burger.

The gruyere cheese and bleu cheese can be a bit overwhelming, but for the most part it&#39;s a good burger.  Add to that the attentive and friendly service and Ted&#39;s is worth a second visit.

The main drawback is the price.  It isn&#39;t that much better than its competitors in terms of taste.  If Ted&#39;s went along the lines of the average sit-down burger joint in terms of price, it&#39;d be worth another star.  Unfortunately, $14 is too much in my opinion for just a good burger."

Seated promptly and service was friendly and on point.

I order the beef ribeye medium rare with asparagus and garlic mased potatoes.

The steak was served passed well-done and all of the food tasted exactly the same. Which I thought was bizarre and assumed after cooking they sprinkled the entire plate with the same spices. 

Had the pecan apple crisp for dessert and it was delicious.

I have had better food at TGIFriday&#39;s and Applebee&#39;s.

Very disappointing for such a nice looking restaurant that appears to lend itself to the slightly higher end of the mid-range scale to have terrible food.

Wedge salad was good, but this place, like that most others that serve a wedge salad, always seem to send it out to you with a plate that is too small to accommodate the amount of salad they give you.

Meat loaf was good.  Mashed potatoes were good.  Squash casserole was meh.

They happen a some what open kitchen that you can see from the bar and waiting area.  The thing about an open kitchen is that you should keep it clean if customers can see what&#39;s going on.  I wasn&#39;t dirty, but it wasn&#39;t clean either.  If you&#39;re going to have an open kitchen, keep it clean."

I went in today ( Monday evening) and it was really busy. I knew I would wait for a table ( I was told 5-10 minutes by the blonde waiter/host). This wasn&#39;t a big deal at all. There were a few open seats at the bar but I figured I&#39;d wait for the table. About seven or eight minutes went by and another group of 3 came in. The host told them 10-15 minutes and they said that&#39;s fine. After another five minutes passed, she had grabbed the group that came in after us for a table. I was slightly annoyed because we had arrived before them and we had passed up bar seats because we thought the wait would be shorter. 

I politely said, &#34;hey I actually think we were supposed to sit down first&#34; and she said &#34;no their party is bigger ( by one person)&#34; and dismissed me. 

This is shitty customer service. I&#39;ve been a waiter before and I know sometimes you need to sit larger ( not by one person) parties in certain areas but she did not handle it politely. If I would have know this, I would have grabbed a seat at the bar right when I came in."

I am obsessed. 100%.

With my parents vacationing over my birthday weekend, we decided to celebrate at a later date - which just so happened to be this past weekend. I&#39;ve always loved the Platt Park/Pearl Street area - as it&#39;s grown alot over the years, provides a quaint vibe and is 100% walkable. 

Our first stop: Uno Mas Taqueria. 

Happy hour is offered from 4-6pm which features a variety of different drinks, daily special and delicious appetizers, which we gladly took part in. We ordered a round of their house margaritas - which were delicious, perfectly crafted and yummy! Although there was ALOT of ice in the glass, the substance was perfect. Their food is something else - carefully crafted, perfect for sharing and full of flavor. We ordered a round of their fresh guacamole, chips and salsa along their pupusas! Three little pieces of stuff tortilla were filled with shrimp, chicken  and shredded beef - topped with pickled onions, lettuce, tomatoes and sauce. Delicious and perfect for only $3!

The atmosphere is quaint, cute and insanely crowded. There was only one table open for 4 people, which we happily took, but it was right by the bathroom and food running area. not my ideal place for conversation and noshing - but sufficed. Their patio is adorable, but fills up fast, so come early! Our server was insanely friendly, sweet and gave us happy hour prices, even when timing was slightly after hours. 

I can 100% see coming back here to experience other meals and their patio!"

Some friends and I stopped in for dinner and sat out on the patio - loved the setting. We started with chips and guac and salsa. The guac was very good, tasted fresh. They gave us 3 salsas to try and they were all good. I kept going back and forth between all of it.

While we were devouring our chips we also got drinks. I got a traditional margarita with salt and it was perfect. Big, salty and just enough alcohol to give me a little buzz.

For tacos I got the carnitas and the one with the brisket. I honestly can&#39;t say which I liked better. Maybe the carnitas? It&#39;s a close contest.

For dessert we got churros. They were filled and warm and really tasty. They were a great way to top off an even better meal. 

I would definitely eat here uno mas time!"

I am not super picky when it comes to my meat so I am not typically one to complain, but I just can&#39;t get into the flavor of their barbacoa taco and their smoked chicken.

Fresh - being the key word, as it properly describes all of the food.  The three salsas (tomatillo, pico-esque, and sweet and spicy) were clearly freshly hand-made, and delicious.  The chips were ample, also super fresh, and well salted (not to mention, more than we could eat).  Happy hour is terrific - the cold, lime accompanied Pacifico for $2.00.  Really?  Try to beat that in this area.  Cannot. Be. Done.  I love the &#34;like you are ordering sushi&#34; checklist for the street tacos, and if you can&#39;t find something that sounds appetizing, you are in the wrong place.  Ample fillings, and not too soggy.  The two white corn tortillas hold the ingredients perfectly.  I had the shrimp - with three good size shrimp, and delicious seasoning and accompanying ingredients.  Also tried the pork belly, and am not going to lie - not a fan.  BUT if you like smoke flavoring, you would find this selection delicious.  Thick bacon, and fresh avocado.  

This is a small place with quaint decor, bandana napkins, and clean, clean, clean.  I can only imagine that this place gets rockin&#39; on the weekends, and most certainly during warmer weather.

Our server Anthony (who may very well be a manager?) was so incredibly service oriented and friendly, without being obnoxious!  Carefully described his favorites and the fish of the day, and even showed me the plated special!!!  I was sitting by the window, which was too cold and he moved me to an interior table without even blinking an eye.  Told me about the Kaos pizza down the street (that I also have enjoyed) and a new place opening up in the Tennyson area with a sincere commitment to the locations, foods, service, owner, and repeat patronage.  

This is certainly a &#34;don&#39;t miss&#34; place on South Pearl.  Our tacos came out quickly, yet we didn&#39;t feel rushed.  Great energy and vibe, and diverse clientele, which I love.

The service was great, and the menu is super easy and straightforward.

We got the chips and salsa and guac to begin, and we demolished all of it!  The guac was fresh, and the medium salsa, was my favorite!  When the waiter realized most of the chips we had were mostly crumbs, he quickly refilled out basket with fresh, warm, salty ones! YUM.

We tried a variety of the tacos I had the smoked chicken, and the bean and cheese, and my colleagues had the carne asada.

My favorite was the chicken.  My boss said the bean and cheese was made differently than usual, as it had a weird sauce, that made it overly chewy, and not so great.  People said that Carne tacos were pretty salty, but I didn&#39;t try them.  I could have had another pound of chips and 2 more chicken tacos.

I was a bit surprised that a group of 20 had a reservation that was going to take up a lot of the dining room seating in such a small venue, but was happy to sidle up to the bar to eat. 

The bartender was slammed when we sat down but acknowledged us right away. She came back and told us their specials for the night and happily gave us suggestions as well. 

I went with fish tacos and pork tacos.  Both came out delicious but I think the fish were just a bit better.  The couple next to us had guacamole and it looked fantastic. Wasn&#39;t super hungry but will try some next time. 

Service was quick, food was great, staff was friendly.  I&#39;ll be back."

While you can&#39;t go wrong with any tacos on the menu, my go-to order is the al pastor tacos - the pineapple and pork combo is to die for.

However, I was disappointed in the chips and salsa. As a prerequisite to running a Mexican taco shop, you should be required to make your own tortilla chip. The ones provided were too thick, not salted, and tasted like they came from a Costco sized tortilla chip bag. If this one item changed, I would give this place an additional star. I really enjoyed the chorizo taco."

They have a great happy hour that we frequent - on the usual rotation: three pupusas for $6, 1/2 order of guac -$3 and drink specials of the day. The pork belly taco is my fav - sometimes it can be a bit dry but most of the time it comes out plump and flavorful. They put out solid food and drinks and the service we get is fantastic. 

In particular Lucio, Brian and Gabe always make us feel welcome and pay special attention to my husband&#39;s dietary needs (red meat and nut allergies). It is wonderful peace of mind not having to worry about cross contamination. 

Other random thoughts: It can definitely get loud during the busy times but we often go at the beginning or end of HH so it is a more relaxed atmosphere. The tables are close together so you will get to know your neighbors. An outdoor patio offers more space. There is only one bathroom so that can be problematic at times."

The space, though small, is cozy. Not necessarily conducive for large parties or moving around in general. It&#39;s narrow and packed with two top tables and a long bar serving up Pacifico on tap. The small space is also not favorable of noise. Let&#39;s just say we couldn&#39;t hear our convo due to the super loud party nearby. 

The service was attentive and the salsas were zesty and fresh, however I&#39;m still not sure the price on one taco, two drinks, and a beer warranted the price we paid. Nevertheless, I&#39;d like to return and enjoy that delicious Mexican mule during their happy hour!"

Uno Mas was a back up plan for Labor Day and we&#39;re glad it worked out! Not the sexiest place, simple but clean inside, but the staff is nice and the back patio provided some relief from the heat.

Tacos were great, actually liked them all. Highlights were:

Langoustine - was the special of the day, taste fishy/like the sea (in a good way, like a langoustine should) and it was a heaping portion
Lengua - perfectly cooked, nice with the corn

Honestly, you can go wrong with anything.  Order the tacos that speak two you- two or three per person is enough,  Decide on a margarita and you are good to go!  Tacos are a little upscale and a little gourmet ( duck, anyone?) and priced a litttle high.  Seating is tight, crowded, and there is no waiting area... the atmosphere is VERY LOUD.

Love that it&#39;s a welcoming, cozy, neighborhood joint where you will see a wide range of people hanging out and enjoying themselves. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the tacos and margs can be REALLY yummy, but sometimes (especially when they&#39;re busy) a mojito might get a little less attention than it needs or the fish for your taco might be slightly overcooked. Still completely yummy, just not always as good as it can be. 

Favorite tacos are the carnitas, fish, smoked chicken, and al pastor. The queso y frijoles is good, but spicy, and the seafood taco is sometimes great, sometimes not so much.

Another benefit? They deliver. Fast. Like...last time I ordered they apologized that it would take 25 minutes kind of fast.

We stopped into this newish taco eatery to have a sampling of their fare. It was on Sunday and Uno Mas hosts HH on Sundays from open (11:30, I think) - 5:00, Woo hoo! I enjoyed a $5 marg that was pretty good and not too sweet. We also took advantage of the discounted guac which was tasty but seemed like it was from the day prior. (A wee bit brown, you see?) 
We ordered 4 tacos: Pork Belly- this had pretty good flavor and wasn&#39;t as dry as it appeared. I&#39;d possibly order this again. Queso Y Frijoles- Hubs enjoyed this one more than I did. We were sharing and I didn&#39;t get nearly as much of the queso as I would have liked. Seafood- it had shrimp and scallops and was ok. I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The shrimp was overcooked and the flavor combo was off. Roasted Portobello- this was my favorite taco. It kind of had a &#34;pot roast&#34; type of flair to it but I really enjoyed it and would certainly order it again.
We tried all of the salsas but didn&#39;t care for any of them. The main salsa has lots of oregano and is quite overpowering. The &#34;hot&#34; salsa was my favorite of the 3 but it wasn&#39;t very memorable.
We like that it&#39;s local with a decent happy hour so we may return to try a few other tacos but we&#39;re not in a rush."

I&#39;m a huge fan of tacos, especially ala carte tacos so Uno Mas automatically gets points right there for that. My colleague and I stopped in after a work shift and I was stoked to see they had happy hour going on. We sat at the bar, enjoyed a $2 Pacifico and tacos. They had some happy hour specials going on with chips and guacamole but we passed (I think one of the few times in my life where I&#39;ve passed on guac). I ordered two tacos so I could get some food in my system and went with the portobello mushroom taco along with the porkbelly taco because I cannot resist porkbelly ever! The portobello was good but nothing drool worthy, but the pork belly was what dreams are made of. Topped with a nice portion of avocado and covered in an ancho and coffee rub, it was absolutely delightful. I took small bites so I could enjoy as much of it as possible. For street tacos they&#39;re a little pricey ($3-$4.50 each) so if you&#39;re looking to gorge, you may want to rethink but then again, all tacos are $3 on Tuesday so this would probably be the day to celebrate and go wild and order the beef tongue taco!"

No AC so expect it to be hot as hell inside in the summer. But again, authentic. The tacos are inventive with a culinary approach. We&#39;ve been here twice and enjoyed it with a few down sides. The first time everything was good except for the sharp jagged 2inch bone shard my wife found (and luckily didn&#39;t eat) in her taco. This thing was like a tiny weapon! I showed the waiter and he comped us a dessert. It was good but the dough of the churro was raw inside. So eh. The second time we came everything was good with the exception of one taco of which the meat was dry and pretty unpleasant. We ordered the tres leches cake and that was a huge mistake. Grossest dessert I&#39;ve ever had. It was like corn bread soaked in syrupy condensed milk. I&#39;ve had tons of tres leches and this one confused me. So the take away here is, inspect your tacos and avoid the dessert and you&#39;ll have a good time. They are called street tacos for a reason. Authentic."

If you are in the neighborhood, its iconsistent but can be ok if you don&#39;t walk in with expectations. Its not a destination, i.e., don&#39;t go out of your way to come here. Tonite will be the last time I visit. Other than the first time, I come in by default like tonite. On a busy night on Pearl Street South, it had the only available seating.

I grabbed a seat at the bar. When my chips and salsa were delivered, the server/bartender, from my side of the bar, was too touchy &#34;feely&#34; on my shoulders and back. I don&#39;t like that. Then a server had two friends that wanted a seat and not wait. So they relocated me to a less comfortable seat. When another server delivered my tacos, she says with a smile, &#34;I know, really tight quarters, huh.&#34; I felt so uncomfortable, I just wanted to leave and did not enjoy anything. I never received water, and was beyond midway thru my meal before I got a napkin and utensils.

A previous visit, I complained to the bartender, the owner&#39;s wife, the chips were stale and not good. She said &#34;Oh, I know, we didn&#39;t heat them up.&#34;  No apology, new chips, or compensation.

The food has been hit or miss. They are a Pinche wanna be. I don&#39;t like their salsas. The habanero has too much sugar, the traditional is below ok and has an odd chop to the ingredients that makes it cumbersome, and I simply don&#39;t like tomatillo salsa. I tried a torta once. I could have done as well at home. The guacamole is good and a good size. I like the bean and cheese taco (they use a fancier name). A special taco once was lamb, which was excellent.

The margaritas are average at best."

Instead of giving you a bowl to dip your torta in they just another it and instead of using hard bread so that it doesn&#39;t fall apart in your hands they use hamburger bread.

Wtf?!? Your supposed to close at 9 on weekdays). I asked the what looks like the manager why they close so early? And she said they just get to slow but I saw a couple people walk in before their actual closing hours just to get turned away.  People eat past 8:30 and definitely past 9:00 p.m.  Sure your not a &#34;bar&#34; as the manager put it but come one 9 p.m. To close and still close earlier then that.  8:45?!?  That&#39;s way to early.  I was actually eating when this happened I just saw people come in and asked why they got turned away and why the restaurant closed so early but man if you open till only 9 p.m. At least stay open as long as your sign says....  Food is amazing here by the way but the owner could find some new front of the house staff for sure.

There were three of us for dinner, along with a toddler. They were busy, but we were seated quickly, and our drink orders were taken quickly. I had the house margarita which was yummy. The decor was pretty typical, and the atmosphere loud and a little crowded, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. 

It was &#34;Taco Tuesday&#34;, so the menu was largely comprised of a variety of street tacos, along with some appetizers and a couple of other options if tacos weren&#39;t your thing. The kids&#39; options were chicken or cheese quesadillas. The menu is done Sushi style (one menu, write a quantity next to the items you want) which was a little awkward when ordering Mexican, for whatever reason. We got the chips and guacamole which was really good. Very heavy on the onions, so if you&#39;re not an onion fan, you might not be as thrilled. We ordered a cheese quesadilla for the kiddo and variety of tacos for ourselves. Three each were enough after the app. The tacos came out pretty quickly and were delicious. I got the chorizo, el pastor, and the seafood one (it had a clever name I&#39;ve since forgotten) with the shrimp and sea scallops which were sizable and perfectly cooked.

Curiously, the quesadilla didn&#39;t come out with the tacos. The waitress said it would come out shortly...but it didn&#39;t. Nor after we were done with our tacos. It became apparent that the quesadilla order didn&#39;t get placed. Should have been a quick fix, but it took quite a while for that thing to finally arrive, by which point junior had stuffed so many tortillas in his face, that he only ate about a quarter of it. I helped him out with the rest. To her credit, the waitress totally made it right, comping the tardy quesadilla and giving us free churros which were superb. It was an honest mistake, but one that I feel would never have happened if the restaurant had the wait staff take orders instead of trying to be needlessly trendy. I&#39;m still going to give them four stars, as the food was all superb, and the price was extremely reasonable."

The folks next to me ordered one taco too many so my intro was a carnitas taco from the lovely woman to my left (mutual gut feeling for kind people I suppose). 

Their happy hour is excellent. Discounted drinks and food. HOWEVER, even outside of happy hour their beers are actually affordable - $3.50 bottles and they have some delicious options.

The food, oh the food! There is no skimping on the tacos. Two corn shells filled. In addition to the carnitas I had al pastor and duck confit. All three were incredible. My friend and I also shared the happy hour pupusas and guac. All in all, it ended up being one taco too many food wise but everything was incredibly tasty.

The menu descriptions where the most enjoyable part of the experience. 

After we ate we began to look at some reviews and saw that there are a lot of rave reviews and a small amount of poor ones. (Mind blown) the poor reviews had a copy and paste reply with a generic apology and states that they were surprised the the food lacked quality as they had recently won top honors at TOP TACO (an annual taco competition featuring 40+ local restaurants). I urge you to check out the REAL winners of TOP TACO 2015.

Each extra item is an extra dollar. There is indoor seating as well as outdoor chairs and tables facing the street.

We got several different items for our group. The consensus: the grilled chicken sandwich was tasty with lots of lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. The cheeseburger with pepper jack, green chiles, mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was good but kind of sloppy. The hamburger with green chiles, mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was nothing special. The fries were skin-on, a bit dry.

Bob&#39;s is usually really great. It&#39;s a small hole in the wall on Ford street with a great view of the buttes in Golden (and the Coors plant. Hey, it&#39;s Golden.) They don&#39;t have a liquor license (a bit ironic, I know) so you can&#39;t get a beer here, but there&#39;s a shop right next door. 

Burgers are fried, not grilled, so just know that coming in. They&#39;re usually really good and give you loads of choices for toppings. There are also different bun options to suit most palates. 

Not a ton of seating inside so if you come during inclement weather you may face a bit of a wait. But that&#39;s the exception, not the rule. 

Service is laid back and local so check your big city (or Boulder/Aspen) attitude at the door. Downtown Golden likes its small town western feel.

There is also a few spots right in front of the restaurant as well. 

It&#39;s a very simple menu - make your own burger or sammich. All you have to do is check off what kind of sandwich you want or customize your burger, pay and they bring it to you. There&#39;s also a lot of sauces you can add on. 

You can sit inside or enjoy the weather outside. There is plenty of seating and didn&#39;t seem to busy. Wait was not long. 

He got a full burger and I got a simple chicken sammich. They were both delicious - well made and full of flavor! I really enjoyed it. Service was good and prices were fair. A perfect follow up to the tour, especially if you sample all the beer."

I think that&#39;s the best way to describe this place. Given the proximity to Mines, I kinda figured this would be your run of the mill college burger joint fueling the broke college students. That&#39;s basically what it is.

The highlight of the trip was the fries. I do think they were well seasoned and had a pretty nice bit for spice to them. I also enjoyed filling out my burger paper. If you&#39;ve ever been to Which Which, it&#39;s basically the same thing. You fill out what you want on it.

Now the downside. Again, the burger was unspectacular. It was good, but it felt like it needed a little bit of salt. The ingredients tasted fresh but the beef was just the tiniest bit bland.

No complaints about the customer service and it was a neat little place. I think it&#39;s a great option in an area with limited choices, but it&#39;s nothing special."

Located right across the street from the Coors factory in Golden, one would assume that Bob&#39;s serves beer on tap. Nope, it&#39;s a PG rated menu. I say PG because it&#39;s not the healthiest choices, unless you count sweet potato fries as healthy.

But really, a root beer float and smashed crispy cheeseburger with mustard oozing out the sides? With pickles? I&#39;d eat that for breakfast right now if you put it in front of me. Go for it, I dare you!

On a busy Saturday, the competition for seating is fierce! If you are smart and understand how the rotation works, it&#39;s merely a matter of patience, wait until you&#39;ve ordered and gotten your alias before trying to get a table. None of this saving a seat while your friends wait in line. Just hang tight and by the time you need a table, it&#39;ll appear.

I was craving hotdog in a burger place. So my $3 hotdog by Nathan&#39;s is simple but it was good. Topped with sautéed mushrooms. That&#39;s ideal for me just the way it is. No ketchup or any other condiments to come between me and my dog. Additional $.50 for the mushroom. Cheap! 

They grind their own meat in house. Company had the double patty and was the most expensive burger on the menu at $8+ bacon. I had a bite. It was damn good!

Hipster and slightly divey ambiance, a great place to eat your lunch on a sunny afternoon.
The burgers themselves are good to be sure, but nothing that really stands out above the fold. A bit pricey at that which is why I only gave 3 stars. Cheeseburger and onion pedals $10+
Hand packed patty, and apparently they grind their own meat. Without a doubt, it&#39;s quality. loaded with fresh ingredients and made fresh to order.
The onion pedals were pretty awesome. Like a good old onion ring, but in something the size and shape of a flower pedal. Not really much different aside from he shape; but if you like onion rings, this is the way to go.
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back. Places like this tend to grow on me, and I can see why it is a local favorite. Would be a great stop after the brewery tour.

They have a few sauces to try out as well such as an atomic and something else... Neither were so good that I could remember them in a line up of sauces...

The 4th star is specifically for the onion flowers (or strings, if you prefer). They were awesome! The sweet potato fries are another solid choice!

You walk in and fill out your form of what you want on your burger (kind of like which wich). I went for a hamburger, $5.50 base price. They have options for wheat and gluten free buns, cool! My coworkers got a fried chicken and grilled chicken burger (slightly more expensive).

They have free toppings: lettuce, tomato, onions, banana peppers, pickles, pickled jalapenos. I also added bacon $1, and cheese $0.80.

They give you a funny name (I was Wonder Woman) and they call it out when it&#39;s ready. It didn&#39;t take long to come out, we beat the lunch rush somewhat. The burgers are cooked to perfection. They automatically do it medium well. At first I was like &#39;Dang that is too bad I prefer medium rare.&#39; But the flavor was awesome and the meat quality was impressive. 

We were all very happy with what we got. The sides of onion petals and sweet potato fries were a great addition. Great sauce options here as well. Totally coming back next time I need my burger fix!"

However, I wasn&#39;t all that impressed. I think the concept of this place is cool - simple burgers with simple options that you order via a little burger &#34;slip&#34; as soon as you walk in. The staff was really friendly and the place had just the right amount of local town vibe to it. I even loved the fun way the staff calls out your food (you&#39;re assigned a pop culture character name). 

That being said, the burgers were just good. Nothing out of this world good and nothing I wouldn&#39;t miss if I never came back here again. It was a good basic burger that you could probably make for yourself at home. I also got to try the onion petals and fries. First off, the portions for these were really deceiving. We ordered small sizes of these and all of us kept commenting on how it seemed like they were bottomless (that&#39;s a good thing!). Unfortunately, they were also just good. 

I guess if I were a local and I was craving a hamburger that wasn&#39;t fast food quality, I would go here, but other than that...meh."

Bob&#39;s Atomic Burgers is a no thrills cinder block palace of deliciousness. It has a great local mountain dive place feel to it. You walk in and there&#39;s paint chipped on the wall, Bob Marley jammin&#39; in the background, and paperbags to write your order on. What they lack in feng shui they make up in some seriously good food!

Burgers are moist, Buns are soft and perfect, and toppings are all up to you. You can add premium toppings or basic toppings. There&#39;s a small up charge for the premium toppings but totally worth it. When you add cheese, it&#39;s two slices of cheesy goodness instead of the traditional one. 

The fries are good but the onion petals are amazing!  A must try if you&#39;re an onion ring fan. Beatiful crispy little petals perfectly battered and dipping size.

The staff is pretty laid back and friendly. You also get a fun celebrity name to identify your order. Indoor and outdoor seating. A great place to grab a bite on your own, with friends, or with your fam. 

I am already planning my next visit!"

Oh sure the ordering process is fast and easy because you fill out your own burger wrapper form and give it to the cashier. But it takes about 15 minutes on a busy day and by God by the time you see all the other orders bring delivered to tables, you are literally drooling. And I wasn&#39;t even hungry when I went there but I remembered it was on my list to eat here. 

If locally owned Smashburger with their fire hot fry grill burgers are getting too corporate for you, go back to the inspiration- this place. Burgers are cooked on a super hot flat grill, with a sweet crisp caramelization that instantly melts the cheerleaders err cheese (autocorrect) and burns your tongue on the first couple bites. But damn it hurts so good. 

My two burgers were a basic cheeseburger with a fried egg and one with just lettuce and tomato. No condiments on either. I liked the all hot burger the best but not sure what the fried egg added other than a mess since the yolk was dripping on all sides.  The lettuce is chopped up so it falls off with each bite. But it was still excellent. 

My only criticism is that these burgers and onion rings (also delicious) SCREAM for a beer or three!  But they don&#39;t have beer there. But they are in the same building as a liquor store so just pour a beer into a Starbucks cup like I did and you&#39;re - wait for it - GOLDEN."

Interesting atmosphere and the ordering process is good as well.  You fill out your order on the hamburger sleeve similar to Which Wich.  The staff was friendly and it didn&#39;t take long to order as the menu is just hamburgers and hot dogs.  They only offer bottled soda and canned drinks (milk and juice for the kids).  No beer which is odd considering they are across the street from the Coors plant.

I always say stick to what you do well and do it the best you can.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here.  The burgers here are in the solidly decent range but nothing that would warrant all these high ratings.  For those that have claimed this as the best burger in Colorado, you definitely need to get around more.  Even chains such as Larkburger and Five Guys easily out pace Bob&#39;s Burgers and at cheaper prices.  

The burgers themselves are thin and cooked medium well thus losing a lot of the flavor that could have been.  For toppings I added bacon, onion strips, and blue cheese crumbles.  Definitely all had the processed feel and taste.  With that saud the buns were pretty good.  I also ordered a side of the Jalapeno Tater-tots.  These were obviously a Sysco frozen food product.

This might have been the kind of place I would have loved when I was a college student but my tastes require better now and Bob&#39;s just doesn&#39;t cut it."

Walked in and immediately loved the atmosphere. It was quiet, but not eerily quiet; just quiet enough for you to relish in on your lunch break. It was quite nice!

The interior was very neat and clean, and the decor was very modernly fancy... not sure how else I could best explain it, lol. Elegant, but not overwhelming. Let&#39;s just say you don&#39;t necessarily feel the need to &#34;dress up.&#34;

Now, to the food. The hostess was very prompt in greeting me and bringing me the drink menu. The waitress literally followed right after, taking my drink order, and giving me a chance to look over the menu. I ordered the Lychee Martini and processed to look over the menu. (And HOLY CRAP was it good!) The second drink I ordered, the Cherry Blossom martini, was delicious as well!

Flash forward to the food being here. Did you see the pics? It looks delicious!! And believe me, it tasted the same. Everything about this place has really impressed me; from the quality and taste of the food to the extreme attentiveness of my server! 10/10 would definitely recommend!"

The web site never indicate how long it will be ready or being deliver, we have waited for 1 hour and 10 minuets, we lived 8 minutes away from the restaurant. I&#39;ve never order Asian food delivery in the U.S., so I don&#39;t know how long it should take, but that&#39;s a little too long for me.
We ordered Pad Thai and Green Curry with chicken. The Pad Thai doesn&#39;t have any bean spout or peanut in it, and they charge $1 to put peanut in which is ridiculous! They used Chinese red chili instead of fish sauce and Thai chili which made it taste like Chinese style Thai food. The Green Curry dish taste good, however it doesn&#39;t have any basil in it, but has jalapeno and Chinese long bean in it which is unheard of.
This review is just based on this one time delivery experience, maybe some other dishes (Chinese dishes) are great, however, based on the food I ordered, it&#39;s just like Thai wanna be Chinese food, I will not order again."

Other than that I don&#39;t have many positive things to say about this place. The outside of the building and the interior are a little run-down, which should have been my cue not to order anything fancy. 

I ordered soft shell crab, which was a mistake. It came with steamed vegetables and white rice (which was dry and tasted like it had spent too much time in the rice cooker). The crab was heavily, heavily breaded and super greasy - I ate the first one (the lime and chili dipping sauce tasted good), but the second was improperly cleaned and so tough I couldn&#39;t pull it apart. I sent it back and the server kindly removed it from our tab. I spent the rest of the meal watching my fiancé eat his entrée. 

His entrée was supposed to be a noodle dish with egg noodles, it came with what resembled spaghetti. We also ordered egg rolls, which were edible but tasted strongly of cinnamon (maybe too much five spice?) and seemed like they&#39;d been cooked in dirty / old cooking oil. 

The menu didn&#39;t feature many actual Thai dishes, so I guess it&#39;s more fusion - but the food was really disappointing. We won&#39;t be back."

My lunch date and I waited for almost ten minutes at the door, long enough to where a couple who got tired of waiting behind us actually left! We almost followed suit moments later until someone casually strolled over and sat us. The food was bland, I had the pineapple chicken and I think my date had the sweet and sour chicken. I think MOST, if not ALL of the dessert was out of the freezer and nothing decent. I wish this place was good because we work in the area and there isn&#39;t a great selection around. This place has great potential, I think they just need to hire more people to maintain the lunch crowd, and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN the place. You can&#39;t have webs everywhere!"

We ordered the fresh spring rolls, the coconut shrimp and the Panang curry (medium spicy). The spring rolls had mei-fun noodles in them instead of the softer rice vermicelli noodles, which made the roll dry and easily fall apart. They came with a peanut sauce that was on the sweeter side. The coconut shrimp were fantastic and came with a generous amount of sweet chili sauce (vinegar based--it was tangy). The amount of curry I got could easily have been at least two meals (and it was). The sweetness of it overshadowed the complex curry flavors that I was so looking forward to. The curry had onions, peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, bamboo and baby corn that didn&#39;t appear to be cooked all the way but was still good anyway! I&#39;d order from here again."

You can get Miso, you can get crab rangoon, the menu is accomodating for most anyone. I say this having eaten at numerous Thai restaurants in Hawai&#39;i where there are times I&#39;m not sure what we ordered. 

The curries have little peppers next to them in the menu. I tried ordering the mildest curry possible and was still shooting flames long after. When they say spicy, believe them. 

There are lunch prices &amp; dinner prices. Not sure if the whole menu is available at lunch. 

Thai Basil is housed in an old Bennegan&#39;s and there are still remnants of it&#39;s former life, but the atmosphere is very pleasant and calm for lunch meetings or a first date... Enjoy!!"

In that regard Thai Basil was a success -- there even was a shady spot I could see from our table in the restaurant, so I was able to keep an eye on my dogs.

We were here for a late lunch -- so somewhere between 2 and 3 in the afternoon.  Service was pleasant but slow, despite not being the least bit busy.  At one point, one of my companions actually got up to find someone to refill our water glasses.

The menu is pan-Asian.  I decided to try the satay beef lunch plate,  which included fried rice and a spring roll. The satay beef itself might have been better if the beef were sliced thinner, with less sauce and fewer onions, perhaps some other vegetables. The fried rice was dry and bland, and the spring roll just average. It could be that I just selected poorly -- another one of my friends had a rice noodle bowl, which looked like it might have been a better choice

This worked because I was famished, but I don&#39;t foresee that I will be back."

The miso soup was a little sweet, but the hot and sour soup was fabulous!

***50 CENT DRAFT BEERS***

These include Blue Moon and - need I say more? You do have to order food to get this deal, but most of their items are reasonably priced.

Now, this place is done up just like the other Thai Basils, as this is part of a chain. It has the fancy curtained booths and tree tables. However, this one is not half as busy and with that the service suffers. It&#39;s a catch 22.

The food is the same as the others. I am unsure what happened with the other reviewers, but this is the same exact menu as the one in Lone Tree or Denver. It&#39;s cheaper pricing, too.

When we got our receipt, we realized we were over charged and there was no one to complain to. We are so unhappy and can&#39;t believe there&#39;s nobody at this restaurant to give feedback to. If there isn&#39;t a manager, who is managing the business? Obviously NO ONE. We&#39;ll never eat at Thai Basil again and we hope nobody has to experience what   we went through. Unbelievable.

The only reason we left a tip is because we&#39;ve been in the serving industry before and we know what it&#39;s like to pay for someone else to eat out, and it&#39;s not OK. This restaurant needs a new manager. BAD."

Oh how I was wrong! I ended up giving this place a second try. I have ordered from them every week since. I am in love with the chicken coconut soup but, I get it with veggies. Everything we have ordered has been amazing. 

Also, I do not eat gluten. They marked every item I could have on their menu. They are amazing!!

After my experience with this place, I will never give this location my business ever again, I would rather drive to the one at Park Meadows and I suggest you do the same. 
We use to order from this place pretty frequently due to the fact that they deliver.  I&#39;ve had pretty annoying but petty instances where they charge me an extra .50 for hot sauce and failed to delivery it every single time. But that was all small stuff I could look past.  Until, I ordered the spicy garlic shrimp to have it delivered and when it got here I counted only 3 shrimps in a soup of onions, and green peppers (cold may I add).  I know that ordering seafood, I wasn&#39;t to get a bucket of shrimp, but only 3? for $10?!
What really upset me was the customer service after that.  I called trying to get a hold of a manager just to explain how unacceptable I thought this was only to be responded with a &#34;sure, we&#39;ll call you back......&#34; only to never receive a call.  When I called back it was a &#39;We&#39;re busy, call back&#34; How long does it take to refund someone? I finally called back 2 days later pretty frustrated to hear the same old story of how the manager is busy and &#34;they will call be back&#34;.
 Needless to say, this location is awful. Bad food and customer service.  Thank you to the manager Mick who never called me back to apologize or actually give me my money back.  You won&#39;t be having any more of my business!"

CONS

1) BUILDING. It seems run down. Things are chipped and paint missing in some places.

2) TASTE. I ordered Pad See Ew, and I struggled to finish it. The noodles seemed overcooked and the sauce was overwhelmingly soy sauce based. It was very disappointing. My girlfriend got scallops, and it had very little taste. 

3) PORTIONS. Not that it mattered because of the dismal taste, but the portions were very small. My pad see ew had very little beef and shrimp - even though I paid $9.50 for it.

We called them right away about the packaging and the only thing the guy could say was, sorry can&#39;t do anything about it.  umm?? Really?? And the Thai spring roll, we asked why its so full of noodles and 1/2 of a damn shrimp and he (the manager)  laughed saying that this restaurant is Vietnamese fusion and its mainly a Viet restaurant...Are you kidding me?? &#34;Thai Basil&#34; I see nothing from the restaurant title that shows that it&#39;s Viet Fusion. This restaurant and manager is a joke. WTF kind of manager says...sorry can&#39;t do nothing.  We told them that we will never order food from them again and will let everyone else know.

We are fans of the Thai Basil at Park Meadows.  Really fans - gave it a four.

This place, I believe, is a relative, but it just doesn&#39;t cut it.  The service was indifferent and slow.  The food was blase; even the Thai Iced Tea, for which I am an acknowledged fiend, was so bland and wrong that I didn&#39;t finish it.  Literally the first time I have ever ordered it and not finished it, anywhere.

The Vietnamese eggrolls tasted like they had filler in them.  I was looking forward to trying Shrimp with a Tamarind Sauce, figuring the food was so good at its sister restaurant I couldn&#39;t go wrong.  It wasn&#39;t terrible - in fact nothing other than the tea was terrible - but is was truly uninspired and swimming in too much average sauce.  My wife&#39;s chicken curry dish had a sauce similar to one we enjoy at the other place, but the it was badly prepared, with the meat chewy, and the whole dish a bit cold.

So, no dead mouse in the salad, why a &#39;1&#39;?  Not only can you do better at any number of places within a short drive, it can&#39;t hold a candle to the place at the mall (surprising turn of phrase I suppose).

When we sat down, we overheard a server apologizing to another table because they didn&#39;t like their meal.  Silly, we thought, Thai Basil is a treat.

Sadly, they were right.  Drive to the one at Park Meadows.  This place is not worth a first look."

In the case of Thai Basil, the hint is in the title.  We ordered two Thai standards, Pad See Ew and Green Curry.  The PSE was boring and the proteins tasted more like Chinese stir-fry.  The Green Curry was criminally sweet, and, as another commenter noted, spiced with oh-so-authentic jalapenos (and not even spicy!).  What the what?!

Here&#39;s how to solve your Thai dining problem: From this terrible place, drive north on Havana, turn right on Montview, and park in front of the Thai Food place at Montview &amp; Nome.  THAT place is the bomb.  (Am I allowed to reference other restaurants in reviews?)"

Mr. Mixer and I went there last night on a whim and we had a good time.  I started with wonton soup (against my better judgment, I know better!) and it was one big ball of dumpling.  Mr. Mixer got some sort of spicy soup with shrimp in it and fared better.

I had the drunken noodles for dinner.  they were a little sweet for my taste, but really not bad.  They had a good amount of garlic and basil in them.  The spice level was minimal, so next time I think I&#39;ll ask for a little hotter.  Mr. Mixer had some beef, cooked with a pepper sauce and served on a very hot platter table-side so they sizzled.  That dish was good, too.  Again, not spicy enough, but Mr. Mixer just doused it with sriracha and was happy.

Now the drink specials, those were great!  $1 for any beer on the menu, $2 for house wines and $3 for well drinks.  Nice!  Our entire bill came to $31, for two soups, two entrees, two beers and two wines.  Woo-hoo, cheap date place!

Normally I try to steer clear from combo Asian restaurants (Thai + Viet + Chinese + Sushi?!  Hell no...)  But recently I saw an an ad in the Denver Chinese newspaper about their new dim sum menu... since I live only 5 minutes away, figured I&#39;ll gamble $20 and give it a try.... O.M.G. that was definitely a pleasant surprise... 

I ordered my usual faves... shrimp dumplings, pork hash, steamed pork ribs, deep fried shrimp balls, etc... and yes, I even had the chicken feet... Had the shrimp dumpling first and ooh, it wasn&#39;t bad... the skin could stand to be a bit less mushy but definitely a bit above average.... pork hash next, still good.... moving on from one dish to the next exceeding my expectations...  Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re not spectacular but then again, Denver&#39;s no LA or NYC, so I don&#39;t really expect spectacular dim sum here.... but within Denver or even some other dim sum places in other cities, this is up there....

OK, so I&#39;ve been deliberating this all afternoon, and I think I&#39;m ready to say this out loud now.... I think this dim sum place could be even better than Super Star&#39;s.... I&#39;ve been a loyal customer to Super Star&#39;s dim sum, but I think Thai Basil won me over... oh and it helps that their prices are a bit cheaper if not just the same (about $27 accounting for like 8 dishes, tea, and a soda WITH refills.... how many Asian restaurants you&#39;ve been to that do soda refills instead of canned?!)

I didn&#39;t get a chance to try their &#34;look fun&#34; or the other half of their dim sum menu.... Seeing how they won round one, I&#39;ll  go for round two and try the rest next time.... about their regular menu food, it&#39;ll take a bit longer for me to work up the courage to give them a try.... I want this honeymoon period to last for a while......"

Well, I am relocating to Broomfield from SE Denver/Aurora (the no-man&#39;s land called &#34;unincorporated Arapahoe County&#34;, where taxes are low and street lighting is scanty at best), so I thought I&#39;d push myself out of my normal well-traveled paths and hit up some places in the SE before I departed this realm.  And since it had been a while since I&#39;d done Thai, I went here.  This place is just a few blocks south of where Havana intersects with Parker Rd, to those who don&#39;t want to deal with maps.

The first thing you notice when you walk in here is the lighting is very muted.  I think it&#39;s that way for a reason.  Everything light-oriented is in some kind of lovely Oriental style lantern -- and it is soft, muted yellowish light -- like if you were holding a light up behind old-timey parchment.  Or had a light in a Japanese lantern, for example.  it adds to having a relaxing dining atmosphere.  The place was approximately 1/2 to 2/3 full when I went on Friday night, but everyone apparently knows how to converse in civilized tones here; either that or the acoustics are amazing, and this was sampled from the bar area (dead ahead from the entrance).  Would I recommend this place to someone who wanted to get to know someone else, over dinner?  Absolutely.  You can hear each other. :)

I did stand around for about 3 minutes while waiting to be directed for my take-out order, but that&#39;s ok because I was scribbling down notes for Yelpers. ;)  Various shelving units display random Oriental art objects, bamboo sticks fill tall holding containers, and semi-opaque draperies grace 2 of the tables on either side of the entrance for an even more private dining experience for your party.

The food items are reasonably priced and there are a goodly selection of them.  I ordered the satay beef because I was craving peanut sauce.  It comes with broccoli and cauliflower (?) pieces mixed in; but thankfully, more beef than vegetable - a goodly portion that lasted me 2 meals.  The peanut sauce for the beef however was a disappointment because it was somewhat thin -- not exactly sure what happened there.  I wanted peanut to be the dominant flavor there...pity.  The beef was very tender though and the vegetables cooked just right.  (And yes, there are vegetarian dishes as well on the menu).

Ordered 2 spring rolls which were approximately the same quality as you get at Swing Thai - fairly thick, lots of rice noodles, shrimp stuffed in, very good tasting, wrapped in rice paper.  Weirdly, the peanut dipping sauce for *that* was thicker...which I appreciated.  Yummy.

I also ordered the chicken and mushroom soup, which seems to be a divine affair based on cream?...something very creamy anyways, with big chunks of chicken in and button mushrooms to satisfy the fungophiles out there.  Definitely recommended if you like warm. smooth tasting soups.

My order took approximately 10-15 minutes, which I felt was reasonable -- 2 others came in and did takeout as well while I was waiting.  If you find yourself in the neighborhood, drop in and check it out -- it&#39;s quite tasty and satisfying, and I regret not coming here sooner."

Open and airy. They have these 2 cool looking tented dinning tables next to the entrance. I want to eat under one next time.

I had a Pa Nang curry. They make it with sweet potatoes instead of russet potatoes. I liked the variance. However, the curry was a little too sweet. Not bad.

Food was alright. I prefer J&#39;s Noodle or Taste of Thai though.
Stay away from Swing Thai."

First off, this place is about as authentic as Taco Bell is to Mexican food, but we went because it&#39;s one of the few places nearby open on Sunday.  Don&#39;t order spring rolls because literally it&#39;s rice noodles and 1 shrimp wrapped in rice paper.  But the worst was when I was chewing something that didn&#39;t feel right and I pulled out a piece of a steel scrubber.  Sure glad I didn&#39;t swallow it.  I showed this to the waitress who quickly grabbed it off the table and said they would tell the manager.

We just moved to Denver about a month ago from Los Angeles. I had the Indonesian salad and my husband ordered the Pad Thai. We also had the sriracha chicken wings as an appetizer. The wings have a light batter on then and were spicy! I liked them, but my husband doesn&#39;t like breaded hot wings. My salad was very good! The pad thai was really bland. It seemed watered down. I also had a bowl of the coconut chicken soup. It just tasted like watered down coconut milk boiled with some chicken, mushrooms and nearly raw onions. It&#39;s missing the chili, cilantro and lemongrass that I&#39;m used to from places in LA. I wouldn&#39;t get it again. The happy hour special on drinks is well worth it, and they have a two-person dinner special that includes two entrees, shared appetizer and dessert . I&#39;d be willing to order a couple more entrees to go to taste before coming back though."

Once again, another Asian cuisine gives into western influence. The service was slow, however, they supplemented with a round of free drinks. who could be upset at that?

The food was so disappointing! I had dinner with four other people all of our dishes we ordered tasted absolutely the same.  AND we all ordered different dishes. There wasn&#39;t any influence of &#34;Thai&#34; in any of our dishes. Oh, i&#39;m sorry, it had peanuts.

Bar none, the foulest Thai food I have ever had the displeasure of eating (what I actually did eat of it).

The Chicken Tom Ka soup was utterly flavorless, like they waved a coconut and some chicken in the general vicinity of the bowl. Asked for the soup to be hot and could barely find any chilies anywhere. I ate 2 spoonfuls and put the lid back on, it wasn&#39;t even worth it to fish out the chicken.

I also had the Panang Curry (and to call it a curry does great injustice to all the good curries of the world) It was pasty, chalky, sickneningly sweet, no spices to speak of and barely cooked veggies. Once again, ate 2 bites and off to the trash bin it went. 

Overall, I would give a BIG no to this place, try Thai Flavor or Thai Pepper II instead, I have had good experiences with both."

I was pretty excited because I frequented many Thai restaurants during my undergrad life. As soon as I got to the place and found out the location was not Thai food but Thai fusion my heart kind of sank a bit. They offered a variety of Asian dishes like pho and lo mein. I ordered the beef pad see ew which ended up being way too sweet and saucy for myself. I think I also ended up with regularly broccoli too. I guess they are just catering to their clientele. The decoration was also cheesy with a huge Chinese looking door for their entrance.

My custom Which Wich was on point today, as it usually is. Turkey, Double Swiss, Lettuce, Salt and Pepper, Pickles and Regular Mayo on White. The best!

It&#39;s a much needed addition to the existing fast food places in the plaza. This is definitely better than your typical subway sandwiches. Though it may cost more (6 inch is about 6 dollars), but which wich has so many more interesting ingredients! And the milkshakes are amazing! It is still a very affordable price. I get very full off of a 6 inch sub and I appreciate how they cut it for you. 

I came during lunch hour on a weekday and thankfully I ordered online beforehand because it made the process so much quicker. The wait would have been at least 20 minutes. The online ordering process is very simple. You pick everything you want on your sandwich starting with choice of meat and they spell out everything that cost extra so that you aren&#39;t aware of unexpected charges. Most vegetables are free so you can definitely pile that healthy stuff on! I also really appreciate that their bread comes in wheat. The bag the sandwich comes in is also very hipster =) I love the pineapple milkshake which has real pineapple pieces (say what?!) and it&#39;s not too sweet or anything.

I&#39;m happy they opened another location nearby campus because now I can conveniently get fresh pineapple or pineapple/banana milkshakes ($4 for a medium). They&#39;re delicious and unique!!! I crave them all the time. Their other milkshake flavors are good too (chocolate, strawberry and vanilla) &amp; they give you the option of adding banana to any of them or turning them into a malt. 

I don&#39;t prefer this sandwich spot over Togo&#39;s but because Togo&#39;s doesn&#39;t exist in Denver I would have to say this is the next best sandwich spot. I much prefer this sandwich spot over Jimmy John&#39;s or Subway. 

You customize your sandwiches using a bag that has check marks on it. You can choose what cheese, bread, meat, sauce, veggies etc you want on it (see attached picture). You can get onion strings on your sandwich for no additional cost and you can pretty much add as many veggies as you like without additional cost either (with one or two exceptions). I like the option they have of &#34;skinny-ing&#34; your sandwich. This reminds me of the french baguette sandwiches you see at fancy Delis. It&#39;s much easier to eat when skinny-Ed. 

Only semi-downside of my experience today was how it was a little weird when they called my name to get my milkshake before they were done making my sandwich. Also, my milkshake cup had drippings down the side. 

Again- get the pineapple milkshakes."

I went on a Thursday evening around 6pm or so and was one of 3 customers for the 20 min or so I was there.
I got the tomato and avocado and added in veggies. One of the things I absolutely LOVE is that they offer potato chips as one of their add-ins. However, they are chips that are smashed so they are like little crumbles on your sandwich, so fantastic! So much better than placing the whole chip on your sandwich. I also got my bread toasted, which was a nice option. You can get your sandwich either as a &#34;hot wich&#34; or &#34;cold wich&#34;. I was under the impression that the whole sandwich goes in the toaster and since I can&#39;t imagine toasted avocado tasting very good, I made sure to tell the guy that I just wanted the bread toasted.
Anyways, over all, the sandwich was delicious. A little over priced for veggie in my opinion. I&#39;m not a big believer in paying the same price for a veggie option when it&#39;s basically all of the stuff the meat-eaters get minus the meat but for the same price - it is what it is.
Minus one star for very dirty tables and one of the guys behind the counter (I&#39;m assuming a manager since he was wearing a collared shirt) not wearing a cap/something to prevent stray hair from getting into the food. 
Since the restaurant was very empty and slow, I don&#39;t see any reason for the tables to be dirty since it could have easily been remedied."

I&#39;ve eaten at all three locations, but this one is closest to where I used to live in Thornton and the one most frequented. Been eating here since the mid-90&#39;s.

Not much to add that other people haven&#39;t already said, just good, solid food, crisp service, and very reasonable prices.

Although I do have to take exception to the review that characterized the green chile as &#34;orange gravy&#34;. While it&#39;s not blow yer sox off good, it&#39;s tasty, just spicy enough, and goes great over the &#34;Super A&#34; omelet, which I always order here. Love the hashbrowns, not prefab, the grilled homefry style, the best. 

And, hey, this ain&#39;t Starbuck&#39;s. You want good coffee, make it at home. The Block&#39;s coffee&#39;s main function is to burn off residual alcohol and wake up yer tastebuds.

I got the smothered breakfast burrito w sausage. The &#34;green chili&#34; was just orange gravy w less flavor. I seriously felt like I was drinking liquid flour.

But as my husband stated so simply, &#34;It&#39;s not called the Butcher&#39;s Garden&#34;, true that! 

Aside from the salad, everything was very tasty, served hot, filling, and very affordable.

We both got a side order of fries and while they weren&#39;t the best we&#39;ve ever had, they were crispy and flavory.

For lunch get their big Block Buster burger. Just a good solid burger. Their regular beef chili is great as well and can be put on an open face hamburger, I recomend that as well. Their chicken tenders clearly come from a frozen bag and they fry them up there, but I don&#39;t care they are some of the best frozen tenders around.

I ordered the steak fajitas. Steak cooked a little too much, but was very flavorful. Refried pinto beans and rice were as expected. If you like avocados, you&#39;ll appreciate the large chunks added to the pico that was on the lettuce.

Husband ordered the steak burrito. It came wet with green chile sauce. It was filled with steak, refried beans and rice. He liked the chile sauce. The cheese on top looked like the preshredded cheese you get in the store rather than some sort of traditional cheese.

All in all, it was a good meal. But we&#39;ll keep looking for a new favorite place to get our fajita and burrito fixes."

This has to be one of the best places in Littleton area.  Limited menu, hole in the wallish places are the best.   I like it when they keep it simple.   Not busy at all when we went for early lunch.   Unassuming location in a strip mall complex, next  door to a little liquor store.  Which is great, since no liquor in the restaurant.  1.75 tacos. (beef tongue!),2.50 for fish tacos.  3.00 amazing banana leaf wrapped tamale.  I got the skirt steak taco, great.  Skirt steak can be chewy and fatty, this was not.  The tacos come with plentiful onions and cilantro, they put my cilantro and onions on the side, not knowing that I am a cilantro and onion kinda gal!  (but very thoughtful in my opinion)   Boyfriend la-la-loved the pork tacos.  They were choc full of meat.  Triple the amount of meat than anywhere else I&#39;ve gone.  Tamales are either pork or chicken, we both got pork and they were so.good.  The lime served with perfectly balanced it.  Also ordered salsa and chips.  I normally get annoyed when mexican places don&#39;t offer free salsa, but tech this place isn&#39;t mexican, and it was only 1.75.  The salsa was different, and fresh and tasty.  But it is different.  My love for street tacos is only surpassed by my intense love of pho so I&#39;m pretty critical.  Pinches is good, but too hip and waaaaay overpriced.  My favorite place near mi casa is cheaper than Pinches but still 3$ more expensive (i.e. 2 tacos!) than here.  They serve breakfast too, which I can only imagine to be fantastic.  We ordered so much food it seemed... and got out of there for under 20$.  Serious deal, seriously good.   They have a case of pastries that I can&#39;t wait to try.

Adovada tacos and steak tacos:  made the way tacos should be, corn tortillas, cilantro and onions with a sliced lime (tip: they put a lot of cilantro and onions on their tacos which I love, but beware if you don&#39;t)
Tamale:  I&#39;m no expert on the difference between Mexican tamales and Guatemalan tamales but the masa is softer (maybe because they&#39;re steamed in plantain leaves instead of corn husks?  That&#39;s a question b/c I don&#39;t know).  These are larger than your &#34;typical&#34; tamale and have a nice portion of meat inside
Papusa:  The first time I was there they didn&#39;t have any because &#34;the lady didn&#39;t bring them in&#34; which to me is code for &#34;homemade, made from scratch.&#34;  The second time I ordered the loroco papusa (i had to google it).  It was exceptional and not what i was expecting given the description.

Not only is the food good, but it&#39;s also affordable.  For a taco, papusa, fish taco, tamale, and drink it was $10.  The first time I went, I had two tacos, a tamale, a drink and took home a pastry and it was $9."

The options for Korean food in Aurora is definitely sub-par but now with soban open, I have a restaurant I want to go eat Korean at. I really enjoy the variety of banchan they offer, vegetables that you would never expect to be a banchan tastes amazing. 

In la they didn&#39;t have the yulmoo neng myun but I tried that this evening and it was so refreshing in this hot summer weather. Their fish dishes are great and we really enjoyed the bossam (pork). The one thing I wish they kept on the menu from la is the ssam bap (variety of lettuce wraps) but I think the quality and variety of produce in Colorado makes it harder to have that item on the menu."

The service was pleasant. There&#39;s this little button on the wall to call on the waiters or to ask for bill. I thought it was ingenious when I first encountered this button-thing in Tokyo &amp; Seoul&#39;s subway.

I realized that Soban came from LA, but the price is too excessive for Denver metropolitan ($18+ for a bowl of fish roes, 1 shrimp, 1 mussel, $16+ bulgogi). The flavour was just alright, nothing special about it. Well, unless I crave for fish roes soup, I&#39;d rather go to other K-restaurant."

We found SOKO earlier in the day while we were exploring 16th street. It&#39;s in a &#34;strip mall&#34; on the bottom floor of a big office building. You enter through the lobby on Champas Street. We showed up on a busy Friday night without a reservation, and got one of the last available tables.

The interior isn&#39;t much to look at but it&#39;s pleasant. There&#39;s a corrugated metal wall on one end with three booths, displays of sake bottles on the walls, lots of small tables for two, noren over the sushi bar and at the entrance, etc. It&#39;s a fairly typical set-up. Nothing special.

My husband and I both ordered the sashimi sampler (19 pieces), with miso soup, a salad with ginger dressing, and a bottle of sake to share.

The miso soup and salad were good. The sake was delicious. The sashimi was ... OK. Some of the fish was way too cold to be served properly, and some of the fish wasn&#39;t as fresh as it could have been, but it was edible. 

The service was excellent. A young Japanese lady took care of us and was shocked when we spoke a bit of Japanese to her. The expression on her face was priceless!

I heard these guys had natto, blue fin and fresh wasabi so I decided to check them out. Hey, it&#39;s Denver and I live in the east coast so these fish traveled a bit to get here. I gave extra stars for this. The natto roll was good. The salmon sashimi was fair. The bluefin was....I&#39;m not sure it was bluefin. Maybe yellow fin on a good day. 
The sake was watered down but this is pretty normal operating procedure at most places. The vegetable roll had supermarket veggies but nothing from Japan. The FRESH wasabi is well guarded; when you ask for it the chef gives you a small amount. The UNI was not worth 14 dollars. It was fresh but low quality. 

The waitress was super friendly and attentive. Her name was Kyrie and she was superb. I give 2 stars for her and 1 for the place in general. 

The sushi chefs are from Mexico. This is what they said.  The main chef said he was from Japan but looked South American and spoke fluent Spanish. Perhaps he really is from Okinawa like he said and is a polyglot. 

So look, it&#39;s Denver. If you like crunchy, mayo filled, fattening rolls this place works. If you want above supermarket quality it&#39;s fine. 

It&#39;s just not Shogun in Greenville NC. 

I continue my trek to find a better place in the USA. 

Maybe I will visit Japan one day. 

Sorry for this not being short, or sweet. I hope this helps sushi and sashimi enthusiasts."

Most of the rolls that I ordered had way too much sauces and over powered the actual fish. The sushi rice tasted weird. They definitely didn&#39;t make that right, it&#39;s missing some vinegar... Anyways, it&#39;s probably not even authentic either. I guess I could be a sushi snob since I come from the Bay Area where there are better sushi options here.

The food would be a 3.5 but I met Kyriee, she has the most beautiful smile of a host that I have ever met and she&#39;s smiling all the time.

Mediocre fish with somewhat expensive prices and nothing too impressive. We came because it was right near where we were staying downtown and figured they could accommodate 8 people during rush hour. 

They were kind enough to split the checks. However the sushi came out at different times and the same rolls were drastically different. One of our rolls (we ordered 2) had unagi that was burnt to a crisp. When we pointed this out they hesitated to take it back and remake it. 

Service was kind but nothing overly accommodating. The restaurant is quaint and kind of has an odd set up. There is a lot of open room in the middle. The restroom is also downstairs and requires a server to key you into the elevator, which they weren&#39;t always readily available to help. 

Not terrible but not my new go to sushi restaurant. Will probably go else where next time. The best part of our meal was the spicy edamame."

I guess they just weren&#39;t ready yet. 

I didn&#39;t feel like having sushi and wanted to get something hot instead, so I ordered the shrimp tempura udon and my friend ordered the ramen from the daily specials menu. After we ordered, the waitress brought us side salads. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the salad dressing unfortunately. It was bland and not memorable. About 10 minutes later, our food arrived. Well not ALL our food. We had ordered a salmon roll too, but the waitress forgot to put in the order.

The broth in the udon wasn&#39;t great. It was pretty salty and had too much soy sauce. The noodles themselves were fine and the tempura was only okay. Perhaps next time I come, I&#39;ll try that salmon roll."

Soko Suhi is unassuming, tucked in a cluster of restaurants at the corner of 16th and Champa- It can be confusing so just follow the signs and you will go down Champa a quarter block, past the very popular Floyd&#39;s barber shop, an you have arrived!

What Soko lacks in ambiance, it makes up in simplicity and quality. The lunch menu is not too complicated, and there are several SUSHI SETS to choose from.  I had the Sushi Set- about 8 SUCCULENT California Rolls, and 6 ngiri style sushi-  Check out the photo- YUM!  I could not BELIEVE this great deal!  For $12, 8 rolls plus Ahi, Salmon, Yellow Fin, Crab, Ebi, and ?I forgot.  But all of them were tender and melt-in-your mouth good.

My lunch friend had the Sashimi Set and was delivered about 9 pieces of very generous delicious cuts.  Both sets came with miso soup and salad. 

This is one of the best sushi deals in town, and a great lunch spot- no nonsense- you can easily do this in an hour.    Very proud of my find!!  See you there!"

It&#39;s one of the few places along 16th street mall that&#39;s open until 10pm, so if you&#39;re looking for some late night grub, look no further.

Disclaimer: Soko is supposed to be a sushi bar, but I&#39;ve actually never ordered sushi here. I consistently get 2 items here: agedashi tofu as an appetizer (only $5 for 4 huge cubes of tofu) and tonkatsu ramen (the only ramen dish they have lol). The tofu is lightly battered and cooked to perfection, though sometimes the quality can be inconsistent. The ramen is delicious and jam packed with meat, veggies, and a full soft boiled egg. One of my biggest pet peeves of most ramen places is that they only give you 1 dinky slice of meat with a sprinkling of veggies and charge you $15+ for a bowl. The tonkatsu ramen is only $12 and you definitely get your money&#39;s worth. I&#39;ve also tried their salmon ceviche, which is excellent - fresh salmon with the right amount of citrus.

Though the selection is quite limited and slightly confusing (since they also seem to serve Korean food), as long as they keep serving that ramen and tofu, I&#39;ll keep coming back."

The waitress first came around with a miso soup (comes with bibimbap) and a house salad (comes with chicken katsu).

When the chicken katsu came out, it was cold, so we asked to have it reheated and the owner just remade the dish for us. (Super nice!) My sister thought it was very yummy! The bibimbap came out, which looked good. It had fresh greens and, what looked like, bulgogi.

The wait for the food was on the longer side, as business started picking up, but the service was good. Our server smiled, so it seemed like she was enjoying her job.

Bottom Line: if you eat Asian food a lot, go with the kitchen food. If you don&#39;t eat Asian a lot, get whatever you&#39;d like! Everything is yum-diddly-dum."

And The sushi HH menu could be a little bigger. They take $1.00 off the draft beers. I think its unlimited Sake as well but don&#39;t remember. 

Went with the Cream Cheese Egg rolls for an Appetizer. 
They were delicious. 

For Sushi I went with the Mango Roll, and the Philly Roll and the Spider roll. 
They were delicious and not packed with too much rice, which some establishments do. 
The Server was attentive to my needs without being overly pushy. 

Had to go with Dessert when I seen bread pudding on the menu. 
The serving could of been a little bigger, but it was definitely delicious."

I&#39;m glad I did.  Not because the sushi was great, but because you just have to ignore opinions of others sometimes.

Our server was super sweet, the sushi was the typical $4-$6 per order of two (not overpriced as others said).  The chef is from Okinawa.  The decor is a bit strip mallish as it is in a new building but still felt comfortable.  

But these people complaining about not having a bathroom?  Let me clear on this.  You walk past the host desk, take the elevator down one floor (the same floor as another restaurant) and they are ten feet to the left.  Unfairly dinged in my opinion.

I did think the sushi could have used more zing, the rice more vinegar, the spicy roll more siracha, the poke more lime and spice.  

But for downtown Denver, a good choice.  Oh and a small house sake list that hit the spot."

The sushi was very good and the service was great. However...... When it came time to pay we were extremely disappointed to discover they would not take our groupon because it was for dinner only and we were there during lunch time. I completely understand rules, I&#39;m a restaurant manager. But where I work we do anything and everything to make the customer happy, ESPECIALLY when they come for a special occasion. If you have the opportunity to hook up a guest they will remember that and recommend your establishment to everyone they know.

The fish is as fresh as I&#39;ve had in Denver, and the rice/vinegar/warm is as consistently good as I&#39;ve found anywhere in the Mile High.

Service is always very pleasant (perhaps because they&#39;ve come to know me) and ambiance is this modern, granite and wood Japanese... Style-thing that seems to be the big new way of decorating your Asian style restaurant.

They&#39;ve got plenty of playful fusion-y dishes too.  I do really enjoy this place, and in my opinion this is as good as Japanese food gets in Denver (for the time being, anyway.  And minus noodles...) I just wish they would get in Blue Fin more frequently."

I&#39;m surprised on the type of bad reviews this place is getting.  Hope people are ordering things that they know how to eat lol.  

Pros:
-If I could give this place 6 stars I would for their White tuna Nigiri- Delicious!
-Sushi has always been fresh when I go, which is weekly
-Sometimes I need to order to-go food, and I love the Lunch set.  Filet tip w/ toban steak sauce is fantastic.  It comes with Miso soup, cali roll and a salad all for $12.  What a steal compared to the choices to eat around here. 

Cons:
-Bathroom is downstairs.  There is an elevator (you may have seen it already on the way in, its 5 steps away from the restaurant) that goes down and the bathroom is to the left 10 steps away.  Nothing to cry about unless you really need to go lol. 
-think I&#39;m done with this section for now.  Will edit later if I find something.  

Oh and a tip for the guy that said the salmon was tasteless or that Yellow tail had a plastic texture-  you orderd a nigiri so learn to eat a nigiri.  
-Mix a little bit of wasabi with some soy sauce (may require some experimenting to get the right mixture for you)
-dip the nigiri into mixture
-enjoy
~if you don&#39;t like the texture of the yellow tail try the White tuna nigiri- Delicious!
-P.S: your quest for good sushi may have issues with the hero behind the quest lol"

If you know real sushi, it&#39;s the rice that makes it. That being said, Soko didn&#39;t have amazing rice, but their sushi was pretty good. We had the truffle hamachi, sake nigiri, hamachi nigiri and a specialty roll. Keep in mind, when we judge sushi, it&#39;s never by rolls. Nigiri and sashimi are how sushi joints should be judged. I would definitely hit this place up again if we ever came back. They are new so the place was not packed at all. Hoping business picks up for them so they stick around. 

Also, the probably have the best bread pudding the wife and I have ever had. We would go back just for that! 

Denver folks. Give it a try. You might be surprised."

Having lived and worked downtown for many years now, I give Soko Sushi &amp; Sake Bar 18 months tops before the doors are closed. No restroom (read below), a malfunctioning credit card machine, a strip-mall like feel with some $25+ entrees on the menu, no descriptions to accompany their (average) sushi menu and a horrible music selection playing aren&#39;t components I look for in a sit-down eatery and I&#39;d bet you&#39;d agree. 

If these &#34;qualities&#34; don&#39;t hold you away and you still wanna give a new place a try, I recommend you at least come only for Happy Hour from 3:30pm - 6:30pm which includes 2 for 1 drafts (Blue Moon, Sapporo and Fat Tire) and $1 individual sushi pieces. You might as well try to keep the check low as I hope your expectations are. And now the restroom information... Patrons should know before they come here for a meal that they do not have a restroom but rather send you outside the restaurant and down an elevator where you enter a passcode to use a shared facility that in my case, smelled like marijuana and urine badly."

Had the lunch combo that came with soup, salad, fried veggies, rice, sushi x4, and teriyaki chicken for $12.96 (not including tip). The soup was good, just the classic miso with tofu. The salad was crisp and definitely had enough dressing. I especially liked the purple string swirls on top - not sure what they were exactly. The sushi was good - I had the California roll - I would have liked them rolled tighter though, so they wouldn&#39;t fall apart as easy when dipping into the wasabi/soy sauce mix. The teriyaki chicken was delicious. The chicken itself was grilled nicely, and it sat upon a bed of some of the crispest green beans I&#39;ve ever had - they were literally farmers market quality. The sticky rice was soft and gummy. I originally didn&#39;t know that fried tempura items were included, but I got a long shrimp, carrot, zucchini, and onion ring that were nice additions. It was nice that they had wifi, and overall a quieter setting to relax at lunch. The hostess was a very sweet gal that wasn&#39;t intrusive when filling up water, asking how my food was, etc. Will definitely be back!"

So I booked a hotel room downtown, bought tickets for a cabaret show at the clock tower, and made reservations for The 9th Door in an effort to redeem myself.

We genuinely wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but instead decided to put in our order more conservatively, a couple of plates at a time, and i&#39;m glad we did! We ended up feeling completely full on not as many items as I had originally thought we&#39;d need! We thoroughly enjoyed the Pimientos de Piquillo Rellenos (piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese) and Pera Rolls (pear, arugula, and cheese rolled in Serrano ham). The Chuletitas de Cordero (lollipop lamb chops with polenta) were very lacking and poorly butchered. The polenta, however, was divine!

The real winner, though, and the one thing that always seems to make everyone happy, is the Croqueta de Hongos (a mushroom and rice croquette with a sherry sauce). I basically almost stole the whole dish for myself. And I practically ordered another. Those things are without a doubt part of my last ideal meal on earth. Without. A. Doubt.

E and I both had a few glasses of red. I picked a really delicious Argentinian Pinot noir, and he picked a glass of something else before switching to the same Pinot as me. It was a perfect earthy red with a bit of fruit, and paired well with everything we ordered.

We had a great time - the atmosphere is a little dark and sexy and grown-up...very intimate. The food didn&#39;t knock our socks off but it was solid. Service was great, and the tab was around $90, which seemed reasonable especially after five glasses of wine. We enjoyed it and will definitely be back!"

We were greeting by a rather rude and unwelcoming host. The waitress seemed rather out of it, though she did say they called her in last minute. 
The food was delicious, but I was appalled at how much each plate was. 3 balls of fried cheese for $9? Balls that barely constitute as a bite? 
If you have money to burn, then sure, go. I&#39;ve been to plenty of other small plates restaurants that serve equal quality of food but in greater quantity. And they don&#39;t charge nearly as much."

The desserts (although I didn&#39;t try them because I couldn&#39;t find anything on the menu that intrigued me) seemed just a little uninspired (I feel like the lava cake had its moment a few years back..I&#39;m sure these chefs could be a little more creative).

Prices....I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m just used to splitting a tab here or if the prices have gone up too but for such a small amount of food the bill was astronomically high.

We sat ourselves as the sign on the front instructed. A young lady came by with waters and menus. She told us that there was a time constraint because the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes. 

We quickly looked over the menu. They had a nice menu of hot and cold tapas. I ordered the Datiles (Dates), Crispy Serrano ham-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and drunken goat cheese ($8). They came out a little dry, I did not taste the goat cheese at all. Although, the bacon was very crispy. Also, I ordered the Aguacate (avocado),  Flash-fried avocado with fresh pico de gallo and 2 jumbo shrimp. It was a beautiful presentation.

A good selection of Spanish wines the had me having to make hard decisions. 

They even have Torres Jaime I on the bar and anyone who knows brandy would be smiling. But I admit, no Le Panto or  Chinchon.  

I discovered they had A flight of sherry after I had already had a glass of a Rioja so that will be next time.

Lots of available staff and place was expectedly empty. Very friendly staff thst greets, seats, and serves. Not to mention the woman are goreous., but that&#39;s beside the point. Very nice decor and ambience inside. Low lighting inside makes for ideal dinner date local. Bar was roomy and had full service. Only noticed one beer on tap, a spanish one, similar to Stella Artois.

So the plates were small but sooooo so satisfying. They had several specials and those tapas ranged from less than $3 to around $6. Again, small but flavor profiles, plating, and selections were deliciois. I had something like a toomatoe capri for about $3. Then a squash and noodle dish for aboit $6 followed by a beef type dish for around $8 and finally (I was stuffed at this point but the food was so good) a mushroom and chicken with potatoe dish for around $12. Money well spent. On top of the waitress being super attentative, the dishes kept coming and not one was moderately disappointing. The food was above and beyond expectations and I&#39;m glad I stopped in. 

They also have an outside seeting area, and by the time I walked by again later in the evening around 9pm looking for a bar the place was packed out the door."

I had never tried &#34;tapa&#34; style meals before since I thought it would never be filling enough because I knew tapas were &#34;small portion plates.&#34; My friend had a Living Social deal which expired yesterday so that was actually what brought us here. We decided on five different plates which was a perfect amount and let us both try a little bit of everything! Instead of boring you with the list that we got, I will tell you my favorite was hands down the Callo de Hacha  (Chilled, seared sea scallops with crispy jamón, lemon aioli, and flash-fried arugula). Everything, however, was pretty good. Also, every dish came out lightning fast! We were in and out in less than hour. 

I should note that each plate in my opinion is just enough for 2 people. If you are in a larger group and a few of you want to try something, get more than just one plate of it!

Calamaris came with 3 different type of sauces to dip.  In hindsight I would have ordered double of those plates and nothing more and would have been satisfied!

What I didn&#39;t like: lamb meatballs were overpowered with this particular spice that I couldn&#39;t quite grasp just exactly what it was...service was a bit slow and the place wasn&#39;t even busy.

It is a pricer restaurant and the portions are not huge. 

We arrived around 5:15 so it was not crowded. We were seated at a table by the window. We asked if there were any drink specials and our server told us if we sat at the bar its 2-for-1, so we quickly made the move. 

Our bartender/server was very friendly and explained the pre-fixed menu. We deferred to him for a few recommendations and everything was delicious. We started with the fried avacado and the Spanish tortilla which were delicious and got me excited to try the next courses. They also brought out delicious warm bread we dipped in the sauce of the tortilla. It was some of the best sauce I have had and we kept ordering more bread, which our server brought out for us with a smile at no charge. The second course we had the shrimp and artichoke, the third course we tried the chicken and scallops and we had the flan and chocolate cake for desert. Everything was delicious and I recommend all these. 

Our drinks were delicious as well. The grapefruit cocktail was a little on the bitter side so I wouldn&#39;t order that again, but the sangria was well made. 

This is definitely on the pricer side as the portions are not huge and we saved a large amount with restaurant week and it was still over $40/per before tip/tax. I won&#39;t be a regular here but when guests are in town I&#39;d consider taking them here."

We went on a busy Saturday night and had great service and food.  We ordered  nine tapas for the four of us and thoroughly enjoyed every one.  One suggestion would be to forego the calamari and chakurerie for some the more unique dishes.  The risotto  and mushroom couchette was excellent and the ribs were out of this world.  The goat cheese stuffed peppers were also excellent.  But make sure you save room for the chocolate lava cake. 

Lydia was our server and took very good care of us and got us put in time to get to our show that evening. 

We drank martinis which were very generous in size. 

We did end up spending about $50 a piece but we did not skimp at all (7 martinis and 9 tapas)

We walked in and I liked the decor, the lighting is cozy and the walls are well decorated. Initially there was Spanish music which was a nice touch but for some reason the music turned off after 20 minutes. Considering that less than 1/2 of the tables were filled, this led to the place feeling a bit dead. We were seated next to the door which sadly led to us getting to enjoy a nice freezing draft of air whenever the door was opened. 

Service was average. 

The main reason for the rating is that the food quality and portion size were not reflective of the charged prices. I understand that when going to a tapas bar that I should not expect the largest of plates but these were truly portions for ants. The stuffed and spicy sweet peppers were difficult to find on the plate even with my 20/20 vision and the definition of meh. All in all, I will not be returning here for another meal.

In terms of taste the highlights were the bacon wrapped dates with stuffed goat cheese, and the sea scallops on a mushroom compote.

The low lights were the patatas bravas, the sauces were relatively bland and the spice rub on the potatoes left my palate bombarded with smoked paprika for the rest of the meal."

We travel the world trying restaurants and were surprised so many people rated it as being good. Perhaps the standards in Denver aren&#39;t that high for food. I just don&#39;t get it.  The only menu item that was even remotely tasty were the Pimientos Del Piquillo Rellenos.

We had beef skewers, bacon wrapped cheese thing, and artichoke hearts. Out of that selection, would you expect artichoke hearts to be the best? Me neither.

Conclusion: great for a classy night with some communal foods. I would rather try somewhere else instead of going back, but I wouldn&#39;t tell my friends to avoid the place."

We loved the decor of this place and for a tapas restaurant it was conducive for both those people on dates and for larger groups. 

We ordered the albondigas and scallops and both were really good, especially the meatballs. If we were hungrier we would have gotten more but opted to just chat over a glass of wine, which selection was pretty extensive. 

The service was really good and it was just a fun, perfect spot for a dinner. The only thing I would like to see is a different selection of music (not lounge) and maybe not quite so loud."

He changed the entire enviornment and made the restaurant feel like home and like I was actually in Spain. I was not impressed by the food overall, a little disappointed to be honest. 

First of all, even though I understand it&#39;s small plates, but they should have had more courses or given slightly bigger portions because I wasn&#39;t full at all. Compared to another restaurant I went for restaurant week, I was stuffed by the end for the same price and better food. 

For course 1, I had a choice between spanish omelet, jamon, fire roasted piquillo pepers, and flash fried avocado. Since I came with a large group of friends, we all got different things so we could try a bit of everything. I ordered the jamon for myself and was surprised it came out as little shredded pieces of meats that frankly didn&#39;t look or taste all that great. I absolutely loved the spanish omelet and piquillo peppers, however. I appreciated the fact we got unlimited little toasted bread pieces which went well with the jamon as well as other courses later on. 

For course 2, I had a choice between risotto with muschroom croquette, grilled shrimp, spicy sapnish sausage, or pan fried artichoke hearts. I got the shrimp which was very meh and bland in my opinion. The soup tasted good soaked with the bread but I wouldn&#39;t have gotten that. My boyfriend got the croquette which was a way better choice. it was very unique and I love the cheese that was on it. 

For course 3, I picked the beef filet and my boyfriend got the spaghetti squash. The squash was definitely the best I&#39;ve had before. However, the beef was not very tender but I understand they don&#39;t specialize in steak. I was glad I got blue cheese on the side, though, because it&#39;s very potent. I really liked the cheese on the squash as well =)

Lastly there were two options for dessert. We got both the chocolate cake and the flan. I was so dissapointed because the pictures looked so good but I didn&#39;t like either of them. I dont&#39; usually waste food but I couldn&#39;t finish either of them. The flan had a very odd texture. I usually love flan especially the japanese kind but this was very different. Even the strawberries weren&#39;t sweet =( The cake was WAY too rich so I could only take one bite. I actually found the tastes to be more bearable when I mixed the two. 

As for drinks, we tried both of the sangrias: peach and raspberry. Both were super diluted and tasted like a low calorie gatorade without any alcoholic punch. It was a dissapointment as well. 3 stars in reality......."

We were greeted immediately and taken to our table.  The atmosphere is beautiful, well designed and decorated.  I had the Caipirinha drink - well blended with lime, sugar, and Brazilian spirits.  My husband had the Sangria.  It was fruity and delightful, like the warm kiss of summer.  

The menu is tapas, small bites of Spanish delights.  I love tapas, because I can sample many things.  We had the albondigas, which are small meatballs in a delicious sauce.  We also sampled the steak skewers and crisp and tender potatas bravas.  

The service was gracious.  I would add this to my list of Denver dining favorites."

We were traveling to Denver with another couple and found this gem through a search.  One of the group is a super-picky eater, but loved everything.  Highly recommended!

We shared a couple pitchers of sangria.  Recommended!

Aceitunas Alinadas y Almendras - $4 - Marinated mixed Spanish olives and toasted Spanish almonds - The olives were the least favorite item ordered.  I suggest passing them over for all the other goodies!

Queso de Cabra con Miel - $8 -  Fried goat cheese topped with spiced honey - Delicious... But we had to ask for bread when the dish was delivered... Bread is a must.

Carne de Cerdo - $8 -  Spanish style ribs with a pineapple brandy sauce served with crispy fried onions - This dish only comes with two bones, so it is probably one of the most expensive items on the menu, but if you love ribs you will love this dish.

Gambas al Ajillo - $10 -  Grilled shrimp sautéed in olive oil, garlic and chile pequin - This is a must at any tapas restaurant to use as a measuring stick.  And they measured up.  Again, we had to ask for extra bread to soak up the garlic-butter goodness at the bottom.


Callo de Hongos - $14 - Seared sea scallops with a truffled mushroom compote - Easily the biggest surprise of the meal.  I LOVED THIS DISH!

This restaurant isn&#39;t expensive.  But if you want a wonderful experience at a cozy, cute restaurant with great value, I highly suggest this restaurant, especially on a date."

Here is what we had:
* Pimientos del Piquillo - very rich, lots of goat cheese but good
* Pa Amb Tomaquet - mini charcuterie / cheese plate
* Croquetas de Hongos - very solid.  Mushroom sauce was incredible
* Carne de Cerdo - short style ribs; overly sauced which I actually liked in this dish.  These were really good
* Datiles - crispy bacon wrapped dates stuffed goat cheese.  Dates seemed a bit over cooked based on my past experience
* Chorizo - good but usually these is served as a dry link; this comes in a broth of red wine and bay leaf.  Again, not bad but I felt it took away from the actual meat
* Albondigas - meatballs.  These were really good.  We used the sauce to dip our bread in."

Date of Visit: 7/13/15

The 9th door is a fantastic date spot, offering a cozy, intimate decor, good cocktails, and a menu perfect for sharing. We arrived towards the end of Happy Hour, but the server was kind enough to get our first round of drinks in before it officially closed (the Gold Margarita was solid!). After that, it was tapas for days: Ensalada Remolacha (roasted beets with goat cheese &amp; pine nuts), Pera Rollos (pears, arugula, Idiazábal cheese rolled in Serrano ham), Croquetas de Hongos (mushroom &amp; rice croquette), Dátiles (Serrano ham-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds &amp; drunken goat cheese), and Pinchos de Fileta (beef skewers with onions &amp; Poblano peppers). Some dishes were better than others, but all were tasty. The portions were on the small side, but it was still a good meal for a decent price.

I would definitely recommend Happy Hour here, as many of their top tapas dishes are included for very good prices."

We figured it was destiny! Once inside we managed to snag the last pub table. The place has a nice ambience but the lighting could be just a tad brighter, if not to be able to read the menu than to see the food presentation. We ordered an equal number of cold and hot tapas. Here&#39;s the breakdown:
1. calabacitas: light and fresh but it was just ok. It was pretty flavorless. 
2. ensalada de camarones y aguacate: also known as &#34;dos camarones y salsa fresca en cascara de aguacate&#34;. Same as #1
3. tortilla: nice. Could use a bit more garlic, though. And the drizzled sauce on top would be a huge no-no for Spaniards
4. pan am tomaquet; a Catalan delight that was less than delightful. When I have it in Spain it is smothered in tomato. This was spread like butter. Fail.
5. croquetas: my dining partner enjoyed them. I didn&#39;t try, as I&#39;m not a croqueta fan.
6. queso: if you like fried cheese balls, try them! 
7. callo de hongos. They really should call this &#34;callo de champinones&#34;. Hongos are more often used in Mexico and in some places mean different things. In any case, this was my favorite. Sea scallops with mushrooms. I should have just ordered two of these and called it a day!

So, overall, it was a decent dining experience but not one I&#39;d repeat if I returned to Denver. If you&#39;ve spent any time in Spain you&#39;ll realize immediately that the food isn&#39;t really authentic and that the establishment caters to an American palate. On a positive note, our server was nice and we even got to meet the manager. I mentioned they should really consider having squid and octopus on their menu, as any true Spanish tapas bar would have both. I think my comment went in one oreja and out the other. :)"

It seemed to me that they just looked online for Spanish tapas without having any idea of what they were looking for.
There&#39;s a huge misconception about what going out for tapas is. Tapas in Spain is the cheapest plan you can think of, and because they are so cheap (2-2.5€) you can have as many as you want until you are full, usually 2 or 3. If you want to get full at this place you need to spend over $35 plus drinks, and you are not even eating Spanish food, which is what they advertise. 

Even the menu was wrong. The waitress told us the cheff had spent 4 years living in Spain, and many of the words used for the dishes were Latin American! 

The only thing they got right was the beer, only one tap and it was Spanish.

The service was very slow, even just to bring the drinks, which they forgot  a couple of times, and the place was not busy.

The music was very nice, Spanish guitar for the most part.

The two wines we tried were good, although very pricy: you can&#39;t get a glass for less than $10.

If you want to have Spanish food, this is not the place.
If you want to spend about 40 dollars in a fancy dinner, this is not the place either."

Met a mentor here after work. We had a couple of drinks and then ordered some tapas. The tapas were small-ish, but I think that&#39;s what tapas are supposed to be, right? They were tasty nonetheless.

The standouts were the ribs, meatballs, pan fried avocado and the sliced steak (forgot the name). The fried goat cheese, manchego and serrano with crostini, and garlic shrimp were quite good as well. 

Bread was tough to get enough of...as this was definitely not a GF crowd...that left a poor impression on some especially since some ladies wanted to use the bread for the sauces in the meatballs and garlic shrimp dish. 

The charcuteria (meat boards) were nice - serrano, two chorizo (a black pepper and spicy variation of each) - and a decent value. 

Overall, expect to order about 3 dishes for each person for a &#39;meal&#39; so with most around $7-14...it adds up in terms of cost but enables you to sample lots of things. The plus side to the cost of the dishes is the number of very reasonably priced wines. Gazela vino verhde for around $23...I preferred the Basa (verdejo)...but all very nicely priced! 

Our server was fabulous, and the overall impression was that it was a great place for a larger group...and we all had a great time!!"

The restaurant is so cute inside with brick decor and lights filling the open ends of the brick to give a dim dark and mysterious feel to the place. For restaurant week there is a set menu and you order one dish for each course. This year we were offered four courses which was great. I started with the rellenos which are stuffed with goat cheese and possibly some red pepper flakes or something to give it a little kick. This was absolutely delicious. I also tried this with the pieces of bread they give you which was definitely worth trying! It was so flavorful and like nothing I&#39;ve ever tried before. I have had the traditional Mexican dish of chile rellenos which is a chile stuffed with cheese and then dipped in egg batter and fried so this was a new type of rellenos for me and it was awesome! 

For my second course I had the croquetas de hongos which is nice sized mushroom with rice croquette sherry wine and mushroom sauce. OH MY! This is a must try I could have eaten 3 more of these and still find myself wanting and craving more. Different than anything and topped with some sort of cheese mmm mmm good! 

Third course was the filet. Now I am a hard core filet fan and this just didn&#39;t cut it for me. The meat was not tender at all and at times tasted way way too overdone and maybe almost a bit burned or blackened. I was really looking forward to this dish and it did nothing for me. 

Finally! Dessert! I ordered the flan which I thought tasted just like creme brûlée minus the Caramelized topping. I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert as it was refreshing and the slight lemon taste added a nice zing to the flan! It was light and airy and the perfect end to a great night!"

This night, restaurant week, was a bit &#39;eh&#39; for me just because I know they could do better. My experience tonight was probably a 3.5, but other times has been a 4.

Ambiance was great. Staff was wonderful, especially our waiter Jeff. We were a table of 8, and I&#39;m glad I made a reservation and they put enough tables together to accommodate such a large group. It was a set menu of four course so my boyfriend and I both choose different dishes and shared to get a taste of everything. What stood out for me the most was the goat cheese stuffed peppers, mushroom risotto croquette, and scallops. What was disappointing to me was the beef filet, and sadly, the desserts (flan de lemon and chocolava cake). The filet was overdone and was tough. The desserts were too rich, especially the chocolava cake which was dry and not even &#39;lava&#39;-esque to begin with. The flan wasn&#39;t as smooth and silky as others I&#39;ve tried and I didn&#39;t taste any lemon at all. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because restaurant week, but I preferred my other experiences in 9th door on regular occasions. 

PS: a carafe of sangria will cost you $20 if they don&#39;t tell you that. They use to have a drink menu with their specialty cocktails but I heard the management wanted to focus more on wines so the drink menu was limited. On the plus side, they still have a full bar and you can order your own liquor, you just have to ask them to make it."

For a special anniversary dinner last Thursday we picked this restaurant in the Lodo area. After our Spain trip around 3 years back, we never got a chance to try a Spanish restaurant. So we were really excited to be here.

What we ordered:-
1) Seafood Paella - amazing and must try. The rice was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. It came with a ton of mussels. Also had clams and Jumbo Shrimp.
2) Tortilla Espaniola (Spanish omelet) - was excellent 
3) Patata Bravas - same taste as I remember from Spain.
4) Crema Catalana - Catalan version of Creme Brûlée. Must try!

It is not really kids friendly, but we did manage with a kid. Tapas are very reasonably priced."

Service: friendly and casual (waiter Jeff). He made a custom cocktail for a friend and was nice enough to adjust it to their liking after they taste tested it 

Food: I came here for restaurant week so I paid $30 for a four course meal. I got to try more than 4 dishes because I shared different dishes with friends. What I tried:

1. deep fried avocado with pico de gallo; the avocado is a 1/2 avocado that is dipped in egg and then panko and lightly friend. It&#39;s then topped with a super fresh pico de gallo. This appetizer was AWESOME. I&#39;ve made something similar @ home but usually pair the fried avocado with steak and some parmesan cheese but I liked the fresh tomatoes and spice 
2. risotto croquettes with mushrooms and truffle oil; these were magnifique; I could eat these forever I do not lie. Potato croquettes are already a favorite but risotto croquettes?! Just above and beyond. I&#39;d come back here solely for this. 
3. scallops with mushroom sauce; this was a solid dish of seared scalloped made with a truffled mushroom compote. I think I had three dishes with truffle oil and mushrooms so the flavor palette was kind of the same throughout all the dishes though I do love both mushrooms and truffle oil
4. charcuterie with jamon iberico among other hams; I&#39;ve been to Barcelona and my fondest memory of it aside from the sleeping in and late night beach parties was the ease of finding some jamon iberico at mall kiosks. Delicious, salty and thinly sliced ham triggers many happy vacation memories for me 
5. piquillos rellenos: stuffed peppers were visually OK but tasted far better than their appearance 
6. pollo oloroso: sauteed chicken breast with oloroso sherry mushroom sauce and manchego mashed potatoes (again another mushroom inspired dish though I enjoyed this one because it reminded me a lot of Cheesecake Factory&#39;s sweet chicken marsala dish)
7. calabacitas: roasted spaghetti squash with asparagus, piquillo peppers, fresh basil and shaved manchego cheese. This looked like papaya salad and was very refreshing and different. It was light and is a great healthy vegetarian option. 
8. chocolava: it is supposed to have a ganache center with molten chocolate but the cake was pretty solid and not so much &#34;lava&#34;-like. I thought it was very rich but my own molten lava cakes at home taste better. I am sure this would have been better if it was served immediately while the center was still liquid. 
9. flan de limon: 5 stars. I love flan and love lime and the 2 together are a hit for me. I make flan at home and my family eat flan often so eating this reminded me of being home. 
10. two carafes of sangria: 1 was red wine with hints of berry and the other was peach white. Both were probaby the worse sangrias I have had. They didn&#39;t have much wine in them and the carafes and my cup were filled almost to the brim with ice. It also lacked fruit other than one orange slice and one maraschino cherry in my glass 

For restaurant week the portion were not enough to get full off of. I would love to come back again to experience their full menu and order more items. I absolutely love tapas style food and highly recommend this place for those looking try try many Spanish dishes at one dinner."

The staff was very friendly and attentive. The service was very prompt, maybe even a bit too fast. We ordered several tapas plates. The Dátiled were especially good as were the Pera Rollos. I thought the tortilla was a bit bland, but my wife liked it. The Higos Rellenos that I had for dessert were outstanding too. My wife got the flan and reported it was very tasty. My only complaint was that the prices here were substantially more than other comparable tapas restaurants I frequent. The price on the menu is about the same, but most plates only serve two people where I&#39;m used to them serving three or four persons."

The idea of trying many smaller dishes and not having to settle on one item thrills me. Also, I think it makes the act of eating more of an adventure and social experience.  Dining at The 9th Door is certainly an experience. 

First thing you notice when walking in is how sultry this restaurant is. You have to walk through a curtain to get through the dining area, that alone should be your first hint to how sinful your experience is going to be.  Such a romantic ambiance with dim lights and lots of red colors.  It wasn&#39;t too loud either. Shockingly, this place wasn&#39;t packed at 8 pm on a Friday evening. We had made reservations ahead of time, but this would not have been necessary. 

Stands outs for me: Membrillo, Manchego, y Serrano (salty deliciousness! Crispy ham. No bread needed.), Patatas Bravas (potatoes with 4 delicious sauces), Queso de Cabra con Miel (fried goat cheese with honey... need I say more?), Carne de Cerdo (ribs with FALL OFF THE BONE meat. So, so tender. Amazing),  Albóndigas (Spanish meatballs in an almond sauce. Uniquely incredible), Pinchos de Fileta (beef skewers. Delicious flavor and tender). 

I highly recommend The 9th Door if you are looking for an intimate and delicious restaurant.  We had a great experience and look forward to returning in the future!"

- Mushroom and rice croquette - crispy texture with such a delicious mushroom sauce. 
- Spicy potatoes - could be a little more crispy and it comes with three delicious sauces, a garlic aioli, a pepper one, and blue cheese. Yum.
- Spanish meatballs - yummm three little tender meatballs in a delicious sauce
- Blue cheese steak - pretty good but the reduction on the steak was a bit strong for me
- Fried goat cheese - can&#39;t go wrong here, comes with a honey sauce.
- Bacon wrapped dates - so disappointing. They are dry, can barely taste the dates, and there&#39;s absolutely no sauce!

But be prepared to spend $100 on food and drinks for 2 and leave hungry. Even though the food was good. And the atmosphere and staff were enjoyable, the portions were extremely small, even for tapas. We ended up leaving to go to another bar after 2 pictures of sangria and 5 plates (total bill 101.24) and got more drinks and more food. We expected there to be some sort of free bread ( we did get a single basket of 4 small prices of bread after ordering a majority of our food).

I just moved to Denver a couple of weeks ago, so I had absolutely no idea where to go.  We went on Yelp...and here we are!

The selection was amazing, though I do wish they had paella.  The meatballs were ok.  Not my favorite.  But the spaghetti squash, mussels, and fried coat cheese were amazing.  The sauces they used were fantastic and believe me, they couldn&#39;t even give us enough bread.  (which was also amazing...small, but the server kept it coming)

First, the bar service was excellent. Helpful attentive staff and full menu. Traveling solo on biz I could walk right in on Sat night and grab a seat at the bar. 

I started with the Queso de Cabra con Miel and while I enjoyed this small serving of fried goat cheese I found the honey on it made it just a little sweet for my taste at the moment. Based on suggestion from the bar staff I ordered the Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos for comparison and much preferred it. Just a hint of heat with this one.

The fav of my tapas though was the Chuletas de Cordero - the &#34;Lolipop lamb loin chops&#34; (two). Great flavor/taste. The polenta that came with was tasty too but could&#39;a been creamier.

While I enjoyed a couple wines by the glass, I was wishing for a broader selection by the glass. I enjoyed the Orin Swift&#39;s Locations &#34;E&#34; Tempranillo, Monastrell, Garnacha, Carignan to start with. Nice. Looking for a little more structure to things I turned to the Can Blau Mazuela, Syrah, Garnacha and it was more to my liking.

Nice place. Good stuff. I&#39;d go back."

The calamari was good, but the pork satay, the ham wrapped figs and the mushroom croquettes were so so. The pork was really skimpy, the ham figs were too greasy and not hot, and the croquette was drowning in sauce, ruining the texture. The meal was definitely very average.

Now the lemon rosemary flan was TERRIBLE. It was like a block of cream cheese!! Cream cheese taste and texture with barely any lemon or rosemary flavor. Flan should have a creamy, custard like consistency, and this dessert was like whipped Philadelphia cut out in the shape of a scalloped flower. Growing up in San Antonio, I&#39;ve had my share of good flan and this was far from any flan I&#39;ve ever had. #FAIL"

I came here with a large party to try out a number of the tapas and there were PLENTY to choose from. A variety does not necessarily mean a good thing, so choose wisely. I will list some of my favorites out of the 10 different dishes that I tried. I do not remember the Spanish names, but I do remember a rough English translation of what I ate.

Food (3.5 Stars): 
Potatoes and sauce: It is pretty much standard potatoes that are pan fried and you can dip them in a garlic sauce, bleu cheese sauce, or orange tomato sauce. It&#39;s simple, nothing too fancy.

Calamari: The calamari uses the same sauces at the potatoes and are deep fried. This dish can be found at many different places and isn&#39;t too unique.

Meatballs: Ehhh. They were okay. I felt that the meatballs were very PUNGENT and it made it difficult for me to eat them. Although they were drenched in the sauce, the sauce didn&#39;t help on making the dish any more appetizing. 

Lamb Skewers: No, thanks. The meat tasted way too gamey.

Creme Brûlée: MY FAVORITE DISH. I have to say that the creme brûlée was probably the best creme brûlée I have ever had. It had a cinnamon sweet crust that you can break perfectly to eat with the cream. The strawberries that went with it were wonderful. THIS IS WHAT HAPPINESS TASTES LIKE.

Service (4 Stars): The waitress frequently checked up on us and kept the food coming out consistently.

Bottom Line: Creme Brûlée. That is all."

Lengthy list of both drink and food specials. I tried their Tinto de Verano for $3- it&#39;s a play on red wine sangria using Orange Fanta instead of fruit, and it was yummy! And a large serving.

As for the food, well let me just break it down for you. Here is what we had from the HH menu:
Manchego Con Tapenade- $2.45
Tostas Ajos- $3.14
Pimientos Piquillos Salteados- $3.53
Esparragos Con Serrano- $3.75

I don&#39;t know what the heck is with those odd ball (non-rounded) prices, but I don&#39;t care either because all of the above were yummy! Of the 4 above, my favorite was definitely the serrano ham wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli (esparragos con serrano). 

We also couldn&#39;t resist trying a few things that were not on the happy hour menu, especially the fried goat cheese balls that according to other reviews used to be on the HH menu, but I had no problem paying full price for those babies:
Queso de Cabra con Miel- $7 (fried goat cheese balls)
Aguacate- $6 
Croquetas de Hongos- $6

The portions are very small, perfect for two people to share each one, so my friend and I each sampled everything and really enjoyed it all. After our HH drinks, and all the food, our total came to be $50. But, we were able to try a good variety of plates, we left very full and with a slight buzz so we both felt it was well worth the cost.

The interior of this place is very cozy, warm and full of dark colors and woods. Good background music. They have a large garage-type door that opens to their small patio so lots of light and a patio. Good variety of tables (high tops, booths, etc), including a large table that would be great for a group. This is definitely going on my top 10, maybe even top 5 for my favorite HH places downtown, especially when I&#39;m feeling fancy/spendy. All in all, I&#39;ll be back!"

The hostess greeted me warmly, and the bar staff was friendly as well. The drink I ordered was not very strong, and had I been here on any other occasion, I might not have been very pleased, but considering my first date status I was very appreciative. 

While we were sitting at the bar, the hostess was holding our table for us. This was apparently not communicated with all of the waitstaff because a group of people was seated at the table while we were still enjoying conversation at the bar. The bartender immediately noticed and made a point to clear up the situation so that we were provided with the intimate booth my date had reserved, rather than sitting at any of the other tables. I would never speak up about this because I&#39;m generally a very easy-going person, but it meant a lot that the issue was noticed and taken care of immediately. 

Once we moved to the table, our server was fantastic. Our drinks arrived in a timely manner, and neither of our glasses were ever empty. The only reason this place did not receive the full five stars is because I felt our tapas came out too quickly. My date and I were really enjoying our conversation, and had barely finished one plate before the next two had arrived. This may have something to due with the fact that we were eating dinner pretty late (we met at 8:30)...I think the restaurant may have been closing around 10?  Maybe the kitchen was trying to get out of there, but either way, our server never made us feel rushed. 

I will highly recommend this place for anyone looking to grab a drink after work, or go out for a nice dinner. I&#39;d love to return!

Oh and PS... Get the Croquetas de Hongos (mushroom/rice croquette) and Callo de Hangos (scallops with truffled mushroom compote). They were only two of the several tapas we ordered, but my favorites by a landslide. To be quite honest, I will probably dream about them tonight."

First the ambiance of the place is very nice though it was pretty dark but they ended up turning the lights up a bit. The sangria&#39;s they offer are really good I must say. We had a good amount of items off the happy hour like the Spanish tortilla and calamari as well as the mussles. The food was good but nothing to rave about as far as flavor goes. My friend and I felt the sauce for the mussles wasn&#39;t quite there. Overall pretty pricey place as far as food goes that honestly doesn&#39;t live up to the price. Overall I would return here but isn&#39;t somewhere I would go often. Left paying +$40 not feeling totally fulfilled.

We had reservation for 6, got there early at 5:50.  Informed our waiter, Doug, that we had a show at 7:30.  He assured us we would be out in plenty of time.  We were not.  The food was bland, cold, and mediocre.  The service was slow, unattentive, and unprofessional.  Doug seemed to be more interested in being cute than providing service.

They had a prix fixe menu that night ($69 per couple) which consisted of 2 appetizer courses, 1 main course, and 1 dessert course. Each course had about 3 options to choose from with exception of the main course which had about 7 options.

The assorted charcuterie plate, artichokes, and croquetas were the highlight of the meal. You really can&#39;t go wrong here. The food was absolutely delicious.

The main course was a different story. The seafood paella was mushy and bland, and the beef filet was overpowered with a smother of bleu cheese. The beef was cooked perfectly though.

The dessert (chocolava) was rich and not too sweet. The specialty drinks were watered down and disappointing though.

By the end of the meal, we were full but not to the point of being painfully stuffed which was nice. With the prix fixe menu ($69), 3 drinks over the course of the meal, and tip -- the total was about $120 which didn&#39;t seem worth it to me. If I were to do it all again, I would go back on a regular night and only order from the appetizer menu. That&#39;s the only way I could justify the meal at that price."

It&#39;s dimly-lit ambience is great! The food is served in small tapa portions, but it is DELICIOUS. I recommend the scallops in creme sauce (callo de hacha), it is to die for. Wine selection is pretty pricey in general, but they have a garnacha that is only about $20 for the bottle, so that is a good option."

We ordered 4 tapas:

Membrillo, Manchego, y Serrano ($7):  There were 3 bite-sized toasted bread with quince jam and Manchego cheese topped with pan-seared Serrano ham.  The Serrano ham was crispy like bacon.  So good!

Ensalada de Camarones y Aguacate ($9): There were 2 large chilled grilled shrimp with the tails on, sliced avocado, and a diced cucumber, tomato, and onion salad tossed in a light aioli dressing presented in a half avocado shell.

Calamares Fritos a la Romana ($9): The batter was light and the baby squid was flash fried.  There were rings and tentacles.  It was served with 3 different sauces.  This was one of the best Fried Calamari dishes I&#39;ve had in a long time.

Croquetas de Hongos ($6): One large mushroom and rice croquette with sherry wine and mushroom sauce.  Sliced Manchego cheese and mushrooms on top.  This was okay, but I would not order them again.  I&#39;m not used to having sauce on my croquettes.

We will be back!"

I was participating in the Fried Cheese Tour without actually eating Fried Cheese.  I looked at the menu mid-week prior to the event and didn&#39;t see anything that was actually in my wheel-house so I sent an e-mail.  Asking if they would be able to put something together for me that was raw.  I received a prompt reply, from Jessica, that said she had talked to the Chef and he would be happy to do something raw for me.

When I arrived the day of the event they provided a very nice salad along with some olives.  Very yummy on both accounts.

Dave, the bartender, and the Suicide Juice was my absolute favorite part. Remember when you were a kid and you would go to the soda machines at 7-11 and add a little bit of every type of soda in the joint?  Well Dave made Suicide Juice for me.  It starts with fresh lemon, lime and orange slices and then he mashes them all in the metal mixing cup with his wooden crusher thing (very technical term) and then adds a variety of different juices.  Since this is a closely held secret by only Dave and myself I&#39;d have to kill you if I told you the exact types and amounts of these juices. 

Anyway, back to the story, it was so very delicious and made my taste-buds sing.

The food was very good, the atmosphere was quaint and it was a good time had by all.  They get five stars based on the fact that they went above and beyond to provide me something to eat and drink that wasn&#39;t on their normal menu."

The food was actually really good. It was not overly expensive and the portions were medium sized. 

They have a very large vodka selection. It is a Vodka bar so they should and they did. 
They have infused vodka, which I believe they make themselves, and also a really good selection from around the world. 

I would stray away from some of the desserts. I had the chocolate cake and it was mediocre at best. 

However I didn&#39;t go there for cake. The rest was really good and I will def go back."

We all enjoyed ourselves with plenty of options for the omnivores and the vegetarians in our group. The atmosphere was lovely, the sangria was delicious and the service was perfect. The price point also felt very reasonable for what we got, about $20/person to eat to satisfaction and have about one drink each. 

Everything we tried was delicious except I wouldn&#39;t recommend the olive and almond starter that they push. It&#39;s only $4 so it&#39;s easy to say yes, but it was quite plain and underwhelming. There are many other options that are much tastier."

Nothing special and out of ordinary to spend $30-40 per person. We had the scallops and the steak. Scallops was really small but cooked well, and the sauté mushroom that the scallops came with was very creamy and delicious. The steak on the other hand was underwhelming. They steak either doesn&#39;t have any beef flavor or the wine sauce was just too potent which really covers the natural flavor of the beef. We spent around $80 including drinks and came out still hungry. Not good. 

Food wise again was just okay, but what really throw me off was the hostess was sweeping the floor as I was walking in, and continue to sweep around the hallway after she seated us. Given that this is a comparative expansive restaurant and the atmosphere they are trying to persuade is more fine dining like. She cleaning up the floor during dinner time just kind of make me a bit uncomfortable, and kind of gross because there were a lot of dust.

Let&#39;s talk about the experience:
We got to the restaurant at 10:30. It&#39;s a tapas restaurant so you order and then wait for your food, eat it, and the order something else. This isn&#39;t a buffet where it&#39;ll take you 30 minutes to have breakfast. Plan to be here a while! The staff busted their butts... That being said, they could have had five more waiters to help, that&#39;s on the management, not the servers! We witnessed a couple bitch and complain about the wait and then leave. If your looking for a fast meal, I&#39;ve heard McDonalds serves breakfast all day! 

We loved every small plate that we ordered! I highly recommend trying it all... With small plates, if it&#39;s something you&#39;re not crazy about it&#39;s ok! 

The brunch concept is new to this restaurant, there was also recently a Groupon for their brunch menu so it&#39;s CRAZY SWAMPED right now! Have patience and you will be rewarded!"

Happy hour does have some very amazing tapas that are to die for !!  Be creative or show for the group of 4 to 6 people and try the all.

I have been to the Blake Street location and thoroughly enjoyed every tapas we ordered. However, the Lincoln Street has just adopted a brunch menu and I cannot stop gushing about it!
We had the Groupon that sold out as soon as it was posted, but even at full price for unlimited tapas and sangria/mimosa or Bloody Mary- it is still an amazing deal.

Favorites: Fried Avocado, the Mushroom &amp; rice croquette,  the French toast, and the warm salad. Sangria was top notch (they have both white and red). All wonderful

Other noteworthy tapas: the fried goat cheese and the tortilla quiche.

Only disappointments: the mussels were quite gritty (I love mussels so this was a downer), and the eggs Benedict since each egg was cooked through hard (no gooey yolk). I would also say that they really really really enjoy that paprika seasoning. Be careful ordering the Bloody Mary since the rim is coated with it (as well as the potato dishes)- your fingers and mouth will be stained and so will their white cloth napkins.

If they decide to stick with the brunch concept they started (and maybe rotate their menu), this will be one of our favorite new brunch spots!&#34;"

Got a sweet Groupon: $49 for the bottomless drinks and tapas on Sunday brunch.  Thought it was a deal too good to be true, but it was true!

Food was amazing!  We tried every brunch dish available, and loved every single one, save the salad (Ensalada Marquet) and the dipping potatoes (Patatas Bravas).  They weren&#39;t bad by any means, just not our favorites.

Staff was great!  Attentive, quick, friendly, and awfully cheery for 11am on a Sunday as the dining room went from empty to packed in a short amount of time.

Drinks were a little weak, but quite tasty.  Not really a problem on the weakness in the end, as I had several and it was probably better than I wasn&#39;t hammered by noon.  I had a full afternoon of watching Netflix and HBOGO anyway!  I liked the red sangria and my mimosa.  My girlfriend liked her Bloody Mary; I&#39;m not a fan at all of them, but if she was pleased, I was pleased.

Music was a BITTTTT too loud, and we ended up talking in slightly-above-normal voices during the meal.  Nothing terrible though, just an observation.

When we arrived at noon for our reservation, we were seated immediately. Without a reservation, the wait was an hour and 45 minutes. It was busy. So when we waited 20 minutes to receive a menu and water, I tried to be understanding.

Eventually someone asked for our drink order. A few minutes later, someone else suggested we order one of each of the tapas and order our favorites after sampling them all. We did, and he disappeared with our order.

Over the next 30 minutes, we watched other tables being served (some multiple times) while the ice in my glass melted into tomato juice-tinted water. I finally stopped someone to ask the status of our order and for another bloody Mary. Ten minutes later the first of the 10 available brunch tapas arrived. Five minutes later I asked someone walking around with a bloody Mary carafe if I could get a refill.

We received one plate about every couple minutes, up until the last couple plates. I asked our server about the last 2 dishes and ordered a coffee. One dish came out after a few minutes. About 15 minutes later, I asked for a coffee again, asked about the final plate again, and put in an order for 2 additional plates. 10 minutes later, I went to the bar and ordered a coffee. A few minutes later, one of our newly ordered dishes came out. About 10 minutes after that we saw our server again who asked if we needed anything else. &#34;Mussels&#34;, I said. I gave up on our eggs Benedict by this point but I wasn&#39;t leaving without my gorram shellfish in saffron sauce. By this point it was 1:30pm and most of the restaurant had cleared out. It was no longer busy at all. And still we bonded with the table next to us about the disappointing service we were receiving compared to the group in one of the booths who had a new drink and plate of food every 5 minutes.

When our server appeared with mussels later, I was pretty excited. Until he brought them to the table next to us. Bless their hearts, they were like &#34;um we want mussels too but they&#39;ve been here way longer than we have.&#34; He asked if I wanted another coffee and I said, &#34;absolutely!&#34; Ask me if I ever received it. Go ahead. 

I asked another server if we could get the check. I told my husband if it wasn&#39;t at the table in 10 minutes we were leaving our Groupon number on the table and leaving. But don&#39;t worry, guys. The check arrived in no time at all! Our server took our Groupon number and walked off without a word and I figured, oh. Ok. We&#39;re good. No. No we were not. He stopped my husband to let him know we still had a balance of $5.56. For my coffee. Coffee is $2.50, everyone. We were charged for 2 coffees. I received one coffee. A coffee I asked for 3 times. But whatever. My husband have him $5.56 and we left.

The food here is phenomenal. The food brings this review up a star. I&#39;m sure the service is typically impressive. Today was not. Today we were told the kitchen was backed up (except for the people at the booth and on the patio, apparently). Today 4 servers and the hostess walked by us, some 2 or 3 times, before we even saw a menu. Today I was a little concerned at how many times our server asked if we were still waiting on anything, like the exact same items I&#39;d asked for every other time he came by. I was a little annoyed at how many tables received orders of plates we were told were taking longer as a reason we didn&#39;t have them yet. Plates we ordered before the other tables.

For such a highly-rated restaurant, this brunch experience was a pretty big let down. Next year, I&#39;ll celebrate my birthday elsewhere."

Parking around the area can be a bit tricky but once you&#39;ve found a spot and settled into the restaurant, good times await.

Tinto de Verano is a combination of red wine and Fanta which is beloved in Spain.  Naturally I had to give that a try and I was not disappointed.  It tasted like a weaker sangria but was light and refreshing.  The hubs ordered the drifter which was a whisky cocktail and he too enjoyed it.

For food options, we tried the following:

Calamari - my favorite item of the night.  Light, crispy and perfectly cooked

Croquetas de Hongos - a mushroom croquette which was quite tasty

Membrillo Y Manchego - quince paste with Manchego cheese; simple yet perfect combination of flavors

Patatas Bravas - Fried potatoes which were good but nothing special

Queso de Cabra - Fried goat cheese; the sauce was good but I didn&#39;t think it was the best fried cheese I&#39;ve ever had as advertised on the menu

Chuletitas de Cordero - Lamb Chops on polenta.  The hubs ate the lamb but the polenta was very good

Flan de Limon - The hubs liked this much better than I did - I thought the sauce was over powering

Higos Rellenos - Chocolate dipped figs with an almond in the middle and a candied orange peel on top.  A perfect finish to the meal.

Service was prompt and friendly.  This isn&#39;t the best tapas I&#39;ve ever had but was still very good and we enjoyed our time here."

I made reservations through Open Table on their website, and it worked fine.  Parking was a bit of challenge but fine once we figured out where to park in the garage adjacent to the restaurant.  We were greeted promptly at the door and seated immediately.  Our server was very attentive and gave us pointers for our first visit.  We placed our order and she staged the delivery of food at a nice pace.  Here&#39;s a quick run down of our order and a few comments:

Dolces Picantés - 
 Sweet and spicy peppers stuffed with goat cheese - this was surprisingly one of our favorites.  Tartness of the peppers and goat cheese really served as a great palate cleanser!

Pera Rollos - 
 Fresh pears, arugula, and Idiazábal cheese rolled in Serrano ham - I enjoyed the contrast of textures, saltiness, sweetness, and slight char on the pears
 
Queso de Cabra con Miel -
 Fried goat cheese topped with spiced honey - Very good but perhaps a little pricey for what you get.

Calamares Fritos a la Romana - 
 Battered, flash fried baby squid served with traditional Spanish dipping sauces - Calamari were lightly breaded and came with 3 dipping sauces, essentially a marinara, aioli, and a traditional sauce with ground almonds and other ingredients which I unfortunately can&#39;t remember!  One of our favorites!

Paella Special -
Mussels, Clams, Prawns and Spanish Sausage, and strips of roasted peppers - Delicious!  Seafood was not overcooked, and the sausage was flavorful. Our other favorite!

Flan de Limón - 
 Lemon and rosemary-infused flan - great dessert, surprisingly light with a flavor profile that just worked!

Chocolavá -
 Warm chocolate cake with a rich ganache center, served on an orange crème anglaise- What can I say other than Whoooo!  Over the top chocolate, not for the faint of heart.

I would really like to make it to happy hour, so we can try more of the menu at the HH prices and really dial in our favorites.  Otherwise, we&#39;re fans!"

Dane our server from the jump seemed pained, not wanting to be at work, hating life, and hating anyone who placed an order. Please keep in mind I work in the hospitality industry and expect great service from my fellow servers. Had to always ask for refills on the unlimited drinks! Dane was horrific to deal with, and hostile that many people were worried to ask him to fill up their glasses.

The service was pretty bad, and the food was not worth the wait. It took about 25+ minutes between some of our tapas dishes, even after reminding our waitress that we were still waiting for things. The best thing we got was the very last thing brought out after waiting almost a half an hour, and we obviously were not going to order more after that wait. I loved the idea of this place and even considered bringing a friend while she was visiting from out of town, but I would never do this to a friend. If you&#39;re going to advertise an endless tapas brunch, which obviously consists of many many small plates of food, you should hire more people to support your service. You can&#39;t get your money&#39;s worth of food with their poor service. Horrible. I&#39;ll never be back."

We went on a Sunday evening with good company, my 13 year old enjoyed every selection - not a fan of goat cheese though. The croquets glazed with honey are fantastic. If you get the dates, order a side of melted chocolate and don&#39;t scrimp. The chocolava cake is a must."

We stopped in a few weeks ago, early on a Saturday night, and were very pleased. Both food and service were excellent. 

We arrived early, around 6pm in time to dine before our 8pm theater tickets. No reservation was no problem as the dinner rush hadn&#39;t arrived yet, and we were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant near the patio doors. While there were quite a few people enjoying their meals on the patio, we preferred the indoor seating as it was a bit windy that night. 

We started with a couple of my favorites - the Croquetas De Hongos (mushroom and rice croquette) and the Calabacitas (roasted spaghetti squash) - and both were as good as they&#39;d been downtown. By the way, if you&#39;ve never had great spaghetti squash before, try this dish. It&#39;s amazing. 

I think we hit most areas of the menu, including the olives, artichoke hearts, a chicken dish, some chorizo, and the lemon flan for dessert. There wasn&#39;t a single dish that I&#39;d be unhappy to have again. Dinner for our group of three + a few alcoholic drinks was about $70. Great food, good prices, and finally a convenient location for those of us on the edges of downtown. Study the menu and then go check it out yourself!"

If you must know, I had a grand old time eating and drinking away. I started with a cocktail - I can&#39;t recall the name, but it was simply vodka, simple syrup, and muddle cucumber. Definitely up my ally because vodka is my spirit of choice, and it was not too sweet at all. Yup, polished off 2 of those. 

The tapas: I highly recommend the lamp lollipops over polenta. They literally MELT.IN.YOUR.MOUTH. So good. It completely rekindled my love for lamb. Everything else we ordered was solid, but this was the one that blew me away, so  give it a try. It&#39;s a must. 

I would definitely love to go back and have a stab at the other tapas and maybe some more cocktails. Or wine. Makes me want to start planning a trip to Spain."

I had Tempranillo that was excellent. My boyfriend had the Drifter cocktail and loved it - said it was a lot like an old fashioned. Not very sweet. We both ordered seconds of our drinks. 
We ordered the dolces picantes which were an excellent starter. Then we had the patatas bravas which were quite good, including the sauces! More than just aioli. Next we had the tostas de fileta which tasted good but the peppers overpowered the steak so it was disappointing when you want steak. The mussels in saffron cream were excellent and came with bread to lap up the cream. Yum! Finished with the lamb chops which were very good. The polenta with them left something to be desired but we found a little cream from the mussels solved that problem.

Bought a Sunday brunch Groupon that was useless! They clearly oversold in a major way, knowing they would NEVER be able to accommodate the number of guests. The place is small, under staffed and unable to provide reasonable service...the tapas comes out at a snails pace, hardly an establishment that should be offering &#39;all you can eat&#39; tapas brunch. I optimistically walked in twice, NO availability, regardless of my willingness on wait time. OK, no problem, as I made sure-bet reservations twice over the 3 month period. 1st reservation: I ultimately walked out, as I was never seated or acknowledged after 30 minutes of waiting in the hostess line with no hostess. The place was a wreck, the seated guests looked completely pissed, with their empty glasses and plates. Employees were not making eye contact with anyone. OK, try again, 2nd reservation: the last weekend of Groupon eligibility and the manager calls me the day prior to CANCEL my reservation, stating &#34;the owner has decided to close the restaurant for the holiday weekend&#34;, OMG, are you f-ing kidding me! I asked what we&#39;re supposed to do with a useless Groupon, it expires this weekend and you&#39;re cancelling reservations and closing last minute???....he flatly stated, &#34;well, we could try and use it the following month, the owner may extend them, but I&#39;m not certain&#34;. Unreal! I will never give them another moment of my time, more less a penny. Poor business practice on many levels. Calling Groupon to get a full refund! I encourage everyone else that &#39;couldn&#39;t get in&#39;, do the same...this one was a scam, and they&#39;re hoping no one holds them accountable...Groupon will charge 9th Door back in full for any coupons not honored...."

1st impression - cool location (apparently second to the original) but the door isn&#39;t well suited to Denver weather.  I would avoid sitting near the bar area/door!

2nd impression - well we had to wait for reservations, but they made it up to us (bought us a cocktail for our time).  If you miss the time we agreed to, do something nice. I appreciated it


3rd  - food - yeah, the Papa Bravas were about as brave as my five year old.  .The dipping sauces were cool.  Yet everything else was solid. . the Pallea was delicious, the croquettes hit the spot. We even got this fried goat cheese and honey . . darn.  


I can not forget - the dates wrapped in bacon (they said crispy Serrano ham, but tasted like bacon to me).

I wish they had Spanish hot chocolate. . but alas i may be the only one.

My friend and I decided to come here for HH, mostly b/c 9th door offers a CARAFE of sangria. We were seated pretty quickly (we came about about 5ish on a Friday), but the hostess made sure to let us know that there were reservations for that table at 730pm. I don&#39;t want to dock for it, but it seemed sort of... rude. Maybe if you were so worried, you ask us to sit at the bar for HH?

Moving on. Our waiter was gracious, knowledgeable, and friendly. The ONLY thing I wish he did (that he didn&#39;t) was to come around one last time before HH was over to ask for last call. I LOVE when places/servers make sure to do that. 

FOOD:
tortilla with egg and potato and aioli sauce. YUM.
manchego and olive tapenade tartas: We ordered more when we demolished the first plate (each order comes with two bites).
goat cheese with currant jam tartas: again, we ordered more.
beef skewers with poblano peppers and onions: these were my least favorite. Ok. (off main menu)
croquetas de hongas: risotto fried cake with shaved cheese, mushroom/sherry wine sauce, drizzle of truffle oil on top. BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT. we were licking the plate. (main menu).
piquillo peppers with cheese: these were off the HH menu, but suffered due to a mistake by the kitchen. They came out last, after the risotto cake. 

We drank the carafe, and we each also had a mojito. I don&#39;t know if these were virgin or something, b/c I&#39;m a bit of a lightweight when it comes to alcohol and I wasn&#39;t even buzzed. So, boo on that. 

We also ran into a small problem with the bill. As in, dishes we didn&#39;t receive or didn&#39;t order showed up on it. So, check your bill! (they were happy to take care of it).

To sum up: make a reservation. food was a solid 4.5 stars. Service (from waiter) was 4 stars. Drinks - 2 stars. And, check your bill."

The worst part was the inattentive service.  We came during happy hour and our waiter never informed us of this.  We paid $13.00 for a glass of house wine!  After we mentioned it was happy hour we were dismissed.

There were these mysterious &#34;upcharges&#34; on our bill.

We had just came in from 3 days of skiing (and the I70 drive) and I was super tired, otherwise i would have complained.  I just wanted to get out there ASAP.

Arrived at noon left at 2pm to head to get some food...disappointing.

The waitress seemed rushed (there was one other table sat in the place) and annoyed to have to tend to us. After ordering 2 rounds, she informed us that the kitchen staff was new and so they were closing down the kitchen early. With all of us being in the service industry this seemed like it was a bogus excuse for her to get out early (which is where her annoyance with us coming in for a 7:30 reservation probably came into play). We got the last round and a check and as we were leaving we saw her flirting with some boy at the bar (maybe a boyfriend?) the bartender greeted us on the way out but our server was too busy playing kissy face to acknowledge us leaving. I may go back again due to the food and in hopes of a different server that actually wants to do their job."

However, I cannot ignore that 2 of my last 3 visits they have been closed or about to close and not going to serve us. Tonight we tried to come in at 9:40p thinking we would at least be able to catch a plate or two with a sherry... that is if they were to close at 10p. It&#39;s actually posted here on Yelp that they are open till 11p and now looking on their website 10:30p, yet would not serve us tonight at 9:40p with 4 others at the bar drinks in hand. The visit before last was greater by a locked door. I don&#39;t care how great our previous visits have been if you can&#39;t run your posted hours I&#39;ll just go to Crash45 where I know they will be at the very least consistently closed."

We quickly ordered nearly everything and then awaited the results. Overall, it was ok. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time living in Madrid and hanging out in Barcelona and Valencia. I know tapas and this just seemed like a hollow imitation of what I can get in Spain. I say this because The 9th Door has a reputation as being the place for Spanish tapas, but based on this experience, I don&#39;t feel they are taking this responsibility seriously. I have totally mixed feelings. 

The food is fine and they offer a variety of cold and hot tapas. Many items came with bread which limited my gluten-free brother, but he managed to eat things off the bread. The most disappointing thing was the patatas bravas because it&#39;s so classically Spanish. I&#39;m going to stop."

I double-checked the menu for GF options prior to purchasing a Groupon and then was essentially shamed for being so high maintenance once we were finally seated for brunch. We arrived and were ignored for close to 10 minutes, while a group that had clearly came in behind us was seated and treated with respect....not sure if it was because we are a younger couple or what.... When we finally were seated, we waited...and waited....and waited, when finally they came around, tossed us a menu and neglected to ask for drink orders or if we had any questions.  I had to flag down a waitress to ask about the GF options that had been on the internet, but were not in plain site on the menu.  She went to check for my options after looking at me like the outlook was pretty bleak.  She came back.  Asked for our order and completely forgot to check on GF options.  We had to ask a total of FOUR times about GF options before she finally said, in so many words, &#34;you&#39;re out of luck.&#34;  I was embarrassed and we had to get up and leave since I literally could not eat any of the brunch menu items.  Awful service, awful treatment of customers.  Don&#39;t make your customers feel ashamed of their unavoidable medical conditions - doesn&#39;t seem too tough, but for some reason...9th Door hasn&#39;t quite grasped this concept yet."

I am so excited about this.  I love the 9th door and all of their delicious tapas!  This location is a little bit smaller, but just as dark and cozy. 

I wish they had happy hour on the weekend, but they do have it Mon-Fri 4 to 6:30! I will definitely be coming here a lot! 

This visit we got the &#34;Croquetas de Hongos.&#34;  The sherry sauce was delicious.  We also got the&#34;Patatas Bravas &#34; which is The 9th Door&#39;s version of little french fries.  They come with 3 cauces and are a good munchie to share with the table.  

Other than that we did our fair share of drinking.  The moscow mules are great here... and I tried a new drink called &#34;Tinto de Verano,&#34; which is red wine and fanta.  I saw it and thought... &#34;how gross!.&#34;  Instead, I was assured it was delicious and much like a native drink of Spain (red wine and coke) so I gave it a shot.... might be my new favorite little spritzer! Pretty good and they are only 5 bucks a pop! ;) 

To top off the evening... our table of ladies fell in love with out waiter Joe.  He was so friendly, had great suggestions, and was a step ahead of the game.  We never had to  search for him... he was right there with refills and witty comments that made us love.  The service was great and it all made for a wonderful girls night!"

It&#39;s just as good as the other one if not better. We went there on a Friday night and it was packed. I think it&#39;s because lots of people got their $20 off  promotional emails. We got seated quickly. We waited around 20 minutes for the food to arrive because the kitchen was super busy. The tapas were delicious. I highly recommend the Spanish sausages cooked in red wine (not only it&#39;s tasty it will also fill you up), the bacon wrapped dates (not really bacon but I can&#39;t really remember the name) and calamari. The manager (I think) personally delivered the calamari but accidentally spilled a couple of them onto the table. He apologized and got us another plate for free. That&#39;s what I call service! I would definitely go back to check out their happy hours."

Same vibe, same great service and same fantastic tapas.  I do wish sometimes they would switch up the menu a bit, but hey when you&#39;ve got a good thing going why mess with it?  Be sure not to miss the great HH deals with drinks and food.  Seriously can&#39;t be beat!  As for parking, you have one of two options, either park on the street and pay a meter, which happens to end at 6pm or park in one of the visitor spots in the Beauvallon garage.  Be sure to watch out though as you drive in on the left and not the right. Enjoy!"

I will start by saying that the food itself was delicious, and we both truly enjoyed everything we ate, but the experience fell short. 

I had made a reservation prior and noted that we were celebrating a birthday, but we were given a less than awesome table by the kitchen since apparently the restaurant was so packed, but the nicer tables in the back stayed empty the whole time we were there. We then ordered a variety of tapas which all arrived at once. I guess we should have ordered them individually, but we&#39;ve dined at many tapas restaurants, and our orders have always come out one by one in a leisurely manner. As I mentioned, the food was thankfully extremely good and our server was also great, so that helped a lot. Unfortunately, the chocolate lava dessert was not nearly as good as the rest of our meal even though it sounded amazing on the menu. 

So basically, great food minus dessert, good server, but fairly poor experience overall, and no acknowledgement of my husband&#39;s birthday which I know is not necessary but would&#39;ve been nice."

Tonight our waiter generally pushed the up-sell hard, to the point where it became awkward when our friend had to tell the waiter he didn&#39;t want to spend that much money on wine ($20 more than the bottle he initially ordered) and the waiter tried to tell him it was not that much more money. Later, after we had ordered a few different tapas, and after they had been delivered to our table, our waiter told us that he had  &#34;asked the chef&#34; to add portions to the tapas so there was enough food for the four of us. What I learned later, was that the waiter had actually charged us for more food than we had actually ordered.

Service is an oxymoron in this restaurant.  It is clear everyone has a role and if it is not your server you are not acknowledged. The food server was the worst ... Our waitress/ bartender was busy and trying to get this gals attention well I might as well been invisible. Reminds me of that song Mr Cellophane .  

Sad to see a restaurant that has a good product run by folks who basically don&#39;t care..  I will vote with my feet and wallet and move on and let others know Beware bad service is likely.  A good case for replacing the staff since the owner has no idea of how bad folks are being served.

3.5 - Tapas were decent but nothing to write home about.  We shared 5 different plates and all were good but not over the top.  Some of them even lacked flavor and the shrimp served with some broth was over cooked.  

2.5 - Service.  Oh where do I start.  The young guy was very determined to get the up sell on all his recommendations for food and wine (not that it&#39;s a terrible thing but don&#39;t make it so obvious and all you recommend).  Towards the end of the meal he started taking plates away without asking if we were finished.  Some of them still had a bite left that we wanted to finish so we had to tell him to stop.  Then he started taking away our wine glasses without asking.  And once again we had to ask him to stop because there were still a few sips left that we wanted to finish.  The icing on the cake is what some of the other reviewers have commented on too.  We had 3 extra items on our bill that we did not order nor eat.  One was a flan which we didn&#39;t even have dessert.  He was quick to remove those items but as he did made sure to mention it wasn&#39;t intentional.  Makes you wonder if he felt caught???  

Anyways, you be the judge but definitely watch your bill at the end of the night."

Well, I was there an hour ago and the female bartender informed us that she is completely closed for tonight while four people were sitting at the bar with drinks in hand. One of the guests tried to light up the situation by telling me that the bartender would not serve him a second drink. Wait a minute. Your website says you are open for the next 50mins and yelp states that you are open for another hour and half! Since you can&#39;t keep your posted hours I wish you good luck. You are not the only place that serves tapas in Denver. Also, if you are training your staff to close early due to lack of business at least train them to be polite and not snotty.

The first glass of tempranillo we ordered was vinegar - undrinkable.  The server took it back and the second more expensive tempranillo we ordered was fine.  We ordered 6 plates - 2 were quite tasty (mushroom risotto thing and serrano-wrapped dates filled with goat cheese - that one was spectacular,  actually - the highlight of the meal).  However, the jamon iberico had a very bitter finish (though initially did have the expected nutty taste) - I can only imagine that either it was past its prime, poor quality, or we got the very heel of the ham.  The serrano-wrapped shrimp was fishy - not fresh shrimp.  The other 2 plates were okay but unremarkable. 

Dessert.  The creme brulee was average (custard texture was somewhat chunky but flavor was okay).  The sorbet (something like raspberry thyme) was awful - sour and bitter.  I should point out that I actually like some bitter things (lightly cooked Brussels sprouts, raw broccoli, etc) but the iberico and the sorbet at 9th Door were icky bitter.

To top off our evening (my wife and I left the kids with grandma and grandpa for a rare evening to ourselves), the price we were charged for the coffee I ordered was higher than the price listed on the menu. On the way out, I asked the hostess to see a menu to verify and indeed I had been overcharged.  The hostess had me wait for 5-7minutes for the server, Catherine, to come out to discuss (?).  She said without really apologizing that it was a computer error.  She held out two coins representing the overcharge amount.  I extended my hand to take them, explaining I didn&#39;t like being charged a different price than that listed on the menu.  Catherine then withdrew the two coins and stormed off back into the restaurant.   I was not rude, nor did I elevate my voice in frustration.  I was dumbfounded by the lack of professionalism and the overall poor quality of the food.  We will never go back.

The food is good.  I recommend the wings any day, but they have daily specials. The $5 Burger on monday is good, Taco Tuesday, and my favorite .50 wings on Wednesday.

They have poker twice a week,  trivia and bingo for free drinks, karaoke and a DJ once a week, there is always something going on in this bar.

The staff is friendly and will treat you like family (think more like a cousin,  less like that one uncle no one talks to).  This bar is the quintessential neighborhood bar, but if you are in the neighborhood,  you can stop in and not be treated like an outsider.  It would be perfect except for one thing...NO UFC FIGHTS.

When I first arrived it was not busy yet it took a while to get a beer. This was after two new tables were sat and served. Then I ordered food. That did not take long but was brought it, the guy put it down and walked away. I had to reach across the table to get it. I then asked for a fork, a FORK! 15 minutes later, yes you read that correctly 15, I had to ask someone else for the fork. Will not return unless dragged here. Pretty disappointed."

The fried food has been overcooked lately and is very hard to eat.  Examples include the fried mushroom are fried too long and the breading is so crisp and hard the mushroom can not even be cut with a knife.  The chicken tenders are also over fried and are so crisp and hard they are hard to
bite into.  We will return in a few more weeks to see if improvements have been made in the food arena."

This Saturday night we were going to go to our local Pho and THEY were SRO, so we thought we&#39;d try Goal Line since they were the closest restaurant.

We lucked out and they really weren&#39;t busy at all. The bar itself was packed, but the tables were pretty open and the waitress was very attentive, so it worked.

They had some happy hour specials going (even on a Saturday night until 7), so we got a couple beers. Fat Tire at Happy Hour was $3.50, which isn&#39;t that great of a price, but better than their non happy hour price of $4.50.

I got a bacon cheeseburger which came out just the way I like it - burnt to a crisp. It was actually missing the bacon but the waitress noticed it before I did and brought me out a plate so that worked. It also came with a huge allotment of fries and they were very crispy and tasty and really almost too much.

Service was quick, food was good, and the beer came out fast. What more can you ask for?"

We actually tried to come here once before and couldn&#39;t get a table - it does big business on game days.  They have tons of TVs + a couple pool tables.  However, this past Saturday night it was pretty open (bar was full, tables open). The waitress was attentive, although busy, so service was a touch slow.  The food was greasy goodness.  I had the Philly cheesesteak.  It was a little dry, but they loaded up the cheese so that helped.  I paired it with onion rings (for additional $1) and they were super salty - in a good way :)  

I&#39;d be back.  It is a nice local joint. No frills.  Happy hour last until 7p every night. It works!"

The ONLY reason I give it less than 5 stars is that the service seriously fluctuates.

It has a relatively laid back atmosphere that the regulars do not take over to the point you feel as an outsider.

That&#39;s what I thought happened. Frequent this establishment periodically purchasing Coors. Went to buy a pack of smokes about 11ish last night. Stopped in to drink a couple Coors. 
Obtained one from the typical employee of the business, abundance of cleavage, I believe there is a 3-inch minimum. I like the policy. Enjoyed a Spirit on their patio/sidewalk contemplating the Key Bank, Taco bell and the empty grocery store. Returned inside (bar stool) and who I assumed was a bar back (no cleavage) they are the only witnessed policy exempt employees, came over. I point at the bottle. He states, &#34;you&#39;ve had enough to drink.&#34; I thought, joking, you know, build rapport. I said smiling, &#34;I&#39;ve had one beer.&#34; Assumed bar back smiles/smirks/says, &#34;one beer here, go back to McCarthy&#39;s and drink.&#34; I felt it was a unique approach to customer service in a competitive business environment. Maybe the 200% profit on the transaction was insufficient for his time. Maybe his intrinsic BAC and recent history mechanism was down. Maybe he doesn&#39;t like me, weeping softly.
Leaving, I wanted to drunkenly stumble, I saw a nice young lady who has quickly evolved from the normal order dialogue in this place.

what can I get ya?
coors
coors light?
coors
coors bottle?
please

She just hands me a beer. Well, this nice young lady told me the bar back is actually the owner, and he will be here for two weeks. Excellent information, quickly delivered. 
Establishes a time line for possible consumption of Coors here again. Maybe.

The place was packed when we arrived--definitely glad we made a 8pm reservation ahead of time. We were seated around 10 minutes after our reservation.

Although this place is a little bit pricy as far as chain restaurants go, it was well with it. I had the Grilled Pork Tenderloin with a side of mashed potatoes and it was well worth the price. The tenderloin was juicy and cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery. My friend and I shared the (massive!) créme brûlée for dessert and I topped it off with a cappuccino.

Even better than the food was the service!  Despite how busy it was, our waitress was ridiculously on top of it and had an uncanny sense of when drinks needed to be refilled. Serious props to her!"

We weren&#39;t paying attention and ended here instead.  Happenstance is one of my favorite words and one of my most favorite life occurrence. 

We walked in and I noticed how dark this place is. You will get a peek of the kitchen and the reception desk.  We were warmly welcomed and walked to our table. 

I started with The 303 cocktail. I would get this again most definitely. I don&#39;t like cocktails that are too sweet. This concoction gives just the perfect amount of sweetness. It&#39;s Bulleit Rye whiskey, Briar Patch Bitters, Blueberry Jam and Fever Tree Ginger Beer. $12. 

We started with probably one of the best Calamari ever. It was nicely seasoned and the portion was great. 

I love my Rib Eye. So I needed to know if Alexander&#39;s is any good. It was:) Cooked perfectly to my request of medium. This came with a side of really good mashed potatoes. They make their own version of the Worcestershire sauce. I didn&#39;t use it. I truly don&#39;t sauce my food. That&#39;s why I appreciate this meat dish because it was good the way it came. Tender and well seasoned. 

Could be a date place because of the low lights all around and not to mention the red container holding the burning candle. 

Booths all around. Simply evokes an ambience that could be sinfully sexy :)

The cold and aloof atmosphere allows for great business talk. It would be a little strange to have an overly friendly wait staff constantly interrupting with the &#34;How&#39;s everything?&#34; banter that usually happens. 

Now with this in mind, the wait staff was fine. They kept the drinks full, delivered the food (for 7 people) at the same time and came when requested. 

I decided to go with the caesar salad with blackened salmon and it was very good and surprisingly filling. When the food came out, there was that quiet that settles in the group as people eat their obviously delicious meals. I would have liked to have had a bite of everyone&#39;s dishes but as I didn&#39;t, I&#39;ll mention that the aromas flying around their plates and into my salad-eating-face made me a bit envious.

She said the the time I asked for was booked and I said was there any other time available ( I was flexible) and she paused and said she was pretty sure she could get us a table for 5, because the only other option was a tiny booth with a giant chair on the end. 

I get there before my time- and what do I get. Tiny booth with a big chair. 5 tall grown adults do not fit comfortably knocking knees and rubbing elbows. 
It was for a birthday and I was utterly disappointed in the hostess. We left. use reason young high school Hostesses, those booths are just barely big enough for 4 average adults, and sticking a chair where waiters are running past the whole night, not smart. 

I love their food- and normally there aren&#39;t any problems. Just if you have a larger party make sure to be 100% clear on not having that booth situation ( unless you like knocking knees, rubbing elbows and having and over crowded table)."

The size of the side dishes are large. Six deviled eggs were quite filling for two people as an appetizer. The steaks were prepared perfectly. The steaks come in two seperate 3-4 oz pieces instead of one piece, but they turned out great and were not overdone.

We had her go back to remake it, well this time it was still horrible and she refused to remake the drink anymore or offer anything else to drink.  So we immediately ordered an appetizer.

Over 30 minutes later, we had ordered dinner, and seen our waitress one time (to order dinner); but still no appetizer.  Finally, the waitress realized that she had made a mistake; she went and got her &#34;manager&#34; a woman who was all of 24 years old (yes this is age discrimination).  This woman couldn&#39;t handle the situation.  She was &#34;willing to buy&#34; the appetizer.  Well, I didn&#39;t care about that - I came prepared to pay for dinner and I will pay for what I eat, if its delivered properly.  SOOOO then our dinner was being expedited and our salads were on their way out of the kitchen.  They basically were going to deliver the entire meal at one time.

So I told them to just cancel it and we left.  Side Note: I curse when I talk to people, not at the person but at situations.  For example, I do not call people names, but I may call an inanimate object a curse word.  No one gets hurt by that in my eyes.  So I did that in this situation, and well Ms. 24 year old manager couldn&#39;t take it and when I called the restaurant and spoke to the &#34;head&#34; manager Ben, he had a totally different point of view.  He told me that they were going to take care of our entire meals, which I was never told, and that cursing is against the restaurants&#39; religious policy?!?! I am not sure what that means but if he is going to sit on religion to not take care of customers - count me out of eating at this establishment!"

He got the crabcakes and I got a fillet with béarnaise sauce. Mine was ordered medium well plus but came medium however it was not too rare to enjoy and I devoured it without complaint. The béarnaise  sauce wasn&#39;t as delectable I was hoping but it was still nice, just not especially flavorful.

His crabcakes were delicious with large lumps of high quality crab and a good accompanying sauce. It came with fries which were the skinny shoe strong variety.

Drinks were a little pricey and so was the menu but didn&#39;t stop us from ordering what we wanted and fully enjoying the menu (quite a variety I must add.)

Grilled artichokes, I fell in love with. Steak tasted great but was a little tough for medium rare. Carrot cake was enjoyed just an hour later as we caught up on our shows on the couch."

Alexander&#39;s several times, so we revisited last night after a late trip to IKEA. Upon being told our wait would be no more than 30 minutes, we decided to stay. Over the course of our wait, we witnessed three parties be seated before us, despite their arrival after our check-in. This means one of two things - either the hostess cannot effectively manage reservations and walk-in traffic, or we were forgotten. We waited for a table for over an hour and checked in twice with the hostess to get an update. In addition, other waiting parties who checked in on their wait were offered a sincere apology and a free appetizer. When I checked in a second time and received a snooty response from the hostess with no apology or appetizer offer, I asked for the same treatment she was giving other tables.

Once we were seated, we were greeted by our server, who, honestly was the only positive piece of our experience. We ordered the Redlands salad with no tomato or crouton, as we both have a gluten allergy - the salad came out with tomatoes and croutons. I ordered a cocktail that took thirty minutes to arrive at the table - four ice cubes in a Manhattan was laughable, and the drink didn&#39;t arrive until well after our dinner was served. We placed our dinner order, hamburger, no bun, medium - this came out very medium-rare. My husband ordered fish tacos with grilled fish due to the gluten allergy. After another long wait for the food, the tacos came out breaded &amp; deep fried and had to be sent back. When they came back grilled, took one bite of the tacos and nearly had to spit it out - I have never tasted such &#34;fishy&#34; fish. They were awful. 

We arrived at the restaurant at 7, weren&#39;t seated until 8:15, and we didn&#39;t leave until 9:20. The initial wait was over-promised and under-delivered, the wait for the food &amp; drink was unacceptable, and the food was hardly passable. The only saving grace was our kind and understanding server who knew we had a terrible experience and, without hesitation, granted our request to have two of the items removed from our bill. 

Given our clear disappointment with the evening, and our kind but firm request to the server about our bill, this should have prompted a table visit from management, but the smug-looking, suited gentleman chose to stay planted by the kitchen for the entire evening. 

This is not the style of service or quality of food J. Alexander&#39;s prides themselves on, and they should be embarrassed. We will not be returning."

We went there today for Easter lunch, and while we had a good experience, I noticed a couple of things that could have been better.

My wife had the pork loin which comes with mashed potatoes. They serve the mashed potatoes with a pad of butter on top. The potatoes were warm, but they weren&#39;t hot enough to melt the butter that was on top of them.

I had the prime rib which was tender and flavorful, but it came with the same mashed potatoes that were warm, but not hot. I miss the old &#34;smashed potatoes&#34; that were served made from skin-on leftover baked potatoes.

I ordered iced tea, but there was only one packet of sugar at my table. I had to request more, and it was promptly provided. There was plenty of fake sugar, but I only like the real stuff.

Dessert was quite good. The key lime pie was the special today. It was house-made, slightly tart, and sweet enough to match the tartness. It tasted more like lemon than lime to me, but the crust and the texture of the pie was excellent. My wife had the carrot cake which is always excellent, but seemed especially dark today.

Overall, our service was pretty good, and we were promptly seated. Lunch with appetizer and dessert was $140 with tip for our table of four.

J Alexander&#39;s is still quite good, but it&#39;s no longer a five-star Yelp review for me. If I&#39;m looking for a place to go for a celebration, I think I might go one step up to Elway&#39;s instead."

J. Alexander&#39;s is a fantastic venue to experience a culinary treat.  The food and drinks are phenomenal; furthermore, the dark lighting and comfortable seating combine to make any social gathering a special one.

Unless you&#39;ve made reservations, there is generally a decent wait before being seated.  I suggest that you wait it out at the bar, located to the right of the entrance.  The drinks are amazing and the servers are engaging.  Once seated, the choice is yours as to what to eat.  You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.  Be sure to save room for dessert after that appetizer and entree.  The chocolate cake is phenomenal!  Seriously........you better get a slice of that!!

The lighting here is ultra dark.  I know some of you don&#39;t care for that, but I have found that it sets a nice tone for conversation and relaxation.  Speaking of relaxing, the seating is exceedingly comfortable.  Relax, eat and socialize until your mind, heart, and stomach are content!

Don&#39;t forget the chocolate cake!!!"

The multiple peppers they used were all fresh which was a nice touch.  It was more of mac and cheese style dish than a true pasta entree though.  Also kind of pricey for what it was.  Definitely a hot spot for the Denver suburb yuppie crowd if that&#39;s your scene.

I&#39;ve been eating here for nearly 10 years. We would have business lunches here before I moved to Colorado and now have regular family dinners. The food, drink, and service are exceptional and consistent. They mix a lovely martini and you get the &#39;extra&#39; on the side making the price very affordable. 

It&#39;s really good food made perfectly. My son loves the calamari and it might be the best calamari I&#39;ve had in Colorado. The pork loin dinner was huge and easily can feed two (same with the steak burger). They also make a decent steak too. The carrot cake is worth taking home (don&#39;t forget to warm it up). The service is impeccable and always offer a free mimosa at weekend brunch (who doesnt like free booze?)."

I know, I know, it&#39;s a steakhouse, what am I doing.  But trust me, if you run in for lunch, you&#39;ll be set for the rest of the day.  They also have a prime rib french dip that is astronomically good and for the current moment the best in town.  If you like a more authentic french dip, make sure to tell them no horseradish.

As for dinner, their prime rib is wonderful.  Worth every penny and with a nice glass of red wine you probably won&#39;t need to eat breakfast the next day.  Which reminds me, if you order the large prime rib, you can take half of it home and have it for breakfast the next day. ;)

I&#39;m a bourbon \ whisky person and they have quite a few custom drinks that focus on them.  If you enjoy whisky as much as I do, you&#39;ll really like their various custom drinks on their special menu.

As for their dessert, their creme&#39; brulee is really good.  Fresh strawberries, blackberries, and a twig of mint on top it is well worth it for you and a friend, or maybe all just for YOURSELF!"

It&#39;s definitely one of the nicer places in the area. We reviewed the menus and there was nothing under $15 including the salads which was shocking but we ordered anyway. My husband and I split a French dip sandwich and my mother in law got the crispy cod sandwich special. The portions were huge. The French dip was ok but the an jus was made you come back for more. Fries were just average. The cod sandwich had a spread that was somewhere between thousand island and tartar but somewhat bitter, my mother in law ended up scraping it off. 
Service was ok, not bad but far from amazing. We had to look for the waitress when it was time to pay the bill. Total price for 2 meals and a iced tea was $42. Even with portion sizes considered, it was way overpriced. I&#39;m not sure we will back again, there are better deals for your dollar."

the service I could have gone to chili&#39;s and got a better service
Dessert was so so  the best was when we got the bill  and one of our friend wanted a separate bill instead of charging 35.00 for her part he charged 350.00

I recently went to J Alexander&#39;s for dinner with the Rents and got my Martini on. Not sure if I was just in the Holiday mood, but I went a couple deep on the Martini&#39;s (Blue Cheese Olives). That doesn&#39;t even factor in the couple I had before I arrived. Started off with the grilled artichoke which is always worth the messy hands and constant picking. 
My entree was even better (please note I was eating under the influence so I may have impaired taste buds) I had the seared tuna salad and was pleasantly surprised for being in landlocked CO. Great all around experience and I will be back for dinner again."

I ordered a the fresh salmon with a side of their fries. The salmon was visually appealing with nice grill marks and seasonings. It was cooked well and was nice and flakey.

Not sure if they are using lower  quality meat or less attentive preparation but on my last several visits the prime rib was not tender, dry, and lacked flavor. 

On these last two visits I suspect they reheated a slice of meat from the night before and that just does not work. I&#39;d prefer they just say they are out of fresh cuts than serve something sub par. The former approach keeps a customer the later loses one for good."

My wife and I have eaten here 1-2 times a year ever since they opened in Lone Tree.  It has been our &#34;go-to&#34; for a good steak or prime rib.

That said, we celebrated our wedding anniversary last night and chose to have our meal at J. Alexanders.  It seems to have changed.  Yeah - the prime rib was good, but my Filet Mignon was mediocre at best.  My wife substituted the NYO Mac and Cheese for her mashed potatoes.  The au jus for her prime rib was incredibly salty.  The not your ordinary mac and cheese was exactly that - very ordinary and was overwhelmed by the panko bread crumbs (more bread crumbs than pasta).  My baked potato was very dry - I even tried dipping a bite in the au jus but it was far to salty. 

We both ordered a glass of wine, for $9 min a glass - you expect a glass of wine.  Not 1/2 a glass.  And the fact that they have 3 different menus for drinks tells me where they want to make their money.  

My wife asked to take her leftovers home, there was some broccoli, some of her Mac-n-cheese and 1/2 of her prim rib.  We felt our son would enjoy it.  All that was in the box was the prim rib and some of the broccoli stalks.  None of the horseradish,  none of the mac-n-cheese....  

We have no issue spending over $100 for a nice diner out, especially with drinks, and J Alexander&#39;s has been a favorite of ours for years.  But now - it seems we will be looking for a new favorite.   It hurts when someone/thing you trust lets you down and disappoints like this."

An expensive exception, but if work is paying it is the perfect option. 

This was the case when I went out for a work lunch with my boss earlier this week. He went with his standby of the Ahi Tuna Salad and I chose the Redwood Salad. 

I&#39;m not a salad lover, but the toppings pulled me in. The rotisserie chicken that was extremely juicy and tender (and plentiful!) and the fresh chunks of ripe avocado were the most memorable. 

I don&#39;t normally eat a lot on a work lunch either. I usually save half and get two free meals out of it (come on, we all do it). However, I devoured this. Not enough to bring home any leftovers this time. 

The vibe is definitely upper class, people on business lunches, and you should expect a wait if you haven&#39;t made a reservation. We were quoted 10 minutes but only had to wait about 5.

Awful dinner tonight at a place we normally love. Bugs everywhere!! Had to move tables. Waitress explained they&#39;ve had an exterminator in here twice already but it&#39;s not helping. Another table also had to move. They did give us $50 off our bill for a party of five, but the manager made up a different story about landscaping causing problems. The number of bugs was disgusting. We normally love this place but will not come back until the winter when bugs are gone. Horrible experience!!  And ps now they are not seating anyone near the Windows where our original table was. Yuck yuck yuck!!!!!"

They were so busy with every single other person there and still noticed me! 
Beau ordered a beer and me a martini (love the side cars!) we also got an Alex&#39;s salad and a bowl of chicken pasta soup. Sitting on the side rail, we still received the same service as if we would be at the bar or at a table. Thanks so much j. Alexander&#39;s for taking care of us!"

My sone had a hamburger with fries. The haystack fries were good, and the hamburger was huge. He also had an alcoholic drink, but I cannot recall it&#39;s name. He really liked it.

Both drinks were smooth and fabulous, the artichokes were out of this world.

For the main course, we had the Prime Rib and Ahi Tuna, both cooked to perfection. We were not able to have any dessert because we were quite full at this point, the portions were just right.

The service was fantastic. The server was very attentive and pleasant, not overly so though. I would come back for dinner again without hesitation."

It is all about the prime rib here although really everything I have tried here is good.  They have a wood fired rotisserie which is what makes for the amazing prime rib.  I&#39;ve ordered the prime rib sandwich for lunch a ton of time and ditched the bread roll.  The service is always great as well.

Definitely recommend all around."

For two things, and two things only. 
Not Your Ordinary Mac and Cheese and 
Carrot Cake. 
I&#39;ve never tried anything else, and to be honest, I probably won&#39;t.

At first glance the menu it doesn&#39;t look like anything extraordinary but I&#39;ve been blown away multiple times by the amazing flavors here.  The service has always been fantastic.  There is usually a wait in the evenings but you can make reservations.  We have come here with a large party of 12 and we were all served in a very timely manner and the server did a great job.

Things to try:
The Martinis are super strong and they give you a leftover container kept on ice.
The Queso is amazing.   Spinach in it gives it a unique awesome flavor.
Prime Rib is fantastic.
Danish Baby Back ribs.  This is quite possibly my favorite main course from here.
Not so ordinary Mac N Cheese - BEST Mac N Cheese I&#39;ve ever had.  Although the kids in our party didn&#39;t like the macaroni and cheese.  I think it&#39;s because they use gruyere and other more &#34;grown up&#34; cheeses.  I think it&#39;s to die for.

The prices are about the same as a decent steakhouse.  Most plates were around $25-35.  In my opinion totally worth it."

Food:  Ordered the steak burger.  With fries.  Shoestring fries are great!  Burger was eminently mediocre.   Cheese was barely melted.  For $13 or $14 I expect better than meh.

Service was OK although did have to request an ice tea refill twice.

Plus, going downtown means you need to pay for parking so, my friend and I saw this restaurant on yelp and it had good reviews and we thought we&#39;d give it a try. This restaurant doesn&#39;t seat your party unless at least half of the party is present and so, luckily when my group arrived half of us were officially present. 

The waitress began by telling us she will be having another waiter help her with our group and we thought that would be great because it can get overwhelming with just one waitress. Sadly, we were wrong. I am pretty sure I could have waited on us better single handedly than the 2 of them did with our party. They were very attentive with drinks. They came back every 5 minutes to make sure none of our alcoholic drinks were empty.  I do have to compliment them on their alcoholic drinks though, those were quite yummy. So, nice job bartender!!  However post food arrival, I did not see our servers more than once or twice. We also told them ahead of time that we would be splitting our checks so that they could organize our checks when it was time to leave. Unfortunately, some peoples drinks ended up on other peoples tabs that didn&#39;t order drinks, but it was late and everyone decided to just let it be. 

The food was actually not horrible. The people that ordered steaks did enjoy their meals, I had the crab cakes and they would have been very tasty if they had laid off on the salt. They also mixed up our food orders from person to person so, everyone was passing around plates to the right person.

Overall, it sounds like from other reviews that if you have a big group, don&#39;t come here due to service. Otherwise if it is a smaller group, I think you get the best of both worlds with good food and service. In my opinion, for the price you should be able to get great food and service no matter the group size."

Unfortunately we had a bad experience on Valentine&#39;s day and just now decided to try our favorite restaurant again.

We tried to order our favorite appetizer and they were out. When we then opted to order their next recommendation they again had to tell us ten minutes later they were out of that, too. The service lagged, drinks were left empty, portion sizes are continuously dwindling and the lettuce was not as fresh as it always is. 

Maybe we were just too used to such great expectations that they can&#39;t keep it up. We sadly skipped out on the famous carrot cake because we didn&#39;t want to have to wait twenty minutes for it. Sad day."
j-alexanders-redlands-grill-englewood,Jessica T.,9-2DNzpdFfPpFzkdvGbd4Q,"Centennial, CO",1,1,1,181,15,A8Io7JHNQJkkl_-tVovmEQ,4.0,2014-05-05,"I&#39;m going to preface this with the fact that it&#39;s really hard to not compare this place to Shanahan&#39;s or Del Frisco&#39;s...they are a steakhouse with the dark wood and servers wearing button downs and ties. But, I also recognize they technically can&#39;t compete against those places because the pricing is scaled back so it comes down to simple &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;, which isn&#39;t a bad thing. To me, J Alexander&#39;s is the perfect middle ground between a Texas Roadhouse or a high-end steakhouse. You can satisfy your need for a good steak dinner, with above par service and dine in a somewhat upscale atmosphere- considering all those factors, that&#39;s where I came to 4 stars.

My family and I wanted to try something new for dinner, on a slightly lower price point than the higher end steakhouses, while still pleasing most of us with the predictable steakhouse menu. This place hit the nail on the head for our needs!

The servers are all on the young(er) side which I felt came with a bit of inexperience/ lack of confidence but we still had great service all told. Our server figured out pretty quickly we were there for a long, leisurely meal and he quickly adjusted and provided exactly what we needed.

The cocktail menu is pretty boring (I rely on restaurants to help me be creative with my drinking choices), and the lemon drop I ordered had an insanely thick sugar rim. At one point, I decided to try their pear martini and the server was great when I told him it was undrinkable! I explained it tasted very floral, and since the bartender didn&#39;t even remember making a pear martini, we figured out he might have grabbed the wrong vodka; he quickly brought me another lemon drop, to be safe. But, they do the COOLEST thing when serving their cocktails! They bring you your cocktail in the predictable martini glass, but they also bring a bourbon-type snifter filled with ice water, in which is a little glass container filled with more of your cocktail! So, you really get closer to one and a half cocktails, and the extra stays cold until you&#39;re ready for it and doesn&#39;t get watered down!! Seriously, brilliant. Decent wine list as well, gotta love a good Caymus!

For appetizers, we really enjoyed the calamari- all rings! Lightly seasoned, light breading and the calamari was very tender. Some of the best calamari I&#39;ve ever had. The artichokes were good, but they were on the small side and the leaves didn&#39;t have much &#34;meat&#34;, though they were very well seasoned and charred nicely.

All of us ordered steak in some form for our entrees. My filet was a very nice cut, not fatty at all, and well-seasoned and cooked to order perfectly. Everyone else&#39;s meat was also quality and tasty. And you get the bonus of a side coming with your entree vs paying extra for family style sides at the &#34;other&#34; places. $31 for generous portion of quality filet mignon plus a side is a pretty darn good deal. 

We all tried the &#34;Not Your Ordinary&#34; mac n&#39; cheese for our side (as the rest of the choices were pretty ho-hum), and even though we were warned it had onions none of us expected that to be the overwhelming flavor, but unfortunately it was. The parmesan crust on top was baked well, and the gruyere cheese was a good touch, but the onion flavor was so overwhelming we each only took a few bites of the crunchy baked top part and nothing else. So, pretty disappointing, but we were so full it was fine.

For dessert we shared the carrot cake, and wow was it rich! Plus, it was a HUGE piece of cake. The icing was very sweet but tasty, and while we enjoyed it I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. 

All in all, it was good for what it was. The steaks held their own, pretty dang important in a steakhouse, and the service was good. I would personally probably choose the splurge at one of the &#34;other&#34; places for my next steak dinner, but it really is a great middle range option."

I&#39;m not complaining, I LOVE steakhouses.... I just sometimes wish  it wasn&#39;t such a tough decision since there&#39;s several really great ones. That being said, a place like J Alexander&#39;s has an uphill battle given that it&#39;s a chain. Not that chains are necessarily bad, they just have less of an appeal to me when the local joints are so good. (Note: j Alexander&#39;s doesn&#39;t bill themselves as a steakhouse... It&#39;s more the menu offerings and the general upscale-ness of the place that makes me think of them in the same category).

But the food here really is good. They have a well prepared, creative menu, and the stuff is reasonably priced compared to the local joints I mentioned (Elway&#39;s, Shanehans, etc..). I am not a sweets guy, but my wife claims that their &#34;best ever chocolate cake&#34; is..... well.... the best ever. So good name choice there, I guess. It&#39;s huge, very moist and rich. 

So, good restaurant, good quality, pretty good service (although last time I was there with a party of 6 an 18% gratuity was added automatically to the bill... Whenever that happens I can&#39;t help but feel I&#39;m being treated like child). I would recommend one of the many local Denver steakhouses over this.... But you more than likely will still leave happy from j Alexander&#39;s."

We have plenty of good/great dining options in the area but J&#39;s has made us extended family without knowing it, they&#39;re the best - here&#39;s why.

Know when to go - (no reservations but I think they accommodate a call ahead) for dinner plan to show up no later than 6p, 6:02p and you&#39;re likely waiting for a bit. At this time you can chose your table; level-center (nice with some noise), mezzanine windows (spacious and less noise but may be cool on a below-zero evening) or the patio (bring sun glasses and a camera). No problem to ask for your favorite waiter or waitress wherever you sit. I&#39;m extremely sensitive to noise, I recommend taking a moment to assess where the &#39;sales-rep tables&#39; are and creating some distance, NE corner mezzanine is least noise, but noise has only been a problem a couple of times.

Waiting for a table isn&#39;t so bad, watch the grill masters at work or better, head to the full bar; stools, several high-tops and elbow room. They do a &#39;hard-shake&#39; martini like nobody&#39;s business, stand in front of you while they prepare it and the planned over pour comes in a chilled side-car; super, I&#39;ll have another. There&#39;s a couple TV&#39;s behind the bar but not dominating the atmosphere. The full menu is also available at the bar.

Bring your appetite. I&#39;ve had everything on the menu from sides to burgers to steel-head to dessert. J&#39;s will put whatever they have in the kitchen on a nice plate for you, design your own dinner, the menu is just a suggestion. I start thinking about what to have around noon on Thursday date night, I&#39;m not going to have the NY Strip again. Not going to get it just warmer than medium. Not going to swap the signature mac-n-cheese for garlic mashed taters. Not going to request my 2nd cosmo when it&#39;s served - I&#39;m not. But I almost always do. When the guacamole is in season - get it. The calamari is ho-hum, go for the mussels.

Follow up with a coffee and carrot cake and you&#39;re good until next week!"

First of all, the service was impeccable. We consistently had people checking on us at just the right amount of intervals - we never felt intruded upon or annoyed - just well taken-care of. I ordered the crab cakes, and my companion ordered the roasted chicken. Both were superb. The mashed potatoes were lacking in character, but the fries were wonderful. We ordered a side of broccoli, which had been &#34;gussied up&#34; with parmesan and butter and was perfectly cooked. The bread, despite being fresh from the oven, would be better complemented by a butter with more character - it was a bit bland - my guess is that it&#39;s a whipped and (basically) unsalted butter.

Overall, we were impressed with the service, and the flavor was truly wonderful. We look forward to our next trip here."

Last but not least, our waitress Casey was friendly, fast and helpful.  Great experience!"

Walking in, you are hit in the face with the aroma of ribs, roasted chicken, steak, and whatever else they have on the grill. 

Cozy and intimate atmosphere, as the lights are dim, the booths are large, and there is dark wood everywhere.

Food, service, and value were terrific. I had the steak frites and immediately wanted more. It was delicious."

Consistent in great service, food, atmosphere, etc. You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu; I love the cheeseburgers, french dip sandwich, Tai Kai salad, and ribs (just fall off the bone) but the best is their prime rib. OMG, it is the best prime rib I&#39;ve ever had! I never get dessert in restaurants but here, you&#39;ve just gotta splurge and get the carrot cake.

The place is a little pricey but everything is worth it. This is my one go-to restaurant for a bit of a splurge. I even choose J. Alexander&#39;s over a fancier and more expensive steakhouse. The smartest thing they never did was open up more locations in Colorado. I think it makes this Park Meadows restaurant highly desirable and a special place to go since you know it&#39;s one of a kind."

I personally love their ahi tuna which is seared (barely) to perfection, the fire grilled artichokes are to die for and the creme brulee is just plain sinful. The Hubby can not resist their steak &amp; frites but occasionally he tears himself away from the steak for the killer prime rib!  

I like the casual wooded contemporary ambiance Alexander&#39;s offers with large booths and comfortable tables.

I got the baby back rib with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Everything was very yummy. I thought the rib they gave me had very good flavor but seemed to be a bit of a fatty cut. Still good.

The service was good, and the gentleman serving was very friendly. If I were to rate the restaurant solely on these two factors, they would have gotten four stars.

Additionally, I was only in for a burger and a salad - so to say that this is a great review for their main dishes isn&#39;t so. However, the Steak Burger that was served to me was overcooked, tough and not very flavorful. The grilled onion came out nearly raw and so strong that it was inedible. I skipped the Island sauce and was glad for it because it was like Thousand Island dressing with a couple of teaspoons of added sugar. Way too sweet for a burger.

The caesar salad was good, but the croutons were laden with vegetable oil - so much so that it was all I could taste and they were worthless save the crunch.

Would I come here again and give them another chance? Sure. But tonight&#39;s meal quality was much closer to Texas Roadhouse than Shanahan&#39;s or Flanigan&#39;s. And, after all, restaurants of J. Alexander&#39;s caliber should pay more attention to the quality of their food if they want to carry the stature and credibility of the greats."

I&#39;m sure glad that we did! The food here is really good! We started out our meal with the Ahi Tacos. Which consisted of Tuna Tartare, Avocado and a spicy citrus mayo. Neatly presented on a metal framed rack. Boy, these were an excellent choice by my girlfriend! The presentation of the appetizer was pretty and the taste of everything worked so well together. I&#39;m glad it was a crunchy taco shell, because the texture was nice working with the tuna&#39;s soft buttery-ness. 

The establishment itself was really nice and elegant, very clean looking. Had a reservation and they seated us right away after checking in. 

I ordered an alcoholic drink, being the Sangria. It had to be the best one i&#39;ve ever had! There was a popsicle in it, which complimented the drink so much! I am a sucker for frozen items, so adding that nice little touch was a surprise when I ordered it! I ordered the Shaved Prime Steak sandwich and I am so pleased with it! Sandwiches are one of my favorite food items and this steak sandwich here was the best one i&#39;ve ever had! The steak was so tender and moist that it melted in my mouth! Such a great thing to have in my mouth! It came with sweet potato fries and I loved them! Very good! My girlfriend ordered the Prime Sliced Steak. Plated beautifully and also tender and cooked perfectly! It came with jalapeño mashed potatoes and those paired nicely with her protein! They gave us a dessert on the house to finish our meal since it was Valentine&#39;s Day. It was a mini dessert trio consisting of Nutella bread pudding, chocolate cake and mini coconut cream pie. These seemed to be 3 tiny portions of their desserts menu made just for the holiday. And although they were small, they were very tasty and a delicious way to end our meal! A great sampling to get us to order their regular sized desserts if we weren&#39;t already full! I took pictures of all the food we had and put them on here to help with a visual of the great food!

We were sat at the fun side of the restaurant. Right next to the bar. Yeah it&#39;s the better side if you are looking for a fun night. Want a subdued, sweet interlude? Request the other side. It&#39;s far away from the fun crowd as you can be. 

Anyways. Fun atmosphere and a waitress that was a bit clumsy made for a laughter filled dinner. 

Food was not bad at all. I mean my dish was really tasty. I had the following:

VIP Martini
Corn soup
Cheesesteak egg rolls
Filet Mignon with peppercorn sauce.

The latter was done right by me. Peppercorn sauce is my favorite sauce if I ever use or needed one. This is it! The cheesesteak egg rolls was perfectly seasoned and that crunch. Oh my!  Even the corn soup was very good. 

Now that VIP Martini. Get this!

Knowing they have complimentary valet service, coming here sure is convenient.  When I entered, the place was bustling with predators and cougars. Happy Hour here is apparently very popular.  We had a reservation for four and we were seated in a booth near the central bar.  Getting around was a feat in itself.  Our waitress was very nice and managed to serve us with care even with the masses of people in her way.  She was also very sweet and knowledgable. 

The restaurant week menu was full of great choices including starters and entrees.  To start, I went with the Cheesesteak Egg Rolls that were crispy and full of grilled steak and melted cheese, garnished with sweet and spicy sauce.  For my entree I selected the Meatloaf, which was tasty with a savory mushroom twist.  I actually had to confirm that I had the correct dish.  The meatloaf was sitting atop of mashed potatoes that were splendid, the mixed in potato skins was a nice touch with added texture.  For dessert we had chocolate bread pudding and fudge brownie, which were okay. 

Overall it was a great experience, but next time I will ask to be seated on the restaurant side and won&#39;t dine duration happy hour."

Who dresses Philly cheese steak eggrolls with chili sauce?  I think a bright flavored cheese sauce would&#39;ve been more appropriate. 

The chips and Guac were good.

The artichoke was tender. 

My lamb burger was fresh and cooked to tenderness, I would&#39;ve preferred a more toasted bun to get some crunch, but eh.

Wife&#39;s patty melt was more bread than beef.

The service was pretty good, but not quite perfect.  The food, though... the food is excellent, and the reason that I&#39;ll definitely be back.

We had to wait a little longer for refills than I&#39;d like (especially considering that they weren&#39;t busy), and my wife&#39;s salad had dressing even though she ordered it without.  Those are my only real complaints, though (and the salad was still good enough that she ate it without complaint)

The guacamole appetizer is very tasty, and the shredded pork burrito is easily one of the best breakfast burritos in Denver (it might be THE best)!  It comes with an interesting meat sauce that the menu doesn&#39;t mention... it reminded me a little bit of mushrooms, but my wife thought it tasted more like curry.  Either way, it&#39;s amazing."

This is mostly based on a specific menu item. Each time I have been here I have ordered the grilled artichoke as I think it is one of the best things on their menu. However, it only comes out properly cooked half of the time. When it comes out cooked like it should it is amazing and when it comes out undercooked it is inedible. 
Two of the four times I have ordered this we have not been able to finish eating it because you can&#39;t get anything off the artichoke leaves as they are hard and fibrous when undercooked. The last time I was there was the first time my friend had ever had an artichoke and I will say it was likely her last as she couldn&#39;t understand how to eat something so hard and so much work. It should not be that difficult to boil an artichoke until fully cooked."

I&#39;ve heard really great, but intimidating things like if you&#39;re not there by the end of lunch forget about it, and they may have a dress code.  Well, we finally made it and neither of those things proved to be limiting.  Granted it was about 2pm on a Sunday so between the brunch/ dinner hours and the only game on was MLS.  I could see how the rooftop patio would fill up quickly.  Her boyfriend knows the franchise from another city and knew what to order.  

Honestly, I don&#39;t think you can really go wrong.  Both my friend and I ordered salads with dressing on the side (neither of them  came to the table that way) but everything was no less delicious.  The steakhouse salad was the perfect size and temperature (I don&#39;t think you can have steak or tuna too rare, btw) The guacamole and chip appetizer was so good, we ordered two. My husband ordered the burrito, which was absolutely massive (as they often are) the sauce reminded me of a curry more than a chili, not sure that was what they were going for but it&#39;s really good! I also tried the youth serum cocktail, not a brunch beverage, but very refreshing.

Service was fine, the worst thing was the dressing issue.  The space was great, I picked the booth with the best shade, but toward the end of our lunch it was a little inadequate. I&#39;d definitely come back!"

Del Frisco&#39;s is a nice addition to Cherry Creek.  The space is substantial, with the bar area separated from the main dining room.  The bar is surrounded by overstuffed booths that have excellent views of the many TV&#39;s showing the day&#39;s football games (my Fantasy Football line up is rough this year).  

We opted to sit at the bar and enjoy the College football on TV.  I started with a cocktail called The Morning After that had coconut water and coconut vodka - refreshing and delicious.  The second cocktail was a Bloody Mary, the Bloody Mary mix is well seasoned with just a hint of spice, the blue cheese stuffed olive was quite tasty as well (I&#39;ll take 10 of these next time please).

We shared the Deviled Eggs with chive truffle vinaigrette.  The deviled eggs were stuffed generously with the yolk mixture and I loved the flavor, although I thought the truffle was a little heavy handed.  I ordered the Grab a Pair lunch option for $12.  I choose a Caesar Salad and the Spicy Pork Meatball Flatbread.  The lunch combination was a great size and left me full but not overly so.  I enjoyed the salad however the garlic in the dressing was overpowering and took away from the Caesar Salad.  The Flatbread was very nice and would be a fun dish to share with a group.

Service is good in the bar area; our bartender was friendly and was fun to chat with about all the happenings in Denver.  Being a Cherry Creek local, I will definitely be back to try HH, dinner and the rooftop deck in April."

I decided to go in and try the establishment from its name alone. I was seated by a window early this summer, I felt relaxed and enjoyed looking at the decor. I especially loved the shoe painting on the wall. I started off looking at the wine list and noticed they had Muscato. I had to try this particular brand. I was disappointed to learn they were out, but my waitress was able to get me the last little bit on the house, very sweet of her. WOW, just wow! Best I had ever tasted! I am no wine connoisseur but it was sweet, not too bubbly and smooth. I then tried the recommendation of the cheesesteak egg rolls. MMM!!! Simply scrumptious! I love the pairing with the chili sauce and honey mustard. You wouldn&#39;t think they would work well together or even overpower the meat, however it was so delicious together. You will want to check them out! Do not take my word for it. I had a sandwich and fries, which were good, though the fries were cold and undercooked. My waitress apologized and took them back. Overall it was a wonderful experience. I definitely planned on being back. 

Sure enough about a month later I did. However, I had come on a late afternoon when there was a party going on up on the rooftop. This meant everyone was in the bar area and wow, it was packed. I met the manager who was in town visiting from Texas and she was understanding enough to let me sit at a table for happy hour. They were out of Muscato again this 2nd time. Cheesesteak egg rolls were still delicious. 

About two weeks after that I tried to go back again. This time I sat at the bar watching baseball and shooting the breeze with the bartender. A nice young guy. I took his recommendation and had a Filet Mignon. I like my steaks medium and it as well worth it! I also finally got two glasses of Muscato as they finally had some. They do sell the wine by the bottle and I believe the Muscato is around $35 a bottle. I do plan to purchase one soon and of course I will keep going back for their delicious cheesesteak egg rolls.

Love the friendly staff, very sincere and quick to respond. Love the decor and chic atmosphere. Love the great food and great taste. An experience worth having!"

Everyone enjoyed the flat breads as an appetizer, I did not try the roasted tomato, but the wild mushroom was phenomenal.  

I did get the crab Benedict with a spicy lobster sauce which was tasty, the eggs should be poached in a Benedict and these came out soft boiled instead (not a big deal, but meh), loved the crab and the lobster sauce was really tasty, but not a big fan of it being on focaccia, since it seemed to much bread for me (maybe it was because I already had the yummy flat bread as an app, so maybe my bad).

The desserts were fab and I highly recommend the Coconut Cream Pie....it is a sharing dessert for sure.  We also shared the Nutella Bread Pudding Dessert  (drool over those pictures Baby!).

The staff was very attentive and accomodating since my Mom has issues with her dish and they let her replace with a new item with no charge for either and for my birthday they didn&#39;t give us just one dessert comped to share we had the two.

Great location, free valet, Sunday free meter parking, parking garage in the back if needed.

My 1st visit was the Friday Jan 29. I had a reservation for 3. We arrived 20 min early so we we checked in at the host stand and then waited patiently in the bar area for our table. Ordered a couple drinks and stood around chatting. 20m later we noticed that a booth in the bar opened and we grabbed it since the bar area is open seating. Not too long after sitting down, I realized that I received a text that our table was ready. Wait...what!? The ladies at the stand NEVER mentioned that we&#39;d get a text that our table was ready. I would have taken my phone out of my purse had I known this. Secondly, when our table was ready and no one came to check in for our party, why didn&#39;t one of the 4 of you at the hostess stand come get us? 

After taking a seat in the booth, we waited for quite a while before being greeted, I&#39;d say about 15min. When our server finally arrived, she didn&#39;t have a pen and seemed very flustered. She went to grab a pen and proceeded to take our order. I ordered the Prime Rib sandwich and my friends both ordered the roasted chicken. A-OK! 

Feb 5 was my 2nd visit for dinner with the girls. Food was great. Amanda our server was awesome and very attentive. The only critique I have is that when I ordered the lamb burger Medium-Plus, Amanda didn&#39;t give me a heads-up that the patty is pretty thin. So a Medium-Plus temperature would over cook it. It came out like a hockey puck. I truly expected a much thicker patty. Amanda graciously had it redone at Medium and it was perfect! 

For desert we shared the lemon cake. It was just OK and disappointingly dry. Six ladies didn&#39;t finish half of it. 

One of my friend&#39;s had the filet mignon which was delish! I&#39;ll go back for that or the Prime Rib.

So if you are looking for a bit more upscale in the area this is the place.  The main dining room is open with ample seating and the bar is setup so inviting, it just says to you to come in and sit and to stay awhile.  There&#39;s a couple of private areas for your parties, one large and another intimate.   A large group of us recently chose the larger room for dining and for watching the Broncos game.  But the day of this review I came with a group of women to celebrate a birthday and celebrate the holidays so we sat in the Mile High room,  which is a wonderful private and lovely seated area.  My favorite spot for a small group of 6 to 10.

Food is usually excellent and their one page menu has a great selection of entrees for brunch.  I&#39;ve not been for dinner yet and assume there&#39;s a variation to the menu.  I&#39;m a light brunch kinda girl so my go to is the Caesar with anchovies, and iced tea, but by no means is either hohum, Caesar is perfect and they have infused teas.   On our visit one of my guests didn&#39;t get her egg dish quite right but they graciously remade and still not to her liking, she decided on a different option.  They were so wonderful about &#34;taking care&#34; of it and my guest, great impressive and right thing to do!  The eggs benedict&#39;s option are nice and the whole poached egg is really intriguing to see.  There were several other food choices that I heard were great as well.   But in the end it was the killer desserts that swept us off our feet.  Yes, you might say Bread pudding isn&#39;t dessert but YES it is, and here it&#39;s delicious with a smile on your face!!

Last kudos goes to the staff, every single one them we came in touch with was super well trained and accommodating. And not because they took care of an order to make our guest happy but for all the smiles, thank you&#39;s and the quick service.  When I asked to break out the check into separate checks our server said, no problem.   For groups this is super important and so many places don&#39;t do it or find it a problem. Can&#39;t wait to come back for dinner and to try a burger at the bar!

Well done, Del Frisco&#39;s, Cherry Creek I&#39;ll see you soon!"

We had dinner reservations in the week leading up to Christmas and the place was PACKED. I mean like &#34;is the fire marshall okay with this?&#34; packed. Of course the Christmas frenzy + only being open for 6 weeks lent to the madness, but holy smokes. The tables were all so close together that you actually could not squeeze through, but rather had to map out your exit strategy.

Anyway, things were a little slow, but our waitress was apologetic and we were enjoying our company so we didn&#39;t really care. We started with the deviled eggs and some soups/salads, all of which were solid. I think we had the heirloom burrata salad, the Grille salad, and the corn bisque after the eggs? I remember the burrata salad being delicious and definitely what I would order next time.

As far as entrees go - BEEF STROGANOFF FOR THE WIN. OMG. It was amazeballs. It&#39;s one of those dishes that I&#39;m always hesitant to order in restaurants because everyone has their own take. Is it going to be sour cream-based? Is it going to be wine-based? Are they going to be skimpy with their beef? Is Hamburger Helper going to be better than what I&#39;m about to order? Delightfully, this delivered - in a big way. The entree is wine-based with deliciously huge chunks of short rib plus mushrooms and onions. And yay for not being skimpy on the sauce! There&#39;s nothing worse than eating dry noodles which seems to happen quite a bit with this dish.

I think the others at our table had the shaved prime steak sandwich and were pleased. It still doesn&#39;t measure up to Hillstone&#39;s french dip, but we&#39;ve conceded that nothing ever really will.

All said and done - it was good, but needs to be far less busy/new for me to venture in there again."

Arrived early for lunch and was seated promptly and without issue. 

The service was good but we were the first table in so that should be expected. 

The food was quick and cooked perfectly, the salmon came out a perfect medium/m rare, steak was the same and the burger was also very good according to my coworker. 

Check for three people with no alcohol was just under 60, easy to expense without issue, hence the business reference. 

I would recommend to anyone in the cherry creek area looking to make a good impression on a budget. 

Solid four stars for what I was using it for,  but have not eaten during the busier dinner hours yet or used the bar."

However, the GM did reach out to us and invited us to come back and give them another try.

We had actually already planned to go back and try the brunch menu and I&#39;m very glad we did.

Our server (Molly) was absolutely amazing. She was hilarious, attentive, and really seemed like she enjoyed being at work. This was a complete 180 from what we had experienced earlier in the week. If/when we do go back, we&#39;ll definitely ONLY sit in her section.

The brunch itself was amazing. We had two orders of chicken and waffles, a burrito, and the red velvet pancakes. (I highly recommend the chicken and waffles. The syrup has a chipotle seasoning in it and it is probably the best hang over food in Denver)

Good job Del Frisco&#39;s. You&#39;ve definitely redeemed yourself."

I have read and heard mixed reviews, but was still excited to give it a try! The decor and design is amazing- it&#39;s modern, but also welcoming and extremely well put together with the colors and overall layout. The lighting is great, and the tables and booths look very nice. 

Now on to the not so good stuff- it took the staff almost 10 minutes to get a table ready for us when there were literally 2 guests in the restaurant and about 10 staff? Once we were seated the service was quite slow- 15 minutes to get a Bloody Mary and another 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee- again, it wasn&#39;t busy. The food, once it arrived was delicious, which is why I give it 3 stars- the Benedicts, French toast and chicken and waffles were fabulous. We will be back and I hope I can up my review the next time- I really want to like this place, but you&#39;ve gotta work on service-"

Solid spot for sure. 
Let&#39;s be honest, they have clearly done their research of the other restaurants around and cherry picked some of the top sellers from each of them. 
With that said, they have done well. Most items compare that we have tried. Some items are even better.
With time this place will be a heavy weight in the Cherry Creek food scene.
The decor is very Colorado rustic. Lots of woods, leather, and a touch of metal through out. 
This will definitely be a be seen spot for the next few months but still worth it in my opinion. 
I look forward to seeing the evolution."

We were seated in a cozy room next to the kitchen, which I personally enjoyed watching all of the antics in the back of house. 

Our server was a little lack luster from the beginning, disappearing for periods of time and then not understanding orders of drinks later. Meh, minus 1 star. 

I started off with the corn bisque, yum! Very rich, but I could have eaten a whole pot of that. For my entree I decided on the pork chop which was HUGE. Delicious and tasty, no complaints there. 

Overall experience was just ok, I feel like our server just really didn&#39;t care to be there or was attentive enough considering that half of the restaurant was empty. I&#39;d probably be back fro happy hour to check the bar and menu out."

My rating is based on the food, for the price I was not overly impressed.

This place just opened a week ago in Cherry Creek North... We had lunch for five and were sat in an awesome booth.... Server recommended their signature &#34;VIP&#34; cocktail and it was a perfect starter.... Light and not too much vodka.

Lunch menu was plenty, and I enjoyed a fresh take on a kale and Brussels sprout salad with chicken... Fresh and delicious!

Had go to the bar to refill my own water.

Had to wait 10-15 minutes for anything we asked for-catsup, fresh glass, etc.

Was told there was not a kids menu but there were kid-friendly options...but not told what those options were before the waitress walked away.

Waited for 45 minutes on my entrée-which was never put into the system.

Did not clear dirty dishes.

While the manager tried to compensate for the horrible service and after reading other reviews, I am not sure it&#39;s worth the pain of returning to see if they can do better."

I have never left a restaurant so angry before in my life. I did not give them a chance to screw up my meal.  This was supposed to be my Valentine day dinner and Del Frisco&#39;s Grille ruined my night.

I had a reservation for 11AM and was seated immediately - they were not very busy so I am assuming a lot of the seating issues other patrons have had were during dinner.
Our server came over shortly after we were seated and we got mimosas and the Cheesesteak Eggrolls to start. Mimosas were your typical OJ and champagne but the egg rolls?!?! YUM!!! Highly recommend!
For entrees, I had the Shredded Pork Burrito and my friend had The Grille Benedict. To be honest, neither of us was wowed. My burrito really didn&#39;t have much flavor at all - the hash browns were not seasoned and the pork was very plain. I cannot speak for my friend but she didn&#39;t really have much of her Benedict - she did take the leftovers with her, however, so perhaps she just ate it later? The one thing that DID make a wonderful addition was the Red Velvet Belgian Waffle - it was amazing! We split this as it would definitely be a bit too decadent as a meal (for me at least) but I certainly recommend you getting it if you stop in!
Overall, great service and a beautiful restaurant. While I don&#39;t plan on returning for brunch, I will more than likely check out dinner at some point."

The food ranged from good to excellent. However, the service was not up the par for this type of restaurant. They were sweet/nice but not very good. At one point we had to get up and ask for silverware. Point being, they have a lot of work to do in the staffing department. I will give the bartender huge props - he knows how to serve a glass of wine!

Coconut cream pie - in one word....fabulous!

My only complaint is that it was incredibly cold outside while I was waiting for my car. I fell into a frozen lake once and get incredibly chilly ever since.

Parking isn&#39;t horrible in cherry creek but it&#39;s sometimes a hassle.  They have underground parking right below the restaurant but unfortunately they do not validate.  Our server was great and I applaud her for not dressing inappropriate.  However the other servers where dressed as if they were heading to the strip club after their shift.  Fish net and you could see their booty shorts.  Their skirts were entirely too short for this concept of restaurant.  Now if I was going to pts or hooters this would be acceptable.  Also I don&#39;t want to see your ass when I&#39;m eating unless I&#39;m eating your ass.  So for the food it was great.  I wouldn&#39;t say cravable or amazing but everything was cooked perfectly and presented perfectly.  I love going to a restaurant and not have to add salt to my dish.  I would come back to try the desserts as seeing them made me want them but I was to full at this point with my food and lack of cloths for the women.

The bar service was very slow--both standing in the bar and waiting for drinks while dining. They ran out of Grey Goose, which for this caliber of restaurant, is not acceptable. They clearly have a lot of kinks to work out, as they have not been open very long. Again, the food was fine, but for the price point the service needs to be much better.

I think our server was quite embarrassed as well, who could not have been more sweet and helpful despite the restaurant blatant disrespect towards us.

Food was fine, nothing particularly memorable, and outrageously overpriced...but, I&#39;ve been to several Del Friscos, and I know what to expect. It&#39;s got a good atmosphere, varied menu, and is a little more interesting than the standard steakhouse.

My main problem was the service. It&#39;s nice to have attentive service, but I dont need to be asked 6 times by 4 different people &#34;is everything is ok?&#34; or &#34;how is everything tasting?&#34;...I&#39;m not a child. If it&#39;s not good enough, I&#39;ll tell you. I know this is a strange thing to complain about, but it was really distracting. Our server was great. I expect her to stop by just to make sure everything is OK (maybe not during every single course, but I get it)..however this was then followed by two people who I assume are from management, one of the porter/runners who bring out the food...it was bizarre. I&#39;m not saying I want to be served in silence, but I want to be able to at least have a conversation without constantly being interrupted. Good service should be attentive, but discreet. Maybe because the place is so new, but if the staff toned down the enthusiasm just a little, it would have been a much better experience."

I was greeted by two girls dressed very poor. Cotton tank tops and over sized leather jackets are not very work appropriate. Possibly for a hike, but not while working at a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant.  We sat down it was not busy at all. We got the mushroom Flatbread and that was very good! We then ordered a 8oz filet mignon and a 16oz ribeye steak. Both steaks were extremely salty! So much salt you could not taste the actual meat at all. Both were tender but the ribeye was very fatty and not in the good way. It was definitely a cheaper cut of meat. We asked for two refills on our drinks (one each) and only got one. The atmosphere was loud for being slow and very bright. Not a good place for private or intimate conversation. Also a group of mothers came in wearing work out clothing and parked their very large strollers all over the place. I have zero problems with children, but for the $115.00 bill plus parking I was incredibly disappointed! Nothing classy or even average about this place.

I, also, went to the soft opening of The Grille. It was perfect! The ambiance was fresh, upbeat, hip, yet also classy. My friends and I started out by arriving and being greeted by a very friendly server Jangus and a manager Scott who helped us find chairs to belly up to the bar. The bartenders were happy to tell us about all of the drinks and let us sample wines so that we knew which one to get. We ended up getting the merlot, The Morning After, and the Pomegranate Margarita. I&#39;ve never loved a drink as much as The Morning After, so refreshing! 

When we were seated, we were greeted by our server, Janelle, who we immediately loved. She was so sweet and attentive. After taking our order, we had two managers come by to greet us Kim and Lorette. We felt so special and it completely made us feel comfortable and cared about. 

The food... New addictions were to be made. The cheesesteak eggrolls, oh my... I may dream about those until my next visit. We also had the sole and short rib stroganoff and oh my god! We thought we were already in heaven until we had the Nutella bread pudding. The chefs deserve halos because, we have never eaten a meal so heavenly. I wish we had taken pictures, because they were so gorgeous, but we were too busy devouring everything. 

We will definitely be back! It was a perfect place for our girls&#39; night, but will also be fabulous for a date night! Looking forward to returning and will definitely be requesting either Jangus or Janelle. You can&#39;t go wrong with such attentiveness and genuine hospitality."

The Grille is serving a double patty burger instead of their meaty juicy burger they sell at the regular del friscos. And boy at those patties thin.   I asked if I could have just a single patty like the del frisco restaurant.  I asked if the patties were small quarter pound patties.  The server said they were not THAT big.  ????  She said she would ask the kitchen to make one big burger and cook medium rare .  I asked if they had gruyere cheese and totally lost her.  I opted for cheddar.  My single patty came as thin as a McDonald&#39;s patty and well done.  I asked the server what happened, but she did not know.  I told her to just bring me the burger as is on their menu.  The french fries are not the same as the regular del friscos either, these were definitely frozen and had a bad oil taste.  Very disappointed with the food here.  This is a steak house, they should not serve burgers like McDonald&#39;s. Or anything frozen.  I expected the standard to be the same as the regular del friscos.  Not so.

Booked a reservation 2 weeks prior to what I thought was Del Friscos steak house... My mistake but I figured that since they are affiliated it would still be tasty. Really cool location and the restaurant is visually appealing. We were disappointed to see that there was no steak on the restaurant week menu. For our starter we got a Caesar salad which was just as good as one from Panera but about a third of the size, and cheesesteak egg rolls which were delicious and the highlight of the meal. Added on a side of truffle Mac and cheese which was also really tasty and creamy. The main course was average. The chicken was dry and included 2 whole asparagus with bland mashed potatoes. The stroganoff, which I ordered was cold and the &#34;short rib&#34; was basically pot roast with salty gelatinous sauce. The dessert that was offered with the menu was a joke. A tablespoon of old, dry bread pudding, a coconut cream pie tart that was the size of a quarter, and a large dry brownie. The kicker was that we ordered a bottle of wine that was on &#34;special&#34; for a cool $35, saw it in the liquor store yesterday for $10. I know that restaurants mark up alcohol like crazy but that is ridiculous. The service was lacking and we were told over and over again how busy they were... Well it&#39;s the last weekend of restaurants week, obviously you need to increase staff. Just another over priced restaurant where you pay for status  rather than quality."

We tried the cheese-steak egg rolls but I was sent over the edge by their ahi tacos. They weren&#39;t in your typical corn shell, but in crispy, crunchy wonton shells, oh my! The baby back ribs were the special that night and my partner got thru half a rack. I tried a piece and the meat practically melted in my mouth.

I got the Red Velvet Belgian Waffles and my husband got the Eggs Benedict. Our entrees came out very fast within 5 mins, and were luke warm and did not taste fresh. We assumed it was opening weekend speed bumps so we went back this past weekend for brunch. I got the pork burrito, my husband got the Eggs Benedict again. Once again, the entrees came out super fast and neither one was warm.

Yes I get that the guy who works there is very nice, but that does not make the waterlogged, flavorless meats and poor quality toppings ok. The meats sit in steel bins all day I suppose over a warmer like a caterer would use. Why would you do it this way if you have a full kitchen at your disposal? He didn&#39;t even crisp up the meats before spreading them into tortillas. So gross.

My boyfriend and I both thought we would get food poisoning so we didn&#39;t finish our food and just left. Luckily we didn&#39;t, but that tells you how poor the food was. We are passionate about tacos and this experience was extremely sad. If you&#39;re thinking about trying Socorros, please just don&#39;t. Go to Tacos y Salsas or other places on federal instead."

My boyfriend and I were craving tacos tonight and wanted to go somewhere in the neighborhood. After pondering Illegal Pete&#39;s but being hesitant due to the high chance of a loud outrageous crowd, we decided to check this place out after driving by it a few times prior. Good choice, because we were the only ones in the establishment at 7pm on a Friday. It is also a very small place.

We ordered 3 tacos each, they were amazing! We each got the barbacoa and carnitas tacos. He also got the asada and I tried the fish. The toppings were so complimentary, creating an amazing flavor.

The person who served us was the owner, we could tell he was observing our reactions to the food. This place is clearly his pride and joy. He also had us try some homemade salsa he created which was spicy and delicious, he didn&#39;t charge us for that, or the sour cream. The bill for the two of us was $15.

I had a conversation with him in Spanish. He said he works there every day of the week and he is the only employee. That being said, do not come here if you are in a hurry, because he meticulously and thoughtfully creates everything fresh when you order it. So it requires some patience when other people are here. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Unless you are cheap impatient jerk. There is a Mcdonald&#39;s up the street for you haters."

I looked all around me and saw pizza, lots of pizza, before realizing there was a tacos sign beckoning me from a side street. While I&#39;m normally a fan of pizza, I&#39;m also a fan of tacos and new-to-me places so Socorro&#39;s won my lunch bid.

I rolled into the small shop (very little room for dining in, mostly just a bar-like counter area) and was immediately in love with the one-man operation. The guy that took my order, rang me up and then stepped behind the food area to put together my burrito. Sure they have tacos and tortas and on most days that&#39;s what I would have ordered, but today I needed something I could eat on the go and so I went with a burrito. I mean, they are wrapped up so nicely for taking with you, right? Plus, they are covered in aluminum foil so if anything falls out of the bottom it doesn&#39;t fall into your lap.

I ordered the al pastor burrito and my favorite part was that the guy put everything in the shell, wrapped it up, and then put it, aluminum foil and all, under a grill press which resulted in both heating everything up and flattening it to make it easier to it.

Is this the most authentic burrito I&#39;ve ever had? Nope. But, it was certainly good to eat and that&#39;s enough to inspire me for a return trip next time I&#39;m in the area."

I&#39;m not much of a taco connoisseur, so maybe my opinion is not really valid in this area - but the fish tacos here are super tasty.  $1.99 for a delicious little morsel after a night of alcohol?

Really - five people at once would be slammed and service was slow even for takeout.  So, I saw a blurb about this spot in Westword and since the owner is from New Mexico (as I am) I had to check it out.  She also has some pizza joint down on South Broadway.

Well, meh.  The owner (Joyce) waited on me and although the first menu items on the chalk board are tortas, when asked what things are her specialties, she said she didn&#39;t care for tortas.  Not much of a recommendation, eh?  There are burritos and tacos, tambien.

I settled on a shredded meat torta since she said the bread was fresh today - makes you wonder how fresh it is on other days.  It was OK at best - certainly nothing compared to Las Tortas, and, at $5.99, no deal.  Chips and salsa at $2.50 were a joke.  Salsas were nothing special and the chips were hard as rocks.  No booze of course - just canned/bottled sodas.

I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;ll last six months but you never know - I certainly won&#39;t be back until the start up kinks are worked out.  Wish her all the best though."

The burritos are large, but not overstuffed and can be ordered plain, smothered (green chile), or deluxe. The St. Anthony with rice beans and cheese is especially good.

We will not be coming back, and we would definitely not recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic taste of Mexico. Take it from the Mexican husband of mine.

It&#39;s an almost ludicrously small place just off of broadway--any more than about four people in the &#34;seating area&#34; and it starts getting crowded. The food, depending on how busy the place is, can take a while to be made, and there is usually only one person working--leaving him/her to both man the register and make the food. This tends to mean that Socorro&#39;s is not the sort of place you want to go when you&#39;re in a hurry. Depending on what&#39;s going on, it can take a while to put your order in, and a while to pay up when you&#39;re done.

That said, the food is delicious, and vegetarian friendly (as most mexican places are). I have not directly asked about the status of the refried beans, so if you&#39;re worried about that sort of thing, you might want to ask. I wouldn&#39;t say any of the dishes stand out as particularly amazing, but chances are anything with their house-made red chili in/on it will be pretty amazing. I could drink that red chili.

Basically, I mark it down a star for not being all that convenient at times, and also for not being particularly outstanding, but if you&#39;re looking for some good &#34;New Mexican&#34; food, Socorro&#39;s is a pretty safe bet if you&#39;re in the area and o.k. with waiting."

There are many regional styles of Mexican cooking, and I don&#39;t know any of the names. La Cueva on E. Colfax is also a stand-out experience, but the genre of taste is a different one.  Located on one of the sidestreets just East of Broadway, Socorro&#39;s is hung with Zias and other colorful tokens of Mexican heritage. Two stools face the kitchen area while another two face the street. The location gets hot in the summer, but I figured a cool drink of Orchata will cool me down before the show. 

Stepping out of Socorro&#39;s with a paper to go cup in my hand, I was almost run down by a man in a motorized wheelchair speeding down the sidewalk, who roundly cursed me as I apologized in his wake. Though not a smoker, I had bummed one in an effort to quell my pre-show jitters, As soon as I lit it, Socorro&#39;s doleful magician of a proprietor emerged from behind his cookstove and closed the door, establishing himself as a man of genial habits.

Don&#39;t be put off by the cost of a taco - sure, it&#39;s not the $1 special that you may find at other places, but you get at least twice the amount of food in each one, so it works out fine.

They have such a variety to choose from and I haven&#39;t tried them all. But I want to! My favorite was the Sister Bernadette--eggs and chorizo. They also put refried beans on this one and the eggs are very understated so it doesn&#39;t take super breakfast-y. I spent six months in Mexico and this one was pretty authentic, as was the al carbon taco (I can&#39;t remember what they called it). The only downside is it&#39;s a small place, not very comfy to eat-in, and it&#39;s kind of icky-looking...but the tacos were totally worth it."

They were on my college campus one day and I was blown away by all the flavor! I chose their signature bowl with pork and Carolina sauce. It came in a delicious corn bread waffle bowl with Mac n cheese covered in pork and the Carolina sauce. All the flavors came together to blow me away. And for $12 it was such a huge portion with a little side salad that I couldn&#39;t even eat half of it before I got really full. 

I hope I see them around town because they are one of the best food trucks out there! If you ever have the opportunity to order from them, I HIGHLY recommend you do! You&#39;ll be blown away too!"

I asked for the signature plate - cornmeal waffle bowl with a layer of mac &amp; cheese, BBQ brisket ($1 extra) with coffee sauce, and topped with coleslaw.  The plate came out looking pretty creative and it was HUGE! So for 11 bucks, you get two meals out of it, which doesn&#39;t sound too bad, except you&#39;re just feeding on mostly the mediocre mac &amp; cheese (penne was used in place of elbow macaroni here and the sauce was just bland, like from a mix, or just Velveeta.) The BBQ brisket was cut up into smaller pieces - I would associate it with Char Siu, a Chinese BBQ pork; and it&#39;s not as tender as briskets are supposed to be. Also, I was really looking forward to the coffee sauce but it wasn&#39;t life changing. The coleslaw had too much pepper in it. So the only thing that was different and I enjoyed was the cornmeal waffle bowl, it was quite nontraditional."

They get five stars for taste because that barbecue bowl is the sh!t. A cornbread waffle bowl filled high with delicious mac and cheese, the barbecue meat of your choice (brisket is a dollar more but oh so worth it), coleslaw, and whatever sauce your heart desires. We love the Carolina mustard sauce as well as the coffee bbq sauce. We also had the nachos last night, which were (no surprise) also amazing. Fresh-made tortilla chips piled high with pulled pork, corn and black bean salsa, barbecue sauce, and - my favorite part - hatch green chile crema. On the sweet side, we&#39;ve tried the blackberry whiskey sorbet and vanilla peppercorn ice cream - both delicious!

These guys also get five stars for value. While I love the food truck culture, especially when it pairs up with phenomenal breweries, I generally feel like I&#39;m not getting my money&#39;s worth. A brat for $9? I might as well eat at home. But an enormous barbecue bowl that leaves both me and E stuffed for $10? Well, I won&#39;t necessarily enjoy sharing it but it seems like an excellent deal to me. On top of that, the guys working the truck and extremely nice and professional, and food comes out quick - another plus when you&#39;re at a brewery!

Churn and Burn is great about updating their Facebook page with a calendar of where they will be, so be sure to give them a follow. They seem to be at Grist Brewing down off Santa Fe and C-470 every Friday, which is where we always enjoy their barbecue with some good beer. The shining star, though, is definitely the barbecue."

I walked up and wasn&#39;t sure what I wanted and the my suggested the brisket bowl with their Coffee BBQ sauce. It was fantastic. For ten dollars I definitely got my money&#39;s worth. You get a huge bowl make out of cornbread style waffle bowl, inside is a ton to tasty Mac and cheese, and on top they load it up with brisket and add the sauce. This was enough that my girlfriend and I split one. It would be hard to finish one yourself without feeling like a beached whale, but you want to because it&#39;s that good. 

Since the meal was so tasty I went back for dessert and got the Blackberry Bourbon sorbet which was also delicious. The sweetness paired really well with the bourbon. 

They told me they&#39;re at Grist most Friday&#39;s but don&#39;t do too many breweries other than that. Well I like Grist&#39;s beer too so I guess I&#39;m headed back again on a Friday."

I ordered a seaweed salad, the creamy vegetable Ramen and Edamame.  I&#39;m glad I ordered the other two side dishes because the Ramen definitely left more to be desired.  They are very skimpy with the veggies, I even order extra spinach.  If you&#39;re vegetarian I would skip this place because they don&#39;t have many options.

Food wise- We had the spice miso- very tasty! I had the special K roll which was what I expected. Hubs went with nigiri. It&#39;s sushi and we were still super hungry after we left- but we knew what we were getting into...

The reason for the 3 stars is that while tasty, it wasn&#39;t incredibly memorable. I did get a little sick afterwards but that could be from a number of things- I hate blaming restaurants for my digestive problems! I&#39;d probably be back just because of proximity."

Th chirashi don is awful. The sushi rice is the wrong texture and consistency! ALL of the fish tasted of the wrong texture, like they had all been thawed out in the microwave?? UGH!

So I was traveling through Denver on business and learned of all of the ramen joints in town. I lived in Japan for years and one of the things I missed was the ramen. I was really exited to get some ramen, and decided to try Sakana.  I was NOT disappointed.

Atmosphere: it&#39;s small/quaint but really nice inside. Really reminded me of the small mom-and-pop places I went in Japan. They were even playing soft jazz with female singers!
Service: fast and friendly.  The food came out quickly too.

I got an order each of maguro (tuna) and hamachi (yellowtail) nigiri. Not only were the pieces of fish very generous, but they were about as close to a religious experience I have had with sushi since returning to the US. Fresh, soft, smooth, and just fantastic. 

I also got the shoyu ramen with nitamago, corn, and butter- this is how I always ordered it before. And it was just perfect.

The space is really cozy and cute, my hesitation drained away quickly. My hiking buddy and I were in the mood for ramen so we tried the Shio and the Tonkatsu. Both were tasty and fulfilling for a decent price. Definitely add that egg to your order, it&#39;s totally worth it.

I love the way the chef sliced my Saba. It&#39;s not too big and not too small. I don&#39;t like them too big that&#39;s it&#39;s not fun and attractive to eat anymore. It&#39;s almost gross to me if you give  me a huge piece. If it&#39;s too small then I feel cheated! 

Here the Saba is so fresh and cut just right and he made it look so pretty that it&#39;s a inviting to eat. Art and purpose together! 

We sat at the bar and requested more of the Chef&#39;s fresh offerings and also for him to surprise us. He did and we were happy! He made us a medley of diffirent cuts of his fresh offerings. Everything was great and presented beautifully. 

Fresh sashimi mostly for me. Or nigiri if needed be when I order in any sushi joint. I&#39;m a big fan of Sakana on my first foray. I can&#39;t wait to go back!

We only come in for ramen and rice bowls and have yet to try the sushi rolls but it&#39;s a matter of time as it always looks good and their sashimi bowls are tasty.

If you look at the overall ramen scene in the Denver Metro area, we are not as lucky as other cities but we do have some consistent places, like Sakana.  I prefer that the egg be included in my bowl as in most other places but considering the overall price comparison with some of the other options in town, adding it still makes it an affordable bowl here.  Their Chashu is always tender and their Spicy Miso is the best in town.  I always get mine with the egg and extra spice on the side.  Curry Ramen is a bit sweet but the Kara Age is great with it.  Love the Kara Age and Geso Age here, but hands down the best curry beef I&#39;ve had!  Try it for yourself!

They have a small shop so expect wait times if you get there late.  They are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so be aware.  Service is always friendly and consistent as well. We go here because it&#39;s close to home but we go back because the food is good and consistent!"

If you order food for pick up though it&#39;s really fast and easy. Also I have only tried sushi rolls but I&#39;m interested in trying other options on their menu.

You would not expect a place like this to be among the strip of businesses that it was by. Very adorable and tiny place, it&#39;s cozy. If there is a wait you will probably have to stand outside, which we did. We waited about 15 minutes on a Saturday night. 

We got three sushi rolls. Their sushi rolls range from $5-$11. We also got ramen. I got the shoyu ramen ($9) with a ($1.50) add on for the egg. The ramen and sushi were delicious, this place is definitely worth coming back to."

It&#39;s a very cute, small Japanese restaurant that serves a simple menu of ramen, Japanese appetizers, and sushi. It&#39;s in a small strip mall and from the outside its a bit sketchy looking but once your inside, it&#39;s a pretty neat place. It is quite small and from the first time it opened to now, I&#39;ve seen how much it has grown and how many customers it has coming in on a daily basis. My favorite thing on the menu is the spicy miso ramen with egg, I also enjoy their karaage. Their ramen broth has the perfect amount of depth and the karaage is fried to perfection. If you love Japanese food, give this place a try. It&#39;s an awesome joint!"

First we order the squid legs and they were so good my mouth is watering ....
Then I decide on the veggie ramen (only veggie option) and my babe orders a few sushi rolls...
My ramen comes first and it was too die!!! I can say one of the best noodle dishes I&#39;ve had in a super long time !!!!
No complaints with the soup ;)
The sushi was so so ... Not the strongest suit but still tasty ...
The ambiance was chill and everyone seemed happy to be there...
The wait staff was so lovely and welcoming ...
A hidden gem in Arvada/Westminster area ...I hope they come up with more veggie soups soon...until then I&#39;ll order that ramen again and again...
Thank you so much ...
We had a great experience and will defiantly be back

Spicy miso is my favorite, but I&#39;ve tried everything and it&#39;s all flavorful and satisfying.  They also have top notch sushi and a few other dishes like beef curry and katsu don that really hit the spot!

Time was about 12:05hrs ish.  We are among the few ones who arrived early to have Lunch at Sakana.  We are seated promptly.  Take note, this establishment is TINY and during Lunch hour, this establishment can be filled to the brim.

The lovely Staff greeted us, and bring the Menu to our table.  She also bring out Tea and water as part of our beverages.  During our Lunch, our lovely staff makes sure, our drinks are filled up periodically.

From what I could recall, I ordered the following items :

*  Geso-Age ($6.00)
*  Green Mussels ($4.50)
*  Amaebi ($5.95)
*  Kani ($5.95)
*  Kaibashira ($5.25)
*  Tamago ($5.00)
*  Unagi ($5.50)
*  Wasabi Tobiko ($4.75)

The service from Sakana, is 4 stars.

The Sushi/Nigiri that I ordered is like 3 to 3.5 stars.

I like my order of Geso-Age aka which are  Fried Octopus Tentacles.  Its fried properly and just nice with some pepper and salt.  Unfortunately, its ONLY the Octopus Tentacles that they offer.  I don&#39;t mind paying more if I can get the whole Octopus.  *SIGH*

For the Green Mussels, they ONLY offer 3 pieces in which was OK.

If I am NOT mistaken, my friend ordered one of the Salad.  She said her LUNCH at Sakana was just OK.  NOT Wowing her at all.  In terms of the Sushi Roll, she ordered it was OK too.  So in general, she rated Sakana as 3 stars.

Pricing are reasonable.  All in all, its a Decent Sushi establishment which offer RAMEN too.  Maybe, I would return to order the RAMEN though unlikely unless the weather outside its BITTERLY COLD and a snowstorm is around.  I don&#39;t mind returning when needed or when in the neighborhood.  Perhaps from there my review might differ.  

Above anything else, I wish SAKANA well in their business undertaking and may they prosper in many years to come, especially in this Neighborhood.  Left Sakana at about 13:35hrs ish.

SAKANA is open on Wednesday thru Monday from 12 noon to 9pm.  SAKANA is CLOSED on TUESDAYs..

The venue is small, only seating about a maximum of 20 people. We ordered the katsu bowl, miso spicy ramen, and shio ramen. The ramen broth was delicious; the shio was not too salty and the spicy miso had  a light kick to it. The katsu bowl was subtle, light with a sweet sauce and mixed with an egg on a bowl of rice. By far some of the best katsu I&#39;ve ever had, overall a great experience, spot on service, and a meal I&#39;d eat over and over again. Thank you and hope to return over the next couple days -

This place is in an unassuming strip mall, but once you walk in you feel like you are in a nice downtown Denver joint.  It is tiny, but boasts sushi counter seating and about eight tabletops that can be transitioned for more if needed.  Japanese was spoken here between the sushi chef and a patron, which added to the ambience.  We didn&#39;t try the sushi, but we ordered two bowls of ramen and and a fried octopus appetizer.  They were delicious!  Very tender pork slices in the ramen along with pickled bamboo shoot slices.  So flavorful and so filling.  The appetizer was crispy fried balls filled with octopus and laced with eel sauce and maybe mayo?!  Delish!

I grew up close to Japan and have a lot of Japanese influence in my life. I don&#39;t claim to be an expert of everything Japanese, but I do know what good Japanese food tastes like. Sakana is a gem. It&#39;s easy to find excellent Japanese food in Hawaii or maybe even New York (Flushing, Queens). But finding great Japanese food in Colorado is like searching for a needle in a heystack. You may never even find it. Certainly there are no shortages of Japanese-inspired ramen shops run by Chinese immigrants. Some of them are quite decent. Most often than not, they use cheap ingredients, and the concept of umami is as foreign to them, as eating thousand year old eggs to us. 

The menu at Sakana is simple. But I can fully understand the thinking behind creating a simple menu. Instead of offering 100 lousy dishes, serve only 20 simple dishes but do it well. You will not find triple deep fried japalenos dragonfly roll with seared foie gras on top. You will not find any of those fusion sushi rolls that are spreading across the US faster than the speed of light. What you will find is simple Japanese rolls. Buy oh boy, how well do they make them. The fish is always fresh, and the rice vs fish balance is very pleasing. All sauces are made in the house and you can taste it. You will not find a more authentic ramen in Colorado. Shio (salt) ramen is our all time favorite. I am always blown away at how consistently delicious the ramen is. This certainly takes quite a lot of skills to not deviate from the formula. Also, they do not offer tonkatsu ramen. It is a lot more time and resources consuming than other ramen bases. And instead of serving you something lousy, the Sakana chefs decided to skip it. I totally agree with  their decision. 

I never knew that there are so many Japanese expats living in Colorado up until I started visiting Sakana. Every time I visit Sakana, there is either a Japanese family or a group of americans who used to live in Japan. How do I know? As others have mentioned, the place is rather small, and with only 8 tables you can hear what nearby diners are talking about. So that should speak for itself. 

I came across a reviewer complaining about the small space of the restaurant. Boutique like restaurants are very popular in Japan and other parts of Asia. Japan has a third of the US population, yet the country is so tiny. Real estate is super expensive. Yes I know that we don&#39;t really have this problem in Colorado. I believe the family that runs the business wanted to recreat the intimate setting traditionally found in many Japanese sushi bars and ramen shops. Also, quality control. When you have a giant place with lots of cooks, unfortunately, you run into a risk of sacrificing quality."

Closed on Tuesdays, they have one of the best pricing for ramen w/ authenticity and delicious add ons.  I always love their appetizer of the day.  Have tried the agedashi tofu, fried oysters and sea urchin sushi as the specials.  The geso-age and the kara-age are a must!  Lightly battered and fried squid and chicken are so tasty.  

Have tried the miso ramen, the vegetarian ramen, and the curry ramen.  All of them are delicious and filling.  Their chirashi bowl is one of the best deals in the area.  Sushi and sashimi are so fresh and delicious!  Great drink selections and all the food are very tasty!  My first time here has only been about a month but I&#39;ve been back 6 times for the delicious food and can&#39;t wait to come back.  Just don&#39;t come on Tuesdays, they are closed.

I want it all for myself.

Not to say that I have the Yelp clout to effect such a change with a single review, but who knows - maybe this will be the straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back, and I&#39;ll have to battle long wait times just to find a seat.

So what&#39;s good at Sakana? Well...everything. They specialize in Japanese food and they do it right.

The sushi is fresh, typically priced (ie. $20 for a good meal), and tasty. You can nail the best fish by tracking what&#39;s up on their seasonal sushi chalkboard in the back, or just by asking the chef. If you&#39;re not sure what to get, try the chirashi bowl. You may need an appetizer to supplement it if you&#39;re a big eater (guilty), but it&#39;s always a generous arrangement of many fish that hits on all the best offerings.

Better still is the ramen, which vies for Denver&#39;s Best. There&#39;s an interesting variety that includes staples like shio, shoyu, and spicy miso, but also tosses in curry ramen for the more adventurous. Afficianados will note the lack of tonkotsu, but true ramen diehards will note that this isn&#39;t really a bad thing since true tonkotsu has a VERY involved creation process. It&#39;s hard to do right if you have the depth of options Sakana sports, so better to not do it at all than to do it half-assed.

The service is generally brisk and the atmosphere is low-key.

There. I&#39;ve shared with you all one of my most closely guarded glittering gems, so eat and be merry~"

We didn&#39;t mind and the music playing was enough to make our conversations private enough. 

We had the goyza appetizer to start. It was very good. We followed with 4 different sushi rolls- spicy tuna, spider, Sakana, and Philly roll. I loved them all but the Philly. My husband loved the Philly though- so maybe it was just me.

This place is pretty adorable. I&#39;ll try not to repeat the other reviews too much, but I will reiterate that this place is tiny, so be prepared to eat at the bar (which my fiancé and I did, and it was really great regardless). Further explanation:

PROS:
- Atmosphere: the restaurant itself is quaint and adorable - somehow a cross between the Japanese video game Okami and (bizarrely) a Parisian cafe. The intermittent bistro-risqué music really solidifies the latter feel. It is well-combined, though, and while cramped, the place is still very comfortable. 
- Waitstaff: clearly very knowledgable. Interestingly, not the entire staff is ethnic, which somehow cements the multicultural bistro vibe and yet does not feel forced. When I spilled my Ramune, the main waitress hurried to help me clean it up and then joked that I was lucky that it hadn&#39;t spilled on my new iPhone. The sushi chef is incredibly kick-ass. He&#39;s this burly guy that might have been a street-fighter in another life but now makes really good sushi. Very intriguing to watch.
- Sushi: definitely above average. Not fishy and not too cold (a trend which indicates that the delicacy has been frozen), and even the octopus was well-prepared. Beautifully presented and relatively unique without being off-putting. Very good flavor - doesn&#39;t need to be covered-up by soy sauce. 
- Broth: I had the Shoyu (soy) ramen, and the broth base was AMAZING. Super flavorful and, well, brothy, without being too salty (a common issue for ramen). Definitely worth getting. 

CONS:
- Pork belly: I am not Japanese, but fresh ramen is definitely one of my favorite comfort foods nonetheless. I was really looking forward to awesome chashu and was sadly let down. The meat was not super flavorful, and was a little fatty around the edges for my liking (although I know that this is something that is influenced by personal preference). Overall, just a little underwhelming considering I had been craving it. I don&#39;t know if that is a common occurrence here though, since this is my first time here - so take this with a grain of salt. Maybe the pork is usually awesome. 
- Noodles: again, this might have been a one-time thing, but the noodles were kinda gummy. A big reason I think this might have been a one-time thing is that my ramen came out with the surface of the toppings cold - almost as if the waitstaff had been trying to lessen the time spent between bringing my ramen and my fiancé&#39;s sushi (which nevertheless came out a little late, since it was a fairly involved plate). However, the broth was still warm, so the noodles might have continued to cook even as it waited for me. They were still edible though, so I don&#39;t have any severe complaints. 

Overall, a worthwhile place to go. Make sure to listen for the Parisian music. ;)"

It is a hole in the wall place with a six seat sushi bar and eight 2 tops that can be arranged to fit needs, but it is a small place and you shouldn&#39;t try to be a group larger than 6 and hope to be seated.

They do have take-out, which is more than helpful."

It&#39;s super cozy and cutely decorated, and the staff was so friendly and courteous. I ordered the Shio ramen and for some reason that I can&#39;t remember, some of the miso soup, and had never had better ramen or miso for that matter.

This place is incredible and is easily the best bowl of ramen in Colorado. The broth is perfectly flavorful and is very consistent (my favorite is the spicy miso). The noodles are perfectly done every time and the pork is always tender. Everything is so reasonably priced ($8-9 per bowl of ramen $1.5 for an egg add on). The sushi rolls are priced very comparably to other sushi places but the quality is superb (the Special K and Sakana roll are great). Service is good the waitresses are attentive but not too pushy.

To sum up I&#39;ve been going here since December and find myself here about three times a month. I think that tells you a lot about food and service. With all these ramen joints popping up around Colorado it&#39;s easy to miss this little restaurant in Westminster, but trust me you don&#39;t want to miss out!

I have to say one of the best service I&#39;ve seen in a restaurant in awhile. All the waitresses and sushi chefs were super friendly. 

Nice little place with cute little decor all over the restaurant. 

We ordered:

-Shoyu Ramen ($8.00) and added an egg ($1.50)
Good amount of noodles, good for the price. Just wish that it was soft-boiled eggs, instead of hard boiled. 
Not sure if that is an option. 

-Spicy Miso Ramen ($9.00)
Also good amount of noodles, good for the price. Wasn&#39;t really spicy but they have chili powder and white pepper to add in if you choose. 

-Negihama Sushi Roll ($5.00 for 6 pieces)
Simple, light. 

-Special K Roll ($13.00 for 8 pieces)
Was good, just wished the jalapeños were actually spicy, would have given it the perfect kick.

Definitely a place to try if you enjoy ramen and sushi. Less pricier than Uncles and a better vibe. They also have a larger food selection other than just ramen. 

Will definitely be back to try out other things on their menu!!!"

The fish here is generously cut and I had a wonderful experience. 

I tried the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll and Chirashi Bowl. Both were delicious. The roll was as would be expected with a spicy tuna roll and the Panko added the nice crunch. I was very pleased with my Chirashi Bowl. There was a good variety of fish and each piece of sashimi was cut thickly, which I loved. The sushi rice at the bottom of the dish was also nicely seasoned and complimented the raw fish well. 

I can see myself coming back here regularly."

Wife is native Japanese and works at a ramen shop across town. We both love Sakana. The ramen is consistently excellent and would get a 7 out if 10 anywhere in Japan. In the USA it&#39;s easily a 9 out of 10. The nitamago is darn near perfect.

Non-ramen: The chirashizushi is fantastic, with large slices of very fresh fish. The gesoage and karaage are both very nice and exactly like one would expect at any izakaya in Japan.  I found the gyoza passable, but lackluster. The wife likes the saba shioyaki, but that could be as much about &#34;taste of home&#34; as it is about flavor.

First and foremost, the staff was so nice and accommodating, and the restaurant itself is super adorable. 

We always get excited about trying new Japanese restaurants and we LOVE Japanese feed and it&#39;s hard to find anything even close to the quality in Japan. That being said, the sushi here was by far the best we&#39;ve had in Denver. The chef really knew what he was doing. The ramen was also great, although I would suggest requesting they make it spicy.

Sushi was very good.  Perfectly cooked rice, large seafood portions, and great presentation.  Although I was dying to try a ramen bowl, I decided to opt for sushi and chicken teriyaki.  However, next time I will give a ramen bowl a whirl since everyone who ordered one consumed it quite fast and slurped the juice at the end.  That tells you it has to be good.

We tried the shoyu ramen and the beef curry and both were excellent. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the service was attentive without being intrusive but it is very small inside, so you may be in for a wait.

If you&#39;re in the area, I highly recommend Sakana. Good ramen is hard to find outside of downtown, so this is a nice local spot off the beaten path."

It will not be the best ramen you&#39;ve ever had, but for Colorado this place will do. (How I wish there&#39;s a Mitsuwa with Santouka Ramen nearby!)

I tried their spicy miso ramen and even though the miso flavor is very subtle, it was a pretty satisfying bowl with tender pieces of pork (though I kinda wish the pork was sliced slightly thicker) and good noodles. Don&#39;t forget to order corn and a boiled egg to go with your ramen. 

In addition to the ramen, I was very impressed by their gyoza (soft silky wrapper with flavorful meaty inside) and also by their sushi. Everything tasted fresh and made with care. Their house made soy sauce that wasn&#39;t too salty, lending a perfect seasoning to the sushi, was also really good.

I&#39;d definitely recommend this place to anyone in greater Denver and Boulder area who are craving for good sushi and a bowl of ramen with a side of gyoza."

This place is a small mom-pop sushi ramen restaurant. It seats approx 20. I had their spicy miso ramen and it was pretty good. I intend to return frequently for both lunch and dinner.

With ramen, the noodle texture and broth are the stars. The broth is deep and flavorful. The noodles are springy and slurpilicious. The chashu was smoky. The egg was creamy.

The service was fast and effective. I was in and out under 40 minutes.

*****UPDATE 2/5/15******
I rarely update a review, but this one deserves a special mention. This place started out great and now its awesome. The décor is updated, and after multiple visits, I happily declare their sushi, sashimi and grill items, most delicious. 

The space is kinda small, but very cozy and comfortable. I get here, sit at the bar and feel nicely cocooned. You kinda get in the zone and unwind. The challenge is deciding what to eat. I always get the Hamachi kama, but last nite, the chef said they saved some salmon belly. It was fish butter. Just melt in your mouth. Prolly better than bacon. And I am gonna regret telling y&#39;all this cos the next time I come by, you may have eaten my share. 

Anyhoo.. big fan of this place. So good, I came for dinner.. and then the next day for lunch. 

and yeah.. the chef, is a fully trained French chef too."

I have not had great success with Asian food in Colorado, but this place is one that I would continue to visit! The Philadelphia roll tasted great as well, but they could have done a nice job aesthetically. Some pieces of fish were larger and some were smaller in various parts of the roll.  The ends of the roll had tiny pieces of salmon. It came with cucumber instead of avocado, which I am used to.  Ramen was $8 and roll was $6.

I want to try the Salmon Don when I come back even though it&#39;s a bit pricier (about $15).

Also, the place is tiny, so make a reservation!!  My party of 5 had to wait about 20 minutes even though there were empty seats.  They wanted to make sure those who called ahead would have seats when they came.  Liquor store is in the shopping center if you want to kill time waiting for a seat!"

A friend and I ordered the &#39;green mussels&#39; small plate and it came as a three piece dish; which, is kinda awkward sharing it between two people. BUT, the way it is prepared is sooo delicious I could eat 20 of them, no joke! Most restaurants I&#39;ve been to will slap on a hefty amount of mayo as if they were making a birthday cake, at Sakana, however, it&#39;s a nice balance and the small slice of citrus gives it that extra kick in the mouth (in a good way of course!). 

Then, we moved on to their main dishes. I ordered the &#39;Spicy Miso Ramen&#39; and my friend ordered the &#39;Katsu Don&#39; pork bowl. For me, I tend to gravitate towards menu items that say spicy. The spicy miso ramen won&#39;t make you sweat and make you wish you brought pepto-bismol kinda spicy, it&#39;s just a very good clean balance of flavors. Not too spicy, not too salty, etc. It&#39;s very, Zen. 

I had a taste of my friends pork Katsu Don because I&#39;m a pig, and YES! We have another winner! Mainly because the pork tasted full and fresh. And by full, I mean that the piece is not 90% panko and 10% meat. This is when I realized I was deceived my entire life...

Overall, I would love to visit again to try their sushi and recommend it to people who love a good bowl of ramen. 

In comparison to Katsu Ramen and Tokio. Well, they&#39;re all different and unique. Tokio is modern japanese with nightlife vibe, Katsu has an airy atmosphere with bold flavored ramen selections, and Sakana is that cute little cottage in the middle of the woods with a light and goldilocks type flavor. :P"

Unfortunately, the service is slow, they are usually understaffed &amp; the restaurant is not cleaned that often. Usually around lunch hours it&#39;s better but not great. When dinner rolls around things really go down hill. Haven&#39;t had a bad experience but a 10-15 min wait just to order is a little over the top.

Pros;
Great food &amp; lots of parking 

Cons;
A bit over priced, service &amp; cleanliness

This place is a lot like qudoba but a little better. The atmosphere is pretty cute, the sauces are better than qudoba, which makes all the difference.

I got the Yelp offer and made the mistake of opening it, I should have just handed it to the cashier because somehow she closed out of it and poof it was gone! I would have been livid if we would have been charged just because she exited the app, but she was cool and admitted it was her bad and she trusted us..so yeah, just an annoying encounter but turned out okay.

I don&#39;t like how there is one slice of chicken per taco or that they did not offer to add anything to my taco besides cheese and I had to ask him to please give me some toppings on the side when checking out when I would have preferred them on my taco in the first place.
Also, both times I have been in here there is a gentleman who is always nice and helpful; that however is not who served me on my most recent experience.  I came in here ( 7/11/16 3:30 or so) there was another guy behind the counter and he seemed to be completely wasted. He could hardly remember what he was doing or what I wanted and seemed to be struggling pretty hard in order to get me my two taco entree ( he could hardly use the tongs without dropping them repeatedly). It took a REALLY long time and I just stared in disbelief as he made my food and considered leaving or asking the other man to help him out because I was hungry.

I stopped her and ask to try the proteins once more. I think she thought I meant to add steak as well. By that time a younger girl finished my chicken and steak nachos. I also wanted to order some chicken fajita tacos. I was willing to wait for some more fajitas since they were out. When I got my tacos well, there was only fajitas in my tacos besides the lettuce.

I ordered the nachos, the cheese was nice and melted, added in cilantro and onions, and it was great. I probably should have ordered the chips on the side as the bottom ones got soft by the time I got to the bottom. That would probably be the one downside to ordering this to go.

While the menu is a bit more expansive than Qdoba and Chipotle, I prefer the food at Qdoba and Chipotle. This particular location could also invest in some blinds because the setting sun was brutal the night we went.  My group of 6 had difficulty finding a table where we wouldn&#39;t be blinded by the sun.  We found a table that seemed good at the beginning, but by the time we finished our meal some of use were wearing sunglasses.

It&#39;s not that it was bad - I think I was just expecting &#34;really good&#34; based on the hype I&#39;ve read and heard about it, and I found it to be pretty ordinary across the board. The dining room is bright and pleasant. The service was altogether fine, but not different or better than most other places of its ilk. The food was also fine, but definitely not memorable, and honestly, no &#34;fresher&#34; than Costa Vida&#39;s many competitive &#34;cousins.&#34; We had the special of the day (a green chile burrito) - it was fine, but pretty mundane. Another of our party had the enchiladas - he described them as &#34;good&#34; without much enthusiasm. Burritos were met with a bit more enthusiasm, but definitely no wow factor. We shared some chips and salsa, and two different salsas were both fairly flavorless and totally bland. Prices are generally under $10 and consistent with the competition.

If you haven&#39;t been to Costa Vida, it&#39;s a little like Chipotle or Qdoba with a larger menu. Baja Fresh and Cafe Rio are actually better comparators. Except the food at Baja Fresh and Cafe Rio is better at both. 

Try Costa Vida and decide for yourself. Just don&#39;t go with unusually high expectations and you probably won&#39;t be disappointed. It definitely won&#39;t slake your craving for really good Mexican food, but it&#39;s totally fine for what it is."

The food tastes much fresher than Qdoba or Chipotle and seems to be much more filling. I can eat a Doba burrito and still be a little hungry but these leave me much more satisfied despite being about the same size. Since trying this place I have not gone back to Qdoba and my friend that likes Chipotle went back once and found it very disappointing after a Vida burrito. 

Best of all, here you can still get queso and have your burrito smothered in green chili! The sweet pork is very delicious and the tortillas are made there. The staff has been friendly every time I&#39;ve been there and the sitting area is very clean with a cool water bubble art thing (sorry, don&#39;t know what to call it but it&#39;s cool to look at).

I have now been to Costa Vida three times and been pleased all three. The food and ingredients are freshly prepared: beans are freshly cooked, not out of a can or frozen bag. Salsas are all made fresh, meats are delicious and juicy. Chips are crisp and fresh.

The drink station includes iced teas and HORCHATA! Wonderful for those of us who don&#39;t drink soda pop. The place is always nice and clean, but the jumble of highchairs in the corner needs re-thinking.

One issue: two times I&#39;ve been in, the air conditioner has been on in the dining room and all the customers are wearing coats. What is the hint that management isn&#39;t getting?

It&#39;s a real bummer the adjacent construction obscures this place.

I went back in April, so I hope that things have improved. I used to be a regular at Costa Vida when I lived in Utah and it beat out any other chain of its kind--Chipotle, Qdoba, Cafe Rio, etc. This location just didn&#39;t have the same type of service I&#39;m used to and I&#39;m sad to say that the food wasn&#39;t that great either. I felt like the portions were smaller than usual and whoever was helping me ended up helping whoever was behind me first, even though I had ordered. He started making my salad, then stopped and helped the person behind me and finished their meal before mine. Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively and literally). I brought two of my friends with me so I could show off Costa Vida to them, and they weren&#39;t very impressed.

Why wait an hour or more for a table when you can enjoy the lovely atmosphere indoors or out at Acero with no wait?!?!

Tara makes fantastic margaritas and delivers fast and friendly service. Their happy hour menu is amazing!!! If you like spicy, you MUST try the jalapeño poppers (wrapped in bacon and covered in pineapple-chorizo salsa). The street tacos (carnitas, Barbacoa, asada I can vouch for, but there is also lengua, chicken, and veggie calabacitas to try still!) are also delicious and just $3!

I saw that Acero had just opened a few weeks ago which made me nervous that it was going to be really busy, but we thought we would try our luck anyway.
To our surprise the place was totally empty on a Friday night. We stood outside the gate wondering if the restaurant was just closed and we looked up the wrong hours. Sure enough, they were open so we went in. Right as you walk in there is a bar to the left that one couple was sitting at. The set-up is really weird and it still looks like it&#39;s under construction. After waiting a few minutes, someone greeted us and sat us outside per our choice. The patio is nice and you can people watch on south Broadway. I like the concept where you get to choose on a piece of paper what you want in your burrito, burrito bowl, or salad. They have a lot of options for veggies, meats, and extras like cheese and sour cream. We decided to start with chips and queso and I ended up getting a burrito southwest style with veggie green chile on top. Nate got a burrto bowl with carne asada and a bunch of other stuff. We got the chips and queso first and the queso was really good, but the chips were out of a bag and tasted stale. We also ordered margaritas. I went with the Strawberry Basil and N went with the House. They are a little on the pricey side for what they are. They come in a mason jar type glass and mine was $13.I feel like it would have been stronger paying that much but oh well. 
The main dishes came out and they were tasty! All of the dishes come in around $14 whether you get meat or not. I paid the same amount for veggies, beans, and rice in a burrito than Nate did and he got piles of carne asada. Maybe give guests a little bit of break on price if they don&#39;t get heaps of protein on it? 
The service was great, she was really helpful in helping us understand how everything worked since it&#39;s not a standard set up. She was also quick in making sure we had drinks and menus and all that. 
Acero was just ok in my opinion. The food and service were good, but the drinks, ambiance, and the price for what you get was just meh."

Queso was cold and thick, salsa was bland and the chips tasted like bad fry oil.  I asked for a fresh batch of chips but the second time around wasn&#39;t any better.  Nothing traditional about the Margaritas, when I choose Mexican food I want a solid fresh made Margarita not sweet and sour mix which is what I got.  Fajitas were ok, tortillas basically store bought and the beans and rice were sub par.  It took 45 minutes to get our food despite the fact that hardly anyone was there.  I don&#39;t recommend and won&#39;t be going back."

Kinda messes up the tequila IMO.  I tried the Mango Sage and the Watermelon Rose.  Not a fan of either. Thank goodness it was 2-4-1 as these drinks (mason jar size) are $10 buckaroos.

Yes, the ingredients were fresh....but overall the food was very bland and portions were SMALL. For $15 at dinner (not including $4 for stale chips and bland salsa) you get a skillet dish that has about 1 cup of ingredients only. 

Then you get sides that come in plastic ramekins. Some were good but they were so small! 

The chicken in the burrito was tequila marinated - or rather DRENCHED. It was disgusting and the person eating it was a recovered alcoholic. POOR advertising.   Burrito was big, dry inside, and again, bland..."

Awesome patios sitting in front and back of the restaurant.   The veggies that come in the entres are awesome.   Very well done.   The proteins are good too.   Great concept on marking how you want your meal.  Everything we got was delicious including the tres Leche cake.   Service was good,  but it was at a slow time.  They still working out kinks so be patient with them.   

The burrito I had was a good portion and full of fantastic FRESH flavors.   They even use  a lot of true Mexican cheeses which is awesome! 

I recommend this place for sure.   But once again be patient with the service.   You can&#39;t rush quality or else you get a janky food."

The place wasn&#39;t as busy since its only been open for two weeks. You basically get to choose what you want as your topping using a checklist to make your fajitas, burrito, quesadilla or fajitas. It took awhile for the food to come (quite slow). Also, they ended up forgetting to get us our chips and salsa &amp; chips and queso. We felt like they messed up our order, which they should have gotten right since they took so long. Friends were missing sides we chose with our food. Quite disappointing. 

Overall, the food was good not amazing. I would try it again but as a sit down dinner. They still have kinks to work out (speed of the food and take-out). Especially since it slightly pricier than other tex-mex places I&#39;ve been before. I expected to wow&#39;d. 

Note, if you are not in a rush to go anywhere, try the drinks. Still a bit pricey but very good. Try the Lavender Sour!"

So I don&#39;t usually mark down for slow or indifferent service but this time I had to because it was SO slow. 
It was a Sunday night and maybe they were understaffed . There were 8 tables of 2 to 4 people and two servers.

We waited long to get our menu , we waited long to get our drinks , and we waited long to get our food . We even thought of leaving. It was an hour and 15 minutes from the time we sat down until the food was delivered.

We didn&#39;t like the feel of the place as much as before when it was the Black Crown. It&#39;s very bare bones now. 

The food though was amazing ! We had a burrito and a quesadilla and house margaritas ($8). Specialty margaritas were $10 to $12 or $13.

The menu was very limited and the burritos , quesadillas, fajitas all cost $14.95 which seemed pretty steep."

To top it off the specialty margaritas are amazing - not too sweet and perfectly potent. I tried the watermelon rose and mango sage which were both flavor combinations I&#39;ve never before enjoyed.

They changed the menu -- no more make-your-own burritos and fajitas. :(  Instead, they have an extremely minimalist menu with just 5 items -- 3 kinds of fajitas and 2 kinds of tacos.  The server explained that make-your-own was taking too long for the kitchen and they were getting bad reviews.  We were disappointed, hoped for the best, and ordered.  First problem - the main dishes came out before the basic appetizer (chips and salsa).  We also didn&#39;t get our drinks until after the late appetizer.  Two of us then got the wrong order and had to wait 10 minutes for the right meals.  Apparently Acero should go back to the old slow menu and abbreviate the bar menu so that stuff at least comes out in the right order!  (I&#39;ll note that the server comped our drinks because of the many snafus, which was very nice.)  So, about the food ... the guys had the carne asada fajitas which they loved.  The vegetarians had the veggie fajitas which, oddly, had few veggies.  The crispy tofu in there was awesome, but the rest was just peppers, mushrooms and onions.  No squash, no zucchini, no sweet potato, no *real* veggies.  It all tasted fine, but i don&#39;t see a reason to rush back.  Sigh ..."

Since we are in the Neighborhood, and we want something simple and quick, we went to Panaderia Y Taqueria.  This establishment is a 3 in 1 store.  On the right wing, is the &#34;restaurant&#34; dining area, center was the &#34;Mini Grocer&#34; and the extreme left you can find Mexican Bakery goods etc etc.

That recent visit was on Sunday September 22nd 2013.  Time was about 17:00hrs ish.

We ordered at the Counter, where you also paid all your transaction.  Hubs as usual opt to have the Beef Asada Smothered Burrito, with 3 Beef Asada Tacos, while I opt to have Taco Lengua and Taco Tripa for Dinner.  We seat ourselves at the &#34;right&#34; wing of this establishment.  While waiting, I was curious about the Decor and ALL THE Pinata that were hang up on the ceiling at the Mini Grocer Part of this establishment.  Those Pinata are as huge as some kid itself.  From where I was seating, there are several cans of Mexican products etc etc on the Shelf of the Mini Grocer.

While waiting for our order to be ready many more Patrons enter this establishment either to purchase the Bakery goods or the kids wanting the Pinata and some Patrons opt to have their FOOD TO GO.

With the pricing, and the flavor Hubs like what he had.  Reminds him of the Days, he was in Mexico.  What more can you ask for $6.50 Smothered Burrito.  Our Dinner was about $20 with beverages and tax.  Hubs opt to have the Medium Mexican Coke Cola, while I opt for the Strawberry Jarritos.

The Tacos comes with 2 Salsas/Sauces.  1 Red and 1 Green.  The Red is more SPICY than the Green Sauce.  The Green Sauce was more like a Tomatillo Green Salsa.  All our Tacos have Onions and Cilantro, coz that is what we mentioned upfront when we ordered our food.  If I am NOT mistaken, the Tripa Taco was $1.69 each, while the Normal Tacos was $1.39 each.  As for my Tacos, its A-OKAY...  The Tripa is &#34;crunchy&#34;, and the Lengua is just A-OKAy.  All our food came out piping hot, tasted fresh and I like the Spicy Red Salsa aka Sauce better than the Green Sauce.  

Hubs rate this establishment between 3.5 to 4 stars.  Hubs DEFINITELY DOES NOT MIND returning to order many other items from this establishment.  Thank you Panaderia Y Taqueria, we shall see you in the future soon.  This establishment also offer Tacos such as Pastor, Carnitas, Barbacoa, and other items such as Gorditas, Pollo, Milanese, Chiles Rellenos, Tortas, Menudo, Coctel de Camrones to name a few.

At the end of our Dinner, Hubs purchased a Medium Mexican Coke Cola, and 6 Mexican Chocolate Coins, 3 for $1, he got 6, with the Cola is was like about $5.

I have to Agree!

We decided to stop in one evening, for a burger, hey, why not?!

The interior is industrial, with booths, tables, and high tops. You walk in, and move to the front counter on the right side, to place your order.  Once you place your order, they give you a number, and you take a seat. Your order is brought out to you.

My husband and I each had a burger. I had the, Off the Record Avocado (with the sauce on the side), and my husband had the, The Godfather. We thoroughly enjoyed both of our burgers, In fact, we thought these were some of the best burgers in town! No kidding!

The staff is friendly, the place is clean too. Yes, it&#39;s a chain, and yes, it&#39;s like fast food, but it&#39;s a step up from fast food.  

Parking in the lot there is free. The music inside is not loud at all, a big plus for me. 

So, if you are in the neighborhood, and are wanting a good burger, give Illegal Burger a try. You will not be disappointed."

Her battered fish burger was better than I expected.  I actually think I liked it better than the avocado/sprouts burger that I had.  The variety of toppings will likely make it well worth coming again to try something else.  The burgers patties were not my favorite, but at least they let the meat speak for its self, rather than try to hide it behind a wall of seasoning.  Well worth a try if you are looking for a decent burger in the area.  Seating was uncomfortable but serviceable.  Provides a better value than Racine&#39;s or Gov Park Tavern if you know you want a burger."

They had a special going on which was free thin cut fries with 2 burgers purchased and buy one get one beer. I had the avocado burger with sprouts. It was juicy and well seasoned (meaning properly) but not in a greasy way. BF had a loaded basic-ish burger which he didn&#39;t put down once. The fries were perfect. I wouldn&#39;t have chosen that type but it came with the special and I&#39;m glad. They came out first which was weird, but they were so good that I didn&#39;t care. Their fry sauce was perfect, and I&#39;m from utah where it was invented, so I know these things. The food was great, decent beer selection, happy hour, full bar. The only negative was the seating wasn&#39;t very welcoming. It&#39;s very nice looking, but not somewhere you want to sit for an hour or two to chill. There aren&#39;t many great burgers in that area. Although it could use some touch of warmth, I recommend it. I hope it stays. Vesper is too loud and busy, Wendy&#39;s is Wendy&#39;s."

It&#39;s all pretty similar, still I don&#39;t mind trying different places.  This place was really good.  They had a lunch special - for $9-something  I got a roll and a medium bowl of pho.  
I guess it was the little things, but I was pretty impressed.  My server was very nice and professional (unlike another place I just reviewed) Service is pretty fast, and the place was clean.  Usually, you get limes, mint, peppers and bean sprouts - which is hard to mess up.  My tray was very plentiful and I got some thick, fat, juicy limes, fragrant mint (or whatever it is), and LOTS of sprouts.  The broth was really tasty, plenty of meat, and the roll I got was large and fresh too.

For $23.95 we got basically a big platter of bean sprouts and lettuce, 1 eggroll cut in 2 pieces and burnt beef that tasted weird. Maybe 5 shrimp. A chicken breast sliced. Looks can be deceiving as it looked overwhelmingly a huge platter only to dig and find that it was piled high with bean sprouts instead. A package of spring roll wrapper and a bowl of hot water. It was put on a small platter that everything fell off on to the table like the noodles and crumbled beef when trying to get stuff to make a spring roll. I asked for another plate to separate noodles from the veggies and that is when I found that 70% was bean sprouts. Our waters were filled consistently. My boba was ok. The waiter asked if it was good and my dad was like no and he kinda laughed and walked away. Used to be Pho 79 but I guess new management or owners as Pho 99? Not as good now.

The interior of Pho 79 looks like a large banquet hall, a large quantity of tables and chairs and blank walls.  The place feels a little cold and I would prefer a warmer atmosphere for eating in.  Sanitation is also questionable, it felt as though a deep clean was necessary.

I had the Combination Vermicelli Bowl (under $10) and an order of spring rolls to go.  The spring rolls were fresh and had a delicious peanut sauce for dipping although I like to dunk.  The Vermicelli Bowl has pork, chicken, beef, egg rolls, and shrimp with assorted pickled veggies served atop vermicelli noodles.  The marinated pork had wonderful seasoning and the shrimp were tender and mouthwatering.  I found the beef to have an odd flavor, I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on the taste other than it left an unpleasant after taste in my mouth.  Aside from the beef the noodle bowl was exactly what I wanted and I finished the whole thing.

Overall I believe Pho 79 is average, I&#39;ve had better and I&#39;ve had worse."

I cannot testify if that is true or not but I can tell you about my experience from dining at Pho 79 yesterday.

I debated between getting pho or their specialty combination bowl (bun thit nuong). After careful deliberation, I chose the combination bowl because I was craving the grilled shrimp. That bowl comes with vermicelli, bean sprouts, peanuts, grilled pork, grilled shrimp, two egg rolls, pickled carrot, fish sauce (nuoc mam), lettuce and cucumber. The nuoc mam was lacking in flavor compared to nuoc mam that I am used to. I presume they watered down the flavor to make it more acceptable for non-Vietnamese consumers. The egg rolls were perfect and very flavorful and full of meat. The shrimp were small but sweet and the pork flavorful without being fatty. I couldn&#39;t finish my bowl because it was huge and there were a lot of noodles and bean sprouts. 

I found a hair in my noodles mid-way eating which was off putting to say the least. 

I also tried their egg roll appetizer which was slightly expensive considering it was only two egg rolls (two long ones cut in half so I guess that made 4). However, it came with salad, pickled vegetables, vermicelli and cucumber so it could have been made into a mini meal. The egg rolls are worth eating for sure. I would order those again.

In terms of atmosphere, this place is spacious and was half full on a Sunday night. They offer blended smoothies with pearls/boba as well as a seaweed salad appetizer (not very Vietnamese). 

Service was standard for a Vietnamese spot. The girl at the register was on the phone at the same time as doing my credit card transaction so it was confusing the entire time I was trying to receive my receipt and sign it. 

I enjoyed all of the photos of Vietnam on the wall and the hanging nong la (rice hat) decorations.

I will try their pho next time and update my review."

The hubs was in the mood for Pho. Not sure why, as we have never had it before. But, we decided to seek some out. We took to yelp for some suggestions. 

Boy were they right! 

At 12:30 pm the place was not busy. Just a few tables. We were seated right away. All the tables are numbered. We were told to sit at 22. We received our menus and chop sticks. They brought us water before we needed to ask. 
Our server was fun. We ordered a Seafood Pho and the Combination Vermicelli Bowl. We also started with the Vietnamese Summer rolls. 
The summer rolls were served cold with some peanut sauce on the side. For $3.95, they were wonderful. Not sure if we will order them again, as the shrimp tasted dried out. 
Along with our summer rolls they brought out a huge plate of toppings for the Pho. 

Our lunches arrived, piping hot for the Pho, and to my surprise, my Noodle bowl was served cold with hot meats. 

On my Combination Vermicelli Bowl I had beef, chicken, shrimp and pork. All was served piping hit on top of lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumbers and cold noodles. I took one look at my dish and asked for a FORK! I have used chop sticks, but I really prefer a fork! After making a  HUGE mess trying to mix it all together, I ate about 1/3 of it! It was so good and a great item for a hot day!

Hubs had the Seafood Pho. It was steaming hot when it arrived. It was loaded with  seafood, shrimp balls, mussels, &#34;crab&#34;, crab meatballs, beef tendon was in there too!  He added a few sprouts and got started! He ate the all the meat out if it and about 1/3 of the noodles.  We brought home a whole quart! I&#39;m so excited to have some of it for lunch tomorrow! 

Both entrees were priced under $9. 

With tax it was $23 and some change. 

Our server boxed it up for us, bagged it and thanked us. 
We plan on returning. It was a wonderful meal and we can&#39;t wait to introduce our kids to Pho! 
Oh, and as we were leaving I ashes our server his name, so we could ask for him next time. 
True to his personality the whole meal, he replied with &#34;Sunflower Seed&#34; 
So, GO to Pho79 and ask for Sunflower Seed!"

The dining area is very open. There are a ton of tables which means no matter the size of the group, there is plenty of space for all. It&#39;s got a very cozy feel for being so open. They sell fun trinkets and interesting candies by the register so that&#39;s a lot of fun.

I&#39;ve been all over the city for pho and this restaurant has some of the best. They come in small, medium, and large sizes. Plus, it&#39;s very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food. Color me impressed. Also, they have Vietnamese sandwiches available for take-out. That was new to me but it&#39;s a great idea.

It took some time to get the attention of our server but he was very polite and packaged up our leftovers with great skill. It was nice that my water glass was always full. I like that kind of attention.

Over all this is a quality place. It is very clean and welcoming. Parking could be an issue depending on what time you arrive because the lot is a bit small. But, the pho is well worth any trouble cuz it&#39;s so dang good!"

They also have a few magazines (so random) but they&#39;re up to date.

I do wish a few things on them.
1. Their summer rolls/spring rolls/whatever they call them. They were cold and hard when I had them recently and that was a bit unappetizing.
2. I prefer the small leafy cilantro to the kind they offer here (broad single leaf)
3. More greenery for the experience.

I also pretty much never give pho restaurants 5 stars.  This is no exception.  But the tendon and brisket here, both of which I usually don&#39;t enjoy, were phenomenal.  I get tendon for the health benefits but usually chew it like a dog eating peanut butter.  And brisket is usually dry and chewy.  But not here.  At least not this time.  The broth was a lighter flavor than I prefer, but it was still good.  The noodles were not overdone.  They did not get any stray cilantro in my bowl.  I left happier than when I came in.

My experience there was really quite good, but not WHOA HOLY CRAP good like I sort of demand from a pho joint, considering that there are 600 of them on Federal, alone.

I had the brisket pho and my lunch date had the seafood pho, which is really what they&#39;re known for and what you pay a premium for (you can&#39;t order a small, has to be a medium or large and costs a bit more).  My broth was hearty and beefy, though it lacked a bit of complexity. Wow, that sounded snobby.  It was good, but not WHOA good.  There was, however, a very, very decent portion of brisket for the small bowl that I ordered, probably about the amount I get in medium sized bowls at most places.  And, the meat was delicious, though I had to spit out a few pieces for being a little tough.

My lunch date&#39;s seafood pho was..well, it was good, but I think it should be on the normal menu, at normal menu price.  Even if there was an added $1.50, or something, it would be nice to be able to order a small bowl, and I don&#39;t quite understand why you can&#39;t.  I eat like a bird, so I take home a ton of food when I get a small bowl, getting a medium bowl is just too much for me.  The shrimp in his pho was overcooked, like, WAY overcooked.  No excuse for that.

We had Thai Iced Tea and they add a nice dollop of whipped cream to the top, which makes it extra, extra yummy.  I was a little bummed to see lemon served on the garnish plate, instead of limes, but I&#39;ve been seeing that a lot more lately (what&#39;s with that?).

Overall, it was a good meal.  I want to go back and try it again, and maybe try the seafood pho, myself.  If you&#39;re listening Pho 79, make the seafood pho an option on the regular pho menu and allow us to order smalls.  I cannot manage a medium, so please, for me, make smalls available :D

Thanks!"

Also the restaurant could use a facelift. If they opened up the front of the building with windows and/or a patio with new tables this place could look like fine dining! 

I went here with a friend who loves Pho, this place was pretty good, loved the boboa (I got Mango) and my pho was great too! Summer rolls were just ok. Also while its true nobody bothered to check on our drinks, everyone was extremely nice and offered togo boxes when I couldn&#39;t finish my Pho (small was MORE than enough for lunch). Seriously loved the staff. My only concern here (and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5) is that I&#39;m pretty sensitive to MSG and I&#39;m a tad worried they add it to their Pho. I got a huge headache, swelled up and had a blood pressure spike. That being said, this place is really good and almost might be worth the adverse side effects : ) I&#39;d definitely go back for a boboa and warm friendly (albeit absent at times) waiters."

The restaurant is beautiful inside despite the initial chow-hall impression I first got from the tables, but I now understand that they&#39;re super busy. The photos on the walls were pretty, service was fast and friendly and our pho was AMAZING! Very generous with the meat in our servings, and very generous with the bean sprouts and jalapeños (which I love). All tables were clean and well stocked with sriracha, napkins and hoisin sauce. This is a very well run establishment and I&#39;m very pleased with what I found today!"

Got to-go a week or so later and was just a little worried about how my rare beef pho would be after driving home.... But they packaged everything separately so I was able to add my own noodles, meat, and the regular selection of veggies to the broth. They even gave a little container of hoisin and sriracha mixed which really made me happy! And they waited to make my boba tea until I got to the shop which was also nice. 
Really love this place!"

What happened to this place? It used to be my favorite place to eat pho in Aurora and today it was just terrible! The noodles were tough and uncooked, they never cooked through in the broth. And there were only 4 pieces of grey looking steak in my Medium #2. And the smell!!!!!!! What is that stench????? How can anyone eat with that.

I didn&#39;t realize how big it was or how packed it would be. The staff is very attentive and they move the tables relatively quickly from what I experienced.

I actually didn&#39;t feel like Pho so I went with my Spring Rolls and also the Vermicelli bowl. I thought both were spot on and I absolutely wasn&#39;t disappointed in either. From the clientele I get the impression that the soup is great especially since a large number of people were Asian (very good sign!).

When I first came to this restaurant back in 2009, it was absolutely amazing and I am sure anyone who has visited this restaurant a few years back can recall that the pho was indeed pretty good. When I recently came here, the flavor completely changed. The broth wasn&#39;t as piping hot as it use to be, and it didn&#39;t have a rich flavor it once did. Also the meat didn&#39;t look too good and didn&#39;t taste good at all whatsoever. Also the noodles weren&#39;t al dente and some where hard while others were too mushy.

It&#39;s conveniently located right by a shopping plaza so you can eat there and then get your errands done as well. I&#39;ve already been here a countless number of times and I always keep coming back. Some of my favorite things here are the pho and combination vermicelli bowl. The pho comes in small, medium and large. The increase in size is usually just more noodles, not necessarily the meats. I am usually content with a medium sized bowl of pho. Their combo vermicelli noodle bowl is probably one of the best i&#39;ve had in Colorado. The egg rolls are perfectly crisp and there are a variety of meats and veggies inside as well. It&#39;s probably a safe bet if you want something yummy but not noodle-y. The place has ample seating so I&#39;ve never had to wait for seats even during rush hour meal times. You can either pay at the table or just tell them your table number and pay at the front desk.

The broth still has the delicious flavor I remember, however the ingredients you order are not necessarily what you&#39;ll get.  I ordered rare steak &amp; brisket, my man ordered rare steak &amp; flank.  
Due to the strange appearance of the meat in my bowl (didn&#39;t look like the brisket I&#39;d remembered) I thought perhaps ours has been switched, so we traded.  The meat in my new bowl looked right until about halfway through.  There were a webby looking couple pieces which my man confirmed for me was tripe. ...I&#39;m not a tripe girl.  Was certainly not in the adventurous mood that would be required of me to try it that evening.  A few pieces looked like possible tendon as well.  Definitely not something I&#39;m familiar with because I stick with what I&#39;m familiar with when it comes to pho.  Maybe it was my body slightly in shock, but my belly wasn&#39;t happy afterwards...

My roommate and I are on a challenge of eating at one new place a week along the Havana and Parker Rd corridors here in Aurora, and Pho 79 was our first adventure. It&#39;s going to be hard to beat, that&#39;s for sure. The pho here is crazy flavorful! They use the perfect blend of spices, including just the right amount of star anise. This flavor made it&#39;s way into everything, including the noodles and the meat, making it quite the sensory experience. And the meat I had in my pho (raw steak, fat brisket, and skirt flank) were all tender and flavorful. The fat brisket was my favorite, picking up the broth flavors in the fatty parts of the brisket.

We both ordered the large, which was one of the largest bowls of anything I&#39;ve ever seen...and only $8! I was starving, yet only managed about 2/3 of it, which still left me a healthy portion for lunch the next day (and it was just as good too).

Our service was a little slow, but I think we got the short straw on servers, as everyone else looked to be receiving efficient service. Note that you pay at the counter, and they automatically have your order already there. Just state what table number you were at, and you&#39;re good - no waiting for your check or the server to cash you out.

I&#39;m no pho expert, but I have a hard time believing I could have something better. Any more flavor and it might have actually been overwhelming. This was one of those meals where my taste buds left in complete content."

First, I tried pho number 1 and number 12. The broth was absolutely tasteless, and the meat was not the best quality. I also tried the spring rolls with peanut sauce, and let me tell you, that sauce tasted like caramel, without a hint of spices or even peanut.
It was a Saturday night and the place was mayhem! The cooks were singing and joking around in the kitchen, and we could hear them all the way from table 23 (yes, I paid attention when the hostess mentioned the number of my table).

Their wait service sucks. They take your order, bring your food, and disappear forever and ever. No one checks to see if you need anything else. Ration your water or just let the ice cubes melt. I usually ask for three extra glasses of water just to be safe. 
It&#39;s kinda pricey and I don&#39;t get why the sandwiches are to-go only. What the heck is that about?
&#34;In order to experience the sandwiches, you must place a great distance between the sandwich and our establishment. Only then will you truly experience the great taste of the Vietnamese sandwich.&#34;

I do like their broth. Don&#39;t sit in the southwest corner area, it has a weird smell.

The food and service are pretty consistent, and the prices are reasonable.  They also turn over the tables fast, so the wait is never very long even if they&#39;re busy.

FOOD:
* Spring Rolls: standard with meat, shrimp, and other veggies; the peanut sauce is always watery
* Pho - I order the medium size, and there&#39;s a nice portion of soup, noodles, and meat; the fresh herbs and veggies are sometimes more limited than others (last time just two sprigs of basil, three small pieces of lime, and a pile of broken bean sprouts)
* Bun with Mixed Meat - good and flavorful; decent portion of flavorful meat

SERVICE: good; ask anyone for anything, and someone will get it to you within a couple minutes

AMBIANCE: casual; set up to look a bit like a cafeteria with tables and chairs lined up in long rows; kid friendly; the most ethnically diverse customers I&#39;ve ever seen at a Denver restaurant

PARKING: lots on two sides of the restaurant

However, I have some constructive feedback to provide. As the years have gone by little has changed in regards to decor  and this place can certainly  use some attention. Service has improved somewhat,but it can be slow at times when the place is empty. In my OP there shouldn&#39;t be any excuse not to seat waiting patrons within 1 minutes of walking in the door of an empty house. Also food sometimes can be inconsistent.

From the first time I had it, it definitely had me hooked. I raved about this place for a long time and people who went there would come back to me with lack luster feedback. 
So, about two weeks ago, I returned for the first time in about three years. Unfortunately, after being to several other Pho restaurants I realized that Pho 79 wasn&#39;t the ish.... 

The Pho: it was decent, it had flavor and it is what I would expect, nothing to call home about, nonetheless it was good. One thing that I noticed, it tasted like the chicken in my Pho was freezer burned... I didn&#39;t eat it, I was better off getting a vegetable bowl. 

The service: We all  know, any Pho restaurant you go to lacks service. It is a &#34;churn and burn&#34; environment. They want you to eat, pay them, and get the hell out of there! LOL 

The experience: Again, I wasn&#39;t wow&#39;ed, I would go there again (if I was invited).

So Mr. P. and I finally decided we would give it a try and Pho 79 seemed like the perfect starting point.  First, the atmosphere of the restaurant is not what I expected.  I guess I thought it would be more dim and intimate but it&#39;s just one big bright open room filled with people hunched over steaming bowls of noodles.  We were seated immediately and began to look over the menu.

If memory serves, the menu contains a few appetizers, several options for pho, and a couple of combination platters of some sort.  They also offer 3 or 4 types of banh mi sandwiches that are, oddly, only available for carry out.  Also listed are several varieties of boba tea beverages.

We started the meal with the Vietnamese egg rolls which we both really enjoyed.  I ordered the rare steak pho and Mr. P. decided on something with three different kinds of meat.  Portions here are ridiculously huge.  The small size pho is a gracious plenty.  They also give you a heaping plate of sprouts, dandelion greens, basil, jalapenos, and limes to season the pho to your liking.

I would like to emphasize that all of the food we received was made with the freshest ingredients.  The steak in my pho was high quality and did not contain any gristle or fat.  It&#39;s just...well, we weren&#39;t blown away like I expected we would be.  The pho was interesting to be sure but definitely not as delicious as I imagined.  The prices sure are right - you can&#39;t beat $20 for a Friday night dinner for two.

So it&#39;s probably just me and I will try pho again sometime again in the future.  I will also make a return visit to Pho 79 and carry out a banh mi sandwich and one of those milkshake-looking boba teas."

The dish was fine, but not the best.  We thought the spring rolls lacked flavor, peanut sauce too salty, and the pho taste was a bit off."

Vietnamese is the largest member of a family of languages in Southeast Asia. Because of significant influence from China, there are a large number of Chinese words in Vietnamese. And because of French colonial presence, Vietnamese is the only language in the region to be written in the Latin alphabet of Europe and has many French words as well (cà phê for example means cafe)

Vietnamese food is likewise a delicious sum of disparate parts. At Pho 79 you definitely sense this in the complexity of its food. The soup uses Chinese originated rice noodles and is made with delicious cuts of beef, the preferred meat of the French colonists. The broth itself here is deep and complex, using the charred onion flavor common in French onion soup. And of course the pho here has that wonderful umami flavor likely derived from the Vietnamese originated fish sauce known as nuoc mam.

I bring up history in this review, because Pho 79 has the best Pho I&#39;ve ever had. And I had to know how this soup came into my world.. The Banh mi here is also excellent (Love the mixture of a French baguette and Vietnamese ingredients like the seasoned meat and pickled carrots).

We should all be grateful for the way world history has turned out. For all of its tragedies, we now live in a world where in the middle of the United States you can get a cuisine that is a mixture of Southeast Asian, French and Chinese parts all for an affordable price. IThat&#39;s pretty awesome."

My favorite pho bowl here is the #8 Special. This way I get the best of all worlds - rare steak, brisket, flank, tendon and tripe! And Pho 79&#39;s meats are so good, and the broth is so flavorful, I usually only end up doctoring my meal with Tuong (Vietnamese soybean sauce - no Hoisin here people!) because I just love that condiment so much. These folks know their soup!

I also like the Goi Cuon Chay (tofu, veggies and rice noodles in a soft rice wrapper), served with a peanut-Tuong sauce that&#39;s out of sight. I can almost taste them now! If you&#39;re so inclined you can even do the make-your-own-rolls thing.

It was a cold and rainy day, so what better time than to get some pho!!  The place was packed.  Everyone had the same idea we did--but beat us to it, so we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  We each ordered our pho bowls, and YIKES.  It was bad.  It tasted like weak chicken/beef broth with lots of star anise and cloves to &#39;flavor it up&#39; a bit.  It seemed they didn&#39;t have enough broth made for the unexpected large crowd, so they whipped some up quickly without letting beef bones simmer to create the broth. There was just no time.  Hungry folks await!

So I understood.  Maybe it was just an off day because of the large unexpected crowds due to weather.

We went back a month ago on a weekday evening.  It wasn&#39;t packed, but the restaurant was about 1/3 full.  Not too shabby!  We ordered our pho bowls, and YIKES AGAIN!!  The pho wasn&#39;t as bad as the first time we came, but it was not good.  I&#39;m Vietnamese, and have eaten at my fair share of pho restaurants, but this was just consistently bad.  The cloves and star anise didn&#39;t overwhelm the broth this time as it did last, but the stock used  is consistently poor.  There isn&#39;t a lot of beef &#34;flavor,&#34; as though no beef bones were used to or weren&#39;t allowed to simmer long enough.

The cost of pho has risen a lot around the Denver metro area.  Thus, it&#39;s better to use those hard earned dollars elsewhere!"

The key is the broth. The best places start with a yummy, umami-rich broth. And by far, the best i&#39;ve had in Denver is this hole-in-the-wall near the Costco in Aurora. 

Pho places are tricky because they are named Pho 99, or Pho 78, etc. Weird right? And Pho 79 is about as simple as it gets. Plastic tables, no liquor, very fast service and super cheap. It&#39;s all part of the fun.

This place can be crazy busy though and that&#39;s when things start to slip a little. Tables won&#39;t get cleaned as well as they should and once, only once, do I think they actually ran out of broth and were trying to rush a fresh batch so it wasn&#39;t as good.

It happens that not too far from my abode there resides two pho places, neither of which I have tried yet (for shame).  I turned to my trusty Yelpers to guide me in the right direction and Pho 79 it was.

I sat down and ordered a small #1 - meatball.  The wait staff was efficient - not very personable-  but definitely efficient.  When my bowl arrived WOW - I have been to various pho places around Denver but I have never had this much meat in a bowl before - I mean I had to dig through all of it to get to the noodles.

1. I live in Orange County/Los Angeles which means I&#39;m an expert, and that I&#39;m officially honorarily 1/5th Viet.
2. This place isn&#39;t as good as &#34;XXXX&#34; in either San Jose, CA, Houston, Texas, Garden Grove, CA, etc because I&#39;m that worldly.
3. I am Vietnamese, or I&#39;ve eaten pho with a full Vietnamese person who knows good pho, so I know pho because just like every American knows a good burger, every Vietnamese person is an expert on pho.
4. I&#39;ve seen Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Tropic Thunder and every other movie about Vietnam multiple times, and I secretly rooted for the Viet Cong every single time. 
5. I&#39;ve never cooked pho (I have), been in a kitchen before, but I know what I&#39;m talking about in regards to the preparation of pho. You should still definitely listen to me.
6. I&#39;ve dated/hooked up with Vietnamese chicks even one that did nails, so you can&#39;t get anymore Viet than that.

How&#39;s that for qualifiers for how legit this review is? Yes, I know I borrowed some lines from some other reviewers (like a couple of the reviews below), but I&#39;m being sarcastic.

Some may automatically give blind praise to Orange County (CA), Little Saigon pho because they believe somehow that it&#39;s going to be better, but I&#39;d say that Colorado pho is definitely better. 303 pho fo life!

The major thing that sets it apart is the meat quality. The meat specifically at Pho 79 is most definitely better than most pho restaurants I&#39;ve eaten at in SoCal and the fatty flank at most SoCal restaurants is like some tore up pastrami lips.

I order the Pho Dac Biet (the special), and Pho 79&#39;s is also one of the best I&#39;ve had in regards to value. The bowl sizes and quantity of food is enormous. One large bowl is almost big enough to feed a tiny village.

Taste wise, it&#39;s got a good depth of flavor, but if you say it&#39;s got a &#34;watered down&#34; taste it maybe due to the lack of MSG because if you&#39;re used to the others, then you may be used to &#34;flavor enhanced&#34; pho. It&#39;s also the reason why a lot of products, especially soups in most commercial franchises use it - guess what makes that baked potato soup you like so much, so good?

Well I think Colorado pho restaurants are better than most OC restaurants, but then again I&#39;m only honorarily a 1/5th Viet."

I ordered their Combination Pho or Dac Biet Pho (#23 on menu). The bowl that came out was huge! Mostly soup and noodles though. It lacked meat in the bowl but they did have a decent portion of the rare steak on the side. The veggies also lacked when it came out with the pho. I was disappointed with the pho here.

If There were 0 star available, I would most definitely rate this restaurant a 0. I am not from local so I thought I would give this Pho-natic restaurant a try, and boy were I regretted my decision. I consider myself an above average experience in cooking as well as eating Pho but this place is by far the worst I&#39;ve ever tasted a bowl of Pho. I ordered Pho Tai, Chin with tendon in a rather cold day in Denver that we visited the capital right across the street there. The first impression is the aroma of the beef broth and its color was a total disappointment. The broth was so watery clear and has no tint of brown color in it. The very light brown color is the actual color of the beef bones after it&#39;ve been cooked for 8-9 hours. It&#39;s worse than a chicken broth and has no Pho flavor. To make it worse, it was so salty that I had to use extra lemon to combat the saltiness of the broth. There was no room to add any more hoisen sauce or what not because then it would be unbearable to eat this bowl of Pho. The broth is the most important component of a bowl of Pho and their Pho tasted like it&#39;s cooked with dry packed chicken bones broth with added salt and Pho spice flavor. Do not recommend this Pho at all."

In these dark days we also relocated and moved to Denver from the East coast but coildnt find good options on our road trip. We got here, we got settled and it was time for the &#34;pho fanatics&#34; to get some pho.
Pho-natic with all its reviews was an easy choice for location and strength of feedback and man did it NOT disappoint!!! interesting sparse decor and then we had our pho in front of us and all was forgotten as we dropped our heads down to slurp/gulp/munch for 30 minutes of silent, orgasmic eating!! they stuff the pho with meat, give you a basil leaf tree and a Costco sized batch of sprouts and then also provide you with a lemongrass chili oil (our first try) that is potent but so flavorful and complementary to the pho. 

what else, you ask??

Jeez man - get out here and give them a try!!!"

When looking for this restaurant, they don&#39;t have a sign so the only reason I was able to find it was because they had a little sign on a sandwich board looking thing.
Walking in the place was different from other Pho places I have been to &amp; I have been to my fair share of pho places.

The entrance wasn&#39;t cluttered &amp; was almost contemporary.
Very minimal.
They had a host podium with only menus on the side &amp; that was it.

It&#39;s quite small inside but there is ample seating.

The employees are super nice.
I ordered C7. Fried Rice but when looking at my receipt it stated B7. So I let them know &amp; there was no argument, he apologized &amp; told me &#34;Give me 3 minutes.&#34; They had already run my card so he gave me a cash refund of the difference. Which was only about a dollar &amp; some change. 

Super friendly staff! Cannot say that enough.

I ordered the a small 4 which is chicken pho and a large 9 which is a brisket &amp; steak pho with C7 Fried rice.
I only ate the chicken pho, the broth was so yummers by itself (that&#39;s how you know if a pho place is good, taste the broth before adding all your usual condiments.)

The small was a big serving and if I ate the chicken, it would have been a super big portion. as you know, I am vegetarian so I just put the chicken to the side.

All in all, it&#39;s pretty good. 
I&#39;d totally recommend it :)
Especially with Denver&#39;s weather."

Pho-natic on a Saturday was pretty slow but picked up as the lunch date went on. We ordered spring rolls &amp; 2 bowls of pho. The broth itself was a little bland for my taste but nothing that a little sriracha can&#39;t handle....

Let&#39;s cut to the chase: the location is weird.  Right by Civic Center Park, the Capital, the Courts, East Colfax, all that.  Always sketchy people being sketchy outside, some weird dude yelling about something, etc.  Move past that, and you&#39;re fine.

The inside blew me away!  It was quiet, super clean, nicely decorated, and much larger than I imagined it to be from the outside.

The staff was very polite, friendly, and provided good service.

The BBQ spring rolls were tasty, with a lovely crunch and a sweet dipping sauce.  Sauce is pretty watery, something a bit thicker would have been nice.

The pho was delicious!  Hot, flavorful, with big chunks of meat and noodles.  They presented it with raw meat on top, ready to be pushed into the hot broth to cook up.  I loved the presentation.

The price is a little bit higher than usual for pho places, by ~$1.50.  But for the convenience of not driving all the way to South Federal and back to City Park, that was well worth it.

Glad there is a great pho place nearby.  Will be back."

It is on Colfax and if you get a window seat, you get a show! The only drawback is that they don&#39;t sell booze. I would love a beer with my pho on occasion, oh well. Oh and they are closed on Sundays - booooo! The menu is rather limited, but they have Jasmine tea and Vietnamese coffee which I enjoy. 

It is quick, it is easy, and it is the best Pho in this part of town. They have vegetarian options as well, which is something. It is not ridiculously authentic, but it hits the spot!

Regardless, they are a solid spot for affordable tasty pho and I recommend going during off meal hours as it can get pretty busy. But I have been several times and will be back for certain!"

The food was A-OK, as 3 stars on yelp suggests. The broth was not very flavorful, and I was a little disappointed with meat portions, but it&#39;s possible I&#39;m spoiled from San Francisco pho. 
Food-wise I was most impressed by the absolutely heaping plate of bean sprouts, basil, lime, and jalapeno served with the pho. This far surpassed other establishments in scale and generosity. Staff was very friendly, with my water glass always full.


Additionally, anyone who says this place is better than restaurants on Federal is surely a n00b to Viet food and does not yet know the potential of good hole-in-the-wall pho."

When I lived in Cap Hill I would often eat in, now that I moved out of the neighborhood I usually order to go and take it home after work. Pho-natic is a clean, quiet environment that is a welcome change from the absurdity of Colfax Ave. Excellent service all the time. 

I had never had Pho when I first tried Pho-natic and they were patient and descriptive when explaining it to me. I am a huge fan of the rare beef pho and my wife is obsessed with the chicken pho. Lately however I&#39;ve been getting the tofu/veggie but subbing out the veggie broth for beef broth! It&#39;s my new go to for sure. I love having the fresh vegetables in my pho! 

Also, I have not had better taro boba anywhere. Seriously, no trip to Pho-natic i s complete without it!

I&#39;ve been here a few times and the first time I was super disappointed, hence only 4 stars. My friends and I showed up around 1:30pm and there was no host, just some guy standing next to a counter who one in our group thought was supposed to seat us but he was just waiting for takeout. Oops. Then when we were finally seated, it took about 15 minutes for us to get our waters and by then all 4 of us were ready to order. Our order was pretty standard, a few spring rolls, 3 pho, and some other yummy soup they offer. My pho noodles were under cooked and totally stuck together and the food took foreverrr. Luckily none of us were in a hurry but a quick lunch trip took almost 2 hours and only 30 mins of that was spent eating. It didn&#39;t seem like that time of day would be so slow and weird but it was.

Since it&#39;s so close though, I decided I wanted to give it another try. The broth was delicious, the staff was really nice (just an off slow day maybe? Idk) the meat and stuff seemed fresh and the ingredients were good quality.

On our second trip, we were quickly seated, and served and the pho was like a million times better the second time around. I&#39;m sad I&#39;m not eating here right now haha. Their veggie spring rolls and regular spring rolls are both delicious. They offer 3 sizes of pho and I like that just incase I don&#39;t feel like dragging left overs around with me after.

Weird restaurant, kinda feels like a waiting room when it&#39;s empty and they&#39;re playing loud elevator music. The only thing I think that could make this place better is alcohol! Get your license, pleeeeease! And maybe a little more consistency on service time. But I&#39;m glad I gave it a second chance. Super duper yummy and good prices."

I&#39;m in town on business from Orange County, CA where we have Little Saigon.  This is not even close and a couple of the places on Federal are much more authentic. Here&#39;s how I see it.

3.  Atmosphere 3 Stars.  Does it really matter?
4.  Portions Price/Value Proposition 5 Stars
5.  Food 2 Stars

I was originally going to order my favorite Bun Bo Hue but I felt it was not going to be authentic from the description.  Instead I had the #19 Pho.  Based upon the Pho I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t order the Bun. I would have been more disappointed. The beef was fine, but it was the broth.  It tasted like watered down beef bullion. It was very very bland without the rich flavor that should be present.  A lack of proper seasoning and short cooking time minimum of 12 hours.  Also a little Cilantro along with the Basil would have been nice.  Then there was no Crushed Chili Oil.  That&#39;s a sin.  A couple of the places on Federal come much closer.

Service was terrible, and when our food came out, the broth was at best lukewarm. Which by the way, you need very hot broth to COOK the meat. That&#39;s one the best experiences when eating pho, is watching the meat cook right before your eyes. The other part that was downright DISGUSTING was MOLDY sprouts! You have to keep your refrigerator cold, so that doesn&#39;t happen. And your broth HOT so everything cooks right. Broth was a step below salt water.

But, I remember that in Vietnam, about Pho, Bun, or Com, these kinds of food are served with more vegetables and herbs. 
I can say in the US, most Vietnamese restaurants are this way. 
More meat, less vegetable. 

You should not expect something complicated because in fact, most Vietnamese food is very simple taste. 

It&#39;a little bit pricey though considering location, it&#39;s acceptable.

I am a Pho-natic FANATIC! hah!

I love this place. Definitely in my top two fave Pho restaurants in Colorado.

If you&#39;re not big on Pho, I would suggest the spicy beef noodle soup. :P Mmm. I&#39;m getting hungry just thinking of it. It&#39;s got great spices and a good kick - no ad-dons needed unless you like it extremely spicy or like extra veggies on it like me.

Since I am a fan of pho, I must comment on the Pho. This place has great broth - not too salty and I never have to add too much. Their portions are huge - a small is just perfect for me. The bowls also contain a perfect mix of everything - meat, noodles, veggies. Mmmm. 

Oh and their rolls - Gah, soo good! with that peanut sauce too. SO TASTY. I&#39;m even a fan of their tea - comes is a good size teapot to share. :)

My most favorite dish of Vietnamese cuisine! The broth is most delicious and the price wasn&#39;t bad. I think my regular sized bowl was under portioned on beef per bowl ratio but the broth was on point! I will definitely be visiting again. The restaurant itself was very quiet and modern (too quiet for my liking). Be sure and grab some change/card as you will need to pay for street parking during the day.

Nice big dining area and friendly servers.  The prices are good and only a tiny bit higher than other Pho places, but based on location it seems acceptable.  

I liked this place, I didn&#39;t love it.  I thought the broth was very simple, almost clear, not much flavor.

I was surprised at how quiet and clean this place is considering its location. Prices are very reasonable and the food is quite excellent and vegetables are very fresh. I had a pork noodle bowl and it was quite good, and their servings are large. I took a container of leftovers home.

The only snafu I noted which is something other restaurants do is that the servers tend to mistake Sprite for water and come around pour water into your Sprite. Hint: If it&#39;s bubbly, it&#39;s not water.

The broth was not as flavorful as other places and was also a bit tepid when it arrived. The best pho places I&#39;ve been to always serve the broth like it was just boiling in a cauldron -- that ways the rare meat can cook on the table. The rare steak we got was literally frozen in a block, which again, would have been ok if the broth was hotter, but it just cooled the whole thing down too much. The noodles were a tiny bit undercooked (ahem... Again, hotter broth fixes all of this). The service was good though."

The BBQ spring rolls were almost good enough to bring it into the 3 star territory but I feel like Pho-natic still hasn&#39;t earned the solid 3.

The pho itself is low on meat which isn&#39;t acceptable. The broth has a hint of anise but the savory and distinct pho taste isn&#39;t quite there.

I understand this is a very popular lunch place for the capitol and government workers seeing as it&#39;s across the street. I&#39;ll leave this spot to them in that case and save my money and time for more worthy pho establishments. The wait time alone would give me hesitation on coming back. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had to wait at another pho restaurant. 

Bottom line - it&#39;s not terrible but unless you&#39;re geographically limited to it for lunch I&#39;d skip it."

They skimped on the meat.  My pet peave!!!of pho restaurants.  It&#39;s only a couple more slices of meat.  Probably can&#39;t cost that much when the whole plate is just noodles and broth.  Shesshhh. Add some more meat to the dish will ya!..   but again.  It&#39;s typical of pho restaurants.
pho-natic-denver-2,Victoria T.,zZD69AMbrIRIz-5q233tXQ,"South San Francisco, CA",1,1,0,335,11,Upq-VIJ0O0UUD0NN6J6-dQ,5.0,2013-06-15,"Pho-natic has been around for about three years. It doesn&#39;t look like anything special on the outside, but the interior is very pretty, with blue and green hues. It&#39;s bright and clean, with nice decor and relatively new tables and chairs.

Pho-natic uses these laminated menus that present a casual, impermanent feel. The drink menu is a little laminated sheet that tags along. The selection is very basic, with appetizers, rice plates, vermicelli, and of course, pho. Pho comes in three sizes: small ($7), medium ($8) and large ($9). I had a small Pho Tai Nam.

My pho came out quickly, with a lovely plate of garnishes. I was so excited to see saw leaf! I mean, I can&#39;t say that the pho tastes different without it (which is probably why many places don&#39;t serve it), but it was nice to have it. My standards might be strict, but to me, that&#39;s one part of a perfect bowl of pho.

Now, the broth was very interesting. I could definitely taste star anise, and something that gave the broth warmth, perhaps cinnamon? It was a taste I wanted to wholeheartedly embrace, but couldn&#39;t because it was shockingly oily. It was one of the oiliest broths I&#39;ve ever had, which I can&#39;t make myself appreciate. You could say that the meat made up for it, though. There was a beautiful mound of red meat, which cooked tender and flavorful. The flank was delicious as well, wonderfully moist. All in all, it was a great bowl of pho, with the only flaw being excessive oil.

Service is great here, very attentive.

The meat is thinly sliced and flavorful, the herbs and additions are fresh and plentiful, the broth is savory and layered with flavor, and the noodles stay taught but not chewy. 

The rice noodle bowls are also good - the shrimp and meats are smoky and marinated and the fish sauce is not too strong and not too watery. 

Service was fast, friendly, efficient - never condescending but always informative if need be. 

Clientele ranges from families to tattooed cap hillers to people flying solo for a quick meal. Eating alone is never a problem here. 

Decor is clean, simple, no pretentious urban chicness, just a slight asian flair.

Only drawback is they close at 8pm."

It&#39;s a little pricier than what you&#39;d pay on Federal and portions are smaller as well, but if you live in Denver this is a convenient place to get some Vietnamese without going very far. And you pay for that. 

It&#39;s oddly quiet in this restaurant so don&#39;t have too much inappropriate or rowdy conversation in this joint. I got a combo vermicelli noodle bowl, pretty good but nothing outrageously great about it.

And I found &#34;Pho-Natic. 

It&#39;s located across the street from the Colorado State Capitol, easy to access. I went there around 2:00pm, only 2 tables of customers. 

Service was quick. I order &#34;Tai Gan Sach&#34;,
Rare steak, tendon and tripe, Vietnamese Noodle Soup, regular size, $8

The waitress recommended me to order small size and I should listen to her as regular was too big. 

I also ordered &#34;Che Ba Mau&#34;, 
Red bean, green bean and jell-o in coconut milk, $4
It was a drink but they put it under the dessert column. I just wanted to have jelly in my drink and waitress was so helpful to change for me. 



The noodle soup tasted not too bad, portion was big, rare beef was fresh and raw (love it), tendon was soft, tripe was normal. 
Good thing was they served the veggies aside, you could add as your own favor. The veggies also served freshly.

The drink was too sweet for me, ever you treated it as a dessert.


So glad there is a Vietnamese street food restaurant in downtown Denver, not fancy but very honest food. Good for me as an Asian. 

Ever it&#39;s not surprisingly good, quality is quite nice, worth trying for Vietnamese food."

I have never been disappointed, and it&#39;s perfect for a quiet night out.

The pho is simple, there&#39;s just the right amount of &#34;stuff&#34; (sprouts, jalapeno, basil, limes etc) to put in.  The only thing that I miss is some hardcore chili paste to toss in.  Maybe I have to ask for it, but I just put in the Sriracha sauce that&#39;s perched on the table, taunting me with its hot peppery flavor.

Side note... remember when Sriracha became popular, and everyone bragged about how good and authentic it was?  It&#39;s made in China!  Japan! Thailand! Vietnam!

Actually, it&#39;s made in California, but no biggy.  I still buy a bottle at least once a month.

Sorry, I got sidetracked.  The service is always very friendly, fast, and attentive.  The prices are cheap, and the small bowl is just the right amount of pho.  I like to branch out every once in a while, as far as meats go, but the rare steak is always my go to.

We had a traditional gyro, the chicken kebabs and some fried chicken.  It was phenomenal.  It also seems as though their menu is expanding so I am excited to go back and see what&#39;s new.  
They say they have good burgers, and I&#39;m sure they do... But get the gyro or one of the plates.  Stay traditional and order what will make this place famous, gyros and kebabs duh!!!!

I thought the price would be cheaper based on the reviews and other pictures. I was kind of disappointed in the food as well. It wasn&#39;t bad, but just didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor. The gyro was cooked nicely but flavor was not there. Tzaziki was watery and again flavorless. The French fries were quite good though. They had a tasty seasoning.

Overall, I will not be returning but the food wasn&#39;t horrible."

They were friendly, but between the food and the confusion over my Yelp take-out order, it seems fair to give them 2 stars. 

I placed an order through Yelp/Eat24 about a week ago for a couple of gyros and fries. About 10 minutes after I placed the order, Yelp contacted me to tell me that they had tried to call Gyros &amp; Kabobs several times now and could not get through to place the order with the restaurant. I also tried to call the restaurant and received a recording saying that their number was not in service. At this point, I decided to just drive to the restaurant since I had already paid for my order online and live close. When I arrived, I told the man at the register that I was there to pick up a take-out order I had placed with Yelp. As I expected, they had no record of the order. One of the men, who appeared to be in charge, placed the blame on Yelp, saying that Yelp usually calls to place the order and that the restaurant could not know about the order since Yelp did not call. The thing is, Yelp had tried to call, as had I. 

The man I spoke with about the issue was professional and apologetic, but did not offer to comp any portion of the meal to compensate me for the time I had wasted because their phone was not in service. A business should not offer for customers to order through Yelp if they have no way of receiving the order. I had ordered online to save time, but ended up spending over an hour before I got my food. 

Now onto the food itself. My gyro was subpar. There was very little meat in it, and what meat was in there was paper thin. It was decently flavorful, but there just was not enough of it. Most bites were of pita and lettuce. There was not a variety of fresh vegetables in the gyro either; there was only lettuce that looked and tasted like it was a bagged salad mix. There was some ranch dressing tossed in with the lettuce, but no seasoning beyond that. My girlfriend&#39;s fries were similarly unimpressive - very basic, under-seasoned fries with some chili powdered dusted on them. 

In my opinion, this place does not live up to the 4-star average it has on Yelp."
gyros-and-kabobs-denver,Madeleine R.,8x4GcchO0X2Kf7WYpvXZ6w,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,1,67,Zo4bbec0mSnZJo2iM2u18A,2.0,2016-07-17,"Sadly, I was fooled by the 4 star rating for this place, for both service and quality of food.

The prices are great, don&#39;t get me wrong--but I&#39;ve had equally affordable Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food in the area that was much higher quality.

Let&#39;s start with my experience ordering: this restaurant offers ordering through Yelp/Eat24, but I have never had a poorer experience using the service. I ordered pickup, so I could expedite the process of getting food to take out, but it didn&#39;t turn out that way. Yelp/Eat24 contacted me and my partner 15 minutes after ordering to tell us that the restaurant was not responding to their phone calls and e-mails (how they, apparently, generally communicate orders with businesses). Instead of cancelling the order--we still wanted good food!--we told them we&#39;d attempt to contact them, and drive over to see what was up.

Just like they had told us, Gyros &amp; Kabobs was not answering their phone, but not because they simply weren&#39;t picking up. They hadn&#39;t paid their phone bill, resulting in an automated message saying the number wasn&#39;t in service; extremely unprofessional. We drove over, to see if they&#39;d somehow received our order online--no luck. They blamed it on Eat24, saying, &#34;They usually call or e-mail us when someone orders! We can&#39;t know if they don&#39;t contact us,&#34; and when we said we&#39;d tried (several times) to call them too, they had no explanation.

To their credit, the owner was extremely nice and apologetic, and made our food immediately after we showed him the confirmation that we&#39;d paid. He did not, however, offer anything complimentary to make up for our lost time, despite the fact that the missing order was entirely their fault.

On to the food: definitely not 4-star. The meat in my gyro had good flavor, but there was nowhere near enough of it. Like I said above, I&#39;ve been to many restaurants with similar fare, and their sandwiches/pitas/wraps are always stuffed with meat. Their gyro was mostly lettuce and sauces--I literally had to spread out the meat into tiny pieces to make sure I got some with every bite. And the fries? Totally boring with only a little chili powder on them (no discernible salt), and lukewarm.

If there was more meat in my sandwich, and I didn&#39;t waste almost a whole hour trying to get my food, I might have given this place a better score. A shame."

I am so glad I stumbled upon this place; one word: YUMMY. This is a serious hole-in-the-wall spot but the food is sooo good. I have tried the gyros and the chicken kabobs and both have been amazing; not to mention the service is quick and the prices are very fair. The employees are also very sweet; you can just tell this restaurant is owned by a great family. I will definitely continue to come back here for my middle eastern food fix."

For $7, you can a large plate covered in rice, salad, and gyros!  They have $1 chai, too! I enjoyed the unique flavor of the rice - very herby, a little citrusy - and was super impressed by the freshness of the salad and the veggies in my classic gyros sandwich.  Just be sure to ask for no onions if your not a fan of finding a ton hidden inside your gyros. I think the key word for this place is &#34;eclectic&#34;.  Want a salami sub?  Phili cheese steak?  Fried chicken?  Cheesecake?

There are a few booths across from the counter and a TV if you decide to eat in, but this place is definitely more geared for take out, and it&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s a good, cheap place on my side of town when we&#39;re craving some Mediterranean food."

Based on the reviews I thought I would check this place out. The pita on the gyro was really good but I felt they really skimped on the amount of meat and I just didn&#39;t dig the tzatziki sauce - too watery for my taste. The gyro was fine but I think I was let down a bit expecting more.

My boyfriend and I found it pretty easily with the help of Google maps and were greeted by a friendly employee when we were ready to order. I was debating between the Greek gyro and gyros plate until I saw these fried desserts that I am obsessed with sitting near the cash register.. Therefore, I chose the Greek gyro. Boyfriend chose the cheesy gyro combo with fries and a drink. The voucher was easy to use-- I just showed the cashier my phone and the verification code. We waited about 10 minutes for our food. 

We got the food to go and the gyro was pretty good. It was big and had a decent amount of meat, but too many tomatoes and french fries inside of it? Not sure if that&#39;s how they make their gyros, but it was a bit off-putting to me to taste non-crispy fries in my gyro... On that note, my boyfriend and I shared the fries from his combo. They were just too potato-y to me... I like fries crispy! Pretty much what I am trying to say is that, if the fries inside the gyro (and the fries in general) were crispy, the odd combination may have tasted a bit better. Boyfriend&#39;s gyro did not have fries. The dessert (fried sugary goodness) was quite good and reminded me of this dessert my Indian friend&#39;s mother used to make. 

So, all in all, why this place didn&#39;t get 4 stars was for the fries in the gyro/not crispy fries, the one piece of chicken sitting under a lamp (I would have maybe ordered the fried chicken but that one piece didn&#39;t look very appetizing sitting under the lamp by itself...), and the gyro had too much tomato/ not enough meat to compensate or balance it out. The employee who helped us though was SUPER FRIENDLY, which is always a plus! Thanks for great customer service :)"

G&amp;K is a small space in a broken down shopping center. While it doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside... well... I guess it really doesn&#39;t look like much from the inside either.

This recent visit was on Friday November 21st 2014.  Time was about 18:30hrs ish.  We came in to have Dinner here since we are in the neighborhood.  Thankfully we came in either before and after the Dinner rush.  We managed to get the last booth seating in this tiny establishment that can seat about 10 to 12 people at one go.

They offer Gyros, Kabobs, Hamburgers and Fries to name a few.  YES, you order at the counter.  Pay your order at the counter and they will send the food to where you are seating.

From what I could recall these were the items we ordered from their Simple Menu :

*  2 orders of Super Gyro at ($5.99) each hence it was ($11.98)
*  Cheese Burger ($4.99)
*  Shish Kabob ($8.99)
*  Hot Tea ($0.99)

Our order comes with 2 Fountain Drinks and Fries.  

The service is prompt, though you have to wait a couple of minutes for the food order to be ready since they cooked the Fries to order etc

The Hot Tea, that Hubs opt for is some kind of Milk Tea, a little too diluted for our taste bud.  In terms of value and portion, DEFINITELY GOOD coz portion BIG and reasonable and the price is good.

The Shish Kabob comes with 2 sticks of Kabob meats, rice, 2 slices of Fried Naan Bread, some dipping sauce and some salad of lettuce and tomatoes with added pepper and salt.

Hubs like his order of Cheese Burger.  It comes with Fries too.  The Fries are the kind of &#34;skinny&#34; fries, that we like, though Hubs prefer those &#34;thick&#34; ones.  Overall Hubs rate this establishment with the Gyros he had sums up as 3.5 stars.

Take note, after 19:00hrs ish, some items from the Menu in this establishment ran out.  Hence maybe they cook in small portion on certain orders what nots.  Hence its good to either come early for Dinner or stick to Lunch hours.  I hope by now, they will offer those Fried Chicken Wings or Fried Chicken that they have been advertising.

The staff who handled our transaction, if I am NOT mistaken, his name is Zabihullah.  Left this establishment stuffed at about 19:20hrs ish.  Gyros and Kabobs is opened DAILY, Mondays to Sundays from 10am to 10pm.  Just call to confirm in case they might change their operation hours.

The place is small, 3 booths &amp; a counter with 4 high chairs. It&#39;s not a full service restaurant setup, it&#39;s a sandwich shop / take out type, you order at the counter &amp; sometimes they bring you the food or call you. Plastic plates &amp; plastic forks &amp; spoons.

They have a small menu, 3 types of kabobs, gyro, cheese burger, Philly cheese &amp; they&#39;re adding fried chicken soon. Tried all but the burger &amp; Philly. They&#39;re good, the biggest bang are the kabobs. Gyro was good but thought he was stingy with the meat, for $5.99 came with fries &amp; drink so can&#39;t complain.

Don&#39;t let the middle age Taliban looking dude behind the counter scare you. He looks scary but doesn&#39;t bite. Think he was water boarded a few times &amp; is not quite over it yet. He knows how to cook the food and dose it well. He does speak English &amp; knows what&#39;s up."

I took a star off only because the customer service was a little dry and lacking. They were not rude or anything, just not very outgoing and welcoming either. I have no complaints about the food though. Great fried chicken, crispy outside, perfectly cooked inside. The gyros sandwich was packed with meat and was tasty. Will definitely go back. It is a small place, and they do get packed sometimes, so be prepared to switch your plans from dine in to take out."

The place is cramped and the plumbing was backed up while I was there. The prices are a bit high and I didn&#39;t feel that the portion size of the gyro was anything to be excited about. The fried chicken looked was hit or miss. The pieces fresh out of the fryer were great but the ones that had been sitting longer were a disappointment. While it&#39;s not a bad place, this is not a place to go out of your way for. The uncomfortably small space and inconsistencies bring it down to two stars."

I got the Greek Gyro to go.  When I opened it up at home, I was pleasantly surprised with the size and how well it held up on the drive home.  But what the heck was up with the french fries inside the gyro?

The gentleman handing my order to me even repeated it was a gyro without lettuce and hot sauce and I had high hopes to compare this gyro with what I have been craving. I got home and opened my gyro to find it covered in lettuce and hot sauce along with the ingredients I did want. To say I was disappointed is an understatement!

It was the choice between myself and an old co-worker.

The first visit we had our location wrong, so i was stuck waiting for an extra 45 minutes... Luckily the staff is very friendly and let me sit right where i was! I ordered tea and it came in a cool contraption heated by a tea light! Sweet!

I got drunken noodles that time. It was a ton, ton, ton of food and yup - i ate it all. Definitely could have had 2 meals. IT was a might greasy, but i&#39;m not sure if that was mongolian fire oil or just cooking oil. Not too detrimental and still tasty.

The second visit i tried to get something on slaw, lettuce, cabbage instead of with rice and you would have thought i asked for their second born. So next option - mu-shu park. Not bad, a bit gristly, but only available in the dinner portion.

Still tasty and there is plenty more to try, but not sure when we&#39;ll find ourselves back over there!

I ate her for a business meeting a month ago. Service was horrible and food was disgusting. We barely touched the food because I was scared we would get food poisoning from bad fish. 


We were the only customers in there and our waitress only stopped by to grab our order and drop it off. I had to go up to her even though we were only ones in restaurant to ask for check and pay. Even though service was terrible I tipped $10 on $53.17 as I was a waitress for years and always tip. 

I was doing my expense report today and noticed I didn&#39;t have an itemized receipt, which I need for the report. I called three times asking for it and got a different story each time. The third time a manger yelled at me that I took both copies of the credit card receipt and that  the waitress didn&#39;t get her tip which made no sense as I only have one copy. The manager told me she would not send me a copy of the itemized receipt unless I DROVE over there and gave the waitress a cash tip or charged my credit card again. There was no way i was driving there as I was in California and because it was a company card I couldn&#39;t let her charge it again after the fact. And skirts be honest no restaurant manager in their right mind would ever make such demands. 

I became very angry as it wasn&#39;t my fault they didn&#39;t process the tip to begin with and she was lucky she even got one in the first place. The manager told me no receipt until I did it!!!  WHAT???  She said a lot more things too and I&#39;m floored she would ever talk that way to a customer 

Let&#39;s be clear, tips are earned not demanded....that&#39;s why hey are optional. I have never heard a manager talk like this before and I have worked in restaurants my whole life. And I did tip her and she lost her copy. Here is a pic to prove I did! 


This place is disgusting and unprofessional. It&#39;s actually illegal what she just did. I do not recommend eating here.....EVER!! Oh and both me and my colleague ended up feeling sick that night!!"

This restaurant is kind of in the middle of nowhere so I guess it&#39;s impressive that they even offer sushi... It also seemed rather sketchy too. 

I wish I had Gordon Ramsey&#39;s number because MAN he would have some shit to say about this place, I will be far nicer but I&#39;m not going to sugar coat anything.

- don&#39;t put a server in front of the house if she doesn&#39;t know how to speak English (she was nice though)
- the salmon skin was pathetic and a bit tempura battered... And cold. But in their defense, they never catered to my specific no rice order before
- the eel was absolutely delicious, albeit a bit frozen tasting
- speaking of frozen, since this place is in the middle of nowhere, the sashimi tasted partly frozen due to wanting to maintain their stash without it going bad... Give it another hour to thaw and it&#39;ll be good
- the orange chicken can feed a family of 5, you&#39;ve been warned 
- if you&#39;re looking for a classy dining establishment, don&#39;t come here.

I imagine this is a bit higher quality than truck stop sushi, no one got sick so that&#39;s a huge bonus! 

Why the three stars if I didn&#39;t really approve of this restaurant and its paper table clothes and flimsy napkins (common, with sushi and Chinese food you at least need to invest in higher quality napkins... Sushi is messy) because well, it definitely satisfied my cravings for sushi when I went... 

PS: obviously not pregnant if I chowed down on their sashimi deluxe ($24 for 18 thick slices- which is a great deal)."

The woman who took our order was polite and the food was ready within 15 minutes. We ordered a little bit of everything to test it all: egg rolls, crab cheese wontons, Philadelphia roll, sesame chicken with steamed rice, and Pad Thai.

The sushi tastes really fresh.  We liked that it was light on rice; it really let the fresh ingredients shine through. We also loved the wontons and sesame chicken. 

We didn&#39;t eat in but the dining room looked to be really nice! Would definitely recommend."

I have had the chicken lettuce wraps which were good except that the lettuce was so mangled there was no way to place the filling in it to wrap. I&#39;m a bit disappointed that they thought that was ok to give a customer lettuce wraps that couldn&#39;t be wrapped.

I&#39;ve also had the chicken fried rice which was just ok but had a decent amount of chicken in it. I&#39;m going to give them one more try before forming a permanent impression."

We wanted to have Dinner a few miles away aka Near that Hospital, cannot find free parking, we settled for this establishment.

Maybe we did not see the Memo.  Maybe we went on a wrong date or something.  Sorry people, we did not share the sentiments about this establishments let alone of the glowing reviews.  That recent visit was on Friday January 10th 2014.  Time was about 18:00hrs ish.

Is this a Chinese restaurant that serve Sushi and typical Americanized Asian food of &#34;Chinese Food&#34;, &#34;Thai Food&#34;, &#34;Japanese Food&#34; and &#34;Vietnamese Food&#34;?  I think so.

I ask our lovely server whether they provide : Amaebi and Uni, but unfortunately this establishment do not.  From the conversations she had with the other staffs, the other staffs &#34;tends&#34; to &#34;scold&#34; our lovely server.  I felt bad because of my questions, she was scolded by the Sushi Chef.

From the Menu we decide to order these :

*  Eel Nigiri ($5.00)
*  Kaibashira Nigiri ($4.50)
*  Chicken Green Curry ($9.25)
*  Szechuan Beef ($9.95)
*  Chinese Chow Fun with Shrimp ($9.25)
*  Fountain Coke Cola for Hubs while I opt to have water.

From our observation, there are like 4 other patrons while we were there.

The food came out on a timely manner.  But from there it went down the &#34;drain&#34;.

Yes, the food came out piping hot.  The Szechuan Beef seems greasy, tasted semi-ok.  We specifically request for our food to be SPICY HOT!  The food WAS NOT SPICY HOT at all.  Our server brought out the chili oil which was so rancid, aka &#34;old&#34; hence I left it out from my food.  The Szechuan Beef, comes with silvered carrots, bamboo shoots, tomatoes, onions but it was a little salty for my personal taste bud.  Hubs was OK with it.

The Chinese Chow Fun with Shrimp, is overly greasy.  One dimension and once agin NOT SPICY at all.  It comes with silvered carrots, green onions/scallions, wilted green sprouts.  *ANOTHER BIG SIGH*

The Chicken Green Curry, is overly too sweet for our liking.  EPIC FAIL people!  EPIC FAIL.  Once again major disappointment.  This bowl of Chicken Green Curry, comes with HUGE Chunks of Sweet Potatoes, Some Bell Peppers and HUGE Cuts of Jalapeno.  Hello, who put SWEET Potatoes in Green Curry.  *TRIPLE SIGH*

Now to put MORE &#34;damage to the injury&#34;, my order of Eel Nigiri, though is just meh, the Kaibashira comes with avocado.  The Kaibashira, was &#34;flat&#34;, NOT Spicy and I don&#39;t even taste the Scallops at all.  Not even the SPICY MAYO!  *SIGH* *SAD FACE INDEED*

Sorry Blue Lagoon for this rant.  Nevertheless, we wish you well in your Business venture in this part of Neighborhood.  Furthermore, I think they can succeed since while we were there, ALOT Patrons come in for their Take Out/ TO GO services.

I ordered the Singapore rice noodles with shrimp and fresh spring rolls with shrimp for delivery tonight. I like that Blue Lagoon offers online ordering through their website--it&#39;s easy to use--and though I was told to allow 75 minutes for delivery when I ordered at 6:45pm, I got the order in about half that time. They deliver for free within 3 miles with a $10 minimum order, and (yes, I&#39;m being lazy) I only live about a mile from the place.

The noodles were a little salty for my taste. I&#39;ve never had Singapore noodles anywhere else; so, I don&#39;t have a really good comparison or know how this dish should authentically taste. The shrimp were decent, though, without the tails, which I appreciate, and quite a few of them were in the dish.

I really liked the fresh spring rolls. I do love spring rolls in general, but these had a vinegary sweet taste in some bites that I liked. I think it might have been a fish sauce dressing on the carrots. It wasn&#39;t overwhelming but added a nice dimension to the rolls. The peanut sauce was pretty good, too. It was creamier than other versions I&#39;ve had.

With tip, my meal was under $20 and the delivery driver was nice, too!"

They were colorful and neatly made. It had fresh avocado and some spicy tuna. The Naruta roll has no rice and is on the low carb menu. It comes with a low sodium sauce that&#39;s thinner and blander than soy sauce. 

The rolls were really just okay. There was nothing stupendous about them. They were quite standard in flavor though I do think they are very pretty. 

I do like that this place has free delivery up until 10PM if you live w/in a 5 mile radius of them. This would be perfect for times when you crave sushi but don&#39;t want to venture out into bad weather."

Food was good but service was really slow and not really friendly. Got a sushi roll and some sashimi which wasn&#39;t bad. A little too small of portions for the price. Orange chicken was ok, more peppers and such vs meat ratio then I like. Chicken was a bit soggy and missing the crunch but the flavor was good and peppers were crisp. 

Was hoping to quickly grab some food to go but took a really a long time to be acknowledged, place my order, pay and leave. About an hour for the whole process. You could tell they do a lot more business for delivery, which was supper busy."

They could maybe turn up the music a little.  The silence is a bit much--you know, that kind when you&#39;re afraid to swallow your water and make mouth sounds.

It&#39;s not about glitz and glamor but it is about food. Over all this is a solid restaurant with a lot of good things going on the efficient service is something that I really appreciate. It&#39;s quick and affordable and totally does the trick when you just need some good Asian food.

Here&#39;s the one thing that I didn&#39;t like: the Pad Thai. Talk about super disappointing - WAY too much chicken, way too little noodle. The flavor was ok and just ok. You can tell a lot about a place by their Pad Thai so I figure three stars is appropriate.

I really did like the Lo Mein, the Beef with Broccoli and the basic California Roll. The fact that they used full, fresh crab had a huge impact on the overall taste/flavor and texture of the sushi. I&#39;d like to try out some of the other sushi items next time I come in. The location is good, it&#39;s easy to find but there is very limited parking. 

As mentioned above, the service is quick and always polite. I&#39;ve never had to wait very long for a meal which is good when you are in a rush. It a solid three star restaurant."

However, my dining experince has left me highly disappointed. I called in a to go order consiting of chicken lo mein, sesame chicken, and egg drop soup. It was ready in about 10 minutes which was great. Yet, the fact that there was literally a SINGLE customer eating in the restaurant on a Friday evening should have been enough of a warning; but I decided to give the place a try anyways. Let me start of by saying the lo mein noodles have a very strange consisisity to them, hard to explain but not at all appetizing. While there is a decent amount of chicken included in the dish the rest of the ingredients consist of onions. No carrots, snow peas, broccoli, bamboo or any of the typical veggies included in lo mein dishes. I personally prefer my lo mein to include a variety of vegetables so the fact that it was basically all noodles and slices of different types of onion was off putting. On to the sesame chicken, which included both red and green bell peppers and broccoli (a fact my boyfriend was not pleased about). The chicken was simply terrible, very bland and both the breading and chicken were super soggy. So soggy that when trying to pick it up with chop sticks the pieces just fell apart into a pile of orange mush. Only positive thing I can say is that the egg drop soup was decent, woohoo... $28 down the drain."

After a few days eating hospital food and craving sushi my sister was stoked to locate this place just a few blocks from Children&#39;s. 
It was great! Saturday afternoon- fast courteous service. Clean and nicely decorated. Style in the simple things like lighting and tea service. The sushi was great in texture, flavor and scent (lack if fishy smell I have experienced at other sushi restaurants).

We had yellowtail, clam and salmon nigiri, the mango roll and the red caterpillar roll. LOVED the mango roll &#34;as is&#34;. The red caterpillar is great with a few shaves of ginger.

For those who don&#39;t want to sit down, they seemed to be doing a healthy business of takeout and delivery! Enjoy!"

Nice and convenient!

I went to BL with a coworker and my sister.  We attempted to beat the lunch rush, but everyone poured in right behind us.  And I&#39;m not sure how or why, but we ended up being waited on after many of the people after us.  So if we had been in a hurry, that would have been no bueno.  For the time being, I will chalk that up to the growing pains of opening a new restaurant.

As I said, after being waited on, our appetizers arrived fairly quickly.  My coworker, Ruby, and I had both ordered the spring rolls.  We were anticipating finger food sized portions, but oh no.  These puppies were as big as my hand!  One roll was plenty for one person (see photo!).  My sister, Lisa H, loves crab cheese wantons, so we munched on those as well.  Massive spring roll size notwithstanding, both apps were delicious!

Next up, our entrees!  I&#39;ve been in a seafood type mood lately, so I ordered up some seafood udon.  In the always appropriate words of George Taikei, oh myy, these were some tasty noodles!  The lunch portion was huge!  So much so that I easily had leftovers; score!  And the seafood was (seemingly) fresh and very tasty!  Lisa H opted for sesame chicken, her go-to Chinese food staple.  From all indications (her plate was sparkling), it too hit the spot!  I can&#39;t remember exactly what Ruby ordered, but she too was raving about the awesome food.

Although the service was a bit slow, the food was awesome and certainly deems another visit soon.  Thank you, Blue Lagoon, for setting up shop near the AMC!  We certainly needed a quality Asian bistro to add to the rotation of lunch spots!"

There was hardly any rice on the roll, it was tiny and the roll wasn&#39;t very full with Fish, etc. we also ordered potstickers and she had forgot about them, we had to remind her to bring them out. So they came out after the sushi. How do you forget when we were the only people in the restaurant?

As with anyplace like this, some dishes will be better than others, and I&#39;ve worked through a good number of the noodle dishes so far.  The Hong Kong noodles were probably the best of the bunch.  I do want to try the sushi at some point, maybe in the summer when it&#39;s really hot.  They have the usual lunch specials with rice and egg roll, and you get a good amount of food for your money.

My brother says he&#39;s had worse sushi, but never worse curry. The squid salad was fishy, and even the sake was mediocre at best. I tried to give it a chance after the delivery snafu, but the quality of the food on a Tuesday is beyond excusable.  

If you arent eating sushi or curry its pretty good, but dont waste your money on the sushi. Waitress doesnt do english too good so if you order on the phone or want something specific, good luck."

We ordered from there to try it as we knew they delivered to our area. The service on the phone was incredible! I literally hung up and said &#34;Wow!&#34; I was hoping with how great of customer service they had that the food would be good! It exceeded our expectations. 

The second time I ordered I had the SAME experience. Wonderful people. The delivery driver came and visited with me. I called them back and thanked them for the wonderful service that they have given. It is rare to get exceptional service multiple times in a row. 

I recommend this place completely. Everything that we have tried is amazing!!"

I was expecting much more americanized chinese, and while you&#39;ll definitely find americanized chinese, you can also find some authentic.

I came here for a sushi dinner and loved the rolls and nigiri we ordered. Service was quick and friendly. They even comped us an order of yummy edamame, which was hot and perfectly salted. 

More recently, I came for a quick-ish lunch with a friend. We ordered the sacha chicken and the thai style eggplant. Do not be fooled by the small price (6.95. includes fried rice and a spring roll), because you get big portions. Ok, fine, I ate all my fried rice (a medium sized rice bowl&#39;s worth). My friend and I both agreed that we should have shared ONE serving of the rice. The amt of the entree was quite impressive for the lunch price.

I might have to bump up the stars to 5 after I order in lunch. They&#39;ll deliver to anywhere on the Anschutz Medical Campus. I think there might be a $10 minimum. Look for the lunch specials for sushi! They look like a fantastic deal!"

It is rare that every dish is tasty, but that was the case here.  The Pad Thai was probably the best I&#39;ve ever tasted, great authentic taste!  I do agree with one of the other posters that said the chicken to noodle ratio is off in the Pad Thai...they should include more noodles, but I&#39;m not mad about a lot of chicken.  The sauce and taste of the Pad Thai had a nice sweet spicy balance with the chopped peanuts, I really enjoyed it.  One of my favorite dishes is Honey walnut shrimp, but this is the first place in Denver that has nailed it!  A very light breading and generous with the walnuts and sauce.  I haven&#39;t seen it served with the orange slices before and that gives a great taste when you get a little juice mixed in with the sauce.  I also took a chance and ordered sushi...it was fresh and flavorful!  I ordered the Fantastic roll, because with a name like that, how can you not?!  Spicy crab, eel &amp; avocado topped with lobster salad &amp; fish egg and it was great.  Also tried the steamed dumpling appetizer and they definitely taste homemade, with a great soy ginger sauce.  

This was all sooo good and it was delivery!!  What a treat to find somewhere that delivers with this quality of food.  Nice and hot ... my house is hard to find, but the food was still piping hot when it arrived.  Overall, thrilled with the meal and can&#39;t wait to try other things on the menu!"

I placed my order at 6:30pm and did not receive my dinner until 8:00pm. The pad Thai had a weird flavor. I unfortunately could not finish it because the flavor was so far from being classic peanut pad Thai. It was also made with fettuccini noodles instead of the classic egg noodle. The hot and sour soup was way to sour and the fact that I had to heat my food up in the microwave before eating it did not make me happy. After spending $13 for one person and being totally let down made it so I will never order from this place again.

I was promptly greeted and seated.  They have a maki roll lunch special, $11 for three rolls.  Sounded good to me.  I ordered a shrimp and asparagus roll, tuna and avocado roll and a Philadelphia roll. Since we were in the middle of the &#34;rain storm of the century&#34;, there was only one other couple in the restaurant and service was fast.  I was served a small bowl of miso soup that came with the lunch special.  It was pretty good. My sushi came in less than 10 minutes.  They had several sushi chefs on staff (I think this close to the Anschutz Medical Campus, they get super busy at lunchtime normally as they deliver.  Anyhow, The sushi had very ample amounts of fish/shrimp but like another local sushi restaurant, was very skimpy on the rice.  Now, I prefer small maki rolls as opposed to ones I need a knife and fork to eat (some other local places), but, there were parts of these rolls where the rice was only one grain thick on the outside of the seaweed and in places, you could see the seaweed, uncovered with rice on the outside of the roll.  I know sushi rice is expensive but I don&#39;t think they were honestly trying to skimp based on the amount of tuna and salmon they used.  The rolls were also strangely oblong in shape.  This all being said, the sushi tasted good and was really a good value.  I will return, but I&#39;d like their sushi chefs to look at a picture to see what maki rolls are supposed to look like. :-)"

Both were delicious and each gave us enough for another meal or two. I also got an order of the potstickers for another $6 and they were amazing.

My husband always gets the Howie Maui with Garlic Herb Crust that he really enjoys. As you can imagine this can make for quite an expensive trip with us both ordering our own pizzas.... but being that we don&#39;t like the same toppings or even same kind of crust it is a necessary evil. There are couple of things worth mentioning that can greatly affect your satisfaction from my experience. 

First I should mention we aren&#39;t in the delivery area so I always have to stop in and pick it up. Because of this I always put my order in online ahead of time. Howie&#39;s pizza really should be eaten immediately, because while some people might enjoy cold pizza I don&#39;t think any of the pizzas we have ordered are any good cold. Don&#39;t bother trying to put this pizza in the oven to keep it warm, it will dry out and get really gross. Also, this pizza the second day is really not stellar, particularly the deep dish is pretty spongy/floppy. 

I have not tried any of the Calzones yet, that might be a good option for us some time. My co-worker tried Howie&#39;s and he and couldn&#39;t disagree more that this place is worth a second visit. I have to say if I had judged it on the one time I ordered a regular crust pizza with Garlic Herb flavoring I would not have been impressed enough to go out of my way to go back. Fortunately for Howie&#39;s, as I mentioned I am hopelessly addicted to that Deep Dish Meat Eaters!"

Unless I&#39;m really blown away by the food, it will likely be my last. After 20 minutes in the lobby - when I was told &#34;15 minutes&#34; for my food to be ready, I was reading the reviews on Yelp about delays when my cashier called my name and said &#34;your pizza was made wrong, we&#39;re making a new one for you now.&#34; Not a good first impression. So far I&#39;ve been waiting 30 minutes and I&#39;ve just been updated that &#34;your pizza is almost up.&#34; I&#39;ll update my review if the pizza, breadsticks, and salad warrant an update. Whenever I get my food that is. There&#39;s too much pizza competition around to mess around with a new place if I&#39;m not completely satisfied. 

Guys, you only get ONE CHANCE to make a first impression. Two stars.
UPDATE: the pizza was pretty good, the salad was average. I&#39;m giving three stars."

Flavored crust will make you wonder if going back to flavorless crust is even an option. Cajun crust will add the right zing to any type of pie.

The pizza crust options are pretty good, I really couldn&#39;t tell a big difference between the Asiago and butter variety but nonetheless, thin crust was crispy and cooked well.

We also got the Howie bread, good but not something I&#39;d get every time.  

Hot wings were ok, they have a good kick and are more chile hot than expected.  Will try another flavor next time.

Delivery guy was fine and food was in good shape when it got here.

Glad to have another pizza option out here now, papa johns is getting old an Marcos, while good, is a little steep."

I went to this pizza shop based on an email I got pitching a new pizza place that was a must try. I thought, yeah, I&#39;ll give it a go. When I got there I had a bit of an &#34;uh-oh&#34; moment as the places looks a whole lot like Little Caesar&#39;s. Consider me a little concerned. Ok, a lot concerned. I went and ordered and was told that my pizza would be ready in 15 minutes. Ok, off I went to the gas station in the same area. Then I read the reviews about how people had to get refunds, there were massive delays, etc, etc. another &#34;uh-oh&#34; moment. 

About 10 minutes after I placed my order, I got back and sat down on the bench. My name was immediately called and my food was ready to go. 

I took it home, now concerned that I had Little Caesar&#39;s pizza waiting for me. I tried a piece and it was pretty good. Not amazing, but good! Definitely a good place to get a pizza from for something simple and average. I got the Asiago flavor on the crust, which has a good flavor, but isn&#39;t very bold. Because this place isn&#39;t close to home, I probably won&#39;t go out of my way to go again. If I happened to be near it, I may consider it."

And everytime he was in town, he&#39;d ALWAYS order HH for dinner.  So when we saw one had opened not too far from our house, he was excited.  I read the prior reviews on awful wait times and we decided to wait awhile before going to see how things stacked up.

We called in our order for pickup and our order was hot and ready when we arrived.  No wait, no delay.  That was unfortunately, the only plus.

I ordered a thin crust cheese pizza and the crust was like soft cardboard.  Very bland and disappointing.  Reminded me of the pizza parents are forced to eat while at a Chuck E Cheese birthday party.  My husband ordered an original crust BBQ something or other and it was not good. One slice in he decided it wasn&#39;t edible and tossed it to the dog.

Since I couldn&#39;t get past half a slice of my thin crust cheese, I had high hopes for the Howie Bread that we also got.  Hopes were dashed when I bit into fluffy, garlic flavored cardboard.  I now have a box of Howie Bread and almost two full pizzas in the trash... biggest waste of $26 ever.  Will not be coming back and will not recommend to others.  Oof.  Epic pizza fail."

So I decided to stop in at Hungry Howie&#39;s, there&#39;s only one here in Colorado as far as I know. I&#39;d never had Hungry Howie&#39;s and I&#39;m no pizza aficionado but I know what I like and I now like Hungry Howie&#39;s.

I had the small Howie Works with the Asiago Cheese crust. I was going to bring it home but thought I&#39;d try just one slice before I got to the car. Well one turned into two and two into three and before I knew it I was sitting on a bench outside the store devouring the whole thing.

I didn&#39;t know what to expect as I said I&#39;d never had it before, as it turns out, It was 8&#34; of flat out goodness. The crust, I don&#39;t really know how to describe the crust, it&#39;s like no other I&#39;ve had. It was flavorful, crunchy and tender at the same time, the perfect bed for the toppings.

The toppings were fresh and plentiful and the cheese oh the cheese, it had to be the best mozzarella I&#39;ve ever had (the works comes with extra cheese).

I&#39;m starting to sound like a food critic which I&#39;m not. Suffice it to say I have a new favorite pizza and I&#39;ll be visiting Hungry Howie&#39;s often."

I think the thing that bothers me most, and why I&#39;m writing the review hoping they see this, is that they were not honest at all when everything started crashing and burning. I placed my order at 5:42 online, paid, and received a quote time of 20 mins. I took my kids out with me and walked into a tiny waiting room crammed with at least 20 people. Uh oh. Bad sign. When it was my turn, I gave the girl my name. She walked to the back and came back saying it would only be about 8 minutes and they&#39;d call my name. No biggie. I waited for 35 more minutes (on top of the quoted 20) watching person after person get the run around and refund after refund be given. Eventually, I got up to check. I didn&#39;t need for it be ready right then, I just needed an honest answer that it was getting worked on and it WOULD be ready. The lady apologized and said they were getting kinks worked out. Fine. No big deal. I just wanted to know she saw my order and it was getting worked on. She eventually walked back after I pressed for a real answer instead of their generic response and said it would be 12 more minutes. When I pressed further to ensure she saw my order going, a manager (??? Maybe owner) stepped in and mentioned the ovens were down. I&#39;m not sure that was true as the kitchen was still going in chaos, not at a standstill. I think he came up with a lie and in hopes to refund and clear people out to start fresh. I&#39;m an understanding person when I see things like being totally overwhelmed with business. I&#39;ve had years of serving/bar tending experience, but you&#39;re just going to make people mad by lying. theres no way those two people actually saw my order when they went back to &#34;check&#34; on it and quote a time. That&#39;s where the big problem lies. Unfortunately, it was never resolved. I&#39;ll give it a month and check out reviews again before I waste my time, even with the free pizza coupon the manager gave me in addition to the refund."

And then I was pleasantly surprised. I see a bunch of reviews harshin&#39; on the RT. I will just say that, if a review has one sentence, it&#39;s not really a review.

Now, our visit. We were seated promptly and greeted promptly. I noticed a Happy Hour sign on the way in for $2 domestic drafts. Once we were at the table, and asked about it, we were told it is only in the bar. Duly noted. (Next time RT, next time.) Speaking of draft beers, our server did not know them and had to go ask. Maybe she is new to Colorado. Maybe suburbia doesn&#39;t partake of beer? Either way, we ended up finding an IPA and my stand-by, Blue Moon. Beers came in frosty mugs, but server forgot coasters. Shrug.

Now, the burger menu is that to rival Red Robin. At first, I was happy about the avocado bacon turkey burger thing. THEN I saw the gourmet burgers! I ended up with a Spicy Jalapeno Pretzel Bun Burger (tm) (not the official name). My fellow diner ended up getting the turkey burger I originally wanted, which had fresh avocado and was very delicious, but....BUT...myyyy burger was amazing. AMAZING. Fresh breaded fried jalapeno strips, gooey pepper cheese, chipotle aioli, and a pretzel bun (plus lettuce and tomato). I&#39;m going back for that thing soon.

Oh, and something new! Free garlic biscuits! You know those awesome Cheddar Bay biscuits at Red Lobster? Like those!

So, near the highway, lots of parking, cozy atmosphere. Will go back, during happy hour, in the bar, and order another fancy pretzel bun burger."

What I fail to understand is why Ruby Tuesday advertises their delicious biscuits, and when you ask for them, they bring you one per person.  And, they&#39;re very small.  So, if you&#39;re a party of two, you get two tiny biscuits delivered to your table.  When you request more, you get the same thing--one per person.  For the prices charged, I think they could be more generous with their biscuits.  Continually asking for more sucks the fun out of the dining experience."

When I asked her where the beets are she proceeded to tell me that they focus on fresh veggies, beets arent included.  
This made me think about why I wasnt getting a fresh taste, and have decided tjhat if the veggies are fresh then it must be the mediocre ranch salad dressing."

We were stuck in pretty bad traffic at the time and decided to pull off and grab a bite to eat.  We sat at the bar immediately on a Friday night - we were pretty lucky.

It took the bartender a good 5-8 minutes to acknowledge us and provide drinks and menus, not exactly a great start.  On this cold night we were both feeling the Lobster Mac and Cheese, $11-$12 by the way.  It arrived pretty timely and I will say we were both pretty disappointed in the serving size.  I thought they made a mistake with such a small portion.  It was good, not great and certainly not worth the price.

Overall, I&#39;d say the place is normally a three star, but after tonight I am dropping that to two.

While the salad bar continues to be excellent and a favorite, the service tonight was pretty terrible.

1. Server smelled terribly of cigarette smoke.
2. Server was confused by most of everything we ordered and had to look at the menu with us.
3. Server seemed shocked when I asked to substitute extra mushrooms in my pasta dish instead of chicken and even tried to talk me out of it.
4.Two servers loudly cleaned the section we were in while we ate, despite us arriving an hour and a half before closing. As the server swept under our table he said &#34;Sorry guys.&#34;, which tells me he knew it was a bad idea. He even hit my foot under the table with the broom as he swept up crumbs from the carpet.

If you read my other reviews, you know I&#39;m forgiving of these sorts of things, but all together in one night was just too much. My guess is he is new and under trained, but that&#39;s not my fault. I tipped him above average because I felt sorry for him as he seemed to be struggling and I remember that feeling when I was new to being a server back in the day.

The two pasta entrees we had were alright, the salad bar was great as always. I&#39;ll try it again someday, but overall I was very disappointed."

There are very few vegetarian options on the menu.  Our waitress suggested we order side dishes!  We were sat at the first table and it was freezing in the draft.  Our waitress and the manager did not help us find the special coupon (we had left at home) on our SmartPhone.  If only we could find a good salad bar that didn&#39;t have pork incorporated into almost every part of it!!!  I guess if you are a carnivore who likes Louisiana-style food, this is the place for you.  It&#39;s not the place for us!"

We tried the Ranch, Thousand Island and the French and it was the same with all.  One of the guests had the chicken noodle soup and gave me a taste after saying &#34;this has some kind of weird spice&#34;.  We could not identify what it was but it was weird.  Not the traditional comfort food that we all love.  I had the Gumbo.  I have never seen a Gumbo with a brown grave base.  This too was not traditional.  I picked out the sausage, shrimp and left the rest.  The waiter asked what he could do to make it better and I said, &#34;Nothing.  The food is what it is and you can&#39;t change the recipes&#34;.  My other half got sick and we know it was the food.  We told a gal at out club about the experience and she said, &#34;Oh dear, we crossed that place off our list a long time ago&#39;."

My Smokehouse burger ($8.99 with fries) was good. But there was less than one strip of bacon on it. And the &#34;onion straws&#34; were nowhere to be found, although I did see a couple of soggy, brown things (which I promptly removed). The fries were also good, and I liked how they brought individual ramekins of catsup on each platter.

Next time I would order a basic cheeseburger instead. Overall,  though, I prefer the more casual atmosphere, delish food, and lower prices at smashburger."

Well its alright as in no wait to get in cool. Next is the menu seemed a little bland with the usual appetizers that you find at every other place like this ie applebees, chilis, etc. The food was ok nothing spectacular and nothing I would go out of my way for. I got the fried shrimp as a side which was 5 bucks I thought I would get alot of food for that but I got about a dozen oh joy I wouldnt want to see what the small size was.

Apparently they had been hit by some after-graduation traffic that sent them into a tail-spin.  The dining room was dirty and the wait was long.  I ordered salad bar and sliders.  The salad bar was out of lettuce (of all things) and somehow all of the ingredients tasted the same?  Really bland.  The sliders were good, but the fries were too salty and cold.  I ask for new ones but got the same ones back, greasy but heated in the microwave.  Yuck.  I usually don&#39;t like this type of all-purpose food, now I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t."

So we asked to be moved to a table and promptly were. The salad bar is good with a nice selection of options and everything including the plates is ice cold. They have an extensive menu! Most of us got one variety of their sliders which were quite good. Drinks were consistantly and promptly refilled. All in all a good experience.

Day 68 &#34;DUSA Tour&#34; 2016 (Discover USA Tour)  starts with breakfast at a long time &#34;Run-A-Way Bill&#34; Favorite eatery ... the &#34;Butcher Block Cafe&#34; 

Owner operated by sociable Manny &amp; Nancy, I would NEVER consider a trip to Denver complete with multiple stops at the &#34;Butcher Block Cafe&#34; on 38th Street ...

A &#34;diner&#34; in the true fashion ... counter seating (a &#34;Run-A-Way Bill&#34; must) for 13, 5 really unique booths for 2, plus several booths for 4, and table seating fir the table sitting crowd ...

No eatery across the lower 48 states has biscuits and gravy fir $2 ... get a half-order for  $1.50 ...  a super-riffic deal!

Now, the people working here are a pleasure. Earnestly cheerful and helpful. But the food is not good. Bacon and eggs that have so much residue of other breakfast foods clinging to them, it feels like a greasy skillet made from every single thing they have in the fridge. Scrape the grill please.

Also, the place doesn&#39;t feel that clean (sticky tables, flatware dotted with odd specks, ceiling tiles with stains). Yes, it&#39;s a greasy spoon, and we all love a restaurant that feels like a real place, but keep the grimy goodness for the exterior."

I had a cinnamon roll, coffee, and the &#34;roundhouse&#34; which is composed of eggs, sausage, bacon, and hash browns smothered in green chili. Green chili had just enough spice to it for me and the cinnamon rolls were soft and buttery. 

We were greeted warmly and told to seat ourselves. The waitresses were attentive and refilled my coffee frequently so I was never left with an empty cup. The food came very quickly, and it really seemed like everyone working there loved being there. As the cooks and waitresses bantered and laughed, it put a smile on my face and made breakfast even more worthwhile."

We&#39;d have never found it if it weren&#39;t for Yelp because it&#39;s tucked away in a little industrial area.

The waitress was really friendly and gave us suggestions on the menu. We both went with breakfast and split a cinnamon roll. The roll came up first and was so tasty. It had a slight crispness to it and the cinnamon butter on top was divine.

Breakfast was exactly as we asked for it and delicious. The bill was cheap (something like 15 bucks total). I&#39;d definitely stop in next time I&#39;m in Denver and want a basic breakfast."

It&#39;s been The Butcher Block for quite some time, but still has the same feel as Bud&#39;s.

I no longer live in Denver, but if I&#39;m ever in the area of this place I try to stop in for breakfast or lunch. It&#39;s a must try if you love eating in diners. This is on my tip-top list of my favorite diners.

If you go, you must have one of their famous home made cinnamon rolls. They are the best of the best. $2.50, and well worth the price. They are huge!

See my pics. You&#39;ll see they have a great selection of breakfast items, along with lunch items.

This place is very small and no frills. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of &#34;Texas Chili&#34;. My grilled cheese was very basic white bread with American cheese and came with chips. The chili lacked flavor and substance and was probably out of a can. My husband had the chicken-fried steak and french fries. This is more of a greasy spoon Diner than anything else, the food was just okay. What made the entire visit worthwhile was their homemade cinnamon bun. If everything in the restaurant was as amazing as the cinnamon bun the place would be famous. We snacked on it for 2 days and enjoyed every bite."

For an app we ordered the cinnamon roll. I love that they come out with a glob of salted butter on top. We could have used a touch more! Hey, if you&#39;re going to have a cinnamon roll, you might as well really indulge. The cinnamon roll was decadent and gooey cinnamon delicious. 

For the main, I went with the green chili and cheese omelet with hash browns no toast. I like my omelet smothered in green chili and this one had the chili rolled up in the middle. Next time I&#39;ll ask for it on top. The hubs went with the breakfast burrito. Both of us really enjoyed our meals and quick, friendly service."

The service is super friendly, and decently attentive.  Our coffee and water were never empty, and we didn&#39;t have to wait long for our orders.

My wife and I split a cinnamon roll, and then I had the breakfast burrito and she had some kind of egg sandwich with hash browns (she didn&#39;t seem impressed).  The cinnamon roll was certainly enjoyable, but it wasn&#39;t good by cinnamon roll standards.  It was sweet, but too chewy. 

The breakfast burrito.... I added sausage to mine (because why would anyone who eats meat have a breakfast burrito without one??), and I was a little surprised when the server asked me &#34;patties or links?&#34;  In a breakfast burrito?  Patties it was.  The burrito was smothered in green chili which was much better than it looked.  Although I&#39;ve certainly had better, the burrito was good.

Also, in true diner style, the tab was painless.  Two meals, a cinnamon roll, and the tip cost us $20.  If you&#39;re looking for something quick, cheap, and decent then the Butcher Block is it- especially if you&#39;re in the area anyway.  If you&#39;re looking for something extraordinary, or something worth driving across town, look elsewhere."

The cafe is very much a diner, which the pictures reflect. Plenty of seating, you can choose the counter, a booth by the window, miniature booth in the middle of the floor, or a table in the back room. At the moment we walked in, only the mini booths were open (if that tells you anything). 

Our server was very sweet, and in fact moved us to a bigger window booth when it became available! The cinnamon roll was pretty good, not quite the best though. The actual breakfast food we ordered was really decent, especially considering the price!

I got the blt, and a cup of coffee and had to try the cinnamon roll. The butter really made it, but honestly i don&#39;t need that much sugar, dough and butter!

Located near Downtown Denver, Butcher Block Cafe is a decades-old family affair. Most noted for their smothered burritos and homemade cinnamon rolls, this mediocre eatery also serves up old school diner classics, like BLT sandwiches and chicken fried steaks.

Internet hype brought me to Butcher Block Cafe; unfortunately, the food fell well short of the hoopla.  My dining partner had the Smothered Breakfast Burrito.  In very unworldly terms, she described it as an undercooked mass with puke on top.  I submitted a picture to Yelp, so you can judge for yourself.  I decided on the Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  It was perhaps the most pathetic chicken sandwich I have ever come across.  To say that it was tiny would be an understatement.  Furthermore, the chicken was rubbery in texture and insulting to the palate.  It was awful!!

Sit at the &#34;bar area&#34; or among the many booths.  I sat at the counter.  The menu has lots of choices and is quite cheap.  In fact, my meal was one of the cheaper meals I had consumed- also leaving in a food coma.

I got what seemed to be the most unhealthy thing on the menu (see pic).  I doused in it hot sauce, and ate away.  I was stuffed when I was done, with nothing left on the plate.  I saw they had legendary cinnamon rolls. but that would have been beyond gluttonous, IMO.

I said goodbye to the ladies and the cook, and was on my way- I told them I would love to be a regular.  However, a few minutes after I left I felt my chest tighten- in a way that if I ate here on a regular basis I would have easily have left on a stretcher.

This food is wonderful but not for the faint of heart.  If I could only eat here on the regular..."

Super cheap and fast.  It&#39;s a no frills kind of place, open for breakfast, lunch and dinner (serving breakfast all day), diner feel, with plenty of coffee refills :)  I get an omelette or the breakfast burrito, which always fills me up to the brim!  Also, as everyone else mentions on here the cinnamon rolls are to die!  I usually get one for the road because I can never finish it there.  I like ordering biscuits and gravy for the table just so I can have a few bites.  And for $2, you really can&#39;t go wrong.  There&#39;s not a many places like this in Denver and so this spot is a refreshing change of pace from the upscale/trendy dining world."

Juicy and big, with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. The fries were super crispy! But the star of the show was the cinnamon roll we had for dessert. It was so, so good.

We were looking for a place to stop for lunch on our way to skiing and based on the 4 1/2 stars, we expected delicious homecooked food and large portions with friendly service at a good price.  Decor doesn&#39;t matter since it&#39;s not always related to food quality.

We did get the friendly service in a hole-in-the-wall setting and cheap prices, but the food was sorely lacking.  My chili was a gooey mess out of a can and my friend&#39;s fish sandwich came on a store bought hamburger bun with one (!) thin fish stick that didn&#39;t occupy half the bun.  Another friend&#39;s french toast platter looked like a slice of white bread covered in egg batter with a sad folded egg and two strips of bacon (see photo).  

We were all puzzled about the ratings and how a diner like this can survive in an industrial area where the workers must be demanding about quality and portions.

One additional star for friendly service but that&#39;s the only positive about this place.  For a true homecooked cafe experience check out Main Street Restaurant in Idaho Springs on the way to the mountains."

I&#39;m from Wisconsin and this place just felt like home. Attentive servers, quick service, and diner grub. Surrounded by clocks on the wall that my mom still has in her kitchen, Butcher Block&#39;s got it all. 

We ordered a cinnamon roll and Sue brought us two because they were &#34;small that day.&#34; So good. Get the butter. Regret nothing. 

I had a cheese omelette and my partner had a breakfast burrito smothered in country gravy. This is not the type of place to whip out a phone, so no photos were taken. The other patrons were all clones of my stepdad - hard-working folks who get the pleasure of watching Brighton Blvd change into a hipster haven right before their eyes!

There were small negatives, one I can&#39;t fault them for: we chose the back room and the loudest table of four young hipsters came in shouting instead of talking. If you&#39;re looking for a place for the sound to drown, sit in the front. The back has lower ceilings and the sound travels quickly. The outer was the very wet bathroom floor. Kinda gross but also not unexpected for a diner. Don&#39;t wear sandals and you&#39;ll be a-okay. 

Less than $20 to fill our tummies after a night of drinking is kind of living the dream. Check this place out but be sure to read the room - if you wouldn&#39;t scream-talk at your uncle&#39;s poker game, don&#39;t do it at his day-after breakfast experience."

This place is an eclectic version of Waffle House.  Eclectic in the sense that they have a little thrift area up front.  

The food is good and the pricing is economical.  The staff very attentive and friendly.

The only question I have is about the eggs.  If they are not doing so already they should get into farm fresh eggs...my stomach can tell.

The burrito is smothered in delicious mild green chili and you have the standard choices of ham, bacon or sausage  to choose from. Secondly, the homemade cinnamon rolls ($2.50 each) are crazy &#34;melt in your mouth&#34; good. 

There are two seating areas (front diner and back room). It appeared that the regulars congregated in the back room, which on this cold morning was also a bit warmer than the front diner section. Because of the simple good food and amazing prices I give this odd little joint 4 stars."

Although this is not my go-to location for breakfast it was a quick jaunt away from my work downtown and conveniently close to the Western Complex so we decided to give it a go. 

The facade is anything but impressive and to be honest I wasn&#39;t expecting anything special. I had a standard breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese and hash) smothered with green chile. It was $3 and the full size of my plate ... Quite generous considering the cost. AND it was so stinkin delicious! Like, so so so very delicious. We both moped our plates clean with nary a complaint. 

The service was exceptional in every way. My coffee was never more than half empty. Everyone was quite pleasant. People who weren&#39;t our server came to our table to check in and make sure everything was ok. 

So really, who cares if the outside of a building is not updated? We will certainly be visiting again, this time hopefully reining in a bit so we can leave room for a cinnamon roll."

This places checks all of these &#34;must have&#34; boxes for me:
*Must be a diner, preferably off the beaten path a bit.
*Old &amp; established.
*Must serve hash browns a little on the greasy side.
*Green Chili is a must!(How else am I going to smother my massive plate of eggs and hash browns in delicious goodness) 
*Sausage Gravy
*Big doughy cinnamon rolls.
*A bar with stools and pleather booths for seating.
*Offer daily specials.
*Enjoy an eclectic mix of regulars.

Top marks for this delicious treasure.  PS, decor could use a deep clean and a few repairs but that is part of the charm of an old diner!"

The kind I have no plans to patronize again, and the kind that I&#39;m looking forward to trying another time.  This place falls squarely in the latter category.  While our meal there was decent, but not much more, the potential, as well as the other menu items, will draw us back again.  And likely again after that.

To begin, the staff we dealt with were very pleasant.  We arrived about 45 minutes before closing on a Sunday, and received not one whiff of annoyance that we were impinging on their getting out of there.  Our young female waitress was excellent, and I mean excellent.  She knew exactly what she was doing, and had exactly the right demeanor.  That young lady is going places, I hope.  Smart and capable.

The food on average was solidly 3 star.  I ordered the Block Buster Burger with Cheese.  The patty itself was one of those loose, hand-formed patties, kind of misshapen and sloppy, that are so good.  The edges faintly caramelized.  The lettuce, tomato, and onion were all decent.  As for the cheese, it was pointless.  I had ordered cheddar, and the cook had put a small quantity of very finely grated cheese on the patty.  When it melted, it was almost non-existent.  Couldn&#39;t taste it, nor perceive the texture.  Definitely not worth the extra $.75.  The accompanying fries were cold.  Don&#39;t like cold fries :-(

Sweetie ordered the hot hamburger plate, which consisted of a small patty, a little scoop of mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and two slices of white bread.  Eh.  We were expecting one of those typical diner plates, with a big mess of taters and gravy.  Nope.  Little scoop of taters, the size of a traditional little ice cream scoop.  And the taters were instant.  The hamburger patty was okay, while the brown gravy was quite tasty.  As for the bread?  The standard Wonder-type.  This is the kind of dish that Sweetie absolutely adores, but he wouldn&#39;t order it here again.  He also ordered a side of fries, and they, like mine, were cold.  Usually would have asked for fresh fries, but didn&#39;t since the place was near closing time.

As always, when necessary, I give a shout out to you snobs.  You won&#39;t like this place!!  First, it is in a sketchy, industrial, weird part of town.  Second, it is truly a dive.  Not an art-directed faux dive.  A real dive.  Stay away!  We don&#39;t want to hear your grumbling and complaining.

As for the rest of you, this place is good fun.  You can purchase odd thrift-shop items that sit there on old shelving.  A harvest gold cookie jar shaped like a bulldog?  Yup, yours for just a few dollars.  An old hubcap from a random vehicle?  Take it home for 75 cents.  Uh-huh.  That&#39;s right.  Have your morning breakfast while purchasing an oddity.

As mentioned at the beginning, though our first meal here had its highs and lows, we definitely will return.  Can&#39;t wait to try some of the other menu items."

Why 4 stars? Quick service equals not cooking my hash right. 2 bites were somewhat cold. Don&#39;t let this bother you. This location are professional, everything is covered even the syrup for the toast was warm.

i decided to go light and order the chicken fried steak (no eggs, there was no way i could have eaten two eggs, toast, bacon, hashbrowns *and* a CFS!), which was exceptional, and definitely the best i&#39;ve ever had -- AND I&#39;M FROM TEXAS. fiance had bacon cheeseburger and it also was delish; he was a big fan. the service was amazing, as was pretty much all service we received in Colorado.

we ordered a cinnamon roll to go, which you should definitely do if you&#39;re too full to eat it on location. unless you&#39;re diabetic, i assure you, you will not regret it. they ain&#39;t lying when they say they&#39;re good."

You can sit at the counter bar and watch your breakfast being made or grab a table in you prefer. Either way, the waitresses there are super friendly and quick to refill your coffee, two awesome things in my book.

Two other pro tips: they serve lots of items in half orders (even the cinnamon rolls) and they are more than happy to smother your burritos or breakfast in green chile."

Their pies are not housemade.

Decor: The outside looks like it&#39;s a worn down divey joint. It&#39;s got that old school diner feel in the inside. Lots of old memorabilia for sale around the place. 

Food: I ordered a half order of the cinnamon roll with butter. Delicious and hit the spot as I waited for my main portion, the special breakfast burrito. The burrito was HUGE. Fluffy eggs and gooey cheese. I ordered mine with ham and was pleasantly surprised to see it was chopped up ham from the bone, and not deli ham. A good hearty meal.

The service: And this is how this place won the extra star and a half. The folks here are extremely friendly. Cheryl the counter waitress was fast and friendly with my order.

my first time to the butcher block, and it seems like every other customer in here is a regular. the incredibly welcoming staff made me feel like i had been coming here for years. apparently during the week the kitchen has to shut down breakfast service to accommodate it&#39;s lunch crowd. luckily i came in after the bulk of the lunch rush - after some prodding from two of the waitresses the owner/cook agree to make my breakfast order, provided i swear allegiance to the broncos. 

this being my first time to denver, i ordered the omelette named after the city. i&#39;m finishing the last couple bites of my late breakfast as i type this, fully satisfied and ready to hit the road.

Oasis Grill was serving flavors from the Pacific all weekend long at the Hawaiian Asian Festival in the heart of Boulder. They were the only ones on Pearl that were actually serving authentic island plates, main stream, but authentic nonetheless. They were also cooking for a cause since some of the proceeds were being raised for a family affected by the Aurora theater shooting.

The food. Their chicken was perfectly cooked. Tender and juicy which is awesome ans served with a bed of steamy rice. The sauce was sweet and not drenched. I could have eaten three plates of this. As for the musubi, it was okay. I know they were pre-made so I won&#39;t really knock them for that. Overall, I think their booth was a complete hit and the most popular of the bunch. 

The owners were there to cook and serve. They were nice and even took some time to talk to us. Fellow islanders always find a way to bond.

It&#39;s a great place to watch the World Cup and an even better place to eat some local kine Hawaii grinds.  The atmosphere is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.  

We ordered the kalbi plate and kalua pig w/cabbage plate.  It came out plate lunch style with two scoops rice and a scoop of mac salad.  The mac salad was more homemade style, like how tutu used to make.  I enjoyed the kalbi, it wasn&#39;t overly sweet and had the right amount of fat on it.  However, the winner at this place is the kalua pig.  Perfectly seasoned, moist but not watery, it&#39;s the best kalua pig I&#39;ve had in years!

The two cooks who run the kitchen are both from Kailua and have been in Colorado less than 3 mos.  They are friendly and funny.  If they  find out you&#39;re from Hawaii as well, you pretty much get introduced to the whole bar.  I felt as if I was back home on Oahu.

After my boyfriend brilliantly suggested going to just wing it and have a nice dinner downtown, without a reservation, at 7 p.m., on Valentine&#39;s Day, as much as any other girls who like being pampered and have their bf take them out to a nice dinner.... I told him he&#39;s crazy.  

Instead I came to yelp in hopes to find some not so fancy place, close to home, but with decent food.  Fancy dinner postponed.  So imagine my happiness when I landed on this place.  Good food reviews, not too far, have seats opened.  Jackpot.

When we went there last Monday, their Hawaiian kitchen was closed, so we ended up ordering their $6 steak.  Yes, $6.  2 small pieces of sirloin (I think, about 1/2 lb?!) on top crunchy toasted french bread, 4 pieces of shrimp scampi, side of green beans, fries (they ran out of baked potatoes), AND a cup cake with a plastic ring.  That, all that, for $6.  I mean, how much does a happy meal cost at Micky D?!  The food was good, so I got over my disappointment of not getting my Hawaiian food fix that day.  

While I was waiting for my food, I asked about the Hawaiian food, and the waitress called Kalani, one of the cooks and owner of the kitchen, to come to talk to us instead.  We ordered a lb of ahi poke to be picked up this Sunday, which brings us to today.  

Instead of going there for dinner, we decided to do a late lunch instead.  &#34;They&#39;re doing Hawaiian BBQ outside in the parking lot&#34; we were told when we called to ask if they&#39;re opened yet.  When we drove up, this reminds me of the Foodland steak plate BBQ in Hawaii Kai back on Oahu.  All they had for today was huli huli chicken rice plate, and grilled oysters.  So again, while we were waiting for the food, we chatted, asking if they do this every Sunday.  Turns out, listen to this... TODAY IS THEIR LAST DAY THERE!!!!!!  What?!?! I finally found a place I like and they&#39;re leaving?!?!?!  For the next 45 minutes, my bf and I ate in sadness, and every bite of the food and ahi poke just reminds us of the love (for their food) that died so young.  I haven&#39;t even had the chance to try the kalbi yet!!!

So about the bar...

- service is slow, small place, staff is ok.
- I like how the music isn&#39;t so loud that you can&#39;t hear yourself think
- 2 pool tables, and I think the people that play there are pretty serious players.  We enjoyed watching people play while we ate.
- Food, not sure about how their food future is.... like I said, Hawaiian kitchen is now CLOSED!!!!

Without the Hawaiian kitchen, I probably won&#39;t go anymore... Good luck Oasis Grill..."

Poor service. Mediocre Caesar salad with some sand in the lettuce. Bread is dry and ordinary, and even costs extra. When I asked for ground pepper, you guessed it, she brings a diner style pepper shaker. Despite asking for meat sauce, I end up with watery, canned quality red sauce.  No half portions unless you succumb to a child&#39;s spaghetti plate, which i did. Apparently, opting for a kid&#39;s plate gives them credence to provide chef Boyardee sauce dumped on truly ordinary noodles.

I have never spent so much for a thoroughly unenjoyable &#34;dinner&#34; In the Denver area, not this calendar year, anyway, and that&#39;s saying a lot.

Take my advice and either go to your nearest Trader Joe&#39;s, purchase basic marinara sauce and cook $1.50 spaghetti at home, or make the drive to Il Pastaio in Boulder, less costly and truly remarkable.  I used to like this restaurant but something has markedly changed."

The Garlic Cheese Strips come out on a round platter and looks like a pizza, but is actually cut up into garlic-y, cheesy strips. The last time I came here, I ordered a medium Bianca -- the ingredients were fresh and the pizza was hot! I had the double-crusted Gourmet Spinach pizza once before, and it was very ... thick and filling! Everyone had one slice and hit a wall; we took the rest home.

On portioning: I usually come here with two additional people and we always have leftovers when ordering garlic strips and an 18&#34; pizza. But, we love leftover pizza from Pino&#39;s. It&#39;s one of the greatest leftovers anyone can ask for!

Pino&#39;s is a little pricier than your average pizza place (i.e. Dominos, Black Jack), but it&#39;s definitely a lot yummier and not as greasy!

Also, the owner is always there and is really friendly! Stop by and bond with someone over hot, fresh pizza!"

It&#39;s a perfect place for families and the service is great. They really make you feel like more than a customer when you are there. I sat at the bar which faces the kitchen and you get to see the chef prepare all of the food. I got to talk to the chef, Justin, and he was a great guy and he also made some wonderful, delicious meals. Overall it is a great restaurant and I highly recommend it.

My husband and I have been regulars at Pino&#39;s for 2 years. Since the reopening the attention to detail and quality seems to be missing. We have been in 2x since the re-opening and both times left us 

1st time - most of the staff that we became accustom didn&#39;t return afterward. This obviously took away some of the charm as the previous staff knew us and what we liked to order. The kitchen was running behind and took 45m for our food. We figured this was an anomoly since they had just reopened and were getting use to things. We had a waiter carelessly spray the table next to us with cleaning and overshot on ours. 

2nd time - my favorite thing here is the burrata salad. Whenever we go I get one with dinner and one to go for lunch the next day. My salad for here did not come with the side of focaccia bread but otherwise was good. Today when I opened my togo salad I found the pre-dressed it with the truffle oil so the romaine is wilted....not what you want in a $10 salad. The kitchen was backed up again and our togo pizza took nearly an hour.

The food is still amazing but Pino and the team need to spend some serious time focusing on consistently, quality and guest services in order to be back where they were when it was a smaller restaurant."

My only issue is with the owner&#39;s service. On two lunch occasions now he has spent his time either chatting with a customer or the employees while I wait to be seated and the single waiter or waitress struggles to serve everyone.  On busy nights it&#39;s a different story and he&#39;s very involved, but during lunch he has paid no attention to the dining room."

The place itself is quite small but we were treated to prompt and friendly service. Our order was placed by phone and we came away with the same impression from that interaction as well. It comes across as a quaint space, mildly intimate but not overly so.

For our pizza we had half Diavola and half Capricciosa. I like that they split pizzas and I thought the pricing was fair due to the quality of ingredients. However neither of these pizzas &#39;rang true&#39; for me. The Diavola is spicy,  as advertised, but most of the spice comes from an overuse of red pepper flakes instead of a balance of natural heat; I was glad I tried this slice second, otherwise I would not have been able to get a full scope of any other flavors. As far as the Capricciosa goes, it had an interesting flavor but nothing that delivered a &#39;wow&#39; factor. The ingredients complemented each other well, the presentation was nice. 

Overall I think this comes down to personal taste: I would have preferred a crisper crust but if that&#39;s not what the business is going for then its not really a downside. The large selection of ingredients and available pizzas will lead me to likely try this place again, hopefully leaving me want seconds."

No kids menu. No crayons. It took them nearly AN HOUR to bring our child an order of spaghetti without sauce.  Our food came even later, but the service had been so annoyingly awful I could barely eat whatever I ordered (aka not memorable). The staff was too busy with their phone orders, so perhaps we should have called our order in from our table for prompter service. We asked for bread twice (first request forgotten) and after 25 minutes they brought ONE slice of bread in a bowl - there were 3 of us - and charged us $1 for it.  (I am serious!!!) So my question for Pino is:  if your restaurant is meant for an adult night out, why is it decorated like a dimly lit Burger King?  ZERO ambiance, sadly sterile tables, oddly loud and a boring menu.  And the food - the reason that people go out - was only average.  Would never go back, mostly due to the insulting service."

We arrived here at 8:45 and although the place was packed, we found two seats at the bar. The bartender was busy but related with us immediately and got us our wine quickly. We ordered the burrata salad which came out first with little wait and was amazing. Wonderful truffle flavor, very delicious high quality prosciutto with it, great combinations of textures with the pine nuts and raisins. We also had the eggplant rolatini which was delicious - light and flavorful and the fresh basil put it over the top. Just excellent. For a pasta dish we had the pappardelle con ragu. The menu describes the sauce as a bolognese, and while I don&#39;t think it was a true bolognese and it was a bit heavy on the meat, it was still good. Service was great throughout, and they even served us the peach cobbler dessert special at closing time, when we were among the last stragglers remaining in the restaurant. The modern atmosphere is quite a change from the warm, inviting vibe this place used to have. But even if that bums you out, the food quality, great service, and very strong list of wines by the glass make this place stand out in the neighborhood."

The sauce was sweeter...but not too sweet...just like I like it. The pepperoni was also very good. The service was great and couldn&#39;t have been better. My only complaint....they forgot the extra cheese. I always get extra cheese on my pizza and them forgetting it only served to remind me why I do. Without the extra cheese it was still very good...but not the way I wanted it. Still worthy of 4 stars...but with the extra cheese it probably would have been 5 stars.

1. Reviews that say the burgers are like In-N-Out&#39;s
2. Reviews that say the pizza is the closest thing NY pizza. By the way, NY is a large place. There&#39;s darn good pizza in upstate NY but it&#39;s nothing like city pizza.

Anyway, if I ignore those comments in reviews, I usually can enjoy my food with an open mind and not end up disappointed. 

Pino&#39;s makes a good pie, but it&#39;s not fair to compare it to pizza in NY. Our take out order included a simple Formaggio small pizza, Burrata salad and a Panna Cotta for dessert.The pizza was delicious, crust is thin and crisp, the sauce has a nice zing so they don&#39;t have to put too much on and we could tell the mozzarella is higher quality.  We also enjoyed our Burrata salad with romaine, asparagus, golden raisins and pine nuts. We skipped the prosciutto and truffle oil that usually come with and dressed it with my homemade vinaigrette instead. The Panna Cotta was fine, but at $4.50, we&#39;ll skip it next time.

This place is great for take-out and extremely popular for dining in for dinner. Especially on the weekend! I arrived to pick up our dinner at 6:30 and had a challenging time finding parking. When I entered the restaurant it was standing room only. All the tables were full and people were waiting at the bar. Getting to the back to pick up our order was like making my way through a mosh pit at a concert. Really. If you choose to eat dinner here, expect a wait.

While Pino&#39;s isn&#39;t what I&#39;d call NY style of any sort, it&#39;s what I&#39;d call tasty. We will definitely order from here again."

When we walked in in a Saturday night, the place was completely dead, so that concerned me, but the reviews were good. Since it was 6 of us, we ordered a bottle of wine, rather than get an individual glass each. Turned out to be cheaper anyway. Only about $29 for the bottle. I believe we got an Argentinian wine. Very good! 

For an appetizer I order a Caprese salad, always an italian favorite of mine. Perfect portion for myself, with just enough olive oil drizzled over it. For my meal, I ordered the Lasagne and was a perfect portion with a side focaccia bread. Our friends ordered the Diavola pizza pie for the two of them and they were stunned with how spicy it was (even though it clearly stated in the menu that it was very spicy) They could barely finish their pizza because they couldn&#39;t handle the spice. I tried it bc I love spicy and it was very good! Probably wouldn&#39;t order a whole pie, but nonetheless very good.

I had a house salad and a slice of pie.  The slice of Bianca pizza was pretty tasty - and the garlic strips that a friend had were just as tasty.  When we were there we were only table in the restaurant so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s always that empty or that was just a typical late Sunday afternoon.  

Very nice, clean atmosphere and I liked it was open to the wine shop next door -- it make it seem much larger inside and very airy."

We split a pizza.  She had the meatball appetizer and I had the caprese appetizer.  I had a couple of glasses of wine, and we each got a dessert.

The atmosphere is nice; it&#39;s adjacent to a wine shop with a half-wall separating the two businesses.  There&#39;s an open kitchen and a mid-sized bar where they pour the wine from some sort of special device - presumably a gadget that&#39;s designed to keep the wine from spoiling, but I don&#39;t know for sure.

Service was good.  All in all a good experience.  I recommend trying it."

We noticed a decline in quality over the this last summer, later to find out it was a major staff change in the kitchen. Tonight was the last straw, we attempted calling for over 10 minutes on a Friday night only to continue to receive a full message box message. Honestly we feared that the restaurant had closed! When my husband arrived to order our take out in person and discussed his concern about no answer when trying to phone for over 10 minutes, he was met with a clipped attitude. We have over 20 years of restaurant experience and we were floored by their rudeness, especially since they know in their computer that we are regulars. Sadly we will never eat there again and will make sure to no longer recommend this to our locals as we have for many years."

Michael has been my server since day one, and has gotten my order down to a science.  This is impressive, considering that Pino&#39;s is constantly filled with happy customers.  It&#39;s comforting to know that no matter what, I know Michael will greet me with my Pino noir, and take care of the rest.  
Another aspect that sets Pino&#39;s apart is that Pino himself is actively involved in his restaurant, and his pride and passion is palpable among his staff.  Whether, greeting all the regulars, or directing his crew on prep for his cooking classes... SOMETHING I VERY MUCH WANT TO TAKE PART IN... he&#39;s not only a boss, but a leader.
Moreover, the food is crave-worthy, and reminds me of Rita, my Italian nanny in NY.  Not too sappy I hope, but I throughly enjoy Pino&#39;s pizza."

In a neighborhood that is full of thicker crust, run-of-the-mill pepperoni pizza, Pino&#39;s is a nice treat with the more traditional pizza style found in Italy.  The crust is thin and crispy and the prosciuttos that we usually order are flavorful.

We usually order a pizza and pasta dish to share.  I love cannelloni and this one is the best I&#39;ve found in Denver (because cheese filling has always been manicotti where I come from, but often listed as cannelloni here) - the bechamel very creamy as it should be.  The other night we ordered rigatoni with sausage and the cheese-tomato sauce mix tasted so rich that I was glad to have tried something new.  The only complaint is that we had one small piece of sausage that I had to cut in half to get 2 small bites.  I was too tired to deal with it when I figured this out at home, but I will make sure to check before I leave the restaurant next time.

Adjacent wine shop has great selection for $13+.  I had an outstanding $20 Barbera the other night that I can&#39;t wait to have again."

Nothing fancy or gourmet. After looking at the menu to see pizza by the slice I would give this place a try. I was some what disappointed that the Spinach slice was not available that day. Why have it on your menu if it isn&#39;t a daily thing. I ordered A slice of peperoni and it was super greasy. It tasted ok, but didn&#39;t through me over the edge. I also ordered a cheese slice with black olives and mushrooms. I was very disappointed in this as the toppings were placed on a cooked cheese pizza and were not cooked.

The thing that saved Pinos for me were the cannolis. I can&#39;t rave enough about them. I could eat them all day. The shell had a cinnamon flavor and the cream was sweet without being over powering.

There menu is full of yummy Italian goodness that I want to try, but for the regular old pizza I need to  keep looking."

Service was good, but not great. One girl ordered a caprese salad and the server brought two. Someone else ate it, but they still charged them even though it was their mistake.  We ordered the wine the server had recommended and got a bottle with a different name on it.  He said &#34;it&#39;s the same, they just changed the name.&#34; That seemed pretty sketchy, but it tasted good and was cheap so not a big deal.  The food was all very good and tasted authentic.  Got some foccacia bread with dipping sauces to start and it was delicious. Also shared the diavola pizza with my husband and it was way too spicy for me.  I had 2 slices and had to call it quits.  Another friend shared her white pizza and spinach pizza and both were delicious. I wouldn&#39;t mind going back, but would probably try out some other spots first."

The wine selection in the restaurant is good. Mostly italian with some Colorado varietals.

The pizza is very inconsistent. The hand formed crust can be cracker thin on one side and Neapolitan on the other, of the same pie.

Their oven is likely too hot which leads to a very crispy cracking bottom crust and a soggy undercooked top layer. The addition of moisture rich toppings delays the cooking of the top layer, which results in inconsistency. This is probably done to expedite the turn around in the kitchen. Good things take time and people should be patient.

I will probably come back even though I expect to get a &#34;special&#34; loogie pie based on the tenor of my review.

Having been born and raised in NYC and going back often I would not call this NY pizza. It is very similar to pizzeria locale and pizza republica.

The staff are warm and gracious and very accommodating.

I just wish they would turn their oven down and let things cook more naturally."

This is NOT the place to do that! not only is it small but after we completed our meal and paid, we chatted a bit more and than was approached by who I assume was Pico, who awkwardly lingered and asked if everything was ok. Clearly the sign, you ate, you paid, now leave. I totally understand as people were waiting but there were other tables around that he could have done that to also and had been there longer.

There are lots more places on my &#34;to-try&#34; list, but I&#39;d be surprised if any other restaurant manages to impart the same outstanding combination of flavor and texture to its pizzas. Pino&#39;s gets five stars for pizza perfection.

Pino&#39;s is located in a strip mall in the Cherry Hills area.  It was pretty quiet at 7 p.m. on a Sunday.  The service was top notch!  We were definitely well looked after by our server.

I started with a Peroni draft.  The burrata salad [not on the menu] that our server recommended was really good--the cheese, the prosciutto and the light dressing.  We shared a medium-sized King pizza with some modifications.  It was good, but it didn&#39;t completely remind me of the New York pizza that I grew up with on Long Island.  The cheese oil drippage was darn close to NY style pizza, though.

I took a leftover slice of the King pizza home.  I have to say, it reheats well!  (And to me, that&#39;s an important pizza quality.)  I liked it just as much the day after.

Overall, I think I need to go back and have a slice of plain cheese pizza at Pino&#39;s to give it a fair New York taste-bud test. :)"

I felt compelled to write this because i really hope the current down trend will end and they will return to making a decent pizza pie.  My first time at Pino&#39;s was just after they transitioned from the previous ownership, which by the way was a great pizza experience!  Does anyone remember that pizza?  The transition was seamless and many things improved, i live in the area and if i wanted pizza it was the obvious choice, but every visit, the people that helped me and did a good job, had either left or were let go.  This is a sad thing to consistently happen to a &#34;neighborhood restaurant&#34;.  The pizza the last three times has been awful and the service seemed disjointed.  Tired dough, the result of it waiting too long before it is utilized, and cook times that don&#39;t allow the ingredients to work.

This place is essentially a quasi-wine bar in a small strip mall in between Downing and Broadway on Hampden.  I have no idea how the salads are or how most of the entrees are but the Formaggio and Diavola pizzas are great.  I don&#39;t think they use San Marzano tomatoes but the sauces still taste great.  Pino&#39;s also offers good choices for red wine by the glass to have with your meals if you&#39;re like me and don&#39;t feel like splurging for bottles when at restaurants.

Was looking to have some pizza &amp; wine for dinner, to celebrate a brithday and this place is closed to home which was perfect. We went in around 3:30pm early dinner should I say. Was greeted &amp; we were the only ones there. Our server was very helpful in helping us to decide what kind of pizza to get. We ended up with the Spinach Pizza. We both had a glass of Pinot Noir &amp; our server was nice enough a small sample of Sangiovese. For dessert, my partner was eyeing the Tiramisu. She is in love with Tiramisu... me not so much. I ordered the Panna Cotte. It reminded me of Flan but not as eggy. We were very happy &amp; enjoyed our experience.

I&#39;m looking forward to trying one of their salads &amp; their wines. What so great about this is there is a wine shop right next door that is by a different owner but by the last person who owned the restaurant made the 2 places opened  so.. it&#39;s perfect to go in there to buy a bottle if you would like. PLus it&#39;s close to home. I&#39;m so grateful to find an authentic pizza place that isn&#39;t your typical chained restaurant. 

The owner was there as well.. so thats always a nice touch. Good Job Pino&#39;s!"

He answered our questions abruptly and sarcastically and acted like we were stupid to ask them. He rushed our order and scoffed at my brother for asking for a box!  If you want to avoid bad service, don&#39;t receive service from the tall waiter with a huge frown on his face.

We ordered the carne asada and the al pastor tacos.  Both were delightfully delectable. The carne asada was flavorful, meaty, and the meat was perfectly cooked. Oftentimes, carne asada is dry or grisly, but this meat was lean yet juicy. I topped mine with with a squeeze of lime, fresh house made salsa, and pickled habanero onions...the perfect two-biter.  The al pastor meat was perfectly caramelized and sweet from the grilled pineapples. These were a little greasy, but also delicious. I prefer the carne asada, but would order the al pastor in a heartbeat.

To drink we ordered an horchata agua fresca and a pineapple Fanta. Horchata is highly recommended. Let me just say that if you want spicy, this place definitely delivers! Their orange chile de arbol salsa is fire! Take a bite of taco and follow it up with some horchata to cool the fire.

Definitely coming back for more. They also have goat, lengua (tongue), and cabeza (head meat)....sounds like a challenge !"

I down a quart of Piña Agua Fresca every time.  I love that they don&#39;t treat me like the Gringa in the Ghetto (I definitely get approving looks every time I order the Tripa and the Lengua though!) 

Their salsa bar is awesome.  Fresh cucumbers, radishes, limes, onions, cilantro, roasted jalapeños, 2 pickled onions (Mild and Holy Crap Habanero) and like  6 different house-made salsas.  Do NOT skip the Avocado Salsa Verde.  It&#39;s the mildest of the bunch but WOW.  I could drink the stuff.

The building is old and it shows it has been here awhile, if you don&#39;t like places that aren&#39;t sparkling clean or in parts of town you would let your kids wander around worry free, then this isn&#39;t your kinda place. 

For those still left you will find an amazingly tasty taco spot you will keep coming back for. 

Had the marinated pork and beef cheek tacos, both were good but the pork was so juicy and flavorful it stole the show. 

They have a great salsa bar as well, some really good and spicy options with a verde salsa made with avocados that was spectacular.

After work and after running some errands in this Neighborhood, Hubs is craving for some Tacos and Mexican so to this establishment we went.  This establishment literally is in a &#34;cute house&#34; turned into a RESTAURANT.  Ample of Seating areas available and the staffs are indeed friendly, inviting and my oh my, we should have been here many moons ago..

YES, if you BLINK, you definitely can missed or passed by this establishment since its located along a busy road of WEST ALAMEDA.  YES, you order at the counter and they will call your name and send your order to where you seat or you can pick up your order at the ordering counter.

As usual there are plenty to choose but we opt for our favorites.  From their simple menu, we opt the following items :

*  Burrito de Carne (Asada Burrito) ($8.50)
*  Asada Tacos ($7.25)

*  Taco de Cinco ($8.50)
*  2 orders of Cabeza Tacos
*  3 orders of Lengua Tacos

*  2 bottles of Cola ($3.98)

Thankfully, the staffs behind the ordering counter, allows me to choose the &#34;combination&#34;.  Hence I opt to have the options of Lengua and Cabeza.  I cannot recall which is which coz everything is so tender and I like it ALOT!  ALOT!  ALOT!

YES, they also have a SALSA BAR in which so many to choose and all the SALSA they offer, we like it a lot!  From the Habenero Pickled Onions, to the Red Salsa, to the Tomatilo Salsa to name a few.  The dining area is kept clean as well as the washroom, when I managed to use it that evening.  

Then after our dinner, I am curious about some of the dishes and the staffs are so willingly answering all my queries and even offer samples in which I am NOW Craving for those.  I should have ask earlier and order those items too..  Then I also overlooked the Tripa Tacos..  

With the Pancita and Birria de chivo, those are now my favorites.. ONLY if its like BLIZZARD outside to have them..  &#34;COMFORT&#34; food similar to what I grew up eating, though I am NOT Hispanic at all.  I whispered to myself.  The meat are so tender and its so flavorful.  Definitely returning to La Calle to bring a group and see how things may differ.  See you soon La Calle.

We hadn&#39;t realized we could do mix and match tacos so ordered five of the al pastor and five of the stewed pork. The al pastor had a hit of sweet that neither of us loved from pineapple chunks. The stewed pork was good but a little sweeter too. 

We went back for more and tried the lengua, carnitas and asada tacos. The second round was much better for our taste buds. We also got the hang of the salsa bar and sampled a couple sauces which increased the tasty factor. 

Hands down the best part of the meal was the pineapple agua fresca. Incredible pineapple flavor with chunks of fresh pineapple and served ice cold."

As someone who has been called a taco purist, aka someone who has a love and passion for classic, street tacos, I think this place hits the spot. I really liked their barbacoa, it had flavor density and went well with the pickled onions and green salsa. The al pastor was also great and wasn&#39;t dry which was fantastic. Very dense in flavor as well! The beef tongue here was just ok. The beef tongue is probably my favorite taco meat because of how much flavor that meat can hold and how moist and delicious it can be, but it is an easy meat to mess up and not get the right flavors. It was just okay in my book because it didn&#39;t have the flavors I was looking for and also it was a tad dry. This place is BOMB though, so don&#39;t overlook it and just drive past it. It&#39;s an awesome taco establishment! They also have delicious horchata as well."

We were discussing the various taco and Mexican joints, I have gone to, and he was like those are not very good. So I had him write this one down. Hands down the best tacos we have had in Denver. We had 5 Al Pastor, and 5 Carnita tacos. They have a legitimate salsa station, my favorites were the habanero, and the verde with avocado in it. They also have agua fresca, which I didn&#39;t see till I already ordered a Jauritos mandarin soda. I also saw someone eating a burrito, which is not on the picture menu. The menu is all in Spanish, but has pictures associated with the items. , I was not sure of these so I have broken down the translations for us gringos.
In our next visits- we will try the leunga- tongue
the chivo- goat
Cochinita pibil- marinated pork 
cabeza- roasted head/beef cheek
campechana- a mix of pork and beef-?,  
Still too chicken to eat the Buche- esophagus, and the tripa- intestines.
 Of course I will be trying the carne asada tacos, but those are not as unique. We beat the lunch rush. It got crazy busy as we were leaving."

My rating is more reflective of what I think of the people who work there than the food. Their compassion for people in need alone is enough to make me a loyal customer. 

First, the food:
I ordered two carnitas tacos and my boyfriend ordered three tacos: one each of carnitas, al pastor, and carne asada. All of the tacos were pretty good, especially with the variety of salsas and toppings provided at the salsa bar. All around solid and I will return.

The Five-Star Moment:
While enjoying our tacos, a homeless man came in and asked if the folks at La Calle would make a burrito for him to share with his girlfriend in exchange for the $3 they had pulled together for dinner. The cook said yes immediately and proceeded to make the man and his girlfriend each a generous meal, gave them drinks, and then refused to take any of their money. The whole interaction was so touching it made me slightly teary. 

Take away:
I will continue to support this business, not only because I love tacos, but because these are good people."

I ordered 2 Carne asada tacos and a cheese quesadilla. My son ordered 2 Carne asada tacos and an asada quesadilla. We both had horchatas. Not sure how much anything was,  the menu was in Spanish, but other than the actual meats I didn&#39;t recognize the words. The quesadilla was not called a quesadilla. They have tacos, quesadillas, burritos and tortas. I know that because that&#39;s what the man told me.  The food was straight up excellent!!. You would have to order more than what we did to call it a meal though.  Asada was delicious, quesadilla was so cheesy. Horchatas were good too, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not homemade.  I seriously would have given it 5 stars if....

They served fountain drinks. 
They served chips and salsa. 
If they had pkates with beans and rice. 

This place is literally am indoor taco truck.  Service was good too.  I paid with a card and it asked me to leave a tip and I did.  Since this was self service and we literally did everything, but make our food, I&#39;m not sure who I&#39;m tipping or why. I&#39;ll be back someday."

We also got sides of rice which were pretty close to what we were used to in So Cal and was super good. 

Also, the salsa bar had so many choices and cilantro WITHOUT onions, yay!  Plus the staff was super friendly and helpful. The only downside was that it was really cold inside and I&#39;m not sure there was a heater... so my food got cold fast.

 Amazing salsa selection 6 options last time I was in along with all the little toppings.

  Aguas frescas and my personal favorite, tepache.  Tepache is a mildly  fermented drink made with pineapples and piloncillo!  It is very good, almost as good as my grandmother&#39;s version of it. If you have never had tepache, it alone is worth a visit to La Calle.

The menu on the wall is in Spanish, but if you find it hard to navigate, they do have an English version that they offered.  We decided on carnitas, al pastor and carne asada.  They had a nice variety of salsas that you can choose from and I was a big fan of the habanero one.   Everything had good flavor and I was happy with all of our choices.  The price was good and the people working were all very nice.  I will be back as soon as I need my taco fix, which will probably be soon!"

You&#39;ve got to love authentic Mexican food, and no I don&#39;t mean Tex-Mex or that crap they serve out west called Cali-Mex. 

Building off of the successes of Las Tortugas, this taco venture is spot on good authentic (CHEAP) Mexican cuisine!

The menu is quite simple. A plate of 5 tacos will cost you between $7-$9 dollars depending on the cut of beef or pork your Mexican-craving palette desires. I recommend the Carne Asada, Lengua (tongue), and the Al Pastor. They also have the most authentic quesadilla (chuletta) I&#39;ve ever had in the states (and im from Houston)!

Your taste buds will go on a roller coaster ride via the salsa line in the restaurant. They have 5-6 different sauces with different a different base ingredient. Habañero, avocado, peanuts, traditional green, traditional red, etc. 

Do not expect anything fancy except for the exquisite taste of the taco concoctions that hit your mouth. 

While you sit and eat your amazing meal you will be treated with a lesson in Mexican culture as they blast latin music over the restaurant speakers. Knowing a little spanish will go a long way here as many of the staff may only speak spanish. 

Do yourself a favor and get here as soon as possible. You can send me thank you letters. Just PM me for my address."

The issue I&#39;ve been running into out here is that there&#39;s so many variants on Mexican food depending on the part of the country it&#39;s based on, and the stuff you get in Fresno is just one of those varieties.

This place was perfect for what I was looking for. No corn and stuff in the rice, perfect beans (none of that black beans on the side nonsense), and the carne asada tacos were cooked perfectly. They also have a little bar in the front where you pick your own toppings, so I was able to keep it to the simple onion, cilantro, salsas and lime.

Mash potatoes have chicken gravy- really wish they had other options

Mac and cheese- tasted worse then what you can get made from a box from the store 

Chicken was so blend it reminded me of Golden Corral Lacking seasoning like salt and really greasy.

This place has a lot of potential, the location is a little off to the side, and the signage. otherwise really all that noticeable, but it&#39;s clean, decently decorated inside, and the staff seem AWESOME! The young man especially who took my order, and kept asking if there was anything else I needed was super kool. I think he genuinely cared about my experience. That alone made me want to give these places more stars, but the food is what threw this off for me. The mac and cheese (noodle cheese soup) taste like something totally artificial and out of a laboratory, which makes their claim to serve &#34;all natural&#34; Chicken slightly less credible. The mashed potatoes/gravy had no flavor either. The Chicken has an incredible light fried crisp skin which is unlike anything you&#39;ve ever tried before (yummy), unfortunately the chicken has no flavor either. If I could put White Fence Farm on either Churches or Popeye Chicken I thing with their flavorings and WFF frying technique it&#39;d be brilliant. The fritters they served were probably the 2nd best thing on my plate. I wish that this place offered a 2 piece meal, instead they force a 4 piece on you for 9 bucks, and then offer you two sides and no drink included. Also, would have loved the option to choose between white meat and dark. Come on now... I&#39;ve been waiting to try this place based on the strength of the recommendations of some of my elders who know this place from its history on the other side of town.

I love the mac-n-cheese at Noodles and company, but I am not a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, whatsoever. With that being said, please understand I am rating for taste and my own personal opinions about my experience.

This place is NOT the original farm, nor is the even size even similar to the farm. This is a small, take-out restaurant  filled with a choice of about five tables to sit at. I do have to commend their service, it wasn&#39;t busy at all and the cashier/order hostess was very courteous and helpful. Overall, the service was great.

I ordered the three piece chicken meal that includes two sides and a drink. I chose the biscuit with honey butter and the mac-n-cheese. I may have inadvertently  let the biscuit air out, because it was not warm and was stiff, I could barely spread the butter on it. One could taste the honey in the bjtter, so that was good on my spare bread I had at home. As for the mac-n-cheese, the noodles were overcooked  to my liking, and had a lot of paremesean cheese  in it, I wasn&#39;t too much of a fan.

Now for the meat! I loved the crispy, thin batter (buttermilk-like) coating on the fried chicken. You could tell that the oil amd chicke was fresh, they were really large-sized fried chickens. The great part about it was that it wasn&#39;t as greasy as your typical KFC/Popeye&#39;s restaurants. The only super drawback was that it was pretty salty to eat it like a purist. I had to dip it in a honey mustard, because the &#34;hot sauce&#34; was practically buffalo/Frank&#39;s Red Hot sauce. I am planning to give try this again, but next time it&#39;ll be on my terms! Oh yeah, for those of you who love the fritters that they have at the FARM, they too, will be serving the fritters at this location. Happy eating!"

Why else would anybody be going here other than fried chicken anyway? I just happened to be out in that far Eastern part of Aurora North of I-70 for business. Breakfast is a distant memory from 6 hours before. I can&#39;t even stand the thought of the usual chain burger places that I seem to be surrounded by. As I sit in the First Bank parking lot scanning Yelp reviews for good local lunch places I glance across the street and see White Fence Farms. I have never been to the original White Fence Farms but I know it by reputation from my wife and friends. Why not give it a shot? The newly opened (3 months old?) place is in a very small corner of a strip mall. I would guess it&#39;s 20 seats max and very plain, bare and simple. If you have a large party I would recommend getting your order to go. The menu is pretty stark with a few different options on various size orders of chicken and a small handful of sides. I get the three piece dinner combo with 2 sides, beets and bean salad, and a drink. The 2 guys who are working there are super nice and get my order ready and served to my little 2 person table in 7 or 8 minutes after they had served the couple that had gotten there just before me. The first great thing I notice is that I have a wing, a breast and another piece (sorry I don&#39;t remember but not a thigh). If somebody orders a 3 piece chicken dinner I always feel a breast should be part of it (read my Popeye&#39;s review). I like dark meat but there should be a mix of white and dark, IMHO. It is not coated 1/4 inch out with a grease soaked flour crust like so many chains but a lightly battered chicken skin with a little flour, buttermilk and a few spices. I can actually see the chicken skin through the light coating. The all natural Red Bird chicken inside is steaming hot and juicy without being pumped full of the solution that is common with so much chicken. On the first bite I am hooked. I sprinkle on a little salt and a tiny amount of hot sauce to suit my personal taste. I devour it down to until I am just gnawing on bare bones. Good stuff Maynard. This is the best restaurant chicken I have eaten in this century and in this state. I have had as good or better home-made but that&#39;s not what this is about. The beets were okay and bean salad was actually pretty good but only tiny amounts in little souffle cups. For what it&#39;s worth 40 years ago when I was 16 my second hourly paid job was working at Kentucky Fried Chicken, a place I now avoid if possible and maybe eat at once a decade. The employees said they are planning on building a few more of these across the Denver metro so maybe, if I&#39;m lucky, one will show up near my home soon."

After patiently waiting for a table for 30 minutes on a busy Monday night, we were rudely seated as if it was an inconvenience to walk us to out table. Our menus were thrown on the table and the host walked away before we got there.

After ordering two bowls of pho, we waited for another 30 or 45 minutes while people who were seated after us were served their food.

I walked to go ask if our food was on it&#39;s way and the waiter yelled at the kitchen. After we finally got our bowls, I found a long black hair hanging out of my bowl. To make a terrible experience unimaginably worse, the waiter rudely asked if we wanted to leave or wait for another bowl- I asked for one on the house and they refused.

It&#39;s so good that I ate here two days in a row!

They have Filet Mignon Pho so obviously I ordered that (Pho 95 Special). It came out with very fresh veggies and generous amounts of meat. The noodles were cooked perfectly soaking in an amazing bowl of their pho broth. I always put Sriracha, Hoisin and Sauté sauce in the broth no matter where I go. The broth was so good that I didn&#39;t do it here for the first time in my life. I left extremely full and very happy both times I dined here.

The pho broth at Pho 95 gave me that moment. I usually hate any pho outside of SGV, but this knocks any pho I have ever had out of the park. 

Normal viet restaurant set up. Service was friendly. Typical menu.

Pho did take a little long to come out but it was worth the wait.

Viet Coffee - $3.50 - Drip drip drip! Strong and woke me up!

Cha Gio - $6.95 - Crispy and good meat filling. You get 3 egg rolls, cut in halves. Comes with lettuce wrap stuff and fish sauce.

Goi Cuon Tom Thit - $3.95 - Normal spring roll but something about it made me not enjoy it. It was missing that crunch factor a spring roll needs. Peanut sauce was so so. 

Pho Dac Biet, medium - $8 - Like I said above, that broth was amazing. So clear and clean. Pure beef flavor. Add some of the beef oil inside and it will blow your mind. I usually do not drink much of the broth but I drank a bowls worth before I put my sauces inside. The bowl itself is your typical Dac Biet stuff. The noodle to meat ratio was crazy, 1:2. I ran out of noodles before meat, never happens!

Pho will never be the same again!!!"

I was in town for a conference and my group of 15 needed to grab dinner before it started.  We called ahead to let them know of our large party and they were more than willing to accommodate us.  The restaurant started to get busy, as it was Friday evening, so they had to split us into two tables which was completely fine.  The staff was very friendly, helpful, and patient with us during our visit.  

The majority of our table ordered #21 Pho 95 Special aka the Filet Mignon Pho.  I ordered a small and the rest ordered mediums.  I was a bit skeptical about the concept because it seems like a waste of filet mignon but the price was right, so I went for it.  

The pho came out quickly and the portions were generous.  The broth was clear and tasty; not too salty or sweet.  The meat was deliciously sliced thin and oh so tender.  There was also a ton of meat for all bowl sizes! My friend Henry actually ordered extra meat and it was a little too much.  Our vegetarian friend ordered the 3P Vegetarian Pan Fried Noodles [Pho Ap Chao Chay] and ate everything on her large plate.  It was well cooked and had a variety of ingredients.

One taste into the broth changed my opinion about Denver and their pho. I ordered the wagyu beef combo pho (wagyu beef plus brisket and flank) and was very pleased with the copious amounts of meat provided. They only give 5 slices of the wagyu beef so I had to cherish every piece. One great thing about using more tender meat is that when it&#39;s cooking in the broth, it still stays tender and not dry.

We ordered appetizer plate with friend soft shell crab, spring roll and shrimp. It was filling, and breeding was good. But it was greasy. We also ordered pork belly bun. The pork was perfectly but the wrap tasted like undercooked frozen dough. 

They do not have sandwich on the menu anymore. So we ordered the combo grilled plate. The meat was cooked well, and I enjoyed it.

I had the flank steak and filet minon. The large was a little over ten bucks and could have easily fed a family of three with generous portions.

We both tried the filet mignon pho (I got a small bowl and he got a large) and now I&#39;m sitting at work dreaming about it again. The broth was the best broth I&#39;ve ever had. Light on the herbs but packed with intense beef flavor, with very little oil and super clear. The noodles were really good texture - they didn&#39;t soften in my soup at all and maintained a decent bite (not undercooked by any means, but just chewy enough to be satisfying). And the meat! There was so much of it. I thought I had more meat than noodles. The filet mignon was so soft and tender. Definitely worth paying extra for.

I got the vermicelli special with pork, beef, shrimp, egg rolls and man was the dish so full of meat and noodles I thought since it was full of meat maybe I&#39;d run out of vermicelli but I had plenty.  The marination was tasty, maybe being on the road for a while my taste buds are off.   But I don&#39;t think so, because this is the 2nd Vietnamese restaurant I&#39;ve been to in Denver and it definitely beats anything I can get in Kansas City. 

Meat portion = large for my appetite, but I love how I had a snack later (not 2 full meals but still a mini snack works for my pregnant belly)
Noodles &amp; veggies = plenty and sufficient.
Cost = for about $13-14 if I remember correctly this is a steal for what you get. 

The tea was a different flavor than I&#39;m used to, definitely wasn&#39;t jasmine tea. 

Only issue would possibly be that we wanted to sit away from the door and pointed at a perfect spot but the waiter said the stroller would be in the way and wanted us to wait for a booth in another spot.  How a stroller between 2 tables not in the walkway is blocking doesn&#39;t make sense to me, having worked as a waitress in the past, but whatever they say goes."

From authentic back-alley Chinatown establishments to white table cloth pho interpretations. The food here is an intentional mix of both. For what you get, the value is exceptional. Every last facet of Pho 95 -- from the cleanliness to ample accouterments this place provides for pho (like two whole limes) -- everything&#39;s perfect.

You can only get this caliber of soup -- with fresh ingredients and ample portions -- at an establishment that&#39;s as frequented and well-run as this one.

We ordered our Pho togo.  They are very careful over the phone to make sure you have the correct location,  I am not going to break down by protein choices per bowl and will just give the highlights for consideration.

1.  Broth - very, very clear;  rich flavor, not greasy, subject to personal preference but perhaps a little heavy on salt but you can definitely taste the complexity. 
2,  Abundance of fresh vegetable sides - basil, sprouts, etc.
3.  Various proteins - excellent and in generous portions.  Tripe was very tender, rare steak on par, tendons were tender and meaty.  What struck me was the brisket - very rich, beefy flavor and tender.
4.  Seafood Pho - lots of shrimp.  I don&#39;t believe it was a &#34;seafood&#34; broth;  don&#39;t remember if they specify but overall very good!

Opened up the broth containers at home and they were still piping hot.  Overall, I am not going to say it is the best Pho in Denver, BUT, I also don&#39;t have any improvements I can think of to give anything less than 5 stars!"

Not sure if it&#39;s 100% certified or anything, but the beef stayed tender even when cooked all the way through in the hot broth. My sister ordered the same thing and we both agreed it was one of the better bowls of pho we&#39;ve ever had (and we&#39;ve had plenty).

They always give a generous amount of noodles that are always cooked to perfection -- not too chewy and not too soggy -- just right. The pho comes with a chock-full of broccoli, celery, carrots, tofu, and onions. Quite honestly, I&#39;m always left pretty full after I&#39;m finished with the veggies. The broth isn&#39;t the best Vegetarian broth I&#39;ve ever had, but it is still pretty delicious -- spicy and sweet. Very nice. I usually order a small ($7.25) and I can never finish it... A medium would probably be just right for most people.

They unfortunately don&#39;t serve any vegetable egg rolls here anymore, so for my most recent visit, I got the crab cheese wontons. The outside was nice and crispy, but the appetizer was pretty salty overall. I&#39;m not sure that I would order it again.

Since the weather&#39;s cooling down now, I like to order steamed bean sprouts and put that in my pho instead of the raw ones that they bring. Having the steamed bean sprouts will not cool your soup down for those cold days coming our way!

Oh, they also have delicious boba here. I usually ask for it less sweet and without whipped cream to save myself from a sugar crash.

Thank goodness for colder, rainy days, and pho!

The service is okay -- nothing praiseworthy. They can be pretty quick, or pretty slow. The last time I went, the wontons came out within five minutes after ordering and four phos took around 20 minutes."

I always taste the pho broth before adding my toppings because you can always tell how good the food will be. My go to pho is always the pho tai bo vien with the meat on the side and extra cilantro. I like that the meat isn&#39;t thin cut and the meatballs are thinly sliced. We ordered a few plates of the egg rolls as well which were perfectly fried. You wrap them in the lettuce and add the toppings then dip it in the nuoc mam (fish sauce). I like to add chili oil to mine for an extra kick.

Being a huge fan of filet, I had to give it a try. The meat is sliced thinly, of course, and served in a bowl of warm broth and noodles. The result is impossibly tender meat that soaks up the flavorful broth. 

I ordered the large bowl with extra meat, and I was absolutely stuffed by the time I finished. At most pho places, I slurp the bowl clean, and there is nothing left by the time I am done. Here, the ample meat and noodles filled me up, and although the beef broth is rich and flavorful, I just couldn&#39;t finish it all."

It&#39;s so refreshing and very light compared to some vegetarian broth that seems a bit like muddy water. This place made me rejoice for the vegetarian pho. Tofu was pretty good.

They&#39;re in every corner. It&#39;s very reassuring for us knowing that one of the dishes that we absolutely must have at least a minimum of once a week is not to be out of our lives.

Locating one is not difficult. At first glance I counted twelve of them a few blocks from each other. Very reassuring indeed.

This particular one that we first hit sits in a very busy main street. Long line past the front door on a very wet rainy and cold day. Very limited parking space. Although they use three sides of the building leaving one side as an exit. With that parking is still very limited. 

It is spacious inside. Two tops table are rare. Fast service. Three sizes of bowl. Small, medium and large. It is about $8 for the small pho ga. 

Very small standing only wait area that will barely fit five or six people. Hence the line past the door. No disposable chopsticks. No choices of noodles except what they give you. Fresh veggies. 

I&#39;m no pho expert although I&#39;ve had an affinity for it that needs to be fulfilled at three times a week. So yeah I&#39;ve been eating pho for the past 5-6 years. So I know a little bit about it. It&#39;s all in the broth. You can throw anything into it if the broth is legit. 

The broth here is definitely not the best for me coming from a city where the best of the best pho is located. But it&#39;s acceptable nevertheless. 

I will continue my search for what suits my taste. There&#39;s plenty of choices."

The dining area is fairly run of the mill with a huge aquarium in the center and a bar with a television screen up by the register should you be worried about missing some sort of game (I&#39;ve never been in that position but hey, I hear some people care about that sort of thing so I&#39;m looking out for you). 

The only thing that I don&#39;t love about this place is the service - total crapshoot. Sometimes the waiters are over-the-top friendly but mess up your order. Sometimes they are cranky as f*ck and slam down food in front of you. Sometimes they are cold to you (white girl) and cold to your best friend... until they realize he&#39;s 100% vietnamese and then are all nice to him but still crap to you. Sometimes the service is as it should be, which is in my mind prompt, curteous, and neutral.

We were given water right away and given ample time to peruse the menu. I ordered the Pho with steak and spicy broth. The broth was full of flavor. There was a nice heat that danced on the palette and lips after enjoyment. The fresh basil and bean sprouts gave some nice texture and complimented the spice of the broth. The steak and onions were evenly distributed throughout the pho giving you pops of meaty texture. The green onion garnish just put me over the edge. Of course, I have a huge love for all things onion. I ordered the small portion and didn&#39;t finish. If you are a noodle fiend and you still have broth, no worries order extra noodles to add to your left over broth for a second meal at home or the hotel. #goodeats #denver"

(I know pretty contradictory but the person I was there with said its the best way to go so I listened) The broth for the vegetarian had a spicy kick to it which I really enjoyed it was also full of veggies more then I have ever had in my pho before. The raw meat was interesting but quite tasty. I have been to Vietnam before and this still ranks with some of the best pho I have had.

Both of us really enjoy eating Buns. But this one just didn&#39;t cut it. The grilled pork here was very thin cuts of meat, which didn&#39;t bother me, but my bf liked thicker cuts. Cucumber was cut into 6 or so huge chunks instead of julienned thin as is the norm. But the carrots were julienned way too fine. The sauce became too salty for me after awhile. There were no pickled julienne radish as is the norm too.

The portions were big and service was nothing to complain about. Basically, the food here did not live up to the yelp hype at all."

We passed many pho places on the way to this one (there was at least 2 or 3 on every block).  I&#39;ve never seen so many pho restaurants in one area.  

This area in Denver was kind of strange.  I couldn&#39;t figure out if I was in Chinatown, or Latin America town?  Or a combination of both perhaps?  Interesting area nonetheless.

 Anyways,.. PHO!  So many people, but enough seating.  We only waited about 5 minutes for our table.  Service was quick!

Their menu has a good amount of items to choose from.  I like how you can pick your size bowl: small, medium, or large.  I thought the small was the perfect size (even for a starving person).  I&#39;ve seen others order the large, and they as might as well call that size JUMBO because it&#39;s that huge. 

I ordered a small combination pho.  It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen a bowl of pho with more meat than rice noodles.  I felt like they didn&#39;t give me enough rice noodles because I&#39;ve never in my life have ever eaten all the rice noodles in a bowl of pho.  

Even though my bowl of pho lacked noodle quantity, it was delicious!  The bowl was super savory and full of flavor.  The combination pho came with steak, beef brisket, flank/tendon, and tripe.  They might have overloaded my bowl with brisket, but I&#39;m not complaining.  It was great!  

Pho 95 might not be in the best area in Denver, but I&#39;ll definitely come back here just for pho!"

We were in Denver on vacation and decided to look on Yelp for the best available. stopped in around 3pm on a weekday and were very disappointed.  We were expecting some great Pho after reading so many favorable reviews. 

We started with an order of summer rolls.  The shrimp was whole, not sliced in half like some places, but the pork tasted slightly off.  Unfortunately, the peanut sauce was even worse. It was runny and with little peanut flavor.  It tasted more like jarred sauce rather than freshly made.  We couldn&#39;t help notice the watered down chili sauce in the plastic squeeze bottles.  Along with our appetizer, we also ordered the House Special Pho.  The bowl of Pho was large and plentiful, however, the noodles were thick and gummy (not thin like most) and the broth had little flavor.  The serving size was huge and had a variety of meats in it, but the brisket slices were so fatty that we couldn&#39;t eat them.  The Pho also had a strange odor.  We began to question the freshness.

I&#39;m not Vietnamese but I&#39;ve had a handful of pho in my life and have yet to find a place that serves as good of a meat to noodle ratio as Pho 95... and to be honest, that is what keeps me coming back. 

The first time I dug my chopsticks in the bowl, I couldn&#39;t believe how difficult it was to take them back...they were buried in meat! And as for the vermicelli, you can&#39;t even see the noodles at first because of how much meat they give you.

So for meatlovers, just come. It will not disappoint.

My ONLY issue was the staff.  Took several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us, and four employees walked by, made eye contact, and just moved on.  Finally sat down by a guy, who set the menus on the table and walked away before we even sat down.  Waiter came over and just looked at us, waiting for our order.  Brought the beers, the food, and the check without a single word.  Another came by and tried to take the not-empty bowls without saying a word, and we were not done.

Kind of weird of the staff.  Just say &#34;hey&#34; and &#34;everything okay?&#34; and I&#39;m happy.  But the silent treatment is a turn-off.

Would have been 5 stars otherwise."

We stayed on course and made our way to Pho 95 for lunch. Service seems a bit off here, but that&#39;s probably expected of most Asian restaurants, and that would be my only qualm. We stood and waited quite a while to be seated, then our food arrived very untimed, however, considering this is a pho place and a &#34;long&#34; wait here means like, 5 minutes, it&#39;s no big deal.

On to the food! I started with a Ca Phe Sua Da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee) and it is one of the strongest, most delicious Vietnamese Iced Coffees I&#39;ve ever had. I would highly recommend trying one of these if you can handle strong coffee! A couple of the guys at my table started with Goi Cuon appetizers. Be warned, these contain shredded lettuce thus aren&#39;t prepared the traditional way and definitely weren&#39;t the best.

For my meal, I ordered a Pho Chin + Meatballs. The soup was great and tasty, the meat was delicious as well. And oh my gosh, the meat. I have no idea how I was able to finish all my noodles while pairing it with meat in every bite and somehow still ended up with about 2 cups of meat left in my bowl. Insane! But, thank you! Needless to say, we all walked away super stuffed. With all the competition going on around here, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with the Pho, but I would gladly come here next time I&#39;m in town. Consider adding this to your &#34;must try&#34; list as well!"

I had my sights set on Pho 95 - largely because of all of the positive reviews - all of which I would agree with. Thanks Yelpers!

The restaurant - which looks like it was built in what used to be a KFC was very nicely renovated, and attractively decorated. The restaurant is on Federal - where, depending on the direction you&#39;re coming from has tons of Pho restaurants as well as Mexican taco stands. They do have a private lot for parking, however - this fills up quickly and may have to park on the street. 

I was worried for a bit, as I was expecting small amounts of meat - however, I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size and portioning. I got the Pho with the Marinated Flank and extra Meatballs - this was excellent. Protein wise, there&#39;s not much of a portion difference between a Medium and Large - so If you wanted broth and noodle leftovers - its worth getting the Large."

If you want the very best, most authentic, and seek the highest quality in ingredients then look no farther than this amazing Pho spot. 

They provide caring and attentive service to all of their many guests. In fact at lunch the parking lot gets packed. People are going and returning often from the friendly rapport seen and heard from staff to guests. 

You will notice all ages and walks of life dining here. Everyone is welcomed and those who already know about this delish place seem eager to return. 

In my opinion Pho should have a deep, rich flavor and that is only possible when the stock is made with fresh and flavorful greatness. Pho 95 hits the mark and then some...

They will admit to using some MSG in their food and kudos for the honesty. It&#39;s a flavor enhancer and while I wish it was left out, I am grateful knowing what I am putting in my body.  No doubt that ALL of the Pho places use the stuff and at least they have the integrity to admit it!

Besides Pho their rice and noodle dishes are packed with meat and loaded with flavor!! For sure the best tasting spring rolls around. 

Pho 95 is clean and smells good from the moment you walk in the door. They have a nicely stocked bar and offer the most popular sporting event on their huge flat screen TV. 

I will keep going back, trying new dishes, and bringing new people in to experience this fabulous restaurant. 

Check them out. You&#39;ll be glad you did!"

The portions are huge, but I think that&#39;s pretty standard. Their special is a must try but I honestly haven&#39;t come across one I haven&#39;t liked. The veggie spring rolls are the only app I&#39;ve tried but they&#39;re quite delicious: crisp ingredients, never soggy tofu, and a paper shell that stays relatively intact.

Some sort of International Pho Numbering Committee, maybe? I&#39;m open to answers as this is important to me) we dropped into this place after reading the rave reviews.

We were greeted by a couple of men that could barely speak English, but the sentences we could understand were hilarious. Our server sat down at our table, talked with us for a bit, before taking our order. It&#39;s great to be at a pho joint that offers different sizes. Too many places have one size and you end up with a lot to take home and pho isn&#39;t the best as leftovers (in my opinion). The pricing is very reasonable, less than $7 for small, less than $8 for medium, and just under $9 for a large. I got the medium bowl which was more than plenty and I&#39;m a big fella that can put away some grub.

They have some pretty awesome looking cocktails at a moderate price that I&#39;ll have to try next time. This place also has great boba tea, which I recommend to end your meal with. I highly recommend this place and will most definitely make the trek down Federal for it."

To me, this is your typical pho restaurant. It has menus that cater more to the general public, not just for the Vietnamese population.

I thought the pho was just okay, flavors were a little watered down. Maybe it&#39;s because I live in an area with a great selection of Vietnamese cuisine. I liked how they had three different serving sizes. Most places only have small and large. 

The restaurant is clean and well decorated. The service is great. The waiters are quick to help and provide you service,

The prices are normal pho prices which is a good thing. 

I just think this place is overhyped. I&#39;m thinking because everyone wants a bowl of pho during the long winter season in the mile high city. The pho on the west coast is a lot better (with the exception of Zagat rated Pho 75 in Arlington, VA).

I have spent a lot of hours doing work, studying, and reading here. There is a back room that groups can book for meetings but when it is not booked it makes a great workspace. There are lots of healthy food options to fuel the hours of work.

The space itself offers a hip trendy vibe, complete with composting and recycling along with many tables to work from.

We live right across the street, and this place was one of the first to make us feel welcome to the community.  Before we had food or wifi, this was our home away from home, and the staff remembered us and always asked how it was going getting settled.

They&#39;re currently doing construction and have expanded so there is more seating and it feels more spacious which is awesome, since I know they have a lot of patrons who use wheelchairs.

Their Novo coffee and beverages are high quality and I love their lattes and cold brew (I get i with cinnamon and agavé which is amazing)  They also have breakfast sandwiches and burritos that they will heat up for you, as well as some healthy grab and go lunch options.  I also recommend getting a rewards card so that after 9 coffees you get a free one (It&#39;s not by visit, so if you purchase two drinks, they both count towards your reward which is cool).

The only reason I dinged a star is because there is sometimes a bit of a wait for your drink to come up, but I know that&#39;s because they really take their time and the quality is good.

I&#39;ve actually been to group events here; they seemed pretty cool about having a bunch of people showing up in their space.

They carry Novo, some people really like Novo.  Lots of other things on the menu too.

I&#39;d say that Fluid is more of a gathering place/hang-out place than a place to get coffee and go.  

There&#39;s lots of stuff positioned around the shop, food, stickers, posters for music, events, etc.  I found that to be kind of distracting.  I had to ask the Coffee Guy where the milk was.  &#34;It&#39;s right there in front of you.&#34;  Sorry for asking, but I couldn&#39;t find it with all of the other crap on display.

Maybe this is a little nitpicky, but I had to pour my own coffee.  I don&#39;t mind a little sweat equity, but what did I actually pay for?  A guy to hand me a cup so I could fill it myself with luke-warm, bottom of the urn Novo coffee.  The urn ran out, and I had to go find the Coffee Guy to get more coffee.

First, I&#39;d like to mention that the service was great. I love when the team remembers your name and even better when they remember your drink. 

I don&#39;t drink much dairy or coffee. My typical staple is a chai latte. The barista recommended their spicier chai because their regular sweeter chai contained dairy in it. I got it with almond milk. It was quite delicious. 

My friend got a freshly made cinnamon roll. It was very good. We sat outside and enjoyed their patio because my friend brought his dog. It&#39;s a great place to people watch and be in the shade. I also like that they are environmentally conscious by encouraging patrons to recycle their sleeves. 

All in all, I know I will be back. Maybe in the winter and I can try a hot chocolate or cider.

He didn&#39;t tell me my total just stuck out his hand for payment. And he watched me put a dollar in the tip job (a habit I might need to break now) and didn&#39;t smile, say thank you or acknowledge that in anyway. The woman who set my coffee on the counter gave me a little smile before going back to their conversation. 

Not very welcoming and mediocre coffee. I&#39;ve never said this before but next time, I&#39;m just going to Starbucks."

I woke up super early on the first day there because I had to crank out some work. I mosied on over to Fluid and it was an AWESOME place to work.

WiFi was fast, there was plenty of seating, and the coffee was good, strong coffee! There are some seats along the window for some good dog-watching fun as well.

Service was fast and everyone was super nice. I was able to grab a seat towards the back of the place and crank for a solid 3 hours without any problems. Sometimes coffee houses can get REALLY loud..especially the bigger ones, but I had a great experience. Added plus of having access to restrooms in the back too. 

They serve Novo Coffee here...never heard of it before I got there, but I liked it.

Really, really great workspace! Would highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a place to bunker down to study/work!"

They serve Novo coffee and offered 2 different blends.  I don&#39;t recall the names of the blends available that day, but the more robust one that the barista recommended was great!

Their breakfast sandwich selection was prepackaged.  A bit off-putting (ummm....7-11?), but heated on the panini grill rather than microwaved and actually pretty tasty. 

They have a meeting room that was available, so it easily accommodated our group of 6. I&#39;m not certain of the fee to reserve this room, but would be a great idea for meeting a larger group of people or having an informal meeting

All in all, a good experience and would definitely pay them another visit sometime."

Between this place and quite a few others I&#39;ve checked out, this place def takes the cake. 
The vibe is really chill, and the cold brew coffee is the best I&#39;ve ever had. Also, found out by talking to them that cold brew doesn&#39;t mean the coffee is just cold, it&#39;s just how it was made, and can be served hot on request. 
The staff is incredibly friendly! Man I know these guys by name they are so cool. Billy, Joey, Max and Bryan (with a &#34;Y&#34;) all have given me great advice on areas to live, music venues to check out and the happening spots in town. Great guys I can&#39;t possibly say enough about the positive, friendly atmosphere they have created. 
Thank you guys so much for your help, I will be a constant customer for as long as you guys work here for sure!!"

Yes, just the tops. No, this is not a joke. And it is most certainly NOT a Seinfeld episode. 

Also, they have very delicious coffee/espresso drinks (the white chocolate mocha is my fave). They are soooooo nice every time I go, and they also have a &#34;day-old&#34; section of pastries that are only $1. Sometimes I&#39;ll grab a couple--one for me, and one for a homeless person that is probably in the neighborhood somewhere. 

Although it&#39;s only street parking, there is plenty of it. They are great about altering a drink to suit your taste buds, making those lovely designs in the foam (I got a teddy bear once!!!), and putting a smile on your face on those grumpy, grumbly mornings. 

Reading other reviews about their Chai, I will need to try it out next time I go! Thanks Yelpers :-)"

Who wants to hear &#34;I Wanna Rock N Roll All Night&#34; in a coffee shop?  Maybe it was just the day and usually the music is more background and low key.

I enjoy the fact that they are open until 10PM every day, later than most local coffee shops around the same area.  Being someone who is more awake at night, I have been able to stop by later in the day and still get a lot of work done.

The space itself is cozy, with tables, chairs, and couches all around. There is even a separate meeting room towards the back for work meetings that require a more private space. I haven&#39;t had any trouble finding a place to sit if the shop is relatively full and the jazz music in the background adds to the comfortable atmosphere.

The coffee is fresh but I do need to add some sugar and milk for my taste. I did enjoy the breakfast burrito (with green chili!) and some good conversations with fellow coffee-goers before I left."

The neighborhood is great as well, and they have a nice event space that I imagine is great for gatherings of all kinds.

I see all kinds of people tapping away on their laptops when I&#39;m there, so I&#39;ll imagine that it&#39;s perfect for working on your stuff. Personally, I can&#39;t work effectively without at least two large monitors, otherwise I&#39;d give it a shot. Maybe you should!"

However, unlike some other folks who wrote reviews, I am not too impressed with the Novo coffee they serve.

Other coffeeshops are just too small and the work spaces fill up too quickly.

Fluid is pretty much perfect for work. It&#39;s large enough (especially when you can use their &#34;event&#34; space in back. It&#39;s set up well with outlets and fast wi-fi. It has decently priced caffeine and snacks. And above all it just has a good vibe that makes you productive.

Also, sorry for not ordering coffee. Novo tastes like vom and I already had first and second coffee for the day. I hate myself for getting chai, too, okay? You can let me steep in my worthlessness without adding your own disdain. 

To be fair, they said goodbye as I left... rather happily. TOO happily? I&#39;ll take what I can get.

The space is definitely fun.  Bright, happy colors.  A black ceiling framework--perhaps hinting at a previous life as an office--revealing cheery pipes beyond.  But, most importantly, it&#39;s quiet!  There is a more social space in the first room with cozy chairs and music, but the second room is intended to be a workspace with big tables and super quiet comrades.  I love this dynamic.  It can be whatever you need it to be!  You can float between the spaces and accomplish your separate missions of socialization and work-a-holism.  Or, if you are singularly focused, you can sprawl out on a giant wooden table, take off your shoes, and dig your toes into the furry rug while making progress on a thesis proposal.

I enjoyed the cold brew &#34;rocks,&#34; which the kindly barista explained is cold brewed coffee served espresso style on ice.  And a day-old raisin bran muffin for $1.  Thank you for not throwing out your old pastries; there are cheapos like me who want them real bad!!!  I was there for a long time, so later got some Elderberry Hibiscus Kombucha which I thought would be a Boulder-style cure to my sickness (spoiler alert: it did not help) and a veggie burrito that was served with love.  Nothing special, but maybe if you&#39;re into Kombucha, you&#39;d be excited about this sort of thing.  There are a wealth of food options, including Udi&#39;s sandwiches, local burritos, house pastries, and so on.  An ample selection, indeed.

I&#39;m a bit of a coffee snob (there you go, I said it!), and this place is seriously the bees knees.  I cannot stress enough now delicious the coffee was, and it&#39;s all locally-sourced!  This place just keeps getting better.  The barista was extremely helpful at suggesting a roast to suit my tastes (this particular day I was feeling a roast with some subtle chocolate notes), and even gave me my specialty roast for the cost of their standard drip since it was my first time, which I really appreciated.  

I absolutely cannot wait to go back!"

I have gotten lattes and drip coffees, both really good, better than other coffee shops.  Recently I got a soy chai, most recent craving.  But I ordered in and spent some time on their wifi.
Boy was it loud.  Loud girls talking about their dates.  The music in the main room was loud.  The meeting room was full so I couldn&#39;t go in there.  The lighting was very dim on a Sunday evening.  If you want to work, try and get a seat in the back room.  Otherwise this is more of a chill and talk with your friend coffee shop.
The soy chai was fantastic though.  Not too sweet.  And the barista was super nice.  Wifi was solid, no loss of connection."

I wish they had better insulating glasses/mugs though, coming in here during winter it can get a bit cold too sitting down ...if you&#39;re not sitting at the table by the fire, also my drink usually is luke warm/cold in a couple minutes too. Not sure if they just don&#39;t heat it up high enough so people don&#39;t burn themselves or what. Either way, still delicious so I&#39;m ordering it anyways.

I am sure a kid has licked each item at that coffee bar. 

No, I am fine doing a quick Yelp search for the nearest and greatest coffee in the area. Fluid popped up as being, basically, around the corner from my hotel after this search, so I headed on over. 

Fluid is in a fairly nice looking, fairly new, fairly modern, fairly clean building. What is great is that when you head inside, it is a really cute local coffee shop with art on the walls and a great selection of to-go beverages.

Similar to all of those local, salt-of-the-earth coffee shops, the service was not warm, but it was efficient. That is all I need it to be, so I was satisfied. I ordered an almond milk latte (so many coffee shops don&#39;t even carry almond milk-- bonus) and it was excellent. Nice work, Fluid. Stop on by.

- This isn&#39;t it.

Hot inside. Always packed. Not optimized for the amount of foot traffic. Slow service. Sticky cheap wobbly tables.

Pros:
- It&#39;s here
- It&#39;s cheap
- They have coffee

Unacceptable annoyances:
- Lukewarm coffee. Always.
- Constantly out of said lukewarm coffee you get to make yourself.
- No selection of milk. Really?
- Wobbly patio tables and chairs INSIDE.
- AC rarely on in the summer.
- Slow service. 

Yes, I know this sounds complain(Y). 
But please, if you just could have a) hot coffee b) tables that don&#39;t spill it c) milk? d) service
- I&#39;d be happy with that.

Honestly any combination of these would work.

Not my choice but my client&#39;s. I can&#39;t get past the shitty service. I could go on and describe everything else about the shop but what&#39;s the point when every time you come in you have to deal with the 2 hipster bros who shouldn&#39;t be working at all with the public. They were bothered every single time I made an order and acted like such hipster douches the whole time from taking the order, to ringing me up to making my drink. Then they both would go and take their smoke break at the same time so if you wanted a drink during that 20 minutes, you&#39;d have to wait until the hipster bros came back to give you shitty service. 
I&#39;m sure the owner is great and I hope for the owner&#39;s sake that they realize how shitty their evening staff is.

This coffee shop is setup as a meeting/work space and really caters to the professionals who enjoy going to a coffee house to work.  

First, their coffee is great!  I had a latte and a cafe au lait and both were very good, smooth, and rich.  Fluid uses NOVO beans.  I have no idea what these are but the coffee I had was very good.  

I also had a scone and I was not impressed by its quality.  I have the impression that there isn&#39;t sufficient turnover of the baked goods, or maybe it&#39;s just the dry Denver air, but the scone was kind of dried out despite being wrapped in plastic.  I cannot recommend the baked goods.

The meeting spaces at Fluid are really a gem and are some of the best I have ever seen at a coffee shop.  This shop is setup to hold meetings of any type.  You can reserve the meeting spaces online.  Additionally, they have computers available for those without one of their own.  I am not sure of the costs, but I did notice a sign allowing you to print for various prices.  Of course, the WiFi is excellent.  

In addition to the meeting spaces that include several rooms and seating arrangements (stools at bars, tables and chairs of various sizes, and sofas; and tables and chairs outside as well) the shop also has a beautiful fireplace with mosaic tiles laid atop it.  

In sum, Fluid is a great place to work and enjoy a nice coffee."

The guys behind the counter were really friendly (and cute!!) and managed to sell me on a nice large iced coffee with some coconut caramels. Apparently the coffee is cold-brewed, dripping for 17hrs and using twice the amount of beans and is basically more awesome! Unfortunately it just tasted burnt. As in, I&#39;d almost rather go to Starbucks burnt. I brought it back to work and it ended up sitting on my table the rest of the day, untouched. I drank maybe half before tossing.

All these rave reviews tells me I should at least give them a second try? Maybe I got a bad batch...

With the opening of Fluid&#39;s Meeting Spaces, there are even more tables and outlet spaces (when the meeting spaces aren&#39;t in use), which I appreciate. Parking can be tight in this area, but I tend to park in the apartment residential garage, as there is some &#34;retail&#34; parking in the garage. It&#39;s worked for me for several occasions.

1) Wake me the hell up. Contrary to what my schedule of waking up at 7 in the morning might have you think, I&#39;m not actually a morning person and I require a TON of caffeine to get moving in the morning. Fluid makes a damn fine cup of coffee or chai or tea. Nick, who I think might be the manager because he&#39;s always there, is awesome and he has a drink named after him: the Nickerdoodle.

2) A good place to park it with my laptop for a while. Yes, Fluid has free wifi. In fact, I would say if ever there was a coffee shop designed for sitting and working for a while, this is the place. I mean, they even have desktops set up so that you can use those in a pinch if you need.

3) Excellent meeting space. Most coffee shops have a couch or one large table for you to use if you&#39;re having a larger meeting of friends or coworkers. Not Fluid. They have an entire meeting room complete with chairs and several large tables as well as an impressive AV display. 

So, whether you just need that extra jolt to wake you up, or you need a casual space to have a meeting, I think Fluid is a pretty good place. 

Oh, and they serve Novo Coffee, which, you know, is my absolute favorite."

Fluid Coffee Bar is in the Uptown area, which is a very nice area. If you haven&#39;t been, you need to park, and walk around.

Interior - bright, cheery, welcoming, colorful, and clean!

Prices - decent, typical for a coffee place

Menu - varied, pretty much whatever you are in the mood or need for, including some pastries. 

There is a room in the back which you can rent, although I&#39;m not in the need for a meeting place right now.  

Parking - street, which can be a hassle.  So, bring a coat, and wear some comfortable shoes, in case you have to walk a block or two.

Whenever we have been here, there have always been people/customers, sitting around, surfing the web on their computers, or using one of the computers in the coffee bar. I&#39;m assuming you pay a flat hourly fee, but not sure, so don&#39;t quote me on that.  A

    Nevertheless, I was served promptly. The wall décor and interior could use a facelift. Some spots had art while other huge areas were left blank. My wife and I looked through the board game section and it was pretty sad, old dusty versions of crappy classics and everything was dirty. 
     What was the worst was the condition of the men&#39;s restroom. Upon entering, your greeted with a strong combination of urine and cleaning supplies. The tile grout is completely black with mildew and its even traveling up the wall. This is unsanitary, there serving food and drinks for Christ sakes. I would expect to see this sort of bathroom in a dive bar. Im all about shopping local, but this place is just an example of lazy management/ownership. If anyone knows a clean, modern, locally owned coffee shop please message me."

On Sunday afternoon, exhausted from a weekend of traveling and other merriment, the boyfriend and I were really just looking for somewhere that we&#39;d be able to kill a few hours.  And I am SO glad that I looked at Yelp and found Fluid (instead of going to Barnes &amp; Noble like he suggested).

The coffee drinks were really good: made and served well.  We found space on a comfortable couch and lounged with our coffee for a while.  Wasn&#39;t going to happen that day, but I liked the selection of board games and the bookshelves with old books for reading was a really nice touch.  And free wifi pushed it up to the 5-star mark.

Hope to return!"

Back to the price, my family of five eats out often, I have never spent $100.00 at a single $ rated Restaraunt until tonight.  And then the gratuity was automatically added to my bill.  We were not in a combined party.  Two adults, three children = auto gratuity?   Wow.

I have nothing to report on the food front other than they were generous and attentive when it came to providing chips and salsa.

Though I was expecting more of a menu selection, the meal i selected didn&#39;t disappoint. I order the baked eggs with Sausage and grits. Dee-lish-us! Initially, the eggs were a little under cooked for my liking, but after a few more minutes in the oven, I could not have been more pleased. 

My travel companion had the chicken and waffles, he seemed to enjoy his meal.  The chicken, though it was well browned could have been cooked a few minutes longer. Honey butter was great. Loved the bottomless mimosa. And the service, both today and last night was great.

The only reason I am not giving it a 4 was because they advertised this brunch as one with live music. I&#39;ve been here for an hour and a half and haven&#39;t seen a performer."

Overall my experience here was pretty awful. My date and I ordered the Gumbo, the Mac and Cheese, and the Catfish with a side of grits. 

The mac and cheese was extremely salty, and about half of the dish was a thin watery pool of cheese sauce. No other flavor, just salt. Both my date and I had to chug our waters and  cocktails afterwards.

The grits were hard, and gluey. It was the consistency of a soft cement. If you turned the bowl of grits upside down, the grits wouldn&#39;t fall out. Very thick and hard. I&#39;ve never had grits like this. Not to mention. It had no flavor. Very bland. That coupled with the consistency was very very odd.

The Gumbo had one shrimp in it and was very salty like the macaroni and cheese. The single piece of shrimp was as tough and chewy like a tire.

The catfish was overcooked. Very tough for fish. 

I was a bit disappointed with the service as well. The server would ask us how the food was, and we told her what was mentioned above and she argued with us, saying that &#34;grits are supposed to be bland.&#34; I&#39;ll never forget that line. Mainly because it doesn&#39;t really help make their food that they are serving sound any more delicious. If we were offered another serving, why would I want grits that are &#34;supposed to be bland?&#34; 

The manager came to our table and thanked us for the feedback and offered to remove the mac and cheese from our check and give us a local discount since I live across the street. When the check came, there was no discount and we were charged for the mac and cheese. At that point, we just wanted to leave and be done with the place for good, so we paid and left. 

Overall, the food was just plain awful. The service was downright strange and the information they gave us was misleading, which was odd because we were really nice and patient for customers that spent a lot of money for gross food. I don&#39;t think I will ever return to Jezebel in the near future. Maybe  I will. After all, the décor was pretty nice."

My friend wanted a slice of tomato but waitress didn&#39;t think that would be possible but if it was, there&#39;d be an upcharge. Since there wouldn&#39;t be a down charge if I left tomato off my sammie, I asked for them on the side and gave them to my friend. Easy solution, but really should have said yes to a slice of tomato in the first place. 

Our server was mostly attentive, but I still had to hunt down plain sugar for my coffee, since my coffee was getting cold and she had disappeared for awhile. Highly recommend the yardbird with sweet potato fries. If you have eggs, don&#39;t get them sunny side up. Not sure how they&#39;re cooked, but yolks look runny, but aren&#39;t. Pick a biscuit over cornbread. A sentence I never bought I&#39;d write!  Bacon and sausage are terrific. Last, but not least, the patio is dog friendly.

I must say our waitress was extremely sweet, but everything else seemed a bit bleh.

It wasn&#39;t very busy in here at 8 PM on a Saturday night, which isn&#39;t always the best sign. We tried to sit outside but it was a bit chilly (the fire pits they have are pretty but they&#39;re for show, not actual heat). We opted to move inside, and then I was surprised by how warm it was. Almost too warm to enjoy. :|

I ordered the gluten free fried chicken with mashed potatoes and made sure the waitress knew I had celiacs. She told me I couldn&#39;t eat the cornbread which is totally fine, but it still came out on my plate pressed against my chicken and potatoes, which isn&#39;t good for someone like me. I made sure not to touch anything the cornbread touched, but I was still skeptical about the rest of my meal after that. I also ordered a greyhound and was brought a screwdriver instead. Citrus, vodka, close enough. I drank it and the waitress brought me the correct drink for my second round!

I must say the fried chicken itself was very good, and I enjoyed the spicy collard greens as well. The portions were huuuuuge though. You get a ton of fried chicken on that plate. 

Enjoyable music and atmosphere and food that seems to be made with a lot of thought (although the bread pudding -- which I didn&#39;t eat of course -- looked sooo dry and crumbly.. that was kind of weird).

But the entire experience was 3 stars at best. We visited today during Sunday brunch and it was bustling. We sat outside but two of the four seats were sat in the sun (no shade), so it was super hot but we had no other options. My friend and I ordered the bottomless mimosas, which we joked should be renamed bottomfull since on every occasion we finished drinking the small champagne flute, we did not get a refill for 10-15 minutes. Granted, they were super busy during brunch time and our waiter was very nice. But he seemed to be the only waiter serving the outside tables and he often forgot about us. 

Between the time we sat down and finally got our cards returned so we could leave, it was 2.5 hours! One of my friends had to leave early because it took so long. But alright, lets talk food. Brunch is served every Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 3pm. We ordered the fried chicken and waffles because of other Yelp reviews, but thought they were ok. We decided that the best way to describe the dish was &#34;as expected&#34;. I mean, chicken and waffles, yum no doubt. But nothing special to it. We also ordered the country eggs benedict, which came with collared greens for a unique twist. But it just didn&#39;t taste very good together.

I came for the gluten free fried chicken. Because gluten. free. fried. chicken. That&#39;s my dream. And it was awesome -- nothing to complain about, except I couldn&#39;t eat all of it, and I really, really wanted to but I was too full.

That being said -- it wasn&#39;t even my favorite part of the meal.

First, our waitress was awesome. 5 star service for sure.

Secondly, they brought us deviled eggs. I didn&#39;t think I liked deviled eggs, because my mom&#39;s are terrible. These were not terrible. I want to go back to Denver just to eat these deviled eggs.

Third, and my favorite part of the meal -- the black eyed peas were sent straight from heaven. I don&#39;t know what kind of magic they used, but I have legitimately dreamed about them. The gluten free fried chicken may not have been finished - but every last bite of these were. And who eats black eyed peas over fried chicken, especially when you have Celiac disease and never get fried chicken? Nobody.

Our first experience in 2013 was fantastic! Excellent shrimp and fried chicken that was incredible. Adding a Bloody Mary with candied bacon was icing on the awesome cake of dining experiences.

But then... We went again with friends after talking the place up, swearing it was amazing. 1 fried chicken burned (not just burned, but the chicken crossed the road through hell burned). We sent it back and the server was kind about it all. Then it came out undercooked and COLD ( not just cold, but the chicken crossed the road in Antarctica and froze in the middle of the street.  They comped the meal but it was good because we all lost our appetite.

But then... The following six times we tried desperately to reach the excellence of the first meal like a couple of junkies needing a crack fix- it all went DOWNHILL- no more candied bacon in the bloody Mary&#39;s, food so salty it belongs in a nursing home and orders wrong, poor staffing etc.

Makes me sad to say we won&#39;t give it a 9th try no matter why the chicken crossed the road."

It was a little early so it wasn&#39;t terribly packed so we were able to snatch a table on the patio. 

We ordered gumbo to start and it was really super! I&#39;m usually not the biggest fan but I would have this one any day of the week. My entree, the catfish, was just alright. I guess I expected more based on what I&#39;ve had at other places. My girlfriend had the chicken and waffles, which was good especially with chicken breast. We were just both disappointed that we were not told of the up charge. And our service was a bit slow so that is something to consider if you&#39;re planning to dine here."

The sign on their door mentions coming in to feed your soul and we slowed down and did just that. 

When we walked in we were warmly greeted by the whole staff. In particular one of the chefs, Rick James, was outgoing and engaging- we had a genuine conversation and it felt like we were catching up with a friend. Our waitress Barbara was great too and was very knowledgable about their many craft cocktails. The service is not quick - nor is it meant to be so if you are in a hurry this is not the place for you. All part of the southern charm! 

The food was scrumptious. My husband got the yard bird - breaded chicken with fried pickles sandwich - he let me have a nibble (of the non-pickle end) and the breading was light and the chicken was juicy. There was a variety of sides to choose from and he went with the Cajun fries- they were too spicy for me but I am a big wimp! I got the scallop salad with strawberries and a side of raspberry poppyseed dressing.  The portion of lettuce was huge with five good sized scallops wrapped in perfectly cooked bacon- not too crispy. They also have a happy hour starting at 3 pm with reduced price appetizers and drinks. 

We enjoyed a leisurely lunch will happily return."

Went here for brunch after church on a Sunday, we didn&#39;t have reservations. Told by one guy (who we thought was the host) that the wait would be around 20 minutes. Never saw that guy again. Service seemed lethargic and unorganized, only saving grace (and only reason for the second star) was the bartender who was super nice. We kept seeing food that had already been served being sent back to the kitchen and just didn&#39;t get a good vibe about the place. And the Voodooo Bloody was so spicy and Tobasco Sauce flavored, my mouth was on fire for 30 minutes and I couldn&#39;t finish it.  After 30 minutes of waiting we decided to go across the street to Old Major who also had multiple flavors of bottomless mimosas, but the best food and Bloodies I&#39;ve had in a while!"

Missus and I had the 1/2 buttermilk fried chicken, the ribs, and somehow we managed to eat it all.  The service was impeccable.  The employees that crossed our table genuinely cared about providing service and THAT, ladies and gents, is what it&#39;s all about.   

Buttermilk fried chicken.  Holy cow!!!!!!...err chicken!  The batter and crust was medium thickness, very crisp but not burnt, packed FULL of punchy flavors.  This is chicken unlike any other chicken to grace the streets of Denver. Crispy crust outside, juicy deliciousness inside and finger lickin good!  Face it Denver, (it hurts, but) this city doesn&#39;t know fried chicken.  I&#39;m glad Jezebel moved in! 

Collard greens.  I thought about moving this to the top, and deleting everything else I wrote.  I can&#39;t put it into words.  What you see on the plate does NOTHING to prepare you for the wholesome goodness packed in these greens. After one bite, it&#39;s clear that a LOT of love goes into these collard greens. A little acid, a little spice, soft and delicious without being stringy or mushy. These are worth the trip to Jezebel, alone! 

Ribs.  Yup, they got it mastered.  The ribs are barely clutching to the bones and the meat is fall-apart delicious.  But somehow, someway, they managed to build in a slightly crisp exterior.  The texture is outrageous.  crispy outside, warm and tender inside....A+  The homespun BBQ sauce is tangy and pairs very well with the ribs.  

Mashed Potatoes - I tasted a heavy presence of sour cream.  The potatoes were unique and very much complemented the other items on the plate.  A bit more sour than I preferred, but that flavor helped to cut through the thick flavor of the fried chicken 

So you&#39;re thinking, why 4 stars?  It&#39;s nitpicky.... like the judges on top chef....  Read on if you must, 

Cornbread was a little too dense and the green beans lacked a little seasoning."

I was in town for business and had a hunkering for southern/Cajun cuisine.  Of course I did a Google search and came across this place.  The reviews on Yelp were all over the place.  I didn&#39;t know what to think.  I decided to give it a try and convinced my colleagues o do the same.  I am glad that I did!

The fried chicken that I had was scrumptious.  Perfectly seasoned and flavored with a crispy, but light crust.  Nicely done!  My colleagues split an order of the ribs. And still managed to share a piece with me.  I still don&#39;t know how they get the outside of the ribs to be so crispy, but the meat tender and pulling off the bone.  

I wish I visited Denver more often.  Nicely done, Jezebels. Get some plainer flavors of Little Man ice cream though!  I want to try, but that line is always so darn long, and your selections were two exotic!"

It was early still, so we got a lovely patio seat. I liked the vibe and they played lovely 70&#39;s tunes that really put me in a good mood. We settled on the Traditional Gumbo to start, and the &#34;cup&#34; was big enough for both of us to share. The Gumbo was D-E-Licious, with amazing flavor and true southern kick. I&#39;m not a fan of shrimp, but luckily they only put shrimp on the top of the gumbo, so it was easily picked out by my boyfriend. My boyfriend got the fish and I, of course, got Chicken and Waffles. After I ordered I overheard the waitress tell someone that you could swap the chicken for breast meat, and I asked her if it was too late to switch. The kitchen gladly switched my order, which was very kind! The fish was tasty, not incredible, but the chicken and waffles were spectacular. Thick, crunchy batter covered moist chicken breast, with a perfectly cooked waffle to accompany it! I really enjoyed them both. 

Their were two disappointments though. Service is slow...southern style slow. We weren&#39;t in a hurry, so it was not a big deal, but I have read a few other reviews that talked about slowness, and I definitely observed that they are in no rush here. The other thing was that there was an upcharge for changing my chicken to breast meat and the waitress did not mention it, even as she dropped the check off. It was a $4 difference for chicken breasts, which was quite the surprise, and I wish she would have mentioned at the time I wanted to change my order.

But, I enjoyed the atmosphere and food and would come back next time I&#39;m craving some southern cooking."

It took our waiter awhile to get our food order, and the food was very underwhelming. I had chicken and waffles and it was very salty. Aside from the salt I didn&#39;t taste that much flavor, and the waffle texture was a bit too hard/stale tasting. I wasn&#39;t in love with the atmosphere where we were sitting ether.

Deviled eggs: great! hard to go wrong here. Especially when they ask you if you want to add bacon. Always add bacon.
Chicken Wings: Very tasty. Not mind blowing.
Catfish Nuggets: The dredge/breading needs more spice. The fish is quality though.
Brussel Sprouts: Also hard to go wrong here.
Shrimp and Grits: Eh. Good but nothing special.
Stuffed Pepper: Delicious filling, kinda soggy pepper though.
Red Velvet Cake: Fine
Carrot Cake: Delicious Cream Cheese Frosting!!
Lemon Cake: Fine.

All the waiters and waitresses are nice (at least now, I think the douchey one I had the first time has been fired). The place is cute inside. Great highlands location. AND I AM GOING BACK TO TRY HAPPY HOUR. Any place that has HH till 7 is good in my book and they have a TON of specials. 

Also. I GOTTA go back for brunch. If only to try the FLIGHT OF BLOODY MARYS on the menu. I bet I&#39;ll add more stars after I drink that.

(If they had a decent website that showed their lunch menu this wouldn&#39;t have happened, but that&#39;s an aside.)

They said they would subsitute another side for the waffles, so I got fried chicken wings and sweet potato fries.  As soon as I started eating, my annoyance with them disappeared.  The fried chicken was outstanding, and the sweet potato fries were fresh and delicious.

Jezebel&#39;s has a really great selection of cocktails that were interesting enough that I otherwise might not have tried. We were both really happy with the drinks, and enjoyed them sitting out on the patio while watching highlanders walk by. 

We opted for fried green tomato caprese salad as an appetizer, which was really delicious. For entrees, we split the southern fried chicken salad. Also really tasty, and HUGE -- easily shareable.

It would be a shame if the service can&#39;t match the caliber of food. 

In a nutshell, our food was top notch, but the service was pretty slow. I&#39;ll be back though to see if it was an off night!"

The fried chicken at Lou&#39;s food bar knocks the socks off the stuff they serve here. The service is great, so they got that going for them.

11:00 AM Brunch  on 8/14/16. I was looking forward to the visit because of their southern bias on many of the menu items ( having lived in several southern states for  number of years ).
The table service was painfully slow and it took forever just to get what tasted like frozen concentrated O.J. It took forever to place the main order. Longs waits and loud place to sit on hard wood seats to receive your food. Once the order was placed the food cam with a reasonable period of time. It was a plain order of bacon, eggs, home fries and a southern  biscuit. The eggs were between cold and a little warm, two pieces of bacon and what like like
mini frozen home fries. The biscuit had little or no taste and felt like a heavy lump of dough.
The waitress had an attitude an was basically very unfriendly and had no interest in our preferences or dining satisfaction. Fortunately there are a lot of other good choices in LoHi. Would not recommend or ever return. Having been in the restaurant business, for more years than I would like to admit: There is a big difference between a great idea/theme/recipes and executing it successfully day in and day out. They need someone with operating experience and expertise, if they hope to survive."

It wasn&#39;t busy (unlike Rootdown), so we were seated immediately. We ordered bottomless mimosas, which at first were coming out with way more orange juice than desired, but they got the ratio right after a couple. 

We both got the veggie entree with two eggs over easy and cornbread. The waiter told us this was his favorite item on the brunch menu. It was pretty good, nothing phenomenal, but nothing to complain about. The hash browns were the same. The cornbread was a bit dry, but I ate it all anyway, so I guess it wasn&#39;t that bad either. 

I don&#39;t have anything negative to say about this place. I guess it was just a tad bit underwhelming."

They have a great tap beer list and a very nice selection of whiskies.  In fact, they offer whisky flights.  YESS!!!

We tried the fried pickles and I had the Southern Fried Chicken Salad.  It was absolutely amazing.  The cornbread croutons made for a very nice change up, and that chicken is excellent, tasty, and tender.  As the name suggests, the food is southern style.  Po&#39; Boys and fried okra, chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits will make any southern food lover flock to this haven.

Ordered two drinks, and waited for another ten minutes. Once drinks came, waited for another ten minutes to order food. 

Food came and it was good - not great. Ordered Catfish Fingers appetizer and the bigger pieces were raw! Yuck! 

Empty plates and empty drink glasses sat on the table for, you guessed it, a solid ten more minutes.

The Catfish nuggets were cook perfect as far as the jerk chicken wings they were cooked good but as far as the jerk seasoning it could be a little bit better all I tasted was the spice..... We ordered the large plate of chicken and waffles the waffle was delicious and I loved the butter and the syrup as far as the fried chicken it was cooked perfectly but it didn&#39;t have to much of a seasoning like they just battered and fried it.... It was piping hot so  I know it was fresh but it needed a little pizzazz some kind of seasoning overall it was a great experience.....

I brought a MeetInDenver group here for brunch one Sunday afternoon. Yes, afternoon. I like to sleep in on my weekends and I love that Jezebel&#39;s serves brunch late. Our reservation for 1pm was perfect and they had both breakfast and lunch entrees for us. 

$10 bottomless mimosas. Awesome.

My chicken and waffles was great. Three huge fried wings atop a big belgian waffle with plenty of butter and syrup. Delicious. 

They can totally do separate checks for your group, just make sure and let them know at the beginning of the meal.

It was busy, but looked manageable and the hostess told us it would be about a 15-20 min wait which didn&#39;t seem bad. There wasn&#39;t room to wait inside, so we sat outside despite it being about 40°. She told us she would send out a server to get us drinks.
About 10 mins passed and the server popped out and said she would &#34;be right back&#34; but didn&#39;t come back for about 10 more mins. By this point we thought we would be sat, but still ordered drinks. After about 10 more mins I checked in with the hostess and she said it would be at least 15 more mins. At this point seats had opened up at the bar and I found it disheartening no one informed us, since it was so cold. 
We sat at the bar and the woman bartender never checked in with us. We watched 2 4-tops clear out and were hoping one was for us. It took at least 10 additional mins just to flip the tables. A group who appeared to be leaving even sat at one table while they waited for their party to use the restroom. 
By this point we asked the bartender if we could just order food at the bar since clearly we weren&#39;t getting a table any time soon. We thought about leaving, but didn&#39;t want to walk somewhere else and start the process over. 
Finally we were sat, it had been an hour since we had been quoted a 15 min wait. I understand you can&#39;t control the pace of the other patrons, but it didn&#39;t appear that anyone had a sense of urgency or cared to check in with us. Since I teach customer service and professionalism for a living, I am fairly sensitive to it and was not impressed with how we were treated. The food was OK, but not worth the ordeal. Not sure if I will make the effort to return, and definitely not without a reservation."

The prices were totally reasonable. I ordered something I imagine most people don&#39;t get -- the stuffed pepper. I enjoyed it and I was happy to see that the restaurant had several hearty vegetarian dishes. I don&#39;t know why more places can&#39;t do this. I ordered the fried green tomato appetizer and I wasn&#39;t particularly thrilled with it. The coating was really thin and weak and you could barely taste the tomato at all. The pepper jelly was also a little overpowering for the dish. It was a decent portion, so there was that. The rib tips were pretty good and were a solid portion for $8. I feel like it&#39;s close to the portion of the full rib order that&#39;s $19. So in short, get the appetizer portion. The collards and mashed potatoes were pretty decent but the corn bread was pretty terrible. I can&#39;t imagine how you mess up corn bread. And last, the fried chicken. It was fine. A little bland if anything but still good. Total bill for 2 drinks, 2 apps, and 2 entrees was $75, so overall, not bad."

Our server Roxy was new, told us so, and taking that into account was both friendly and helpful. It was likely not her fault the kitchen was S L O W.

First issue was the drinks. 7:30 PM on a Wednesday. Ran out of the infused tequila after one drink, so no more pineapple margaritas. Switched to watermelon, ran out of that after a few as well. 

The brussel sprout appetizer was overly vinegared, tasty but a bit overpowering. The fried green tomato caprese was nicely presented, but the fried tomatoes lacked any complexity or seasoning. 

Same with dinner. Birthday girl had the fried seafood; they substituted more shrimp in place of catfish which was very nice. But, this and the gluten-free fried chicken were devoid of any southern spice beyond salt. Bland and tasteless is the only comment I can make on the fried food, to the point maybe they just forgot the spices in the frying batter. Collard greens were also just salty. 

All in all, for $140 for a party of 3 it was underwhelming. 

There was a single dessert choice and despite noting the birthday in the reservation, there was no recognition of that occasion with even an offer of a birthday dessert. 

Maybe it was an off night -- every restaurant has one. But even considering the past reviews and the hype, it&#39;s unlikely we will return. Oh, and they forgot to award my 5-star point for the visit, even after asking me to put my phone # on the credit card charge."

I have been all over the south and I am here to tell you the Fried Chicken that was on my plate was the Absolute Best bite of Chicken I have had in my life. And at one point my wife told me I ate so much chicken I was going to grow feathers out of my arse. So I consider myself somewhat a connoisseur by default. Not to mention the Bottomless Mimosas, and yes they keep them flowing. My beautiful daughter had the Kids Waffle and Fruit which came with a Hearty side of Bacon. She was very impressed as well. My wife had the garden omelette and could only eat half. All around service was amazing and something else that was totally cool, the chef himself came out and asked how it was.

When my husband and I walked in, the waitress was about to seat us, then the guy I think was the manager with slicked back hair barely acknowledged us as he couldn&#39;t decide which one of the countless empty tables to seat us at. He was kind of a dick but whatever, we weren&#39;t there to hang out with him so we weren&#39;t too phased. The waitress gave us horrible service the entire time. Everything about it was just an annoyance but we figured as long as the food is good, we can deal. The food was not good. It seems like a chef set the menu, then abandoned ship here.

My husband had the smoked crab eggs Benedict. First, the hollaindase was cold. Second, the eggs were way over cooked and looked like hard boiled yolks it was so over cooked. Really? Cold hollaindase on hard poached eggs? It&#39;s really not hard to poach eggs correctly and the whole basis of eggs Benedict is having runny yolks. No dice. I was hoping to at least politely tell the waitress whoever was cooking that batch of eggs kept them in way too long but she never even came to check in. 

I had the chicken &#34;wings&#34; and waffles. First, if you write on the menu that they specifically come withv3 chicken wings and serve them with 2 chicken tenderloins, no good. The chicken had a really heavy and tasteless breading on them that just fell off and had the consistency of chicken finger breading. Yuck. The waffle batter resembled pre mixed batter. Not good. I looove fried chicken and love waffles but this was not good at all.

Overall, the slicked back hair dude was a dick, service was absolutely horrendous and the food was even worse. OH! I also had their bloody Mary which tasted like a salt lick. Worst bloody I&#39;ve honestly ever had and it took her 15 min to make that p.o.s. 

Jezebel&#39;s, you have potential but you need to get your act together with your service and food."

Let&#39;s start with what Jezebel did well. The fried chicken is gluten-free and delicious. The chicken was tender and the coating was delicious and a bit unique(did I taste cinnamon?!?).  The fried Brussels sprouts, fried pickles and lemon cake were also scrumptious. I&#39;m still thinking about the lemon cake. But even with these highs, I can&#39;t be distracted from the mighty lows we experienced tonight. 

We came to Jezebels for restaurant week, excited to try a new restaurant in our neighborhood. We ordered our drinks and then our waiter came up. He, before anything, let us know that he, &#34;might be bailing in the middle of dinner.&#34;  Well...okay then. Good to know. When our other guests arrived we were set to order. We ordered fried okra to start; they were out. I ordered catfish nuggets; they were out. We ordered cups of gumbo all around to start. I ordered shrimp and grits, my friends ordered fried catfish, ribs and fried chicken. 

The gumbo was delivered, my friends got thiers before I got mine. The waiter delivered them hot sauce(sans a cap on the Tabasco...?). My gumbo still was not there. Then my gumbo came. It was cold and looked like it had been sitting under a heating lamp: there was a ring to show it had evaporated! I noticed my compadres has corn bread. I looked for mine. No where to be seen, but there were a few stray crumbs on my plate. I asked he waiter what those crumbs might be and he responded, I shit you not: &#34;that&#39;s where cornbread use to be.&#34;  I asked if he thought that was odd and he begrudgingly said yes and he would get me more. Eventually I got more cornbread but I couldn&#39;t finish my gumbo. It was cold, old and the fun was gone. 

Once our entrees arrived it seemed like we were being Punk&#39;d. Shrimp and grits was grits with gumbo poured over it.  They were cold. At this point all we could do was laugh. It seemed like such a mess.

The chef(and I think owner?) came out and asked how our meal was. We have him honest feedback and he was very receptive. He paid for many items in our ticket and picked up a drink for us. He also provided a gift certificate to come back and try them again. And we will. The chef and owner single-handedly redeemed Jezebels. I hope to provide an updated review with a much improved experience. But that waiter has got to go-he was a grumpapotomous that only smiled and seemed happy when it came time for the tip. Well, this ain&#39;t my first rodeo and you can&#39;t polish a turd."

Hint: it wasn&#39;t salt.  I had the blackened catfish with yams and collards and both the fish and the greens were way over-seasoned.  And that&#39;s coming from someone who really loves salt.  The prices are pretty high but the one upside is that the portions are very generous.

Apart from the food, the service was equally disappointing.  There was a small misunderstanding with our waiter who thought we had told him we weren&#39;t ordering food.  I forgave his neglect after we cleared that issue up, but afterwards he continued to ignore us.  At one point, we ordered a drink and watched as it sat on the end of the bar for 10 minutes.  Eventually, another server brought it over.

This place is really close to home and they have a good enough looking happy hour, plus I really liked the ambiance, but based on all the other negative reviews and my own underwhelming experience, I&#39;m not sure if I can convince myself to go back."

Brought her a cake in and they glade held the cake for us and decided to wait till after they brought the cake and plates to tell us that they charge a cake cutting fee. However they didn&#39;t cut our cake but told us it covered using there plates and forks. I found them to be very backdoor with there practices. I also found the service to be lackluster.

Waited over 20 minutes for water while bees were swarming at us on the patio. The owner informed us that &#34;yellow jackets don&#39;t sting&#34; so not to be worried. Multiple parties were talking about how long it took to get served and I saw many people leave. Not to mention there was one waitress working. ?? Confused. They were super rude too.

I met a friend for brunch and I felt we were rushed through our meal. In fact, a manager came up to our table to tell us they had a reservation for our table and asked could we pay our check. When we left, we noticed several open tables and no one waiting. The other Yelp reviews about the service are spot on. Had the service been good, I wouldn&#39;t have even bothered with a review, but I&#39;ve never been asked to leave a table! Sooo....as for the food, I ordered the chicken and waffles...the chicken was very salty and tasted as if it had been fried in old grease. You get three chicken wings on top of a this waffle. My friend got the omelette, it was okay. We both got the bottomless mimosas...it&#39;s more like bottomless orange juice and you see the bottom a lot. There are way too many restaurants in Denver that do brunch right to choose a place with poor service and mediocre food.  Very disappointed."

The basil pesto hummus is the best hummus I&#39;ve had. I tried their white beans today and the seasoning is so good!

They were great, and the white beans that come with them is a nice touch because protein! The salad was a generous serving and I appreciate that they let you dress it yourself with the dressing on the table.

We tried the hummus trio appetizer (roasted red pepper hummus, basil pesto hummus, and original), the chicken kabobs with rice and salad, and the steak kabobs with potatoes and roasted vegetables. We thought all of the food was delicious.  All of the flavors of hummus were spot on (the basil pesto was amazing and my personal favorite). The chicken kabobs were great (I added some Greek salad dressing on them for a little more flavor), the rice was delicious, as well as the salad.  The steak kabobs were amazing! The potatoes were delicious and I&#39;m not a fan of broccoli, but my husband said it was good.  We are so happy that we were given a chance to try out Zoe&#39;s Kitchen.

Loved the mustard sauce on it. All the employees were also kind and smiling. They didn&#39;t seem seriously busy for just opening which concerns me. They will pick up this weekend since they aren&#39;t necessarily visible from 120th. Once foot traffic impacts this weekend they will gain regulars. Highly recommended.

My husband has tried the gruban which he said was very good and the tuna pita sandwich which he said he would definitely order again, and was among the best tuna sandwiches he&#39;s ever had.

How could I when I&#39;ve never been there? I read another review of an onion allergy which I also have, and simply asked if I could get mine without it and he said no you can order something else. I got the steak kabobs, which have onions on them (I just took them off, as long as I don&#39;t ingest them I&#39;m okay) It looked and smelled great but the meat was raw inside!

I ordered. We sat and he turned to me. Where are we? What kind of food is this? It&#39;s typical to have this conversation with him. So I said to him. Read the wifi password. It says &#34;bigknish&#34;. He did and looking right at me said.&#34; Yeah and?&#34; Omg! lol! 

To top this story he actually ordered Rabi I&#39;m Confused! Haha! I know! It&#39;s too cute! So I explained what kind of food. The information actually downed on him finally and so we begun the process of discovering the wonders of Latke Love. 

We are both impressed! I ordered the Meshuggah. It&#39;s half Rabi and half Baleboosteh. The dishes here are served in a recyclable small bowl. This little bowl is filled with so much goodness! You get four latkes in any of the dishes on their menu. 

This latke deserves its own very short paragraph because it&#39;s that good!

I also spied their awesome list of cocktails. Next time I will check them out. 

The day we stopped by my target The Cornwall was not being served at all.  It&#39;s the corn beef with eggs and hash brown. We were told by Dina the pleasant owner that it&#39;s due to the fact that their corn beef provider can&#39;t deliver the moooo. The other would be provider was pricier and Dina and family didn&#39;t want to raise the price on this popular dish. So, call them to inquire if they&#39;re serving The Cornwall before you start driving.

Seating outside could be sweet in the summer. It&#39;s cute! Inside is not as large as outside but it&#39;s sufficient and I love their simple decor. 

Check out their dessert as well. What you see is what they have on the glass case. 

They share a private parking lot but you can park on the street."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food was fine, but frankly overpriced for what we got and we were not very impressed with the somewhat surly woman behind the counter.

Found a deal on Groupon and we were in the area so.... Why not?

Our walk up to the establishment was quite the treat, too. The little courtyard with wrought iron tables and chairs were adorable. Made me want to dine outside, bus alas the inside reminded me of being in a small European diner, so I opted for the latter and so did my bf.

Once we entered the front door we were greeted by a man with a kind smile. He did seem a bit busy at the time and informed us he was understaffed that day. 

After taking a gander at the menu for a few minutes we decided on the Manhattan (smoked salmon, cream cheese and capers) and the Jewban (a cubano but the Jewish way.) Also, my bf decided he wanted a beer. The bill came to $27 and change. Without the Groupon I&#39;d have to say this was way overpriced, especially for the beer. Almost $6 for a can.

After a bit of a wait we received our food and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. The wait was worth it!

I do think that the prices are pretty high, but the food is very good and the man working the counter was very nice. 

I&#39;d like to return, and I believe I will, but to dine here regularly would be to live outside of my budget."

Stopped by this place post-Powder Daze and after two hours of discount shopping, this was exactly what I needed! 

The converted house turned restaurant was cozy and inviting, the service was engaging, funny and warm.  The pastry on the Traditional knish was flaky and buttery.  I would have enjoyed a creamier, heavier mashed potato, but maybe that takes away from the &#34;traditional&#34;.  There are rotating options for less traditional knishes and I&#39;ll likely try one of those at a later time, but then again, my boyfriend had the Manhattan and my substantial bite of his food was a delightful flavor bomb so maybe I&#39;ll try that next time.  Or maybe the Meshuggah.  Or maybe the Oy Vey Caliente.  Or maybe the lemon blintzes.  

I&#39;d come here from Capitol Hill even if I didn&#39;t just happen to be in the area.  A real gem.  Large, shady, outdoor seating in the &#34;back yard&#34;."

Well for me the opposite is true. I REALLY wanted to believe that my latkes were better and that a restaurant focused on latkes was a silly idea. Then my friend really wanted to try it for brunch and I found out  how wrong I was!

I ordered The Cornwall-latkes topped with corned beef hash and a fried egg and a bourbon egg cream to drink. The latkes were perfect-super crispy on outside with melt-in-your-mouth creamy potatoes on the inside and the hash and egg were the perfect topping. The bourbon egg cream was exactly what the name suggests-an egg cream with bourbon and it was amazing.

This place has been bookmarked for nearly 2 years, so when I saw that they finally reopened - I didn&#39;t wait long to jump at the chance to finally check this off the list. 

We went on a Tuesday and while it wasn&#39;t crowded, extra points for having a parking lot in the back! The place is pretty easy to find as their signage out front really helps mark the place, but it&#39;s one of those places that used to be a house, but is now a business sort of thing. Little weird, but very cozy inside. 

It&#39;s a husband/wife duo that run the shop and I think they do a great job of managing the ordering, cooking, serving, barkeeping, etc. There was a little bit of a wait to get our food, but we weren&#39;t in a rush so I didn&#39;t care. They kept apologizing, but it honestly wasn&#39;t anything to scoff at.

And now, enter latkes - specifically the Manhattan and the Meshuggah. YUM. We even started with a knish, which was really yummy but totally gets overshadowed by the latkes. The Manhattan was my pick, and I really thought it was well put together. The toppings were fresh and flavorful, and everything I hoped it would be. The Meshuggah is half pork shoulder, half brisket on top and it&#39;s SO GOOD. I really liked the pork shoulder, but the brisket was so just so outstanding I think that would be my pick next time.

All in all - happy bellies and happy Yelpers. Thanks Latke Love, we&#39;ll be back!"

Where else can you stroll in through a back door and be greeted by aromas of crust?  I felt as if I were going into a friend&#39;s kitchen side door (like Ethel did into Lucy&#39;s kitchen).  I opted for The Classic -- latkes with crunchy apple sauce and a generous dollop of cream with cinnamon. It would be nice sometime, after the spring rains go away, to sit on the shady back porch to eat al fresco.  I&#39;ll be back, for sure."

Want something different and tired of all the same food and chain restaurants, latke love is a breath of fresh air. Locally owned and delicious. It is in a cute house off littleton Blvd.  I drove by it a ton but was deceived that it says it&#39;s a deli. I saw them doing a Groupon for a discount so we decided to go try it out. 

We had lunch there on the weekend and found out they have a very nice back patio to sit as well. Lots of trees and flowers, you don&#39;t even notice littleton Blvd nearby. 

The owner made our meals and we purchased 2 seperate items to try them out . She even brought out seem homemade applesauce for our toddler to try, Yum.

They all come with 3or4 latkes as a base then lots of yummy choices for things on top. We tried the dish with the salmon and capers. That was so good. Highly recommended! The second dish we got was the Jewby, must try!

We will for sure be coming back for more !"

We arrived about 30 minutes early and had to wait for the rest of our party. The man who was serving (I think he must be the owner) was so kind and hospitable. He talked with us the whole time and offered us coffee to have while we waited, as the place was so popular there wasn&#39;t an open table in sight! Learning that this was our first visit, he explained in great detail all about the menu and the ingredients, everything made on location from scratch; it&#39;s obvious he takes great pride in his business and product.

As he should! EVERYTHING that we ate today was brilliantly delicious! We started with a knish (don&#39;t remember the exact name, but it was stuffed with brisket and veggies and mashed potatoes) to share, and oh my goodness how yummy! The pastry was so light.. the filling so delicious... I hardly have words.

I had the Baleboosteh (latkes with brisket and gravy), and hubs had the Rabbi I&#39;m Confused (latkes with pulled pork in BBQ sauce), so I got to try both. We also ordered a Classic (lastkes with homemade applesauce and cinnamon whipped cream) for the table, and split it four ways like the knish. If I had to pick one... I couldn&#39;t! Each was more than delectable enough to order again and again.

The overall experience was just exceptional. High-quality food produced by high-quality people. A simple menu done brilliantly well. Prompt, friendly service. Come visit at once!"

We have seen this same location become many different things over the years. After our experience we hope that we see it stay as Latke Love for many years to come. 

We were greeted with friendly smiles and welcomed in right off the bat. You can choose to eat inside on the patio or to-go. We ordered to-go and still enjoyed the food so much. The gentleman who took our order was friendly and really helped to give us a run down of the menu. 

We chose to order the Cornwall latke, brisket knish and blintz two with lemon marscapone and one smores flavored. Everything we ate was spectacular.  The flavors were on point the corned beef was fresh and the egg was perfectly cooked. The gravy that came with the knish was also really delicious and the cinnamon whipped cream in the blintz hit the spot!

The only reason I gave this visit/place four stars was due to the wait for our to-go order. We will definitely be coming back, without a doubt!"

It&#39;s all delicious - I highly recommend the Baleboosteh (a family fav, even for our 7 year old daughter), the Manhattan, and the Campfire blintzes! Now you can even add an extra latke. The new location has a cozy and quiet space outside which has been nice this summer, and they seem to be expanding the menu - everything we&#39;ve tried has been tasty!"

Check it out (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrKMOsY5xVA). 

Now in the Denver restaurant world my absolutely favorite version of &#34;I&#39;m Back&#34; is currently being performed by Steve Shander and his darling sister, Dina, at Latke Love which just re-opened a couple of days ago down in Littleton. Wow! What a superb job they&#39;ve done.

And talk about a fantastic repeat performance. If you&#39;ll remember, Latke Love lost its lease on its space in North Park Hill and has been looking hard to reopen for going on a year now. The place has so many devoted  customers that an article has even been written looking forward to its revival. (See the Denver Post&#39;s 12/2 article called &#34;Latke Love Reopens Just in Time for Hanukkah,&#34; http://www.denverpost.com/food/ci_29184789/latke-love-littleton-opens-just-time-hanukkah). 

Bottom line (and semi-mixing 2 metaphors:) . . . Latke Love is rockin&#39; it outta the park. Their reopening rivals &#34;Godfather II&#34; in following up on the original film version, and doing an even better job as a sequel. (By the way . . . the first sequel ever to win an Oscar:).

So here&#39;s my prediction: Latke Love wins the 2015 (Food Oscar) Award for the Best Latke in Denver, hands down. Not even a contest. Properly grated, seasoned and fried, these little packets of golden brown potato starlight pack a punch the size of the Rocky Mountains. Today we got the &#34;Meshuggah.&#34; That&#39;s Yiddish for &#34;crazy,&#34; because it&#39;s a combo of shredded brisket alongside of some non-Kosher pulled pork, all served over latkes and finished with a mouth wateringly great sauce.

So Latke Love, you&#39;re aptly named. You&#39;ve got latkes, and I&#39;m in love . . . again,

The staff is incredibly friendly, the facility is VERY VERY clean, and the food is delicious. Their green chili is to die for. How can you not enjoy some Latkes smothered in green chili and cheese. 

The downfall is that I work next to them, and want to go there everyday but I try to limit myself to once a week, Which is proving to be pretty difficult.

I was sorely disappointed.
I even called the day before to let them know we would be coming by and to make sure the serve time would be speedy, as the family had a flight to catch back East.
When we arrived we were informed that they were out of applesauce and also the blintzes. 
We thought we&#39;d give it a go anyway.
I hope the food is better with the applesauce. 
Ours was mediocre at best.
The food that we were told would be 20 minutes, came out in 40 minutes.
The food was served in paper bowls. ( Some white NY deli porcelain would have really classed it up.)
Then 10 minutes into our meal our server came out with some smaller latkes sitting on a paper napkin that she explained were supposed be part of three ordered items. (They forgot.)
Then she used her fingers to add them to the half-eaten dishes on the table.
We all sat in silence and proceeded to eat as we didn&#39;t have time to hunt down another restaurant.
Very disappointing and embarrassed that I suggested this place."

Super delicious! You can tell they put LOVE in everything. The applesauce is the best I&#39;ve ever had, and homemade! 

My friend and I went in and ordered practically everything. Two little piggies! We weren&#39;t disappointed in anything we tried and neither was the two year old who was with us. 

The brisket is terrific, the pork is fantastic, and the corned beef is a treat! I highly recommend the meshuggah. I got a knish also, which was terribly unnecessary but really good. The pastry around it is awesome. Coffee is good too. 

Service was great but we were the only people in there. I don&#39;t know what it would be like on a crowded day because it is really small, but they have a beautiful patio and I can&#39;t wait to go back many times during patio season.

I couldn&#39;t tell if they were shredded the old fashioned way ( my family was brought up hand grating the potatoes and onions and occasionally getting our knuckles in the way....) but they did have a texture that I found nice. I usually cook mine on the crispier side ( I use baking powder as well ) and I make sure to use organic canola oil to avoid GMOs&#39; ) 

I think they make their applesauce from scratch and it was good but not fantastic, although I cannot quite figure out why... We tried to stop in the other day to try them fresh (my house is 8 min away) but latke love was closed... oh well. I will be coming back to try latkes along with their knishes. Being from Boston, we have tons of knishes and Jewish delis. I am particularly fond of the beef knishes ( little orange ones) and my husband and son like the potato ones so I hope they have the kind we remember. Additionally , If I could make a wish list up of the things id love to get there it would be:

authentic ashkenzi stuffed cabbage ( sweet and sour) with organic beef please :)

kasha varnishkas

small chubs ( white fish) 

authentic chicken liver pate ( organic please) 

matza brie ( the old fashioned traditional version) 

kugel ( with the golden raisins, not too sweet!) 

jelly rolls

hamantashen

onion rolls ( these are a specialty found in New England bakeries: a slightly sweet egg bread oblong roll filled with slightly caramelized onions baked inside... absolutely delicious)


Cylindrical bubke, with only cinnamon sugar  and golden raisins swirled inside and lots of cinnamon  sugar completely crusting the outside. This is a specialty bubke from a favorite bakery my grandmother frequented ( and I still do when Im back home) where the recipes are over 100 years old)  I like this bubke because its not sickeningly sweet like a lot of the other types with thick jam and nuts. This one is just heaven. its like an egg bread with the ingredients mentioned above. We like to eat it sliced plain or toasted with whipped cream cheese...MMMMMMM

And then of course the regular items I make at home: 

Chicken soup WITH the fat, with the sliver thin egg noodles carrots, white chicken, celery, onion, sea salt, and the best matzo balls you&#39;ve ever had. I again use baking powder and Schmaltz and lots of eggs so they are  very textury but light. The secret to good matzah balls is the ancient recipe passed down and lovingly followed. 

Brisket. Organic. with the sweet and sour taste ( white vinegar , lemon and brown sugar) slow cooked with sweet potatoes, potatoes and carrots.

Ok, well you can see my stomach is back home. Its hard to make stuffed cabbage because you have to make a lot since its labor intensive and I don&#39;t have a lot of people in the house...


Latke love, I know you have to deal with mostly gentiles, but maybe you might bring these goodies back when you&#39;ve got a bigger captive audience?? See you soon!"

I ordered a Rabbi I&#39;m confused, and it was very good. They lose stars because they don&#39;t have latkes. We&#39;ve tried to order throughout Hanukkah and have been given the runaround every day. I finally went in, and they were out...2 hours before close. I came in a different day for a to-go order, after being told I DID NOT need to order in advance, and after much eye rolling and sighing was able to order. Latke&#39;s are potatoes and onions....it isn&#39;t that hard to make more. I&#39;m fairly certain at this point that these are not made IN HOUSE, and are instead bought premade. How are they always out otherwise? The place has been busy, but not lines down the street busy, and it isn&#39;t like potatoes are a specialty ingredient that you can&#39;t run to the nearest grocery store (a half mile away) and pick up more of."

We were seated quickly and they served up waters and our menus quickly. The menu is literally mind boggling! They have any South Vietnamese dish you could want including some Central Vietnamese options. My husband ordered Bun Bo Hue which is a central Vietnamese noodle soup dish and he was pleased with it. It was a little on the sweet side, but seriously, I thought it was quite good because very few Vietnamese restaurants make it at all. 

The appetizer platter we got with softshell crab, grilled meats and egg rolls was massive and basically by the time the 4 of us finished it, we werent sure if we could eat dinner anymore! I love the portions here! It&#39;s really awesome. 

We also got duck pan fried with some mushrooms which is crazy good! The duck is super fatty though, so anyone on a diet or with high cholesterol shouldnt get this dish! We also ordered the seafood stir fry and that was excellent! 

Overall, this restaurant was as awesome as my friend said it was! I&#39;m glad my friend recommended it! I am so pleased with this restaurant and will definitely be back soon."

We asked to speak to a manager who told us that there was nothing wrong with the tea, that it was just lemon... which is odd because the tea had lime in it..... No attempt to make it right and no apology at all. Now it&#39;s a waiting game to see if either of us get sick. Not a way to run a business at all. We are not complainers and we don&#39;t go out to eat looking to get something for free; we don&#39;t operate that way. However, when a customer tells you something is clearly wrong, you have to work to figure out what is wrong and correct it. 

We will not return EVER. Which is a shame because the food was very good, but the worry about if we are going to get sick as a result of the tea and the lack of concern by the management tells us they don&#39;t want our business. 

We will post an update if either of us gets sick.

The restaurant has been located in the Northglenn area for multiple years now and their recognition is well deserved. Most of the time we order the same thing, canh chua ca (sour soup with fish) and ca kho to (caramelized and braised catfish). This time we decided to order the Seafood hotpot, goi dac biet (combination viet salad), and avocado smoothie with boba. Definitely worth your investment since they give you big portions and taste great! Reminds me of how meals are prepared at home each time we come here. The staff are excellent as well and there&#39;s plenty of parking. 
Tip: if you come in a big group, order their signature appetizer dish which includes a variety of meats and vegetables. Goes great for DIY spring rolls!"

They have all kinds of Vietnamese dishes.  I was pretty stoked when I saw what an extensive menu they had...including some stuff I hadn&#39;t had since I was a kid and are not so easy to find.

I ate here last time I was in town and was blown away.  So freaking good and the portions are family size!  We had:


Seafood goi - Squid, shrimp. abalone, jellyfish...really fresh!

Heo ram man (Caramelized pork) - really tender and awesome with the rice.

Canh chua ca (sweet &amp; sour soup with catfish) - I am picky about my canh chua...I don&#39;t like when the fish still has the slimy skin on it.  They actually took it all off and the filet was cooked perfectly!

Cua rang me - tamarind crab - a whole fresh Dungeness crab cooked with tamarind sauce.  This was my fave!!!!!!  Think...sweet and sour crab :)

Being from Cali, where supposedly we have the best Vietnamese food...I was pretty damn impressed with this place.  Looking forward to some future visits next time I&#39;m in the Mile HIgh City!"

Always consistent. Always delicious. Always welcoming, of course it helps when me and my family are there at least once a week and everyone remembers us. 
- usually get the 52, combination rice plate sub chopped pork instead of a pork chop. It just tastes better to me. 
- Aso get the rare steak pho, can&#39;t go wrong with that either. They do have &#34;huy fong&#34; aka the chili paste most pho&#39;s have out on the table, you just have to request it and they&#39;ll bring out a hefty dish.
-The shrimp wrapped steak appetizers are 5 stars
-The make your own spring rolls appetizer dish is to die but just so big! Easily feeds 3 of us as a shared entrée.
-Recently tried the crab and asparagus soup, yummyyyy!
-Chicken fried rice!! Once again amazeballs.

Never asked or came back to see how the food was. Never refilled my water and then he sent someone else to give us our check after we sat and waited, and waited for one. There is no way he was mad at us because he never interacted with us in the first place.

5* Food
 We usually order their seafood hot pot with beef, you get so much food for only $20 and it&#39;s enough to feed 3, maybe even 4. Their bun bo hue is really good too, and Banh xeo although it&#39;s a little expensive it&#39;s fluffy and crispy. 

4* Service
Most of their servers and extremely friendly and funny, I&#39;d say 3/4 of them. The two ladies and the older guy are great, but there&#39;s one guy who just does his job just enough.

The previous owner of Saigon Bowl sold it and started this place not too long ago.  I am so glad they did because the northern part of Denver was lacking good authentic restaurants.

I come to Saigon Basil quite often with my family.  They are a huge fan of the baked catfish which can feed 4-5 people.  It is quite delicious, but requires some time to prepare.  So I suggest calling in a head of time to get it prepare.  However, the size of the fish varies from time to time.  Sometimes we get a fat juicy one and other times it is skinny.  The baked skin is the best part so I do not mind it being skinny.  

They also have a huge menu filled with authentic cuisine.  I never had their pho here because they offer other noodles dishes that cannot be found elsewhere.  I personally love their hu tieu thap cam which is a nice rice noodle entree with warm broth; good for the cold days.  My boyfriend loves the hu tieu ap chao.  It uses the same rice noodle, but is pan fried.  I also like the shaking beef (bo luc lac) here and their thai tea boba.  Their thai tea is freshly brewed and the boba is soft and chewy.  Honestly, you can not go wrong with any of their items.

Service is always great here and they make reservation an ease.  My only compliant is that they are not open on Sundays."

The little sign on 104th st. makes one think it is in the parking lot of the strip center. However, you need to turn right on Melody Drive.  There&#39;s a rather large sign once you turn.

The food was very, very good.  I ordered the #52 which was a very large plate containing vegetables, egg, a pork chop, egg rolls, shredded pork, chicken, and shrimp for only $9.99 plus tax.  There was no need for dipping sauce; the food was very well seasoned and didn&#39;t need any extra condiments.  Everything tasted fresh and clean.  As another poster alluded to, the strip mall its part of looks rather sketchy and may dissuade some from visiting. 

The interior of the restaurant is clean and inviting.  Except for one of the girls refilling water (she also ran my check), there wasn&#39;t much customer interaction, but that&#39;s the norm for Asian restaurants."

My fiancée&#39;s family and I eat at this restaurant at least once a week whether it&#39;s take out or dining in. That just goes to show how much we love Saigon Basil! Plus, his family is from Vietnam so they approve on the authenticity of this restaurant. 

We usually order com dac biet (the rice combo special), saigon basil appetizer dish (spring rolls), bo luc lac (steak salad), muc rang muoi (fried squid), bun bo hue, and Lau thap cam (seafood hotpot). Not all at once obviously but those dishes are in our rotation lol.  

These dishes are hands down the best in Colorado. Their dishes are jam packed with lots of flavor and spices, and fresh vegetables. Price per dish is very reasonable and the size are family style. 

Other than the food, service is great. The staff and owner are very personable. 

I&#39;m quite bias but we LOVE Saigon Basil and highly recommend it to any and everyone!"

There was maybe 3 other tables with customers. We put in our order. 20 minutes went by and still no food. The waiter didn&#39;t come by in that time either. Finally by 30 minutes we asked the waiter. He said the rice needed to be cooked. If they knew it would take that long, why wouldn&#39;t they come by and ask if we wanted something that took less time? By the time it came out, the noodles in the pho for one order was hard and stuck together in a ball. My &#34;fresh&#34; chicken tasted like store bought chicken. Even at the counter to pay they were still rude to us when we complained about the wait time. Had I known I would have to wait this long and be treated like this, I would&#39;ve gone to a fast food place. Never coming back."

The staff was friendly enough for a Vietnamese restaurant. Generally I feel like I&#39;m putting them out by needing service, but at Saigon Basil there was only one server who made this way. When I asked if the soups were made with beef broth or something else he went to the kitchen and did not return. The other two servers who helped us were pleasant considering my diva-like tendency to make a server&#39;s life hard during the ordering stage of the meal. There were some cleanliness issues with glass seeming to not have been cleaned in some time; i.e. front doors &amp; fish tank, but the tables and silverware were clean. Once we dialed in what I could eat on the lunch menu I selected the curry chicken and a veggie egg roll with white rice. The food was fabulous, but I could have done without the grease on the egg roll. It wasn&#39;t expensive. I think the bill for two with tax was just over $15. I will definitely come back, but beware pork and beef sneak onto your plate at Vietnamese restaurants. It&#39;s not personal, it&#39;s cultural."

I love the Hot and Sour hotpot, Fish Claypot, duck, and cubed steak. Typing this review is making me hungry now. This is the place and definitely lucked out. If I need Vietnamese food in Colorado, this is the place to go.

Usually, Vietnamese restaurants are known to specialize in a dish. Either for their pho or Vietnamese omelette etc. This place is all around delicious. Everything is on point and very clean. The bathroom is clean as well. The ambiance and decor was a nice blend of Western and Eastern. Seating arrangements is very roomy, too. Great for groups!

Even though they sat us down in a matter of minutes after arriving we rarely saw our server, ran out of water multiple times waiting for someone to walk by and ask, than we ordered a boba tea (which we thought was chai tea from how the server pronounced it but was Thai tea - which makes sense after the fact I guess) we asked for it to be changed out due to it wasn&#39;t that great and we sensed that they were reluctant to do so even though we only took a sip.

Saigon Basil may serve many different dishes, but their pho is definitely to die for! I would definitely recommend eating here if you have the chance.

My usual order is the steamed rice with grilled pork (#46). The sauce is absolutely delicious and the pork is so savory. The plate is pretty decent sized, but you should be able to finish at least 7/8 of the plate if you have eaten rice at previous Vietnamese restaurants before.

They have a bar area for people eating alone. I&#39;m not sure they serve beer or anything. The tables are great for groups of all sizes.

Service is slightly lengthy, since it&#39;s usually always busy. It also depends on how many are in your group. Obviously, a four person group gets served faster than a ten person group.

The best part is that it&#39;s pretty cheap! Most single dishes are between $8 to $13, and the bigger ones for groups are about $25-35."

I don&#39;t come often, however, because I live in Aurora and this is kind of far but I have been here a handful of times with friends who wanted authentic viet food. If you want the real stuff besides pho, come here because they have anything and everything you want from bun bo hue to banh xeo to the giant fried catfish etc. 

If you&#39;re going to get the giant catfish, come with a big group of people and call ahead of time so they get it ready for you. I ate it by wrapping it in rice paper and dipping it in fish sauce which was soooo delicious. I&#39;ve also tried their shaking beef which was delicious. Their pho comes either in small, regular, or x-large. This is kind of weird that they skip large all together. They give you a lot of meat and the broth is delicious as well. You can ask for whatever combinations of ingredients you want in your pho and you don&#39;t have to get what&#39;s stated on the menu. I have also tried their combination fried platter which was honestly way too much fried food. I felt a little bit sick afterwards but next time I will know to share with more than two people if I were to get that again. I also appreciate that this place puts fresh flowers on the table and that their tables are clean and they can accommodate huge groups of people like 20+. I would definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re in the area and want some legit viet food =)"

All appetizers, and make no mistake we ordered a bunch, were very very good. My sister, who claims she has a discerning palette, can be a bit annoying regarding &#34;oh i know food&#34; and was visiting from out of town. 

Sis was blown away. Kudos to Saigon Basil, thanks for making me look good in front of Sis. Our waitress didn&#39;t have a ton of English, but she made everything clear for us. The seafood fire pot involves a propane burner on the table with a bowl of broth and a MASSIVE platter of raw scallops, shrimp, calamari, and a little crab plus some vegetables and rice noodles. You adjust the burner, cook your seafood, put it into cute little bowls along with the noodles and vegetables, and drizzle off into food narcolepsy.

Loved Saigon Basil.The reason I give it 4 stars not 5 is that the broth was a little too sweet and the ambiance is too fluorescent, almost like a cafeteria or a mall food court.  I didn&#39;t even  mention their frog&#39;s legs! YES THEY HAVE FROG&#39;S LEGS! YES, THEY ARE COMPLETELY AND RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS!"

Since it&#39;s not as busy when I go there, the food tastes wonderful, for as, they have more time to prepare my dish instead of just rushing it out like the Federal Blvd. location.

I had a few bites of the food and the egg rolls and filled up. I ended up taking the rest home, cooked more rice, and was able to eat it for 2 more meals! I&#39;m on a tight budget, so this was a great deal. 

The food tasted really good. The pork chop and marinated pork was flavorful. The viet egg rolls were delicious and they did a good job making the sauce. The shrimp was good but overcooked. The rice was old and dry.. I could tell it had been sitting around all day long (we got there an hour before closing).

My brother initially showed me this place and they are far superior to any other Pho restaurant I have every been to. I always wanted to give this place a review so I can share my wonderful experience with others but it has always slipped my mind. That might actually make my review more viable though. I say this because it was not a single visit that has developed my point of view on this place. The results are consistent and your food will always be a delight! Like I said, I have been going to this place for more than 5 years and they have never missed a beat. Saigon Basil is the place to eat right now! The ambiance is great and my girlfriend loves when I take her on dates at this place. She too is a die hard Saigon Basil snob. 

Thanks for years of delicious piping hot Pho!"

I have solidly determined Saigon Basil is my favorite!  When these restaurateurs moved from Federal Blvd to Northglenn I happily followed. It has the best Vietnamese food and you should look no further for some damn fine Vietnamese egg rolls, pho, or noodle bowls (IMHO).  Their dipping fish sauce is also mixed exactly how I want it.  I try to make the 40 minute trip up at least a few times a month because the food is that craveable and addictive."

They missed my order and the waiter spoke limited English and didn&#39;t understand what I wanted and got some of my order wrong. They had to send another waiter to clarify the order. My husband enjoyed his lemon grass muscles and the kids loved their sweet and sour chicken. I did enjoy my stir fry. Besides the food mixup the restaurant appears clean and well kept. Prices are decent and I did like that they pack your food for you right at the table to take home. I would go again only if I&#39;m in the area.

I have taken multiple ppl there and they have been very pleased with the food, especially their seafood.

I love that they have an expanded menu whenever I&#39;m not in the mood for Pho or the rice/noodle combo plates. You can get a true taste of Vietnamese cuisine if you decide to venture out!

A real treat for the purveyor of authenticity, quality, and exceptional taste. I&#39;ve done Vietnamese weddings, and have enjoyed the real deal on a number of occasions... alas, Denver blows when it comes to good stuff (the best kitchen is at my house, my mom&#39;s house, my mom-in-law&#39;s house, and a couple places scattered across the globe). This is the exception. In fact, I&#39;ll go as far as to say Saigon Basil&#39;s chefs have single handedly... err, not **single** handedly... redeemed the ENTIRE CITY&#39;S reputation for being the cultural center of anything. I mean, The Denver Biscuit Co. has 4.5 stars on Yelp... poached eggs, biscuits, and Coors impresses the locals... some of you get my drift.

Saigon Basil has a few dishes which cater to the &#34;I want &#39;asian&#39; food&#34; illiterates. But that&#39;s for profiling purposes... or reverse profiling purposes... you know, so **they** know whom to make fun of. The real treats are the Vietnamese goodies. Here are the things YOU MUST ORDER:

1. Steel pot of seafood soup. It&#39;s missing those little tiny mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and the cool steel soup pots with the hot coals inside, but whatevs. Pour a little Sriracha in your bowl, and you&#39;re in teary-eyed heaven.
2. Goi ga - vietnamese meat salad. It&#39;s supposed to be beef... they do chicken. Meh, close enough.
3. Seafood Goi ga - waay better than the chicken. It&#39;s got JELLY FISH!!
4. $45 catfish - It&#39;s not on the menu so you feel like a baller calling it in (after you get thru the faulty VOIP system, and finally get handed over to someone who understands you). It&#39;s over priced, overcooked, and bland (because catfish is bland), but a real treat for when your eyes are bigger than your stomach, or you wanna impress some out of towners with your fish-taco-in-rice-paper-making skills.

Denver&#39;s only a foodie city if you&#39;ve never left Denver or drink too much to notice. Thank you, Saigon Basil, for raising the bar in the Mile High City. Thank you also for raising my average yelp review, and for serving as the model to which all other Denver/Boulder aspiring &#34;originals&#34; ought to strive."

Nice, spacious, friendly staff, authentic Vietnamese food with lots of options to please everyone.  I&#39;ve been here at least a dozen times but only for family meals and group parties so I can&#39;t comment on their individual plate type of items like pho or bun.  They have a very extensive menu and we&#39;ve tried most of them and I can&#39;t remember ever getting anything bad.  So many dishes to recommend, goi (salad) is always excellent.  The Saigon Basil appetizer is easily a meal for 2 or 3.  &#34;Canh chua&#34; (sour soup) and &#34;ca kho to&#34; (braised fish) is a pretty standard Vietnamese meal and you can&#39;t go wrong with that.  The crabs are excellent too when they have it.  There&#39;s something special about the plain white rice they serve with meals, a friend of mine keeps claiming that this is the best in town and he always orders extra to take home.

For a special take-out meal at home, we&#39;d call ahead and order the roasted fish, a whole big fish comes with crispy skin and everything else you need for a meal: rice paper, veggies, dipping sauce,..  Always satisfying.  

They have a raised area separate from the main floor good for larger groups (30-40).  The acoustic there is interesting, we had a party there once and folks were pretty loud but when we walked down to the main floor, you don&#39;t really hear much at all."

Vietnamese food is some of my favorite cuisine on planet earth and SB is second to none. Yes the strip mall they are located in is ghetto. They are by far the classiest establishment in that rundown shopping center, that&#39;s for sure. When you walk in and see the size of the place and all the Vietnamese people who are eating there, you know you are in the right place. Shoot, you can smell them from 2-3 blocks away and the aroma is tantalizing and irresistible. It torments me. I HAVE to eat there!

I always order Bun Ga Nuong, as I do at every VN restaurant I eat at and theirs is SOOOOOOO good. The fresh, crispy greens, tangy pickled veggies, savory chicken, sweet and spicy fish sauce... Man the combination is unbeatable! Plus their pork egg rolls are amazing. I also really enjoy the rice paper sample platter (can&#39;t remember the official menu name) but they bring the rice papers and warm water, so you soak and roll your own spring rolls basically (fun - my kids love this). They include all the greens, rice noodles, fish sauce and grilled chicken, shrimp, beef, pork, soft-shell crabs - and they are all DELICIOUS. 

Boba and VN coffee are great. Haven&#39;t tried the Pho.

But then again, 63 other reviews give this place 4.5 stars, so I can&#39;t be exaggerating, right? This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in metro Denver for sure. If you&#39;re looking for comfort Viet food that&#39;s legit, this is the place to go. The restaurant is very spacious and can easily accommodate big groups. It&#39;s also in a very accessible location, just off I-25 and 104th Avenue. 

Definitely order the make-your-own spring rolls, which come with eggrolls, grilled pork and chicken, soft-shelled crab and so much more. And don&#39;t be intimidated or turned off by their extensive menu. They may not specialize in any one dish, but they do specialize in deliciousness in every one of their dishes! If you ask me, though, these are my top favorites from their menu: Canh Chua (hot &amp; sour soup), Hu Tieu Thap Cam (a noodle soup that in my opinion is way better than pho), and Ech Xao Xa Ot (frog legs with lemongrass)."

I had the combo noodle bowel on my first visit. Shrimp, Chicken, Beef and Egg Rolls in a fantastic bowl of noodles, salad and fresh herbs... really satisfying.

The second time I tried their #1 Pho which was basically beef, tendon, brisket and some other really yummy stuff. The broth was so wonderful and beautifully done. I was in Pho heaven! ;)

I&#39;ve never had their Chinese food, but the Vietnamese dishes that they serve are on point. They have great variety, but like most restaurants, there are certain dishes that are better than others. 

I almost always get their Saigon Basil Appetizer Special (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) which is DELICIOUS. They bring out a plate full of noodles, various meats and veggies as well as a bowl of hot water and banh trang, or rice paper wrappers, and you make your own spring rolls! It&#39;s a bit too much for two people to share, but not quite enough for three. I usually go with a bigger group, so we&#39;ll order one or two of these plates along with a few other dishes to compliment.  I would also recommend the Canh Chua Ca (a sour soup with fish) or Lau Do Bien (basically a seafood hot pot), but only if you have people to share with!

Great place for groups and eating family style. The ONLY drawback for me is that they&#39;re closed on Sundays, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m forgetful and have made plans to go there on Sundays before."

I am in so much luck because now I do not have to drive 25-30 min every weekend to get my Com Dac Biet! (Combination Rice Plate). They serve it the best with Pork, beef, chicken, egg rolls and a fried egg! Tastes the best! 

Just fingering through the menu, everything on it was the same. The only problem is that the location is off of main street in a strip. Not visible at all for people passing by.

We joined the establishment for their, well-known, Taco Tuesdays (&#34;ARIBA!!&#34;). Before I go into details, to sum everything up, the place was awesome. 

What I learned: 
- A majority of the Tacos listed= awesome. The Tongue-taco (I know it sounds scary lol) was my favorite. So good actually, that I had to order another one. The &#34;Al Pastor&#34; taco was another good one. The Taco of the night (forgot the name), was too filling....... the taco tasted like an ENTIRE pot roast was stuffed into a tiny tortilla.

- Drinks= did their job. I got a pitcher-of-margarita  to share with my lady friend. In my opinion, whenever someone purchases a pitcher of something, the taste shouldn&#39;t matter. The real question should be: Did it get you loose? And yes, yes it did get me loose.  

- Atmosphere stood out the most. Cool decor, nice staff, an awesome waiter (shoutout to Ara). 

I will repeat, Adelitas is good. If you trust/know me, I would recommend it. I still need to try it out on a regular night , but 100% go for Taco Tuesday&#39;s."

The margarita was great, as it had no mixes and wasn&#39;t overly sweet. It also was decently strong. The chimichanga was smaller than I hoped for, but ended up being quite filling. I got the pastor chimichanga and the flavors were just okay. It came with a side of sauce to pour over the chimichanga and I was a little disappointed in the green chile sauce so I asked for a side of mole. I was surprised to find that I was charged $1.50 for a small side of mole, but that&#39;s the way it is I suppose. 

The ambiance was quiet at 4pm on a Thursday, but it had a charming modern Mexican vibe. My waiter was also cordial and brought everything in a timely manner.

Overall, I enjoyed the food but I&#39;ve certainly had better. I am surprised at all the raving reviews."

Second visit was above average but not as good as the first visit. 


Menu = 

Solid menu. Kind of confusing to read when you&#39;re hungry, but great selection. The textile it is printed on is pretty fun (great idea!).  


Food Quality = 

It ebbs and flows. I feel the first time I ordered (the enchilada suizas), the food was knocked out of the park! It was Soooooo good. Upon my return some weeks later, I had the tacos Al pastor (of the chef) and it was honestly &#34;just ok&#34;. The flavors of the food were communicating to me that they were actually really trying hard to be great tacos, but they fell short of expectation. Additionally, they were very oily and I felt gross eating them all - they dripped with oil. Ewww. I realized ALL the tacos needed salt, like all of them but there was no salt on the tables. Hardly any flavor to the tacos AND oily. Meh.  Also, I ordered the salsa flight again because it was so awesome the first time I ordered it. This time, one of the salsas delivered a scary &#34;zing&#34; to the tongue- like when salsa has turned and gone bad. I tried it a few other times thinking it was intended to be a special surprise haha....I&#39;m pretty sure in all honesty that it had expired. Yeah, having worked in restaurant and food prep, I&#39;m like nearly 100% sure actually. (eww)


Atmosphere = 

Fun, really fascinating old photographs on the walls. I swear, some of those pictures look exactly like my great-great grandmother who was from Mexico. I even pulled out a picture of her to compare and my partner was amazed at the resemblance.  ;)   (Soy Mexicano authentico, aqui.)


Cleanliness = 

Very clean (and thank you for keeping it clean!!) Even the restrooms were spotless, inviting, &#34;safe&#34; if that makes sense, and very nice overall. 


Customer Service = 

Friendly, not overly warm and fuzzy, like no one cracks a joke or anything, but totally friendly. The first visit, we announced to our server it was our first time there. She offered the salsa flight and comp&#39;d it since we were new there. That was a very kind gesture and totally unexpected. 


Feedback = 

I don&#39;t know if I have clear feedback. I&#39;d say, just try harder at being the best. As a local, I&#39;ve seen MANY (specifically Mexican) restaurants on this small stretch of Broadway come and go. I&#39;ll try a place, find it to be impressive, and within 2 years, they&#39;re out of business... Another one takes its place, corners the market for a period of time and then goes out of business. I&#39;m not sure if its the South Broadway location or what. I&#39;d say, stay on your game and realize that there are many who are a metaphorical flash in the pan. Dont let it be you guys."

I think this place is best-known for Taco Tuesday and friendly, alternative wait staff. Taco Tuesday aside, there are tons of other hidden gems on their menu. I am obsessed with their variety of unique sauces, enchiladas, and I must say...their chile rellenos have broken me. They are very different than anywhere else due to their large size and light breading... or whatever you are supposed to call chile relleno coverings. Their mole sauce doesn&#39;t have chocolate, which at first made me sad. Upon trying it, though, it was love at first taste.  It is great on the aforementioned enchiladas and rellenos. Also, their tacos are like street tacos. delicious. Thisplace has definitely carved a niche out for themselves as a unique mexican food restaurant. I love you guys!!"

I&#39;d give it 3.5 stars if I could but don&#39;t think it was bad enough to rate it only 3 stars.  

Went on a Friday night and had a 45-minute wait which is to be expected.  Downside is there&#39;s really no waiting area on a cold night when the bar is full.  

Sat down and was served by a very bubbly waitress who was wonderful and very knowledgeable.  Ordered the quest fundido which was GREAT!   It was mixed with chorizo so there was a nice fatty element to it but the cheese was so mild and chewy like a mozzarella stick if that makes sense.  We also ordered chips and tomatillo salsa which we had to pay for which was disappointing.  At least make the first basket free.  

House margaritas were extremely strong and only $5.50 a piece.  

The entree was my least favorite part.  My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas with a cream sauce which he loved.  I ordered the chili rellenos which were mushy and not tender whatsoever.  They lacked flavor, had a very eggy batter taste to them and the chilis seemed raw and required a fork and knife to cut through.  I only had half a relleno, ate my beans and rice which were exceptional then had her take the plate away.  

Definitely a busy place, great libations, awesome appetizers and I&#39;d definitely go back to try the street tacos or carne asada or the mocajeta which all looked great."

There were 6 of us so there was plenty of food to sample from camarones diablo, enchiladas, tamalitos, and salsas. The sauces on everything was the key to these quality dishes with a fresh taste. We&#39;re definitely going back. Call for reservations because it gets busy quickly."

While the decal and ambience of the place was excellent, the food leaves a lot to be desired for. We ordered the carne asada tacos and the al pastor tacos. There is very little meat and not a lot of flavor.  The Al pastor was rather bland, although the fresh pineapple offered a nice touch. The carne asada was much better. The meat was a little tough but had a nice smokey flavor from the cumin. Really tiny tacos, not impressed.

I can&#39;t say that the tacos were terrible but the salsas were what did this place in. I really believe that one of the most important factors in judging a Mexican restaurant is the quality of their salsas. We ordered the chips and salsa and had the tomato and the avocado salsa. The tomato salsa was pretty standard; however, the avocado salsa was atrocious. The texture and flavor was all sorts of wrong. I couldn&#39;t place the exact flavor, but I guess kind of like gazpacho if that makes any sense. The texture was that of baby food. The flavors were not well balanced  and rather off putting. The tomatillo salsa that came with the tacos was super tart and had no flavor aside from the sour. 

We also orders the prickly pear agua fresca that was the highlight of the meal. It was really sweet but refreshing. 

Not sure if I&#39;d come back for more when there are so many food taco joints in Denver."

Small homemade corn tortillas filled with carne asada, al pastor, carnitas, pollo, veggies... A couple are $2, like the camarones. We ordered a bunch of each kind and were so happy with our meal. Alongside chips with a fantastic salsa trio + fresh made guacamole, I had more than enough to eat and barely spent anything. 

We also tried the skinny margaritas; just tequila, lime juice, and agave syrup. Strong pours, super refreshing. Can&#39;t beat the happy hour prices (late night happy hour too).

This is a cozy, colorful, casual spot that serves great Mexican food (until 11pm on weekdays) and makes stellar cocktails.

Since moving to Denver on July 1st, I have been there a total of 10 times, 8 of which were for Taco Tuesdays.

Selfishly, I don&#39;t even want to share this gem with the masses of Denver, because that only means I have to wait longer to get a spot.

Go. Or, better yet, don&#39;t."

The best way I could describe it is a hipster Mexican joint. It has a cool vibe along the bar where I would be tempted to come just for a drink and to watch games. We actually sat at a table since we were eating. 

My street tacos were good but not $2 good. My girlfriend&#39;s sopes were definitely the highlight. I would come back for these any day of the week.  They were absolutely fantastic. We did also come on &#39;buy one get one free&#39; margarita night. I guess you get what you pay for. Although they were good, 50% of it ice and I had to try hard to taste (or feel) any of the tequila. 

It&#39;s not all perfect but it doesn&#39;t have to be - it&#39;s a nice alternative to other Mexican restaurants that provide a fun atmosphere with good  food."

It also happened to be Taco Tuesday - MOST tacos $1. After seeing many empty tables, we were finally seated. Decided to try their marg and it was okay. Nothing mind blowing and it was also a very short drink. Kind of felt jipped. Additionally I will say if you&#39;re getting tacos, please please please the El Pastor. The deliciously marinated pork topped with pineapple salsa that adds the perfect amount of sweet and spice literally (okay not literally) BLEW me away. 
And please do not try camarones taco. It&#39;s terrible and flavorful. As for the other tacos, they&#39;re mediocre. El Pastor all the way though."

I organize a monthly girls dinner, and have a list of restaurants bookmarked on Yelp. This month, we tried out Adelitas!

I had a group of 15, so they reserved the entire community table for us and it was perfect. (A couple girls ended up not showing, so they sat a couple people at the far end, but it still was a great seating situation.) Our server was friendly and efficient. He even split our bill (again 15 ways!) and it seemed like it all worked out great.

The food was very good. All the girls seemed to enjoy what they ordered. I got a chimichanga and tried 2 of their sauces to cover it. All was delicious. The chips and salsa were also real good. Love me some salty chips!

I am looking forward to going back to Adelitas in the near future!"
adelitas-cocina-y-cantina-denver,Jenn B.,K5xWoJIkcw87VkIYiwd0nQ,"Littleton, CO",1,1,1,154,531,m2hn-TrACcC_B1qxyfoL8Q,3.0,2016-08-01,"My first and only real visit to Adelitas so far was with some friends who absolutely LOVE this place. Maybe it is the fact that they talked it up so much that caused me to be a little disappointed with our actual experience. 

Our reservation was for 6pm on a Friday, which I understand is a busy time for restaurants everywhere. Regardless, I still expect the service to be on its game. Our waitress did not greet us or welcome us to the restaurant or explain the menus or offer any specials; she rushed us to order and was just generally impatient with us most of the meal. She got better part way through, but the disappointing beginning still colored everything that followed.

The menus are ridiculous. They are huge, unwieldy, filmsy, floppy, and hard to use. Each one takes up most of the table, so it&#39;s impossible to have more than one open at a time. A book-style menu would be so much better. Moreover, the actual text of the menu is rather pretentious. Refusing type the English equivalent of various ingredients (always &#34;pollo&#34; instead of &#34;chicken&#34;, for example) even in the descriptive paragraphs, makes your food inaccessible to anyone who doesn&#39;t know enough Spanish to read your menu. I have a little Spanish so I knew how to look for things I would like, but I missed out because I wasn&#39;t about to ask our already impatient waitress for help understanding the menu. 

The food, though, was OUTSTANDING. I haven&#39;t had Mexican cuisine this good in a very long time, and it rivals some of my favorite restaurants in Southern California and even some of the dishes I&#39;ve eaten in Mexico. Here&#39;s the low-down of what we ate: I had a half-portion of pozole (hominy soup) and the camarones a la diabla (shrimp in a creamy red sauce), Hubs had the mole michoacno (chicken in a savory chocolate sauce), friend 1 had beef fajitas, and friends 2 and 3 shared a molcajete (a rustic &#34;stew&#34; served in a hot stone pestle). We all shared bites so I got to try everything, and I think that my camarones and the molcajete were by far the best entrees. 

Hubs and I shared the half-portion of pozole as an appetizer. This was by far one of the best things I ate the whole evening. I was really excited when I saw it on the menu because I haven&#39;t even encountered it at a Colorado restaurant yet, and it&#39;s one of the things I miss about living in SoCal. The pozole here is so fresh and savory - I think I could live on it forever and ever!

The &#34;diabla&#34; sauce that came on my shrimp is a little like an extra thick, creamier, red enchilada sauce. It was incredibly flavorful and well-balanced. The meal included a side of rice and some fresh veggie toppings (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole) and choice of flour or corn tortillas. If I come back, I will get a molcajete because I really want to have that at least once (the presentation is impressive and the sauce is unlike anything else I&#39;ve ever eaten), but for subsequent visits I would be tempted to get the camarones a la diabla again. 

The atmosphere was not what I had been hoping for. We came out to dinner specifically so we could visit with our friends, and noise level just made it completely impossible. The dining room was just so loud - in a really unpleasant way. The establishment itself made it worse by pumping loud music on top of the din of customers who had to shout in order to converse. For this reason, I doubt I would ever come back for dinner. I think if I do try Adelitas again, it will have to be for lunch. And that is a big &#34;if&#34;."

Hidden behind an a charming facade - is delicious food and a bevy of tequila options.

I had the carne asada with shrimp. I&#39;m not usually a fan of shrimp but these resembled prawns. 

Big, juicy and perfectly cooked, not to mention they packed a little bit of heat. The flank steak was moist and had a lot of flavor.

Started with a house margarita which was delicious.

Server was nice, polite, and quick.  She brought cheap beers and took our order quickly.

Food was...alright.  I had heard good things about this place and the accompanying food, and was looking forward to a tasty Mexican cuisine meal.  But it was just so-so.

Nothing stood out.  The platter I got all tasted the same, the food blended together into just a plate of the same-old-same-old.

I wasn&#39;t disappointed per se, but just a little bummed that the awesome food so many had told me about never materialized.  For the price, I was hoping for more awesomeness.

For drinks we had the Down in Laredo, the award winning house marg, and the Flogata marg. I enjoyed the Flogata tremendously with the jalapeno simple syrup. The Down in Laredo was awesome- it had tequila and whiskey and came together nicely.

Well over the years she really got her act together because some damn fine Mexican food comes out of her kitchen here!

My party of four had a hankering for a Mexican lunch so we blew in here on a recent Saturday.  We snagged one of the very few parking spaces in the alley to the left of the restaurant.  We were lucky.  It&#39;s more likely that you will be dealing with street parking.

I&#39;ve been to tons of Mexican joints and the ATMOSPHERE of this one is like most.  There is a huge bar and rustic tables and tons of Mexican kitsch. What a surprise: it&#39;s decorated just like a Mexican Cantina!

While we perused the menu we were served a ginormous portion of chips and three salsas.  Everyone has a preference but just so you know, they serve the thick chips here.  The three salsas were much appreciated as each was a different heat so everyone was satisfied.

No Mexican meal is complete unless accompanied by a Margarita.  I tried the house version on the rocks and it was excellent.  It was strong and just the right tartness for me.

I ordered the Pollo con Crema for $13.95.  It arrived quickly and as you can see from my pic was plated beautifully.  The flavor profile of the sauce was perfect.  My experience was slightly marred by the fact that my two pieces of chicken were bone in.  I would have preferred a more typical boneless version.

Throughout our meal our waitress was friendly and always available so CUSTOMER SERVICE was never a problem.

We met some friends here a few nights back. It was very busy when we came in, apparently word got out about this awesome little place. The service here is great, while we knew who our server was, there was a team of people there supporting him by checking up on us and moving plates out of our way throughout the meal. 

We started with a pitcher of margaritas, often restaurants skimp on quality when giving you such a high volume of booze but in this case we were not disappointed. The margs had just the right amount of sweet and sour with tequila. Our friends also ordered this amazing appetizer, I wish I remembered what it was called, but it was some sort of Mexican pork sliders on a really good bread/tortilla/sopapilla thing.

I ordered the tamales in mole sauce, the server warned that it isn&#39;t like typical mole, it is more tomato based, this made me a little nervous so I had it on the side, but as soon as I tried it I dumped it all over my food because the flavor was amazing. My boyfriend went with the rellenos which were very authentic and delicious.

We ended the night with Mezcal, a very interesting, delicious type of tequila. The server provided the history of Mezcal, the best way to drink it, and even an explanation of the glass it came in. We sipped on it and our friends also ordered a flan which looked amazing, I was was sticking with a margarita for my dessert.

When we left we admired the local artwork lining the walls. I always appreciate a local spot that also supports local artists. The work was very impressive and added on the Adelitas already great charm."

They open late so it&#39;s a great place to go after work for tacos and drinks. They have great happy hour after 9pm where tacos are $2. They have a huuuuuge assortment of tequilas and the house margaritas are delicious! Try their salsa flight too, the tomatillo is my favorite and the guac mix one (not sure what it&#39;s called) is hit or miss for me, but still super yummy!

Was pretty busy so we had a 20-30 minute wait, which they told us a head of time. Once sat the restaurant was extremely loud, hard to hold a convo with it being that loud. 

But let&#39;s talk about the important thing, the food.
Probably the best carne asada I&#39;ve had in a long time. I had some carne tacos, a carnitas taco and rice and beans. The carnitas was good but to me the carne was a lot better! It was great. 
We also got the salsa flight and guacamole.. Which I could pass on. None of the salsas were very good (the tomatillo salsa is great on the meat but just on a chip it over powers it), and the guac was kind of bland too. The chips themselves were good tho. 

As you can see, not a ton of positives but what was good was really good! I would go back just for the tacos, which are easily a 5 star!"

Adelita&#39;s food has won my heart and I cannot wait to come back multiple times to try everything on the menu (in a form of a scroll, how cute is that?!?)

Puerco con chile Colorado would be something I&#39;d like to get every time (what contradiction with the statement I&#39;d just made!) because the sauce is so flavorful you&#39;d want to use up your last bit of warm tortilla (also great BTW, thin, large, warm to the touch, and chewy) to wipe clean the plate! The pork is so tender that if it was on a bone, it&#39;d achieve that &#34;fall off the bone&#34; sensation. Refried beans are perfect and the rice is the best Mexican rice I&#39;ve ever had. The color isn&#39;t orange but a pale yellow, yet it&#39;s got good flavors, also fluffy so it doesn&#39;t taste like day-old rice that&#39;s been reheated. I actually wish there was more of it! Enchilada Suizas is a nice combo plate where you can fill all 3 enchiladas differently. I went with beef, chicken, and cheese. The cheese, I thought at first, was funky as it had that gum texture as if it hadn&#39;t been cooked through, but nope, the thing was hot, so it&#39;s just a new kind of cheese I&#39;m not used to. But the flavor was good so needless to say, I finished it all. I also got to try my fellow diner&#39;s torta sandwich. I have better places to go for torta but it doesn&#39;t mean Adelita&#39;s is bad. I like my torta to be almost like a Cuban pressed sandwich and theirs is more loose, still tasted good though. 

Too focused on the food this time, will have to concentrate on the other aspects next!"

The food is authentic and flavorful. The chef is from Mexico. The carne asada and enchiladas are my personal favorite but really like everything else I&#39;ve tried, tamales, fajitas, a veggie burrito, tacos. And, of course, margaritas. And believe me, I love my Mexican food."

We decided to have dinner here because we hadn&#39;t been in quite a while. It was the busiest I had ever seen it. Who knew that Adelitas was the place to be on a Wednesday night?
The spot is pretty small so we had a small wait but that was A-OK with me because the waiting bench was right next to the bar. Adelitas has a smattering of tables, booths and a large community table in the center of the restaurant. You can also sit at the bar. 
We always, always, always start out with a couple of spicy margaritas (amazeballs) and the salsa trio. The spicy margarita has a darn good bite to it but doesn&#39;t melt your face off. The salsa trio is tasty. All three salsas are very different and delicious!
I have tried their mole (maybe the best I&#39;ve had in Colorado), the fajitas (lots of food and super tasty) and the shrimp el diablo (they don&#39;t skimp on the shrimp!). Jeff almost always orders the chili Colorado. To be honest, we have yet to order anything here that wasn&#39;t tasty. 
The staff here is always friendly and the service is always quick. This has been a staple of ours for a minute and I don&#39;t see that changing anytime soon."

You probably already know that by now. Instead, I will generously offer you an insider&#39;s tip. People rave about their Taco Tuesday specials. And, although it is great food for a lovely little price tag, I would actually recommend Chimi Wednesday. For 5 bucks you get a large, breaded and fried burrito with any of the meat and sauce options for the tacos. Hopefully this doesn&#39;t create too big of a ruckus--I don&#39;t want to deal with Tuesday-sized waitlists. But, check out their chimmis, they will not disappoint. 

The regular menu is great too. I love their mushroom chipotle sauce. They also have a great selection of salsas--I always like to order the sampler, but have found that my favorite is the guacamole salsa. Mmmm..."

Though I think the chips &amp; salsa charge is pretty silly, the fact that their house marg is not drowning in sweet and sour and is actually GOOD more than makes up for it.
Upon the recommendation of our server, I had the Puerco con Chile Colorado and subbed veggies in for the rice and beans. This is basically pork smothered in a delicious red chile sauce. It was fantastic!
Hubs had a chile relleno with rojo salsa and a chicken enchilada smothered in mole. He was a big fan of both.

They were busy, but managed to seat us rather quickly. Ordered the pollo con crema and the carne asada plates, as well as some chips and salsa. The salsa was rather bland and watery by itself but went well with the over salted chips.

Our plates were well portioned for the price, but were overall not top quality and not very flavorful. The flank steak they used for the carne asada was marinated well, but the cut was such inferior quality that it became stringy and rubbery. The pollo con crema was mediocre at best. Beans were good, but the Spanish rice tasted like something out of a box... The vegetables were not fresh, and the lettuce was beginning to rust.

The service and atmosphere was ok, but the food quality is seriously lacking. Might be a good place to grab a drink, but if you&#39;re looking for top notch Mexican food - find another spot."

The refried beans had no taste and seemed &#34;canned&#34;. The shrimp tasted frozen and were super small and the diabla sauce seemed to be just tomato sauce and chile powder.

The size of the house Margaritas - hm, I think those are the smallest margaritas I&#39;ve ever seen. 
Shrimp ceviche - very lackluster and boring. Barely any shrimp, needed more lime juice and salt. 
Carne Asada tacos - the beef was very dry.

Redeeming qualities - some of the best chips and salsa, chipotle mushroom sauce was super delicious (I even looked up the recipe to use in my cooking). 
Overall, the ingredients were fresh.

This was also on our dining out passport so we thought we would check it out. We started out with their house marg, $6 with reposado tequila, which we both were quite happy with. In round 1, my wife had the house with silver tequila $5.5, and we both agreed the reposado was better and thus, worth the 50cents. Our server, NATE, was great. He was approachable, friendly and professional. The restaurant was packed but it didn&#39;t seem to affect him or our service. He gets a 4.5 star for service. The food, well, not amazing. We both felt it was lackluster and nothing special at all. My wife had mix and match enchiladas that were just fine, also not warm enough she mentioned. I had the diabla shrimp that I also thought were fine but nothing special. Perhaps a bit overcharged for this dish @ $16. I probably wont&#39; be back. So I thought...

Although the outside is nothing fancy and parking can be difficult to find during peak dinner hours, the interior is well decorated and clean. The menu was unique in a scroll like laminated cloth material which I enjoyed because it was different. Ordered 3 of the tacos with a mix and match of different meats and sauces. Food came out timely and was delicious and just filling enough.  Was slightly saddened that chip refills were not free, but the complimentary sauce test plate made it worth it."

She was neither knowledgeable about items on the menu nor on the drinks available. Just overall not very helpful. It felt as if she didn&#39;t want to serve us (came off quite pretentious), hardly made eye contact, and constantly reached over us while we ate to grab small items (straw wrappers, a piece of chip, etc.) off our table. She took our napkins repeatedly while we were still using them. We started to pay attention to other servers, and everyone else seemed much more personable.

Where to start? First of all, when you walk in the restaurant it looks a bit more like a bar than a restaurant, but trust me, it is a restaurant!

Okay and how cool are the menus? I am apparently easily impressed with gimmicks but the menus were printed on a scroll of  canvas. I thought they were cool, and huge!   About five pages of things to eat!

We started with the house margaritas, rocks and salt, and Bam! They pack a punch right away. Very good- not too sweet.

We tried the very popular sopas. They were tasty, but I was actually more impressed by the salsa and chips basket- the salsa is very flavorful, not too spicy, and the chips were fresh and delicious.

For entrées, I tried the enchiladas and my friend tried the fajitas. We both went home with boxes.

The enchiladas were gigantic and filled with loads of chicken and cheese...These are not little poor man&#39;s enchiladas.  I tried the green sauce and loved it.  They were served with rice, beans and a little bit of sour cream- Yum!

The fajitas were amazing and huge, served on three platters of food. Three people could easily split these.

There was no room for dessert. I will be back in a heartbeat and will continue to sample the margaritas as well as the menu. There&#39;s a lot to choose from here. And the waiters were also quite attentive!"

It took kind of a long time to be greeted and seated the last time, and my boyfriend and I both got the impression that none of the staff really seemed like they wanted to be there. Our waiter was kind of indifferent in his demeanor and interest in taking care of our needs, and the hostess was kind of rude. (Again: no one seemed like they liked their jobs very much.)

The salsas are passable, but definitely not exceptional. And chips and salsa aren&#39;t included with the meal unlike a lot of other places. However, the chips are homemade and really good. I got a veggie fajita that was pretty overpriced, but again, was passable. 

But yeah, if you&#39;re looking for exceptional Mexican food, you won&#39;t find it here. But if your expectations aren&#39;t high, you probably won&#39;t be disappointed."

To start, it&#39;s not very reassuring to walk into a Mexican restaurant and not see any Mexican people...  Anyways, my girlfriend and I happened to come in for lunch on Wednesday after recently moving to the area. Since it was not Tuesday, we tried some other dishes in the menu: the chicken mole and the tamales. Both tasted bland and under seasoned. I had the mole and was excited to see the deep red sauce when it came out but the flavor did not hold up to its appearance. On a positive note, all of the servers were super friendly and helpful. We will have to come and try the $1 tacos, although this may be a place where the food is you get what you pay for."

I have been wanting to come here for a while and stopped in for dollar tacos for lunch.  The place has a great vibe, don&#39;t really dig the scroll menus as they are difficult to read but the menu seemed pretty appealing as far as items I wanted to try.   We just got some chips and salsa and some tacos. The salsa really did not have much flavor.  Needed some salt, cilantro, more onion or something, it was fresh and that kept it from failing altogether. They do have a salsa sampler that I will try next time

   I ordered 1 chicken, 1 pork, 1 steak and 1 shrimp taco.   They looked great when they came out and looked very appealing.  They were all just a dollar except the shrimp which they charge 4 dollars for.  The shrimp were very low quality frozen tiny shrimp the kind you get in a frozen bag at the grocery and although they had a lot of nice ingredients with them nothing could cover up the fact they are were pretty low quality, I would not get again.  The steak were simple and delicious, the chicken were pretty good too as were the pork.    Other food that was coming out of the kitchen  looked really good and I started to wish I had ordered something off the main menu.   I will definitely give this place another try as I feel the tacos are not totally representative of all their food."

The house margarita is made my favorite way: tequila, triple sec, agave and lime. The yellow corn chips were freshly made, light, crispy and not over salted.

It was pretty late &#34;for Denver&#34; around 9:30pm and I was craving a margarita and some mexican food. I had called a couple other places that were closed already, then I found Adelita&#39;s and they were open til 11pm on a Wednesday. Awesome. We walked in and there was only one other group of people eating, but there were 5-10 people at the bar. The restaurant has a more of a cozy modern mexican vibe to it which I liked a lot. Nice art on the walls and I always love exposed brick. 

Service was prompt and got my margarita out quickly while I was still looking over the menu trying to decide what I wanted. Boyfriend decided on a chicken burrito, and since it was kinda late I figured we could just split it. The burrito was huge, and our waiter suggested getting it smothered with their &#34;christmas sauce&#34; so we could try both the chile verde and chile rojo. The chile verde is not your typical green chile, it is made from tomatillos instead of your traditional hatch chili. It was great. It has a very different tangy flavor to it, its surprising at first but then grows on you. Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was great the whole time answering our questions and bringing everything out quickly. 

We will definitely be back to try more of their food items. They also have daily specials (like $2 tamales on Thursday&#39;s) and 2 daily happy hours :)"

It&#39;s not often that I venture out for Mexican food, but when I do I want it to be flavorful and to satisfy my craving.    

Service has been on point on both occasions.  Friendly staff with the willingness to provide recommendations when I&#39;m being indecisive.  The place is upbeat and would be a great place to come and chill at the bar or sit in one of the large plush booths against the wall.  

Chips and salsa is a staple at any Mexican place and is an excellent way to judge how tasty your food is going to be.  The salsa trio is large enough for a table of four but may be a little too big for a table of two.  Three salsas each with a different flavor and texture, the classic red salsa which is the mildest of the three with diced onions and tomato&#39;s, the tomatillo salsa with a bit more heat and has more of a blended texture, and then the avocado crema as silky as a chocolate mousse with just a hint of heat and vibrant green in color.  Each one was refreshing on its own, my favorite was following our servers suggestion and mixing the tomatillo and avocado crema for the perfect bite.  

The Enchiladas Suizas is a popular choice here and is top notch.  The portions are on the larger size, you receive three Enchiladas with your choice of filling and yes you can mix and match.  Then you choose your sauce, I was a fan of the green Chile Verde however you can also choose the Mole if you desire.  The meats are tender and flavorful, and the Chile Verde adds a good tang to the entire dish.  I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of having some taco&#39;s here and have to say the Camarones was my favorite, the shrimp were lightly grilled and then topped with a chipotle cream, cabbage, and sliced avocado - all my favorite things in one taco.  The Al Pastor and Carne Asada were delicious as well but the Camarones will stand as my favorite for now.

Adelita&#39;s is where everything comes together in such a way there is only one way to leave - full and happy!"

I ordered the carne asada tacos and a side of rice. The tacos were good, they seemed a little peppery but aside from that I was satisfied. The rice was really, really good.

The place was quite popular as there were 5 people in front of me and roughly 10 to 15 in people dining in.   Seemed like they were regulars.  

Food seemed fresh as well, like it comes out instantaneously. Two of the dishes were replaced while I was waiting in line.  I wish the place looked visually pleasant than it did.  It&#39;s not something I&#39;d brag about but that&#39;s just me.  

When I was there, they had a kid working the register, like a little boy.  And I saw another kid in the background delivering food to the cooks in the back.  Is that weird? Family owned business, most likely?

Overall, the food tasted good.  I got the Lo Mein and Sesame Chicken with a few Won Tons for $4.50.

There were prices next to what it was.  Getting 2 scoops of sweet and sour, 2 scoops of sesame chicken.  The batter and chicken tasted fresh and really good, but their sauces aren&#39;t up too par.  Watered down tasting sweet and sour sauce (the reason pll say it&#39;s tasteless/bland), a little too sweet of sesame chicken.  HERE&#39;S THE DEAL, it tasted really amazing when I did some of my own tweaking, ditching their nasty sweet and sour, I used my own (stuff I buy at King Soopers called &#34;East West Classic Sweet and Sour Sauce.&#34;) and I added my own red pepper flakes (it had none) to the sesame chicken to give it spice and balance the overly sweet tastes.  Leaps and bounds better!   If only they would do these same things Bird&#39;s Nest, wow, they could really improve the taste.

I don&#39;t assume that she did this intentionally, but nonetheless, the charge caused my account to overdraw, therefore becoming a much more costly mistake than it would have been. Not only that, but when I thought it was fishy that she was making me sign a second copy of my receipt, her lack of knowledge of English made calling her on it a near impossibility.

The wait time is a little ridiculous but it seems to be very popular due to its great food. I would definitely plan ahead and be here at least thirty minutes before you actually want to eat. Maybe longer on the weekends. 

I have only been a couple times but have gotten great service each time. Worth the wait times. There are multiple locations but after talking to others, this seems to be the one with the least wait times. Would recommend going during the week if possible.

All in all, great experience"

Sat for 5 minutes before being offered a smile a cup of coffee or even a menu.  
The server was nice once he finally finished chatting with a customer who had already finished and paid.  I&#39;m just glad I was not in a hurry.  When you dine alone it seems every minute ticks by.  
I ordered the chilaques Benedict that has beef.  They also have a green chili Benedict made with pork.  
The food came out quickly.  It was served, I took a bite.  I swear it was the pork chili Benedict.  I had a hard time getting ketchup.  I took a bite and it sure tasted like pork and was already getting cold.  When I was able to ask if what I had in front of me was the beef they took it back, to check.  They brought my plate back, which was super cold now and a sample of the pork.  I didn&#39;t want to argue but asked if they could please remake it because I was certain it was cold now.  They happily remade it.  
This time it was beef, and I could see the tortillas underneath.  It was definitely what I ordered and was hot.  After that everything went as expected.  The Benedict was good, and I couldn&#39;t even finish it."

The breakfast drinks will always help you kick a hangover and whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory breakfast food you can&#39;t go wrong. I&#39;ve tried several items on the menu though most are escaping my memory right now.  Most recently I&#39;ve tried the egg white fritata which was on the lighter side.  I&#39;ve also
 tried the banana french toast,  eggs benedict and the pineapple upside down pancakes just to name a few and I&#39;ve never once been disappointed.

Not to the Lone Tree location, but I must say that that Snooze offers a menu that could use a little more creativity. 

FOOD: Pot Pie with a sunny side up egg. The portion size can be considered &#34;small&#34;, but overall, I think the size is perfect for brunch. Could have used some more seasoning, but not bad! 

SERVICE: I&#39;m a fan of Colorado friendliness. Maybe after my few years away in New York and California has made me a little crusty on the outside, but coming back reminds me how nice people are. Our server, Hakuna Matata (talk about LOL), was friendly and accommodating to our party of three. 

The waits don&#39;t really justify the quality of food (about a 40 minute wait), but it is a Colorado classic. Come by for a cup of Joe, some pancakes, or whatever you feel to enjoy the Colorado air."

We went on a Friday and had no wait at all which was a bit surprising even though the place was packed.  

First of all, this is a very very loud establishment. The music is loud, the people are loud, it&#39;s just a noisy place. If you&#39;re looking for a quiet way to ease into the morning this is not it.

One of the issues with that I was not super hungry so I ordered the loaded hashbrowns. What I got had nothing brown about it. They were basically raw potatoes that had been shredded and cooked on the grill for a second. Their only redeeming quality was some outstandingly delicious thick-cut bacon, caramelized onion and cheese.  I would not order this again. I thought maybe it was just my dish but the side order of hashbrowns my husband got were woefully undercooked as well. Call them something else besides hash browns if you&#39;re not keep them on the grill long enough to brown.

One star for the bacon and the other is for our very super sweet server whose name I have forgotten but he was very kind and efficient. Also their silverware is quite heavy which I love!"

ITS SIMPLE: Best breakfast in Denver.  

Example:  Dear friends of ours moved to Florida because of work.  There LAST meal in Denver this morning... Snooze. 

My favorite is the Benny.  Classic or with salmon.  Today I had the breakfast tacos and they were awesome.  Very filling.  
  
I almost always get a pineapple upside down pancake on the side. Ridiculous.  

Decor original, coffee while you wait, they will text you when tables ready and the food is just straight up good.  Now my only thing on the menu I didn&#39;t enjoy was the pot pie. It just didn&#39;t fill me up.   But other than that I haven&#39;t had a thing that I didn&#39;t like.  

If you haven&#39;t been, go. 

Be prepared to wait!  Plan for it. Try to go during the week or after the rush in the morning.

I got the pancake flight with the sweet potato pancakes, peach strudel pancakes, and OMG French toast. I liked the French toast the best, and the sweet potato pancakes the least (which were still good, just not as awesome as the OMG French toast). I liked being able to try multiple types of pancakes!

Gotta say, loved the vibe as soon as we got in and it was packed! We had a 5-10  min wait and then it was hard deciding what to get as pretty much everything on the menu looked so good!! I spotted the folks on the next table over getting a luscious looking plate and asked them what they ordered and so ended up getting the same - a Benny Duo! My two choices were Ham Benedict III (that smoked cheddar hollandaise sounded interesting) and the Benny Goldman cause I&#39;m a big salmon fan. My coworker got the pancake flight and choose the pineapple upside down pancake, the sweet potato pancake and the blueberry Danish pancake. I also got a small OJ.

So first of all, everything was just super delicious! My co-worker actually started talking about moving to Denver :-) the menu was fresh, exciting, innovating and the food lived up to its promise. Eggs were poached perfectly and I would absolutely get the Benny Goldman again! Also that sweet potato pancake - It inspired me to look at online recipes and recreate this one at home - that ginger and cinnamon spice just hit all my olfactory notes perfectly. 

Absolutely recommend and can&#39;t wait to return!

If I drank coffee, I would appreciate the free coffee station while waiting for your table. My beautiful wife would have enjoyed a cup, if any clean cups were available. We were there on a Sunday around brunch time so they were slammed, but still. It would have been less disappointing if complimentary coffee wasn&#39;t available at all, rather than coffee for the taking without a cup to pour it into. 

No complaints about the service, and the food came out timely. I got a breakfast sandwich which by mistake came out with sausage instead of the bacon I ordered but the waitress was quick to get a side of bacon out to us. My beautiful wife got their breakfast tacos which she enjoyed very much!

They have tables/booths inside, outside seating, and bar seating as well. I&#39;ve been to multiple locations, and they all to have a similar set up in regards to seating.

The fact that they have a booze menu is also a super plus! I work nights and sometimes at 8am when I get off work It&#39;s nice to be able to indulge in a Bloody Mary or mimosa.

We had a great time! Our waiter, Hakuna Matata, was awesome. We had a hard time choosing as we wanted to try the peach pancakes and knew they were on a limited time menu, but also were hungry for eggs.

He solved the problem by bringing us one peach pancake (which was plenty) for us to share!!! It was so good and fluffy.

We each got three different dishes and all of us had to ask for boxes. I ordered the breakfast tacos on our servers recommendation and they were great!! One of my friends ordered a skillet and the other ordered the Benedict. All were delicious!!

The only issue was the wait. It wasn&#39;t long, but there were a lot of people waiting when we pulled up, and this was a week day--I can&#39;t even imagine what Snooze is like on the weekends.

There have been 9 parties of two go ahead of us due to the very poor and limited seating for groups greater then two.  They should convert some of the seating for two to a higher number.  So if it&#39;s just two of you, you will get a seat much faster then any number greater then that.  My two little girls and myself waited 40 minutes.  Then a party of 4 that the front seemed to know showed up.  You could tell by body language and small talk it was favoritism.  I would have lost it if my girls weren&#39;t with me.  Very poor!  I will say the food was pretty good.  They need to do something about the seating."

I ate here for the first time today and I was overjoyed to find out that everything except for 2 things on the menu can be made gluten free. The gluten free pancakes and French toast were so good that my husband couldn&#39;t tell the difference and finished off my plate. The toppings were unbelievable. I will be back here every time I am in Colorado. Our server was so nice and the decor is precious.

But they have an interesting and innovative menu, I absolutely loved the corned beef, and the jam for the toast was amazing.

My boys loved their French toast and pancakes. I sampled, I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s pretty good.

As much as I adore a good Benedict, and love some variety, I&#39;m a purist about hollandaise. I suspect the things they add (like cream cheese) are there as stabilizers. It&#39;s great, I get the point, but the proteins in milk and cheese products mute the other flavors that make a good hollandaise perfection. I just can&#39;t bring myself to do it. 

But they have lots of fans. 

In spite of the hollandaise heresy, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s innovative, and their pancakes are delicious little clouds. I&#39;m glad we went. We will be back. When we can sit outside, because OMG, earplugs. :)"

We started with drinks, because when you are planning on drinking all day it is very convenient to have the option to begin at breakfast!  
I ordered the Gazpacho bloody and it was so so yummy!  My husband had the grapefruit mimosa, and even though he enjoyed his,  he said he wished he would have ordered the same as me.   For breakfast he ordered the chilaquiles benedict and I had the caprese benedict.  They were both absolutely wonderful! I was half tempted to beat him up and steal his and eat both.

Now for the food... preview the menu online before you go...everything looks delish...and go with your first instinct.

I&#39;ve been to this Snooze three times so far, and it&#39;s fine. The food is tasty (the coffee was lousy the first time I went, but they fixed that). I appreciate how great they are about food allergies; my wife has consistently been able to eat there safely. If you can&#39;t eat gluten, you can ask them to make you one of their Eggs Benedict dishes with avocado in place of an English muffin, which is awesome!

The only reason it&#39;s not worth five stars is that honestly, it&#39;s not worth the wait. Snooze is good, don&#39;t get me wrong, but there are plenty of other places I&#39;d be happy to eat at without waiting.

The pancakes are so soft and fluffy you wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s gluten free ! And the peanut butter chocolate is so rich and smooth.

If you get eggs benedict make sure to get 2 different kinds so you get to experience multiple tastes.  I took my mom here recently and she ordered french toast and gave me a taste.

Very nice service and tasty options. My one complaint: my breakfast burrito came out a little cold, but not so much that I&#39;d send it back. (The burrito is so big and flavorful I skip adding any meat- you won&#39;t miss it!) Husband had 3-egg omelette with mushrooms and goat cheese which he enjoyed - warning, it&#39;s a little wet because both his fillings are kind of wet, so keep that in mind. Son got omelette with chorizo, onion and something else, loved it. Son&#39;s hash browns were so cute, in circle like they pack it into a mold to give it that shape. Both the guys subbed a pancake for a side. Son&#39;s sweet potato pancake was excellent. So was husband&#39;s pumpkin one but I&#39;m not a huge fan of the pumpkin seeds on top.

At that time I had their standard French toast and thought it was so very delicious. So when a friend recommended we visit again I jumped at the opportunity. Our wait was only 20 minutes, something rather good for a Saturday morning. The hostesses were very friendly despite eager customers swamping the doors. 

Since pancakes are essentially how they made a name for themselves I went ahead and ordered a single Pineapple upside down with a side of hash browns and a breakfast taco. Admittedly pancakes are not my favorite breakfast food, and this visit reconfirmed that notion for me. It was very sweet, but not in a delicious candy way, just sweet for the sake of being sweet; I have a huge sweet tooth so even penning these words is bizarre. The pancake itself never turned soggy, which I appreciated, but the whole dish was not up my alley. My friend had the Strawberry Shortcake and again I was left with the same impression.

On the bright side the hash browns had a nice presentation and were perfectly done. The breakfast taco was also quite good - it had a green chile hollandaise sauce that was interesting but lacked any spice or flavor imparted from the implied spice; still though, a good option as I just had one. 

Since it was a Saturday it was very busy and we didn&#39;t see the waitress quite as often as I would have liked. A different person brought out our food. Which is fine, however I let this person know I would also like a cup of coffee and it never made it to my table. 

Overall not a bad dining experience, but I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn&#39;t ordered pancakes ..."

I had a half order of the Bella Bella eggs Benedict which was delicious and a flight of pancakes. I had the pineapple upside down cake, the coffee and donuts and the peanut butter cup! They were a nice size and I wasn&#39;t able to finish it! The PB cup is a must for PB lovers like myself! My boyfriend had the stuffed French toast and was also extremely pleased! Coffee was delicious! I had a caramel latte and he had a chai. I will definitely come back when in town, although I found it a little pricy for breakfast."

Will you be confined to overpriced Chili&#39;s? Or come across a great local spot that just happens to have an airport location? (I&#39;m lookin&#39; at you Root Down!) 

However, when it comes to small airports, you can almost always count on there being a cute little cafe with quality eats. Such is the case of Blue Sky Bistro at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport. And no, you don&#39;t need a plane ticket to eat here!

We walked up to the counter and I spotted a BBQ brisket sandwich as a special. SOLD. From there, we found a seat at one of the tables outside that offered a beautiful view of the front range and airplane runway. There weren&#39;t any planes taking off so it was rather quiet and one of those settings that reminds you why Colorado is simply the best. 

Our food came pretty quickly and I devoured by brisket sandwich! The meat was sandwiched between a soft hoagie roll that my fiancee couldn&#39;t stop talking about. On the side I got coleslaw which was pretty standard, and it also came with a refreshing slice of watermelon. 

All in all, an unexpected solid find in Broomfield. If you&#39;re looking for lunch in the area, definitely check this spot out!"

As per usual these days, we checked Yelp for a place to eat. I&#39;d seen this one come up before and didn&#39;t try it based on the fact that it&#39;s located at the airport. It&#39;s worth every one of the five stars I&#39;ve given it and the overall five stars it has earned at the time this review was written.

We arrived at 12:30 and were served immediately. It&#39;s a counter service shop. The service was excellent. In fact, after we&#39;d placed our order, one of the owners came to the counter to introduce herself and tell us a little bit about the place. She was very warm and sincere.

It&#39;s hard to beat the view of the front range outside! I recommend eating outside where you can watch the planes come and go. It&#39;s occasionally noisy as a plane taxi&#39;s in but, it&#39;s also pretty damn cool. There was even a group of planes practicing maneuvers for an air show while we were enjoying our meal!

Food... OMG!!! Sandwiches, fabulous, great tasting, generous portions, wow! The BBQ is really good! We also sampled the roast beef, the chicken pesto, and the chicken cordon bleu - all were really good!

Stop in and try this place when you get a chance! You will not be disappointed!

It really felt like she wants each and every person that tries her bistro to become a regular. 
Back to the food though. I knew I was going to order the barbecue before I even found where the bistro was at. Walking around the outside of the building I caught a whiff of the sweet delicious meat on slowly cooking away inside. Every Wednesday thru Friday, they pick a different item to barbecue, and they cook it right! I had the Texas cheesesteak. Built like a Philly, the only difference was barbecue beef brisket as the steak served with a side of bbq sauce to pour over the meat, onions, and peppers. Mmmm! I had mine with a side of pretty darn tasty coleslaw.

I&#39;ve been twice now for lunch and both times the food and service were great.  On my first visit, I tried the brisket sandwich - it was the special.  And it was HUGE!  You could easily split it with someone and still have leftovers for the next day.  On my last visit, I opted for the 1/2 soup and sandwich combo with a club sandwich and a cup of green chili.  The chili was so tasty - made with smokey pulled pork rather than just chunks of roasted pork like some others.  It&#39;s not a large place, and it can fill up at lunch time, so plan accordingly.  You&#39;ll be glad you did!"

Since then, I have been here about 5-7 times - both dining in, to-go, and delivery. It&#39;s located inside the Metro Airport and has plenty of seating both inside and outside. You can watch the planes or simply enjoy the fresh air that the patio provides. It&#39;s worth noting they also sell breakfast, but I have only had lunch here. 

Usually I&#39;ll spend about $8 for lunch including a cookie (without a drink). My favorite thing on the menu is the club sandwich - their bacon is always crispy, which I love. I tend to be kind of picky, and they are always willing to substitute ingredients without any extra charge. 

Every sandwich comes with your choice of sides - chips, homemade potato salad (which I recommend), and a couple other choices. Plus, you get a pickle and a mint. The cookies, called Hope&#39;s Cookies, are baked fresh and come in two&#39;s, perfect for sharing or for a sweet snack. My favorite is the chocolate chip. They also offer homemade BBQ on Wednesdays &amp; Fridays. 

A perfect example of their customer service: Last time I got my club sandwich, I added avocado (which is really guac), which is not included and therefore extra. When I got back to the office, I saw none on the sandwich. I called them back. Not only did they apologize but they offered to give me free guac when I came in next. That was months ago. 

When I walked in today, the cashier (and co-owner) recognized me and immediately said, &#34;I owe you avocado!&#34; It was great to feel appreciated. 

They also have a punch card available - come in 10 times and your 11th meal is free. The great thing about this is that I have lost or forgotten my card before and each time they are willing to start a new one for you and combine the card(s) you may have together.

I highly recommend this place - it&#39;s local, the food is great, and it&#39;s something different from the big box restaurants around here."

I drive by them every week but did not get to experience it until Westword Dish.  I ended up meeting my friend Chris over there last Saturday for early lunch.  I didn&#39;t want my ahi poke to swim away this time! :)  I met both Regan and Louie who run Ohana Island Kitchen.  I&#39;m super excited to say the aloha spirit has landed in the mile high city and the food came along with it as well!  Ahi poke bowl, spam musubi and a green tea to boot.  All this made my weekend and I can&#39;t say it enough, so ono! (yummy)  They will soon be relocating across the street to a larger facility where customers will be able to sit down instead of the two picnic tables outside.

You want to talk about a hole in the wall?  Yup, this is a window in the wall. haha.  I look forward to coming here for lunch on the days I can break away from the office.  I also look forward to what is planned for the new space and what&#39;s to come.  Mahalo nui loa!"

They currently do not have a sit in restaurant but just an order window with a couple of picnic tables. Very soon though they will be moving across the street. 

I heard of this place through a friend and as we had just gotten back from Hawaii, I was still craving Hawaiian food. Their menu is very small with about 5 dishes and a few choices of Hawaiian sun juices. As I can make my own Hawaiian food, I still wanted to try this local place out. We decided to try and share their spicy poke bowl, a tad pricey but it is fish. 

We didn&#39;t have to wait too long, maybe a little less than 10 minutes or so. It was served in a bowl with rice and poke, so the presentation was fine with an orchid flower. The bowl itself was just ok. But that is me comparing it to the fresh fish and poke bowls I was consuming a week ago. It was missing limu (seaweed) for me so to say I&#39;d go back for the poke bowl, most likely not. But there was one more item I&#39;d like to try so I&#39;ll be coming back for it. However, my hope is once they move into their larger space, I hope their menu gets bigger as well. 

I will update my review for the next time I visit at their new space."

I walked over on a very very hot Tuesday afternoon after reading about Ohana. 

I had the Kale Salad with pork and at the advice of help the Mac salad.

The line was short and service was great. The food took about 15 minutes and the presentation was top notch. I also has a pass-o-guava juice (the pink can). 

The kale salad was a refreshing and it was obvious the veggies were all really fresh. The pork was a great compliment. The walnuts seemed slightly out of place flavor wise but added a nice crunch. 

The Mac Salad is some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

In one sitting, two of us tried everything on the menu but my favorites were the SPAM musubi, the hawaiian sliders and the poke bowl special.  If you&#39;ve never had a musubi then this needs to be the first thing you order.  To be honest, you&#39;re not going to go wrong with anything you get.

Fish was excellent quality, very fresh. Sauce was perfect. This dish was absolutely delicious. Service was friendly and fast.

I also liked the pork sliders, but they did not wow me like the poke bowl. A little over-salted maybe?

The guava cake was a bit disappointing--it was fine, not bad at all, but it was a bit bland and plain (kind of like a step up from grocery store white frosted cake). I was just expecting a lot more guava flavor."

Ok so obviously it would make sense for me to try this place or any Local Hawaiian kine food since I&#39;m born/raised and 25% Hawaiian. I&#39;m not super hard or thaaaat picky because I know I&#39;m so far away from home so it&#39;s hard to get perfection.  On my 1st visit I was Super Happy &amp; my tastebuds were in heaven with the nice &amp; salty kalua pig! oinky oink.  I grew up eating this stuff and liked the saltyness of the pork because the rice evens it out, along side some good mac salad, wish they would maybe add some Ono kimchee please. :-) ..  The sliders were unique and good, but I went back here for da Bento box &amp; spam. The spam taste ono and just like my hubby makes his, but sometimes you just don&#39;t feel like cooking you own you know?. So of course we got some can drinks &amp; sugared up, and side mac salad.  Now I really Love there salad, traditional in taste, texture &amp; ingredients except for the having The big size macaroni, but I Actually prefer this because it&#39;s easier to pick up wit my chopsticks..lol

Ok so we went a second time the other day and I like to compare my previous pics to portions and so forth, and this time the pig was just as ono, but less serving?  Nooooh!  I honestly think maybe they were trying to stretch it out because they seem to run out fast on the Bento and this time she almost thought they were out of Mac salad?! what!!!  It was ONLY 1215pm!  Last time I we got there at like 1pm and the people behind us got the last 2 bento box because they ran out of RICE!!!!  Now anyone from back home knows that is a MAJOR Faux pa! Man during Hurricane season people be fighting over rice at da store!  Who the hell runs outta rice? come on it&#39;s a super cheap filler that you can stock up on and make more than you think you may need.  So low down:

Bento box- nice touch using the Noritamago furikake, but wish they maybe had shoyu for us to put on our rice?  Maybe they do if you ask &amp; bring my own. Pig is nice and salty, not for those with sensitive taste buds, I love the pickled veggies and egg, the Shibazuke is a nice touch. (the purple pickled veggie one) Sadly my second time my meat was 2 bites less than last time because it was a smaller portion.

Sliders- were tasty, but not up my alley, needed to try it though.

Poke Bowl special of the day- Now this was SOOOOO VERY disappointing!  Okay, first the bowl was 12 bucks, and not worth it!  I just went to L &amp; L and bought 6 of their small poke for cheaper.  Was Not marinated long enough and didn&#39;t have that Authentic poke flavor soaked through it. Plus it was too big. I wouldn&#39;t mind big if they had more flavor. I mean it wasn&#39;t terrible, but it was Very bland and not Hawaiian flavored like poke should be.  Maybe they are trying to cater to other taste buds?  

Mac Salad - not 100% traditional, but never the less just as delicious IMO &amp; hubby&#39;s!  I always order 2 sides of this and comes with a decent 2 scoops, so to me the price is worth it. 

All in all, even though the meat portion was smaller, it was &amp; is SOOO dang Ono Freaken liscious that I&#39;m still going back and get me 2 all to myself like I usually do.  Aside from the poke, and closer for me to drive too than L &amp; L by like 35 minutes, everything&#39;s worth it.   When I am craving just the piggy &amp; mac salad of course.  Almost as good as Zippy&#39;s &amp; L &amp; L&#39;s, and this is a complement."
ohana-island-kitchen-denver,Greg G.,jHqKq5K0-RqfPApiGmInQw,"Kailua, HI",0,1,0,3,8,ae_E9hnRA-QgOq5203Kovw,5.0,2016-06-22,"Small backstory, there is no genre of food that I am more picky in this world than Hawaiian since I was born in raised in Kailua, Hawaii and cook Hawaiian food regularly. 

With that being said, Ohana Kitchen destroys my insanely high standards with their amazing Kalua Pork Bento, and their Spam Musabis. Louie and Regan (the owners) are two of the friendliest people I&#39;ve met since moving to the mainland, and truly embody the aloha spirit, thus resulting in amazing service and food at an exceptionally reasonable price. The Kalua Pork Bento with Spam at $10 is not only delicious, but is 100% guaranteed to leave you full, and possibly with a little leftover for dinner.

Now I know, a lot of you who read the previous paragraph are saying &#34;spam!? no!!!!!&#34; Well, i suggest you let go of your preconceived notions of spam, because it&#39;s honestly delicious. Spam Musabi is the infamous &#34;spam sushi&#34; that any of your friends who have been to Hawaii recently may have spoken of. It&#39;s a piece of pan fried spam, in between rice, and wrapped in seaweed. It&#39;s the perfect lunch on the go, and is pure energy. 

Kalua Pork, or pig, is a slow cooked shredded pork with a very smoky flavor. Think a much more tender/juicy carnitas (or pulled pork) that is highly flavorful in such a way that needs no sauces. 

They are very new, and have a slightly limited menu, so to some it may be early to make the following statement, but I&#39;m confident they will soon be considered one of the best lunch spots in lower highlands. They certainly already are in my book and I will be going back as often as i possibly can."

We went on a weekend afternoon and it wasn&#39;t crazy busy but they were selling out of food fast. There were two covered benches outside where we sat and enjoyed our food. 

I ordered the poke bowl special (I don&#39;t think they serve this everyday) and the ahi tuna was to die for! The rice was delicious and had a flavor I&#39;ve never tasted before. My boyfriend ordered the pork bento box which was also amazing. Pork, tender and delicious rice. We shared the Mac salad and both loved it, as did our daughter. 

We each had our own little canned beverage. Mine an iced coffee with cream (in a can! Cool) and he had a guava juice, very tasty and refreshing.

A trip to the airport always includes a trip to L&amp;L, even though it seems like L&amp;L was nearly the only place we didn&#39;t go on our last 2 trips to Hawaii this year. 
Having said this, I actually give it 3.375 stars, not a flat 3. Ratings on a 5 point system are really hard for me to assign. As a teacher and scientist, I like to be able to differentiate grades on a more specific scale. A 14 out of 15 is much better than a 9 out of 10, if you get my drift. So in this case, I&#39;ve come up with 4 different criteria to total up to 20 points for this particular review. 

Service. 4/5. It was a bit of a wait, but it was a friendly wait. An hour before close and they were out of or almost out of many things, in spite of having a positive mention in the local paper the day prior. 

Location. 4/5. This is all relative and a way to raise an otherwise non-passing grade. (You teachers know what I&#39;m talking about). I live close, good grade. If you live far away, you probably wouldn&#39;t grade it so generously, but you might give it a higher grade based on the 2 adorable picnic tables or the cute flowers on the door/window counter. 

Food. 3.5/5. This is also a matter of taste, like all reviews, naturally. Louie said he prefers over-seasoned food to under-seasoned food, but I (and the boys, Q &amp; M) prefer well-seasoned food. Miles, who in Berkeley last week, only ordered Mac salad as his preferred snack, didn&#39;t even finish his 2 small scoops.  It was way over salted and pepper was the only other flavor that came through. The pork in the bento was cooked in teri sauce, then had a drizzle of more teri sauce. Now I know that some places in HI are like that, but not all of them were or needed to be. Q said, &#34;This is probably what Haole&#39;s think Hawaiian food should taste like.&#34;

Price/portions 2/5. I know this is LoHi and all, but really?  2 really small scoops of mac for $3.50?  The bento was not only small, but was 80% rice. Just &#39;cause you sprinkle furikake on it does not make it worth an extra 2 bucks. The rest of the bento was 15% pork, and 5% tsukemono (Japanese pickles). Regan did say they had enough for maybe 2 more bentos, but I hope there was only enough pork for 1.5 bentos and that Q just got gypped a bit. 

Total score = 13.5/20. It passed, but not by much. We will probably return, but it&#39;ll have to be earlier in their service. But I&#39;m really looking forward to their own space where they will be able to expand their menu and hire some more help."

The fish didn&#39;t have much flavor and there was a lot of rice. Just rice and fish... I&#39;m sure this is very authentic Hawaiian poke, but compared to the incredible poke served all across California, it was not nearly as satisfying. I would have preferred it served with some edamame / soy beans, option of avocado, seaweed/nori, cucumber etc. It would also be nicer served in a bowl rather than a compressed rectangular shape, so that one could toss it."

The owners/servers are super-friendly and the service is great. I had the King&#39;s Hawaiian pork sliders and a Spam musubi.  The pork was tender and flavorful topped with fresh shredded veggies served open faced on a semi - sweet roll drizzled with a slightly spicy homemade sauce.  The Spam musubi made for a great side.  Cooked Spam layered in between steamed white rice and wrapped in nori.  Even if you&#39;re not a Spam fan, you gotta try this!"

Food is okay but they overuse pork shoulder meat (which is cheap).  I don&#39;t want to repeat the previous reviews complaints but overall the value is just not there.  My subconscious and wallet tell me not to visit often because of the price and small portions.

However, overall I was extremely disappointed. I understand it is a small lunch place only open three hours a day, I also understand the very limited menu. However, for what it was, it wasn&#39;t worth the hype. They offered three meal options, all unoriginal and lacking inspiration. Pulled pork was the meat of choice for two and an $8 meatless kale salad was the final choice. A raw tuna poke bowl was also an option but this appeared to not always be available. You could add a slice of Spam for an up charge. I ordered the Bento Box thinking it would at least offer me the most variety of flavors. However it consisted of 2/3 box of white rice, 1/3 pulled pork, and a couple pickles. The pork both lacked flavor and was slightly nauseating. It didn&#39;t contain any sauce although that would have been a Godsend! You order through a window and are expected to tip the cashier so that you can stand around 10-15 minutes for them to dump a scoop of rice and a scoop of pork into a box. What am I tipping you for if you won&#39;t even bring out my order? You are lucky if you can get a seat since two outdoor picnic tables and a trash bin was all they provided for a dining area. I was really excited to try this but ended up never wanting to go back. Not even worth trying to find parking. Portion size was good and that&#39;s the ONLY reason they didn&#39;t get one star."

We came here for a broncos game to get away from the rowdy crowds in the big bars of downtown. There was a handful of TVs scattered around the bar so we could watch the game. Not too packed, it was a great place to watch a game and still be able to hold a conversation with your neighbor. 

We all got a burger, split the fries between two of us, and two beers (bogo offer). Came out to being around $17 per person. Not bad for a downtown burger spot. They let us pay for all the food upfront and throughout the game if we wanted more alcohol, they served us at the table and brought a tablet to us to pay so we didn&#39;t have to go back up to the front to pay. Service was fantastic, one  waiter in particular had us laughing at our table the whole time! 

I got the illegal cream cheese- A burger topped with- you guessed it- cream cheese, fried onions, and jalapenos. It was S-P-I-C-Y!!! To offset the spice, I had sweet potato fries that came with a rich and creamy cinnamon apple dip. I could have taken it home and spread it on toast. I even dipped my burger into the sauce, it was THAT GOOD.

The bogo offer for beers was $6 for two. They had around a dozen craft beers to choose from for that special. They also offer insane looking pitchers of margaritas for only $8. I will have to come back to try the margs!"

The waitstaff have a really intimate relationship with the menu and a very seductive way of describing menu items and the overall concept of this fine establishment. So in our case, we went a little crazy on our appetizer order just to explore the menu. 

TIP: One thing is clear, this is not a best kept secret by any means so a reservation is key. 

STARTERS
We ordered the OG Sushi Tacos (thanks to all the fellow yelpers), the Seafood Potstickers and last but not least, the octopus. Sadly the octopus was our least favorite, we are die hard octopus fans and this fell short for us on flavor. But we made the right call on the OG Sushi Tacos, so good and fresh. And the potstickers were also equally as enjoyable but next time we might opt for the Hamachi. 

MAINS
Anytime a menu has Black Cod as an entree, my knees get weak. If you haven&#39;t had the pleasure of enjoying Black Cod, get to it pronto. It&#39;s by far my favorite fish. More flavor than traditional Cod and melt in your mouth goodness. Definitely would recommend this main, hands down-biased or not. 
My husband ordered the duck and judging by his sudden lack of conversation I&#39;d have to say he enjoyed it just as much as I did mine. 

DESSERT 
We ordered the Banana Cream pie which unfortunately was pretty unremarkable. The base was like eating a good-for-you protein or granola bar. And the only part we really ended up eating was the bananas. If I had a second shot, I would have ordered the Sticky Toffee cake. 


Oh and if you need to use the restroom, it&#39;s a bit of an adventure- down an elevator, couple turns and you will find it. But be sure to take note of the bar/lounge that&#39;s in the basement and come early to enjoy it."

The OG taco sushi - the name says it all. The fried taco shell includes a small amount of rice, charred ahi tuna with mango salsa and sits on top of a mound of fresh guacamole (simple smashed avocados, lightly seasoned, not a whole lot of other fluff to get in the way). Slightly sweet mango with the saltiness of the other ingredients made the 2 bites so enjoyable!

Shishito peppers - nice &#39;meaty&#39; sized peppers, charred with some crisp shallots; several packed a punch but the burn doesn&#39;t linger

Grilled cuttlefish - asian inspired, with a light soy sauce, the cuttlefish was tender and cut into strips; something different and not often seen in non-asian restaurants

Local NY strip steak- three strips each of about 3 in in length. Each piece was cooked nicely to my desired preparation and sat on top of confit potato medallions along with some cooked miniature carrots - purple and yellow. 

Scottish salmon - mixture of mushrooms, asparagus, corn shoots paired well with the perfectly cooked salmon (very good portion size) and cooked such that the fish was buttery and flaky."

It would have been nice to be told about the added service charge when we were asked whether we&#39;d like to sit on the patio or in the blocked off street section. 

Our group had some dietary restrictions, hence we chose TAG over other participating restaurants since the menu appeared to be vegetarian/vegan friendly. Well... the sole vegetarian option on the menu had mascarpone and another cheese as the main ingredients, which made it unsuitable for vegans. They were willing to make a vegan mushroom risotto for the same price, which wasn&#39;t appealing. If I am paying $21 for rice, there better be some shaved truffle in it. Hence, I ordered sushi, since I can tolerate small morsels of fish. The sushi roll was okay, not memorable in any way. 

Drinks are upwards of $11, and they weren&#39;t willing to make changes or substitutions to the three choices. I like gin, and was forced to choose between a sweet/sparkly vodka Prosecco cocktail (headache waiting to happen) and a tequila/lime/jalapeno drink, which was (thankfully) quite good. 

All three desserts contained wheat and dairy, again a no-go for me, so I had a second tequila cocktail as my dessert. $60 for one sushi roll and two drinks? Miami flash back. Definitely not doing that again."

By far the best appetizer was the taco sushi. Beautiful presentation and a flavor explosion. A perfect salty sweet balance. A must try!

Best meal, hands down, was the short rib pho! I didn&#39;t see any reviews of it on here, so it must be a new (or temporary) item. The short rib was very tender, and the veggies complement it well.

Unfortunately because of the weather 3 of my team members couldn&#39;t make it out to Denver.  Ugh... Snow!!  Glad we chose this restaurant over some chain (originally was going to hit Capital Grill), and it was absolutely the perfect choice.

Decor: open brick wall, booths in the front, and high/low tables, with a special 2 seater for the chef&#39;s table.  

We opted for a regular table (half booth/half seats).  Our waiter was awesome, made some recommendations and wasn&#39;t pushy, which we appreciate because who the heck wants a hard sell over dinner?!?!  He was attentive w/o being over-bearing.  

Mocktail - coconut soda! Mmm... 

Food: started w/ 1) wild mushroom gnocchi w truffle - this was so rich in taste and well balanced w the roasted garlic. 2) seafood potstickers - this was ok, I wasn&#39;t too taken, the skins could be crispier... however the sauce was perfect! Tangy, sweet, &amp; mildly spicy... 

Main: NY strip steak w roasted rustic veggie, it was cooked perfectly at med-well and seasoned, coworker loved it!  I had their signature Miso Soy Cod - over edamame and baby sprouts.  I love white flakey fish when it&#39;s cooked right.  This one was delicious, soaked in miso soy marinade before cooking certainly made it more tender, flakey and the edamame complimented the fish.  

Closing out the night: deconstructed banana cream pie  (over graham chocolate tart crust, banana cream custard, fresh bananas and torched caramelized bananas) - very rich, might have been over kill!  My coworker had Amaretto ice cream... Probably the best choice to end the night (after such a heavy main).

We had three group starters, the tacos, hamburgers and butterfish. All three were delicious mouth bite sized starters, great presentation as well.

The shallots added a hint of sweetness and the aioli balanced this with a little salty creaminess.  The buns were slightly toasted and had a nice light crunch around the edges with a fluffy softness inside. Bite sized deliciousness! 

The duck fat fries lightly dusted with salt, sugar, and cayenne pepper made my boyfriend&#39;s day.  Each one has a slightly different seasoning balance which keeps them interesting. Could use a little less sugar. It should come with the Gorgonzola aioli. Great flavor combination. 

The charred ahi on the taco sushi was delicious too. The sushi rice in the taco sushi provided the nice mouthfeel of traditional sushi in the fun of a taco! The taco shell was satisfyingly crunchy and reminiscent of a cannoli shell. The guacamole and bright mango salsa were excellent additions. 

My boyfriend got the escape to colorado IPA and liked it. It&#39;s brighter than the IPAs he usually orders which was perfect with the sushi tacos. 

We came during social hour and the social white was crisp and had a slightly dry finish. Perfect for small bites.

I was EXTREMELY impressed with the quality of food, service, and atmosphere.

I booked reservations last minute for a Monday night dinner. We started at the bar with a few cocktails until they had a table ready for us. After seeing that they had omakase on the menu, I really wanted to try it but you need to give them at least 24 hours notice. :( 

That&#39;s OK, we went on with ordering from the normal menu. Our server brought out an amuse bouche as a little appetizer and we ordered some Tuna Tacos, Pork Belly, and a Angry Volcano Roll to start. All delicious but the tuna tacos were probably the best. They even had rice inside which is something I&#39;ve never seen before in tuna tacos. 

For entrees, I was in LOVE with mine. Miso Cod is always the way to go. It&#39;s rich in flavor - buttery goodness - melts in your mouth, fantastic! Get this dish, you will not regret it. My bf got the Duck breast which I should&#39;ve tried but I didn&#39;t because I want too busy devouring mine.

My husband had a chocolate espresso dessert that was very rich and pretty good, but it had a marshmallow side that was very  gummy and difficult to cut.

2. Meatloaf &#34;Moco Loco&#34; or something...(5 stars!): This meatloaf was absolutely rocking!  Super savory, spicy, caramelized onions with spicy barbecue, fried egg and sushi rice.  Total delight, could eat again for dinner!

3. Duck Fat Fries (5 stars):  Sugar crusted, salty, savory, wonderful

4. Burger (4 stars):  really good cheeseburger, came with the fries.  It was lovely, veggies were fresh.  It wasn&#39;t near as memorable as everything else.

Eager to return and try some of the desserts!"

For my entree, I had the &#34;Fish out of water&#34; which was a daily special prepared by chef&#39;s choice.  So if you are feeling adventurous and can&#39;t decide which fish dish you want. Just have some faith and get the daily, it won&#39;t disappoint!"

I was seated right away even though I saw several reserved parties come in while I was there so I think I lucked out.  After my Arabic final prep I had no brain left for decisions so I handed them all to my server and I now plan to call him for other life decisions because that meal was perfect.

I had the vegetarian option which changes so no guarantees that you&#39;ll have what I had.  It was a variety of spring roots and veggies on grits.  My heart sank.  I hate grits and I&#39;m from the South so don&#39;t tell me I haven&#39;t had grits the right way.  They shove them under fish and next to chicken and under your pillow while you sleep and they can cook down there but I&#39;ve still always hated grits.  I looooved those grits.  It was the best vegetarian meal I have had at a restaurant ever and I&#39;m including restaurants that only serve vegan or veg options in this statement.  The presentation was colorful and appetizing and the flavors were varied in each veg so every bite was unique and delicious.

I asked for a Spanish red wine (again throwing that choice on my patient server) and it was so perfect with the meal and the dessert.

Dessert (sorry again man, you&#39;re picking) was sticky toffee pudding and it was crazy good.  Perfect toffee sauce.  I was a waitress and hated when people made me pick for them so I felt guilty but tired won over guilty and he had great taste.

Overall it is on the pricier side but well worth it for what you get.  I will definitely be back and I will now try the other restaurants this chef owns."

So, naturally I wanted to check out the food scene.

I walked into Tag and was sat down immediately. The hostess left two drink menus and one food menu. One of the drink menus (mostly wine) was held in a manila folder, which seemed a little strange (not in sync with the overall theme of the restaurant) and the other drink menu (mostly beers) was simply a single sheet separate from the manila folder. If Tag is trying to sell to their clients that they are a fine dining restaurant, I highly suggest having a more presentable menu.

I asked a young man if the omakase menu for the night was a possibility for me to order, it took him a good 5-10 minutes to locate the chef. Finally the young man approached my table and gave me the bad news that the chef could not produce the omakase menu for the night.

I ordered the following:

SQUID INK FETTUCCINE - I have yet to taste a squid ink pasta better than Michael Voltaggio&#39;s INK. I don&#39;t think Tag makes the squid ink pasta in house. Since the pasta was so under-cooked, the pasta had a hard center like dry boxed pasta. The pasta tasted better after I had taken it home and nuked it.

CARAMELIZED BUTTERFISH - The best dish I had during my visit at Tag. The fish was perfectly cooked and the broth the fish was sitting in was delicious.

CANADIAN DUCK - It was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. 

The servers and runners were friendly and attentive. I think my first experience with Tag was okay, the only dish that was memorable was the butterfish."

Service was great, prompt and friendly.
We ordered the Farm greens, taco sushi,
Flash-seared hamachi and the Baja Fish tacos.
The kumquat jalapeño mojito was spicy but delicious.
I absolutely loved the taco sushi (but kept the mango salsa on the side, and never added it) the hamachi was fantastic but I could do without the poprocks.
The greens were a welcome fresh salad as we have been eating a little less than healthy items. The only thing that was off for me were the Baja fish tacos. The black bean purée had an off-putting aftertaste.
But I would love to come back and check out the full menu next time."

Of the three dishes, the sushi tacos and especially to beef sliders, were outstanding. I was less impressed by the gnocchi, but it was still fair. Since we kept it light for dinner, we decided to get dessert. My sister had the chocolate panna cotta. Of course I had a bite - yeah. It was amazing. I myself had the banana cream pie - wow!

Seafood heavy.  Had the og taco sushi to start.  Was tasty and a great dish to split as it comes with 4 mini tacos.  The menu has some rolls but we elected to go for the miso black cod entree.  Black cod is tasty in and of itself, but the preparation and presentation was rock solid.  Generous portion that was so satisfying.  I don&#39;t usually get dessert but I was so impressed with the dishes I opted for the Carmelites banana cream pie.  Sort of deconstructed but not in the usual annoying way that requires you to &#34;construct&#34; your food.  One of the top 10 desserts I&#39;ve ever had.  Honestly, so good.

They have some unique cocktails.. make sure to ask the server about them. They do a good job at recommending the right ones when you tell them what you like. 

I had the steak here while my friend had the salmon. Both were delicious, but omgoodness.... my steak... SOOO GOOD. It was so full of flavor... perfect texture, and perfect amount. I will definitely come back to have this steak again.

My favorite part of the evening was their cheesecake dessert.. it just melted in my mouth.. and I can&#39;t stop thinking about how amazing it was. Tag deserves 5 stars if it continues to bring out a smile each time I think about it! :)

I had heard such good things about TAG and couldn&#39;t believe it took me this long to finically check it out. 
In short, don&#39;t wait like me and just GO!

The place is located in Larimer Square with all the pretty lights, perfect for date night or even just a night out in the town with friends. It&#39;s cozy inside and has a basement for extra tables! Nice decor and music (at least when we were there!) 

For restaurant week, it was a set menu. I got the spicy tuna with rice cake, beef short rib with toga radii hollandaise sauce, and a chocolate bar. My boyfriend got the braised pork cheek with poached egg, trout with squid ink spaetzle, and lemon lilikoi meringue tart. Everything was delicious! My short rib was so tender and also my boyfriend&#39;s braised pork cheek! And the lemon tart? To die for! There was a bit of an error with my spicy tuna but they accommodated for that swiftly and let me pick another app- sweet potato ravioli with bourbon pecan sauce. Yum! Our server, Justin, and the Assistant Manager Laura were very apologetic for the error of my app and took our drinks out of our tab. Our drinks btw, mocktails, were light and refreshing! I got the kumquat virgin mojito and my bf got a coconut milk soda. That mojito could make me sober for life! 

To sum it up, TAG has an outstanding service. Their staff was wonderful, and their food is just unbelievably top notch quality. I cannot wait to come back and try their regular menu! I hear they have a scrumptious sticky toffee cake, and I&#39;m such a sucker for that dessert haha"

I will be back to this place soon for sure, but I think I&#39;ll try brunch now and also when they change up menu as to try different foods.  So I&#39;ve been wanting to go here for years, but we always ended up going to root down or other places just because, but I&#39;m soo glad we made it here.  Since hubby likes having date nights now, there are stipulations in order for me to call it that. The place of my choice every week and has to be some place I&#39;ve never been.  He&#39;s been Everywhere&#39;s for client dinners and etc.. I only go when I have to or feel like it. lol  So this was one of those nights.  Here&#39;s the food lo down, service and whole shebang.  

Food:

Voss water - I don&#39;t drink tap and only alkaline or sparkling, so they gave me this. My hub&#39;s was shocked that we weren&#39;t charged for it, but considering the prices, most high end places don&#39;t charge for brand waters IME.

Sushi Taco&#39;s- So this was my least favorite, but it wasn&#39;t bad. Actually hubby loved it the way it was, I on the other hand would&#39;ve liked more of that maysiracha suace?? on it or atleast some kind of seasonig on the avocado bedding. It was a perfect portion (4) for the two of us. I like a bit more seasonings in my food. The presentation of course was very neat and nice.

Pork Belly- Now I really did like this a lot!  It&#39;s my 2nd best, next to Uncle&#39;s and that&#39;s only because Tag&#39;s is much more soft and tender, but not crusted on the outside. Just a personal preference, but it was delightful eating in the lettuce wraps. Really loved how it melted like butter biting into it.

One Town Farm Greens- Hubby wanted a dang salad so I shared it with him.  It was a salad, fresh like it should be, but nothing out of this world.

Miso Black Cod - of course hubby jumped on the band wagon with this entree, but I&#39;m glad he did..lol While the fish was to soft and falling apart for me the miso sauce and edemame purreed with mushrooms bites were DIVINE!!! I wish they made this exact sauce, but with the Halibut instead. It&#39;s hard to grab sauce with such a soft flaky fish.

Pan Roasted Halibut - Now this is more of my kind of fish. It&#39;s heartier and easier to pick of sauce while not falling apart. I Loved the Lap Chong they use in their fried rice, it&#39;s how we make it back in Hawaii. It was SOOO Ono!  Now the Halibut and Rice with the miso sauce and purree would&#39;ve been Da Bomb!  

Nothing on the menu caught my fancy and I can get my haupia when I go home next month so I just figure we go next door to the Market and get my sweets there since it&#39;s the only thing I like from that place.  

Service-

Service was not bad, kind of overwhelming because I think our waiter had a newbie shadowing him, and the place is so crowded and narrow that it&#39;s a bit hmm.. In my personal bubble space to say the least.  We were seated next to the big glass wine Cellar and the last table of 2 towards the end and waiters kept bumping into my hubby&#39;s chair. good thing it wasn&#39;t mine, because I can have an attitude after 2 bumbs and then I&#39;m done. So that was a bit annoying.  It&#39;s def. not a place for you to take a date to get to know someone because its noisy and busy, but it&#39;s nice as a regular date night.  Service was not exactly on par and we had to wait longer than usual in between our foods and in the end when we just wanted to pay because I wanted to go get my desserts.  Is this a 4 or 5 star place, not at all but there are qualities sort of in the making of a 4 star for sure. The prices are what you&#39;d expect for fish or a nice evening place like this, not more than once a week dinner though, but probably lunch is worth visiting more often."

Although my group sat outside since we had reservations for the event, I did have a chance to peep inside the actual TAG restaurant.

TAG has 2 floors and I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good place for groups on a night out. The waiters were very friendly and made effort to personalize our meals. Since I am a vegetarian and most Asian Fusion places are very &#34;seafood heavy&#34;, I felt a bit skeptical about the menu at TAG. I was happy to see that they had a couple vegetarian items but wish they would&#39;ve had more. I had the option of a salad or the vegetarian entree. The waiter mentioned to me that the chef would prepare &#34;anything that I would like&#34; if I preferred that. That was very nice of the restaurant to cater to their guests in such a way, since most places would only leave you with their menu options.

I ordered the Kale salad and it came with shaved gouda and grilled peaches (mmmm!). I was very happy with my plate. The size of the salad was more of an appetizer size rather than an entree size. My friends ordered sushi rolls and seemed very satisfied with them. The only downside, like I just mentioned, is that TAGs plates so so SMALL (especially for the price).

Overall, I would recommend TAG to anyone who want to experience the restaurant scene in Denver. I would also recommend that you don&#39;t go TOOO hungry to TAG because your stomach will probably not be satisfied unless you order 2-3 plates just for yourself. The desserts are delish and sharing a dessert is more than plentiful for anyone who doesn&#39;t need much sugar to be satisfied.

Enjoy!"

Al fresco means outside and it&#39;s a summer event that many of the restaurants on Larimer Square participate in. They set up tables outside under the string lights and it&#39;s so romantic if you want to come for a date or just have a girls night out. Either way, it&#39;s very memorable and you won&#39;t regret it. Make sure to book months ahead of time because everything gets booked fast. 

Tag was very professional about reservations. They checked in with us multiple times to confirm we were coming and were very flexible when we wanted to change our dinner time from 6pm to 8pm so we could enjoy the string lights. We took an uber here because we knew parking would be hard and the girls and I wanted to wear heels. When we arrived, they had us wait in the waiting area (which was super nice btw) while they set up our table. The drinks at tag all look amazing but during al fresco, you had limited choices so I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more. I got the kumquat jalapeno mojito which was an absolutely delicious drink with a nice kick. It is beautifully presented with a lime on top and the orange kumquats just complements the green so well. There&#39;s another watermelon drink that caught my eye but it wasn&#39;t part of the menu since they have a different alcohol license when they serve outside. 

For entree, I ordered the donburi. I have had donburis many times before at Japanese restaurants and it&#39;s basically rice with an egg on top and I wanted to see how this one was like. I have to admit, I was slightly dissapointed when it came out because the portion was tiny. They could really make it bigger since it&#39;s mostly just rice anyways with some ahi and avocado ontop. It definitely wouldn&#39;t have filled me up had I not eaten some food beforehand at home. That was the only downside. Otherwise, the taste was great! It was a bit spicy but definitely not significant if you eat alot of spicy food. 

For dessert, the girls and I split the chocolate cake and their special which was strawberry with ice cream and I don&#39;t remmeber the rest but it was delicious. Just go look at my pics and drool haha. 

The waiter was really nice and split the check for us. He even did 1/3 of each dessert. God bless you. Though they do charge $10 per person for dining outside which I think is a bit ridiculous but it was worth the experience."

As we arrived in Larimer, we realized it was the Dining Al Fresco event, and the street looked beautiful. 
When we checked in for our reservation, we were told that a space just opened up outside for the event if we&#39;d like that. We were not, unfortunately, told that there was a limited menu or that there was an extra $10 charge per person, which was pretty disappointing since there were seats available on their regular patio about 10 feet from where we sat. 
Our server was exhausted and very worn-out (yet very nice and funny). My sushi roll was nice - if maybe a bit too much sauce over and under the roll - but my small plate (butterfish) was amazing. Wish it was offered as an entree. My husband&#39;s crudo was pretty bland actually, and he was underwhelmed by the chicken ballotine. 
Our drinks were tasty however, and it was a beautiful night.

After going several times, I figure it&#39;s time for a review.

I want to like this place so much more than I do. There&#39;s a few highlights but in the end I have to say it&#39;s just Meh...

First off the service has been pretty good each time I&#39;ve been and that&#39;s a plus. They could use a little work on food sequencing-- nothing worse than getting handed a 2nd course salad when the table is barely half way through the first course app. 

Next their sushi rolls are just OK at best. Truthfully they&#39;re very over-priced for the small portion. If I wanted to pay a lot for sushi, I would go elsewhere and get fresher...

Salads are good and enjoyable. Portions aren&#39;t going to wow you in any way. Flavors are nice. Just not enough substance. 

I will say the collars (yellowtail or salmon) are fantastic!! Like not to be missed and out of this works Yumm!! Maybe the highlight of Tag!

Now the real disappointment was the duck breast. At med it came out over-cooked and tough. The flavors were plenty good but nothing memorable. Kinda boring flavor profile and being over-cooked was just a sad waste of a nice duck breast. 

This place isn&#39;t cheap so I would expect more in the way of execution and delivery. Hopefully this was just an off Monday night...

The wine list is alright, nothing to wow or make you want to stock your own cellar. Sadly several by the glass offerings were out of stock and the bubbly by the glass was short of pleasing anyone. 

Hoping for better in the future from this place!"

The drinks were creative an delicious, and the food was so rich and satisfying. This was a fine dining experience that really lived up to it. I also watched the staff efficiently and skillfully handling an order for a table of at least 20.

I will recommend this place to any friends or colleagues who visit."

The food though was the star. We really liked the sliders, great flavor, and the fries were great. However the best dish of the last few months goes to the pork belly. This was heaven in a bite, perfectly balanced flavors, and the most well cooked pork belly I have ever had. 
We also enjoyed the panna cotta, smooth, and well balanced, the only fault was that the red velvet cake was dry.
We will definitely be back, these are the meals that bring inspiration and hope for another perfect bite. Well done!!"

I would recommend reservations for this establishment unless you&#39;re down with waiting. We showed up a little earlier for a 9pm reservation and opted to grab a drink elsewhere as Tag was still quite busy. 

This establishment has a nice outdoor patio area and is well appointed for summer dining. Additionally, I liked that there was an actual space for patrons to wait. Furthermore, the hostess brought waters while we waited a short time for our table. Speaking of waiting, Tag has a nice little area for patrons to wait while their tables are readied. I am sure that this area can get quite packed but it was nice to see none the less. 

Décor and aesthetics aside, the meal was a myriad of highs and of lows. The mocktails that we ordered were delicious and beautiful creations. Our server, however, was not. His cold demeanor and attitude were shocking for a place that touts itself as otherwise. Suffice to say that when we didn&#39;t order drinks his displeasure was quite apparent. His saucy displeasure only faded when he thanked us and passed along the check. 

Service aside, the food had moments of glory and moments of sadness. The sushi tacos were a fun little appetizer but definitely not worth the $14. For our mains, we settled on the scallops, the ceviche, and the angry volcano roll. Our waiters only moment of glory was when he brought out the scallops already separated for us to share. Which, speaking of the scallops, were amazingly prepared and the fritters that accompanied them were spot on. The succotash that they rested on was also a pleasant addition to the dish. The ceviche was decent but didn&#39;t leave me wanting to eat more. I found it odd that it wasn&#39;t served with a crisp or wonton but rather tomatoes. Eating forks of ceviche, while delicious, can be a bit much. The unfortunate moment of the evening came in the form of the angry volcano roll. The toted spicy roll is something that I regret to have experienced. The fish was unidentifiable under the dollops of sauce and the intense spice. To be spicy is one thing, but to ruin sushi in such a fashion is an abomination."

We came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary which we mentioned when we made our reservations. The host assured us that they did something special for this occasion. We were seated right away but the server didn&#39;t even ask if we were celebrating anything and was not very attentive with us. He was very short with some questions we had regarding the restaurant and the chef. My husband wanted to ask more about the owners and who created the menu and he didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to talk about it at all and walked away when we were in mid of asking him a question. He seemed so uninterested in having any types of conversations with us and made us feel so uncomfortable with even asking him any questions. For the price people pay for the food you&#39;d expect the service would be up to par but it wasn&#39;t. The service made our first experience not good at all. And we will not be returning back because of it.

The food was spectacular I ordered off the 5280 menu and my husband ordered the sliders which were both great! To start off I had the hamachi which was pretty epic the vinaigrette is what made the dish so great. My new york steak was my second course and was cooked to perfection probably one of the best New York strips I&#39;ve ever had the sauce was delightful. For dessert i had the espresso tart which was just ok, it was way to rich for my taste. My husband had the Kobe sliders which was absolutely out of this world and is a must have. If we ever do decide to go back it would solely be for the food."

I can&#39;t remember the name of it but it was delicious - not too sweet at all.

We decided on a couple rounds of the $5.00 per plate apps.  The fish tacos were made with fresh tilapia and had a nice, spicy kick to them.  The seafood potstickers were absolutely divine, so light and flavorful.  The Kobe beef sliders were delicious and the gorgonzola aioli served as a nice accent.  The portions exceeded the $5.00 price tag.  These dishes are easy to share or would be a filling snack for one.

Everything we&#39;d had so far was incredible but we still needed something more to round out our meal.  We decided on the Matador Roll ($11.00) and, with the assistance of our server, the Surf &amp; Turf Roll ($16.00).  Both were excellent choices.  Mr. P. was a bit perplexed that neither roll came with wasabi but that bit of unusualness was quickly forgotten once we dug into the fresh and fantastically flavored sushi.

We were able to take advantage of the $5.00 Social Hour drink pricing as well.  Mr. P. had some TAG Mules while I sipped on a couple Mojitos of the Day (raspberry, yum!).  Our service was attentive, informative, and professional.

A full blown dinner here will be spendy but, based upon the plates we sampled, most likely worth the money.  In any event, I&#39;d recommend that you add TAG to your happy hour - err, Social Hour - rotation."

We each took a bite and no more. You&#39;d think the wait staff would have asked whats up but they didnt... Hence the minus star.

Although I&#39;m partial to my dives across the country, I&#39;m always down for the occasional holiday splurge.

Chadwick - an energetic and attentive Irish fellow, with a noticeable passion for food and wine - was our server and made the evening as great as it was.  I can&#39;t speak highly enough about the level of service this place provides from the second you walk in until your last bite.

Tag boasts a healthy assortment of appetizers, both on-and-off the menu.  The same could also be said for the entrees.  We kicked off with the bacon-wrapped rabbit with tortellini, mushrooms, and parsnips for a sweet, tender meat dish.  On the other side of the spectrum, this place also offers taco sushi, complete with ahi tuna and rice in a shell atop a generous dab of guacamole.  The latter is available all the time, and Chadwick will tell you that it makes a great lunch a few times a week!

The highlights kept rolling through the entrees.  I went with an off-menu Brozino sea bass stuffed with herbs, and not surprisingly it was one of the better fish dishes I&#39;ve had to date.  While a lil&#39; fishy staring you in the eye can be intimidating for some, you&#39;ll move past that pretty quickly after one, citrusy bite (which I might add paired perfectly with my Vementino).

Regardless of the excellence of the sea bass, this was still one of those dinners where I was envious of the choice of my diningmate, who ordered the Short Rib Ravioli.  If you go, you - or at least someone at your table who is willing to share - MUST order the Short Rib Ravioli.  It will change your life, and even those who are not partial to cauliflower and brussel sprouts will agree that roasting and frying these veges respectively will bring out the best in this hearty winter dish.

Stuffed to the gills - yes, that was an intentional fish pun [insert eye roll here] - there was no way we were going to make our way through dessert that evening, especially knowing there was a full night of NYE partying ahead of us.  Still, a no-frills Cappuccino along with my bill was the perfect end to a great meal, before heading off to ring in 2015!"

We got to watch all the dishes being prepared, and struck up a good conversation with the chefs working that night. Seeing all the amazing dishes being prepared made it tough to settle on what we wanted - too many great choices!

We shared the deconstructed pho which had pho flavored beef short ribs on mashed yukon gold potatoes, bok choy, and an aromatic broth that was delicious! I strongly recommend it if you like pho flavors. We also shared a diver scallops dish which was on turnip pureer in a light broth and had zero complaints about the dish except there wasn&#39;t enough.

TAG, like Rioja, is located in the very nice Larimer Square, which is south of Downtown Denver.  This charming area seems to be a great area to do a little shopping, enjoy some of the city&#39;s most popular restaurants or simply to hang out.  I found Rioja to be very interesting though I felt the quality and flavors there just did not live up to how good the menu sounded.

TAG is different.  It is labeled a continental restaurant though it seems mostly inspired by Asian ingredients and preparations.  I would not necessarily call TAG Asian fusion though since it definitely has a lot of dishes that you would not find at an Asian fusion restaurant.  A lot of the menu was stuff that I have seen before; I felt Rioja&#39;s menu showcased a lot more creativity and uniqueness.

At TAG, I started with an amuse bouche of a thick root vegetable chip that was topped with a cream sauce and chorizo.  It was pretty good.  For my starter, I had their seared kampachi with grapeseed oil, jalapeno, yuzu, and strawberry Pop Rocks.  I actually thought this was pretty creative as well as playful.  The plate arrived sizzling like seared meat or fish on a hot plate, but the sizzling was not from the fish but from the Pop Rocks touching the vinaigrette on the plate.

The dish was good.  The kampachi had a good sear while the flesh was rare like seared ahi.  I liked the flavor of the fish.  The rest of the dish tasted fine, but the flavors (with the exception of the strawberry Pop Rocks) did not stand out as much.  Despite the addition of the jalapeno, the dish was not that spicy and I have had a similar dish at Studio City&#39;s Asanebo with grapeseed oil where that ingredient was much more pronounced.

For my entree, I thought about getting the local hanger steak but opted for the daily fish special instead.  The fish was a rockfish with a breadcrumb topping and also sides of prosciutto and charred scallion risotto as well as Swiss chard tossed with celery and rhubarb.  This was a very satisfying fish even if it was simply a good but not great dish.

The fish was moist and flaked very well.  The risotto was creamy and flavorful though I wish the prosciutto stood out more.  I also wished the rice was more al dente and had more of a bite, but even the best restaurants across the country overcook risotto.  The sauteed Swiss chard was very good--nice flavor and very appropriately cooked.

For dessert, I had their warm date cake, which was topped with a toffee sauce and burnt sugar ice cream.  There was also a raspberry sauce on the side.  This was a very satisfying end to the meal even if it was the kind of dessert you might be able to find elsewhere.  The burnt sugar ice cream was creamy (much smoother than the ice cream at Rioja) and had a salted caramel-like flavor.  The toffee sauce was good without being too rich or too sugary.  The date cake had a great flavor and was very light.  If I had to nitpick, I would say the cake did not have that great moistness inside-out (especially at the center) that you get with really good sticky toffee pudding desserts.

Service by Josh was excellent.  I experienced friendly service throughout the Denver and Boulder area, but I felt he was the most genuinely friendly server I had.  He was also very professional and polite as well as very knowledgeable about the menu.

Prices were a little high for the quality.  While you do get bigger portions than Rioja, you are probably paying $2 to $6 more per each dish and the quality is very similar.  I would also say that Rioja is much more ambitious with its food so you are much more likely to get a wow dish there.

TAG has a pretty good atmosphere.  There is a great brick wall (a nod to the revitalized area), a contemporary and youthful decor and comfortable seating.

TAG is a good place for a satisfying and (for the most part) upscale meal.  For me, I think TAG would be just a decent restaurant in a bigger and more diverse metro where these types of ingredients and style of cooking are more easily found.  But I think if you are in Denver, TAG is a good option for a high-end lunch and might be an even better option for dinner where they probably get more ambitious with the menu.

There are several pay parking lots and structures nearby and it seems that many (if not all) of them are very expensive."

This is my best friend&#39;s favorite restaurant, so when I recently visited her (for her birthday), I knew we had to dine here.  They were hosting one of their seasonal dinners, with a pumpkin theme (called the Orange Crush Pumpkin Dinner), so we were really excited.  Unfortunately, it was mostly a let-down.

We arrived approximately 15 minutes before the start of the dinner and we were advised by the hostess (who was a bit unorganized) that they weren&#39;t quite ready to take anyone downstairs yet. She recommended that we have a seat at the bar or in the small lounge and she would let us know when they were ready.  So we headed for the bar to have a glass of wine.  Quite awhile passed and we noticed that the hostess had started taking diners downstairs, but she never approached us and seemed to have forgotten about us.  It&#39;s lame that people were seated who arrived after us (and another small group at the bar next to us), so we went back to the host stand to re-check in.  There was a different girl there, and she was even more clueless than the first hostess. We explained that we had already checked in and noticed that people were being seated.  We probably stood there for another 10 minutes, waiting.  Finally the original hostess asked one of the servers to take us downstairs.  This took at least another 10 minutes - there was an issue with the elevator, and then the clueless hostess just stepped in front of our group with another group of at least 6 guests.  So rude! Why else would we be standing there, waiting for the elevator?

Anyhow, once we got downstairs, it took a bit for everyone to be seated.  Once that finally happened, we were served our first drink. Shortly after, we received our first course:

Hiramasa Crudo with pumpkin chips, spicy pistachio brittle, pickled ginger and micro basil.  I wanted to really like this dish, however I was thrown off by how warm the fish was.  Every time I&#39;ve had sashimi style fish, it&#39;s been chilled, so I was surprised it was so warm.

2nd Course:

Smoked Duck Breast with pumpkin walnut ravioli, pepita pesto and cranberry coulis. Where as I thought the last dish should have been chilled, I thought this course should have been at least warm.  But nope, the duck came out quite cold.  I don&#39;t know if this is how it was meant to be or whether they just couldn&#39;t get the food out to us fast enough. Disappointing, although the duck breast itself had great flavor and the pumpkin ravioli were very interesting.

3rd Course:

Pumpkin crusted Cobia with miso kabocha broth, udon noodles and pickled fresno. This was probably my favorite course, other than dessert (which isn&#39;t saying much, since if you know me, you know I am not a dessert eater).  Unfortunately, once again, the food was barely luke warm.  I am not normally a fish eater, but the pumpkin crust added great flavor to the Cobia. The noodles and broth were good, but barely warm. This is where we started thinking that the kitchen might be struggling to keep up.

4th Course:

Braised lamb, risotto in a roasted pumpkin with 5 spice crumble.  Even with all of the temperature issues, this was BY FAR my least favorite dish of the night.  Now, I am not a fan of lamb to begin with, but I will always try it and hope that I would like the preparation.  Oddly enough, this dish was scalding hot.  The mixture of lamb and risotto was just not good. It didn&#39;t even look good.  And the roasted pumpkin was supposed to be edible, but was far too undercooked and tough to eat.

5th Course:

Pumpkin hand pie with spiced cream cheese ice cream, peanut brittle and cherry gel. This was by far the best course of the night.  The pie was shaped like a pumpkin and even had a decorative leaf. The ice cream was amazing, and the peanut brittle added nice crunch.

Each course was paired with drinks. We enjoyed each of the drinks and they were really well made.  I don&#39;t recall all of the ingredients, so I won&#39;t go in to specifics, but they were good.

Overall, the service was friendly.  I just wish we had a better experience with the food.  My poor friend actually apologized and said that she wished that we had just dined upstairs and ordered off the regular menu.  Again, maybe they were just having an off night - I would definitely go back and try TAG again, but would hope that things go a little more smoothly."

The black rosé drink is delicious. Their bartenders are wonderful and will make you a special drink if you&#39;re not feeling something from the menu. They&#39;ve made my friends and I a drink with sherbet and champagne that was amazing.

I love the pop rock kampachi; the sauce is plate licking good. The sliders are perfect and they come with duck fat fries which have a sweetness to them that are impossible to stop eating. I find myself craving those fries too often. I also love the taco sushi.

The only thing that I had an issue was that it took forever to get out of the restaurant. We waited at least 10 minutes to ask for the bill because our waiter was busy with other tables.

Started with the calamari, which was more veggies than calamari. Tasted ok. Not terrible, but wouldn&#39;t eat more than a couple bites.

Ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell -- apparently the current special was Buy 1/2, Get 1/2 Free -- ended up with 11 oysters and 1 empty shell. Told the waitress about it, she jokingly said &#34;well, that IS part of the &#39;Free&#39;&#34;. We laughed about it and she said she would bring us a replacement. Fast forward 15 minutes and several more visits to our table by the waitress... still no replacement oyster. We mention it again (multiple times!!) and she says &#34;oh, let me bring you another one&#34;. We were there for at least another hour through our meal... replacement NEVER came.

Tried the Lobster Bisque -- texture was too thick, and super salty. Barely ate a few bites, even trying to compensate with crackers or bread didn&#39;t help.

For dinner got the Lobster Bake -- lobster was just OK... but the potatoes that it came with were so mushy, it was like they were cooked then soaked in water. Not even good enough texture to use as mashed potatoes. 

Aside from the food, it was uncomfortably warm in there and we were seated right next to the windows, so you&#39;d think it was cooler where we were. 

On top of the whole oyster fiasco, our waitress was just strange... in an abrasive, overbearing but also completely spacey kinda way. At the end of the meal, she hands us the bill and says &#34;I&#39;ll be your cashier, take your time&#34; -- which is great! ...unless you then proceed to stand there and stare at us. she even made herself more comfortable by adjusting to lean up against the wall like it was gonna be a while. THEN, when we stop our conversation to pull out our wallets, only then did she proceed to walk away!? bizarre, I tell you.

And now to deal with the post-bad-meal tummy aches that we all were lucky enough to get sent home with."

Decor is similar to every other restaurant in this chain-the &#34;Lighthouse Look&#34;. Service has been excellent at this location every time we have gone. We have been going in a few times a year for the past 6 years. 

What was different during this visit was the menu options. The Sweet Chili Shrimp appetizer was so good that I would go back just to order that. Perfect! Also had the Bar Harbor Lobster bake that was excellent. Tried the Red Velvet cake for dessert and while it was good, it is very sweet and rich....split it if your going to order it. 

Bread and drinks are always good. This time I ordered a massive frozen margarita that was the perfect fit to the day I was having. 

I love when the do their &#34;Fests&#34; and that is usually when I pop into this location for my fix."

Normally, I&#39;d just order beer but having a weakness for Mojitos, I was tempted by the Strawberry Mojito.  OMG, it was sooo sticky sweet I had to send it back and have them tone it down.  My drink returned to me in a much improved state, though I would not order it again.  I&#39;ll just stick to my beer.  

I ordered the Surf and Turf off the Lobster Fest menu and proceeded to enjoy my salad and yummy cheesy biscuits.  One of my table mates ordered the fresh shucked oysters of which I enjoyed two of and all I can say is delightful.  I&#39;d never had oysters before and this was an experience that confirmed I will have them again.

Shortly after my divine oyster experience, my Surf and Turf arrived.  My steak was a bit under done and my lobster was over done.  Not to fear, our absolutely fantastic server Lauren remedied the situation immediately.   Lauren returned in good time with a fresh lobster that was sooo tasty there wasn&#39;t one bit of it left.  Lauren also advised us to stick with the Maine lobster as opposed to the Rock lobster.

To end the meal we ordered the dessert sampler which contained the best Key Lime pie I&#39;ve ever tasted.  Super creamy, not drowned in whipped cream and just enough crust on the bottom to support the delectable filling.

I&#39;m not sure what time we rolled out of there but we had a bag full of leftovers and a serious need for a nap."

My family and I received beyond poor customer service. First, our waiter stated he would take all the women&#39;s orders first..only to skip myself(very much so a woman). And rather than apologize for the oversight his answer was &#34;I don&#39;t have my glasses on today&#34;. We watched as another table with another waiter received their biscuits, appetizers, AND drinks within 10 min. They had their meal within 25 minutes of walking in. Keep in mind the other table came in at least 25 minutes AFTER my family arrived. We waited 15 min just to get water and bread. Another 15 minutes for salad. And another 15 minutes for appetizers..you do the math. We asked for another marina for our appetizers to no avail. We ended up having to ask the busser to grab it for us. After waiting another 15 minutes we started to get frustrated and asked another waiter could we see the manager. She replied &#34;the reason your food is taking so long is because of the appetizers&#34; as if she didn&#39;t serve her entire table in half the time we&#39;d been there. Not to mention we never even told her what we ordered...sounds like somebody is chatting in the kitchen. After waiting yet another 5 minutes the manager never came to our table. Needless to say, we ended up throwing $20 on the table and walking out WITHOUT eating our actual meal...horrible service and for no reason! The waiter and his manager watched us leave from the window...didn&#39;t even try to come out and make it right smh. The restaurant was virtually empty. Didn&#39;t make any sense why the service was so horrible."

Its new, clean and very friendly staff. They have been trained well and we have been taken care of very nicely.

One thing I want to mention about is there salad. They need to catch up with time. There house salad appears to be right out of the bag. Its the iceberg lettuce with few bits of julienned carrots.. its been like this for at least 20 + years. If any of the company people ever reads this post, you guys needs to follow Macaroni Grille&#39;s house salad.. Now, that&#39;s the salad I don&#39;t mind paying extra $.

The restaurant was quite busy but we were quickly seated and had a nice booth. Our server was very prompt and our drinks were quickly brought out to us. I got a berry mango daiquiri and my goodness, the glass was tall. I&#39;m not a short lady and I had to take the glass off the table and hold it down by the seat, just to drink from it. Maybe it&#39;s easier while sitting in a regular chair, but otherwise it&#39;s a bit of a process.

I had a combo with the wood-grilled salmon and the shrimp linguini and my husband had his standard cajun chicken alfredo. Salads are standard iceburg lettuce, but all ingredients were fresh and they were served nice and cold. The cheese biscuits were nice and warm and delicious as always. Our entrees arrived and I have to say that I&#39;m disappointed with the general lack of vegetables served on the plate. I ordered mashed potatoes, which was my fault, but come on. If you put it on peoples&#39; plates, they&#39;ll eat it. No one needs a pile of fried food with a side of starch. That being said, my salmon was delicious and was perfectly cooked. My linguini had lots of baby shrimp on top, though the pasta was overcooked for my taste and the sauce was separating to oil and cream.

Overall, our food was tasty and service was nice and quick. We were in and out within an hour and I had more than enough food for a second meal."

I know I was not expecting to wait 57 min (timed it after we hit 30 min) when quoted 20 min for our party of 5 (includes 2 hungry, little kids). I watched as larger and smaller parties who arrived after us were accommodated. I inquired with the hostess and was told a 5 top was difficult to seat (what the hell?)

Saving grace was our waiter. He was great. He got the kids bread and put their meals in right away and was friendly even though we were sour when we were finally seated.

We barely tasted the meal as we scarfed whatever they ended up bring us. Unmemorable. Sorry, will not return."

He offered to cook me a Sirloin then said how bout a New York strip? I said great, keep in mind that 20 mins had gone by already that my family had order their food, and now my New York strip has to cook for a while, finally got our food and the fams food was cold and my steak was raw!

They changed the menu up a bit between the two dinners, but both times most of us ordered the endless shrimp and had very nice experiences with getting decent size second portions.  One thing that bothers me here is they don&#39;t have boiled shrimp.  They have added teriaki shrimp, but I found them not so great.  So, that leaves the option of fried or drenched in butter for the shrimp.  The mahi mahi that my love got was on the dry side.  My children had lobster dinners on their birthdays and loved them.  There are two things that really stand out about Red Lobster and that&#39;s the biscuits and the lobster pizza.  Please give them both a try."

You can generally go to any Red Lobster, anywhere in the country, and expect to receive the same meal, same service, same atmosphere, etc.

They are not your local greasy spoon in Maine, where you get fantastic fresh lobster, but that is not how they bill themselves.

The bleu cheese sirloin is incredible.  It&#39;s a decent sized chick steak, and I&#39;d give my right arm to know how they make the sauce they put on it.  Most importantly, the chef knows how to cook it per the order.  My steaks have to be rare, which basically means don&#39;t send it back to me medium or someone will get hurt.  These have been perfect, although I did have to send one back for being tough.  The waitstaff and manager were awesome, polite and efficient. 

There&#39;s another dish I love here that is no longer on the menu, but I&#39;ve asked twice for it and gotten it with no problem.  They have a salmon entree cooked &#34;New Orleans style&#34; with shrimp, beurre blanc, and relish.  This topping used to be offered for an extra $3 on any of the fresh fish offerings, but it&#39;s not listed anymore.  Just ask for it.

If I could, I&#39;d give it a 3 1/2 star rating.  Especially compared to the other place located in Aurora on Alameda.  To start, we ordered the scallops and they were terrific!  I have to say a 5 star for the scallops wrapped in bacon.  It comes with fried rings, not really necessary, but, still good (and of course, bad for you) and pico de gallo.  The pico de gallo really sets it off.  In my and my husbands&#39; opinion, one of the best tasting pico de gallos.  The biscuits were fresh, and delicious.  People either love them or hate them.  I love them; especially dipped in my salad with the red vinaigrette dressing.  My husband ordered the peppercorn steak, medium and coconut shrimp.  Unfortunately, the steak came out medium well.  He didn&#39;t send it back, just asked for some A1.  It was still a decent steak.  The coconut shrimp was very good.  The sauce to accompany it is what really sets it apart from other places that serve coconut shrimp. I always order the Seaside Shrimp Trio.  It never disappoints.  Our service was good, and the manager went to each table asking how everything was, which is always nice.  If you&#39;re a Red Lobster fan, I don&#39;t think this location would disappoint.

We typically call in the order and go pick it up. They are very fast at getting the orders together. 

The food is always fresh and never fails to satisfy. 

My personal favorite is the taco salad, any meat. They are all so good. One thing I especially love is that there is good portions. Enough meat for the whole salad. Even the shrimp! 

The only downside to the taco salad is to go it gets soggy but they can put it on the side! All you have to do is ask! 

They have a salsa bar inside as well which makes it easy to personalize any meal. The salsas are not always the same so remember to taste them!

I had 3 breakfast tacos, chorizo, ham and bacon. They were all really good. It wasn&#39;t just a whole bunch of potatoes with a little meat. They were packed with potaotes, eggs, meat and cheese.

I&#39;m from Texas so I must say I was very disappointed in getting cool tortillas that tasted store bought not homemade/fresh.  the filling eggs/etc were good with decent flavor, the salsa bar is pretty good size - missed my pico de gallo for tacos - but the salsa was pretty good.  I saw some of the enormous burritos and they looked good - I would be willing to try a burrito but I won&#39;t be back for breakfast tacos.  Also, the service was poor - placed my order for 2 tacos and a drink and 2 people behind me including a family were served before me.  I finally had to go to the counter and ask - they apologized and maybe thats why my tortilla was cold?"

This place isn&#39;t far from our place so we decided to stop in. You go straight to the counter to order first, and their menu is in big font so everyone can see it. I got the shrimp fajitas plate and my boyfriend got the steak torta with a side of rice and beans. They have an area where you can get your drinks/salsas/silverware/peppers/cilantro. They have good choices and the hot tomato salsa was amazing! It was barely a wait at all before they called our number to go get from the counter. I was very satisfied with my plate, I especially loved the black beans. My boyfriend thought his torta was just ok, but he loved the rice and beans. Overall we had a good experience and would come back here. The prices are low and the staff is polite!"

Definitely one of my favorite Mexican food spots for breakfast burritos. I did a little something different last time I was here. I ordered breakfast burritos for me and the kids and I got a bowl of green chili to go. It is something about their green chili, when I don&#39;t feel like SUPER spicy chili, this is perfect. I took some home, didn&#39;t eat all of it, threw the leftovers in the freezer and saved it for later. About a week later when I had that Sabor craving, I defrosted it and it was still delicious!

Another thing, outside of their service being awesome, is there salsa bar, which they don&#39;t have at their Centennial location. Their salsa is freaking DELICIOUS... I got an extra one or two (don&#39;t judge me) just to make sure my breakfast burrito had some extra spice to it - their hot salsa is HOT and I love it. 

When I am in the area and craving Sabor, I am definitely going to stop buy... YUM!"

I almost opt for the tres tacos plate with corn tortillas, chicken, and mild sauce. The hot sauce is not joking around; it&#39;s pretty darn hot. 
The salsa bar is where it&#39;s at. I grab a couple cups of each for my chips while I wait for my meal and then dump some more on my tacos once they arrive. The casera and the tomatillo sauce are my favorites.
The food doesn&#39;t usually take too long (and you have chips and salsa to distract you while you wait) and when it does arrive, the plate is super full and comes with guac for no extra charge. Its really quite a lot of food for the price. 
I always leave incredibly full and happy."

I came here the other day for breakfast and was blown away by how huge their breakfast burritos are, and for an unexplainable low price, too. My &#34;small&#34; breakfast burrito was a little over $3 and I could hardly finish it. I came in today for lunch and ordered the Grill burrito with chicken and it was pretty damn good. The burritos are huge, the flavors are authentic and very lively, and for the price I&#39;d say it deserves to be recognized. I live right across the street, so this place will definitely be added into our weekly restaurant  rotation. The staff falls short of friendly, but they are efficient, which is most important.

It&#39;s great food with loaded up burritos.  The kicker is the salsa bar.  Fill up with all the salsas and hot sauces you desire - and be sure to grab a few napkins because you are about to have a messy affair.

I ordered the Dos Tacos platter. One taco was steak the other was chicken. I asked for no salsa since they have a salsa bar. I received them with salsa and BOY them tacos were spicy as all get out. I&#39;m not really a person who likes a lot of heat on my meat so that salsa was way too much for me to enjoy the meal. It&#39;s good for the sinus though! 
I tried the rice and black beans once my tongue healed. I would&#39;ve liked the beans to be softer and the rice was fine too. The tortilla chips came with the meal: They tasted almost like salty and crunchy sopapillas.
The whole meal was about $10 but I had a bunch left over! The tacos really filled me up."

They are juicy and crispy, just as they should be.  excellent guacamole, salty chips and the salsa bar provides a nice variety of heat and flavor. The menu has a very nice variety of tacos, burritos and taquitos. The kids menu provides excellent meals for the young ones. 

 Occasionally, some of the food can come out a little on the cold side, and the Pico can sometimes be less than fresh. I am not a fan of the bun used for the Torta sandwich.

Highly recommended."

I&#39;m an eater that finds something he likes and has a hard time diverting and trying other menu items. The taco plate is hard to beat here. I&#39;ve tried it with chicken and then with pastor. Both were amazing. It comes with salsa and guacamole so for around $8, you can&#39;t beat it. The refried beans and rice are what you&#39;d expect. When you get the salsa though, definitely get the hot salsa. It actually has a nice heat to it and also is really flavorful. It&#39;s a lot better than any of the salsas I&#39;ve tried from the standard Mexican &#34;fast food&#34; lunch you&#39;d get from Qdoba or Chipotle.

It also doesn&#39;t seem to matter when you go, the line could be hit or miss. They really get their customers through the line though quickly. This definitely has gone into my lunch rotation for the foreseeable future.

I&#39;ve also seen the burritos and salads and they look great as well. You never hear any murmurs from other tables of dissapointment here like you may find at other places. I&#39;m excited to go back and try something new!"

First, I don&#39;t like places that put rice in their burritos. Rice is cheap filler and doesn&#39;t belong in burritos. To me, Chipotle and Qdoba are an insult to the word &#34;burrito&#34; but this place is worse. I didn&#39;t order a rice burrito but that seemed to be most of what it contained. There wasn&#39;t any green chiles that I could taste. This was not a burrito. Flavorless crap! The little bit of eggs that were in it were overcooked, the small quantity of ham was flavorless and I didn&#39;t taste any cheese. I will stick to Tacos Selenes, Santiago&#39;s and my other spots. Twisters is far better than this joke of a place. Heck, I really like Twisters and there is no rice in their burritos. I have had better frozen burritos from the grocery store!! Food is subjective but it seems that many people enjoy flavorless food with cheap filler. McDonald&#39;s breakfast burritos are better than this and that isn&#39;t saying much.  There isn&#39;t any accounting for taste though.
    I suppose the guy working the counter was too good to greet me. I said, &#34;how&#39;s it going?&#34; and he gave me a blank stare. 
     Lesson learned! I flushed seven dollars down the drain to get something that belongs in a garbage can.
      Try cleaning the place too! Unfortunately, Yelp doesn&#39;t let you give zero stars or I would have. Rename this place &#34;Trash Can Grill.&#34;"

I can&#39;t speak about service or the experience eating at the restaurant but I will speak about the food. First of all, the price to food quantity is phenomenal. The burrito has a ton of substance and is massive. I could only finish half of it before feeling very full. Along with the free chips, this makes a very satisfying meal. For only about 6 dollars, I get two meals, what a deal. However, the downside is that I felt the burrito had rather bland ingredients and lacked flavor. I had to add sriracha on it to get some spiciness in (I add this to everything though haha). Also the dough was on the thick side and at the end, I felt like I was stuffing my face with only dough. The chips were delicious and crunchy but the sauce was rather watery and bland. The red sauce was more like just chopped tomatoes and wasn&#39;t spicy and the green sauce (which I prefer mine to be creamy) was very watery and not spicy either. Overall, it&#39;s not the best burrito I have had but it&#39;s a great value for the price I paid."

Walking in to the store I noticed it was very clean compared to most places you&#39;d go to find an authentic breakfast burrito.

I was ordering for a group and wasn&#39;t sure if the mini burritos would be big enough he suggested I get those, so I did. They have red chili inside and it&#39;s not very spicy but OMG the flavor is delicious. 

I got a chorizo burrito, which in most places they&#39;re super greasy and make you feel Bleh when you&#39;re done eating them. This one wasn&#39;t greasy at all and had a perfect balance of all the ingredients!! 

The salsa bar had a pretty delicious arrangement of salsas. They had pico, hot ,mild , salsa casera ( which most places don&#39;t have) and green as well.

However, my not so stellar review goes to the lady at the register with the braces. She likes to pick and choose who she gives chips to. I think there needs to be consistency because you can see her hand chips to some patrons while others will have to ask for them. Please make that clear so some of us can avoid the awkwardness of asking her only to be given an unpleasant look. I come here once a week, and every time I encounter her, it&#39;s the same situation.

Otherwise, my experiences as of late have been a disaster. I have been coming here since Baja Fresh moved, and have been a regular, typically frequenting 2-3 times a week. Lately though, I&#39;m very unimpressed with the service. I was here perhaps 3 weeks ago, and made an order for the same thing I always get and have ordered perhaps 50 times, and was given the wrong item. I went to explain this to the teller, and had to explain 3 times that the item wasn&#39;t what I ordered before she offered to have it remade, at which point I was so frustrated I just shut up and ate what I didn&#39;t order. The very following time, I order my regular, and the order was incorrect again. Thankfully the cashier was quick to rectify this. The next time I was in I noticed they had just put fresh chips into the fryer, and asked to wait to get my order of chips until the fresh chips were ready. The cashier simply said &#39;No, sorry&#39; and proceeded to give me the bottom of the broken, cold chips. What do you mean &#39;No&#39; I can&#39;t wait for what I request when I&#39;m paying for it? I&#39;ve came here a ton of times and made large orders for parties etc. and have always recommended this place to friends, I can&#39;t say this will be the case going forward. To top it off, the last time I was in I ordered a large side of guacamole. The chef fills it perhaps just over 1/2 full and hands it over. I look at it, accustomed to getting the full 8 oz as I paid for, and request it be topped off. He gives me a dirty look, adds a little bit of guac to the container, and it is still only perhaps just under 2/3 full. Are you fucking kidding me? This quality of service and appreciation for customers is unacceptable, whether I&#39;m a regular or a passerby, I can&#39;t imagine If I had this service when I was first coming in I would have ever returned.

Its where Baja Fresh used to be.  They have the same menu, website and owners as the Arapahoe location, I think.  I LOVE THIS PLACE! Its soooooooo good!  They still have that awesome salsa bar and its even more authentic now.  Its funny I didn&#39;t even realize the place was a new restaurant!   

They have delicious breakfast burritos and I LOVE their salads for when Im on a strict diet. IF I order a salad with no cheese, no chips and no dressing I get amazing grilled chicken or steak, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, avocados and black beans!  Then I just use the salsa bar for my dressing to add my favorites like lime, extra cilantro and hot salsa!

I ordered the Ham Big Breakfast Burrito and was severely disappointed. It was big, but that was due to the insane amount of rice the stuffed in the tortilla. Barely any eggs, a few small pieces of ham, and barely a recognizable few potatoes. There was supposed to be red chii and cheese but I did not taste any. Not sure how they even call this a breakfast burrito. I added some salsa from the salsa bar (perhaps a nod to the Baja Fresh that existed here before) and at least the green added some flavor. Unless you are looking for a rice breakfast burrito, avoid this for your first meal. Visit Big City Burrito, Chubby&#39;s, or make the drive to Little Anita&#39;s for breakfast burritos."

Very, very generous portions.
Great selection.
Very tasty.
Extremely affordable.
Friendly staff.
Clean, safe location.

This place rocks.  Just forget about those other Mexican fast food places, IMHO there is no comparison.  The value here is tough to beat.  Try the steak quesoburrito... I get mine without rice and they automatically seem to add extra steak and cheese without any extra cost instead of delivering some anemic looking thing.  The nachos have so many toppings on them that you literally can&#39;t even see the chips... now where else do you see that nowadays?  

On second thought, don&#39;t go... I don&#39;t want this place to start getting busy.  I want it to selfishly remain a best kept secret."

So we grabbed a few from Sabor to try.  I liked it pretty well, they are a generous serving for the price, and with some salsa from their salsa bar it turns out pretty well. I wouldn&#39;t rave about them, I&#39;d give their breakfast burrito maybe a 3/5.

We came another time for dinner, and at the recommendation of one of the employees we got the chicken fajitas.  A generous portion and all of it delicious.  

The fajitas will keep us coming back again and again, and I&#39;m interested in trying other dishes too."

It used to be Baja Fresh; the owner chose to go under a different company when his contract with Baja was up - it&#39;s just as good as it was then!  

The manager is super friendly, often on the register or the cook line as a team player - and he provides not a 10% military discount, but a 20% military discount to service members in uniform!!!!   He&#39;s a top notch businessman/employer and all of his employers are extremely friendly and helpful even when he&#39;s not there - a definite sign of good management.  

I highly recommend the Chicken Grilled Burrito - and add the homemade green salsa off the salsa bar, the grilled chicken ceasar salad is great spin off of the traditional salad, and the breakfast burritos are amazing (if you don&#39;t do pork, they will gladly let you substitute other meat)!

We tend to choose this for birthdays. They have a great variety on the menu that is able to please almost anyone. I have four kids and they always find something new to try. 

The wait can be a bit long so I recommend calling ahead and getting on the wait list! It gets a bit crowded. 

The rolls and butter are delicious but try not to fill up on them! 

If you like fried pickles you have to try theirs! By far the best I have ever had. Love them with the blossom sauce. I had a friend who hates pickles try them and even she enjoyed them! 

As for the food I can&#39;t brag enough. Their prime rib , ny strip and kabob are my favorite steaks. The chicken critters with honey mustard are really good. The salads are HUGE and so delicious.  My kids love the burgers. They have really good flavor. 

For the sides, my favorite is the loaded baked potato but the broccoli is really good too. The rice has very good flavor. I have never been a fan of chili but this one is pretty darn good!  

I do t drink but know the margaritas are pretty dang good. My personal pick is the sweet tea with orange slices! Give it a try."

Texas road house is a perfect place that meets both areas. 

Pros: the bread and cinnamon butter is AMAZING. I know they are famous for that bread and butter! The staff and waiters/waitresses are friendly and welcoming. The ambience is casual and chill. The menu has a variety of options for steak, BBQ and some seafood (shrimp or catfish). They are child friendly, which is very important! 

Cons: the food took a little longer than expected, and our waitress was super slow and bringing the bread and butter when we ran out. I ordered the 16 oz prime rib, which came out looking a lot bigger than 16 oz (not a con) but when I cut into it, it was kind of tough, which prime rib should not be! The first bite was most excruciating because I was so hungry and looking forward to prime rib, but the meat was tough and very dry. I drenched it in au ju sauce but it was still very dry. I ordered it medium, but I would say it was closer to medium well to well done."

The salads were very good homemade dressing is a plus and the blue cheese dressing actually was very scrumptious. The raspberry iced tea is pretty good. This part is not food related at all we were sitting at a table not a booth and it is the most uncomfortable chair I think I&#39;ve ever sat in my life!!!. Now back to the food review. My steak is good I ordered the six ounce sirloin my veggies are overcooked especially the broccoli. I told the waitress about the vegetables and she went ahead and brought me over a delicious sweet potato to make up for the lack of the veggies. Megan is a very wonderful waitress she has done her best to make us very happy the manager just came over with a complimentary taster of their specialty award-winning ribs but unfortunately we don&#39;t eat pork but that was a very nice gesture. Megan also offered us some rolls to go she is doing a stupendous job. So overall this has been a pretty good experience.

This was our first time here, and a Saturday night.  This place is clearly popular.  Staff was very good, with one exception...when being led to our table the young gal would say things, and was talking to us, but I couldn&#39;t hear her because she had her head turned away from us and the place is very loud.  We had the peach margaritas, they were very good.  The bread and cinnamon butter was good.  They gave us a rib a piece since it was our first time to try, and they were good.  My husband ordered an 11 oz sirloin, and I ordered the 6 oz.  The food came in a timely manner.  My husband&#39;s sirloin came they way he ordered it and a baked potato.  He said his potato was over cooked.  My sirloin was ordered to be medium well, and it was bloody on the plate when it came.  I cut it in half, and it was less than medium.  I sent it back, and it was returned well done, so I put up with it, and it wasn&#39;t very well seasoned I added some salt.  The green beans I ordered for a side should of been called green bean soup.  Way too much liquid, and way too much seasoning and bacon.

This was a fair experience, but we&#39;ve had better elsewhere and probably won&#39;t return.  The staff was really on their game, and that area of the restaurant seemed managed very well.  Maybe because they were so busy their standards slipped in the kitchen."

Great price, so much food. It was flavorful and didn&#39;t even require steak sauce. 
The booth was in good proximity to the TV for watching Sports. 
My Lemonade never ran dry and he was right there with a new glass and clear off the others.

BUT--Service means EVERYTHING to me.. Let me start with a Friday, end of the month, everyone just got paid, so the place is packed.  I did call ahead seating, they told me 45 to 50 minutes.  47 minutes from the call, I was seated! Did I mention crazy busy? Yet, once seated, I never felt like they were really busy!! 

This was our first time at this location. So the manager Sean, brought us a complementary pork rib.  We felt bad, he was so nice, but we do not eat pork for religious reasons.  He was determined to welcome us right. Out comes an order of fried pickles to try. (Yumm!!!!!).. It was really nice, and I appreciated the gesture! 

Val was our server who came over, and took our order. My gent steak, baked potato and veggies. Me, steak, mashed potatoes and a salad.  We were sitting there enjoying the conversation. When Val came back within 5 minutes of taking our order, to let us know Sean (Maybe Shawn?) saw that we ordered a baked potato and wanted us to know it was coated in bacon grease! OH MY GOSH!!! Can I say over the top service to ensure we did not eat pork?  My guy was floored. Ordered another potato choice.  Then back to chatting.

Not soon after, I got my salad, and shortly after that we got our steaks. Perfectly cooked.  Our drinks never went empty, she was always there before it was less then half left.  I was so appreciative of the service we were provide.  I have to say, we tipped BIG for our server.  I have eaten at some of the super expensive steak places, and I would rather go here for the service alone.  BIG kudo&#39;s to this location for understanding that customer service creates customer loyalty!!! WE WILL BE BACK!!!! .

4-14-2014-- how can I update a 5 star, like this.. Weeks later and Shawn once again provided stellar service.. He remembered us!! I wrote corporate and the location to thank them. I am certain that might be a little reminder.. But he was so gracious. Made us feel so welcome in a very busy welcome. He runs a tight ship and keeps everything moving. Service is always over the top good. The food is fantastic too, I can not stop raving about all that they do to make us feel welcome and appreciated."

I had no idea it would be a zoo! I called ahead and they informed me that I was on the queue and just to check in when I got to the restaurant. Once we got there, there were families taking their dad&#39;s out EVERYWHERE. The nice thing was that they had a little tent set up outside serving free sno-cones and selling beer. We ended up waiting quite a bit longer than our expected wait time. They gave away our table saying that they called our name, but we didn&#39;t show. However, I never received a text, which is what they use to let us know our table is ready. The service was good; about as good as to be expected on a hectic day like that. I ordered the Dallas filet and it was melt-in-your-mouth good. I ordered my filet with a side of potato soup, which was good, but about the same as other big box steakhouses. I also ordered the steamed veggies with my meal. Overall, this place is not bad. The bread at the beginning is so good too. Ask for 2 baskets on your way to the table.

I can&#39;t believe I forgot his name but I&#39;m going to do my best to describe him the next time I find myself in Aurora &#39;cause he&#39;s gonna be a big part of why I came back.

I took a friend out to thank him for picking me up at the airport and gave him two choices, &#34;seafood or beef.&#34; Luckily, he picked beef &#39;cause I wasn&#39;t in the mood for Joe&#39;s Crab Shack either and we entered peanut shell heaven sometime around 7 p.m. on a busy Friday night. I love a place that doesn&#39;t take itself seriously and encourages cheese, sour cream and gravy. And if it&#39;s all on one dish, I can&#39;t complain.

We were immediately greeted by a high energy, friendly, and attentive server named Scott? Richard? Mr. Moustache? (internal scream.) He literally stepped away and came back with a sweet tea in less than 10 steps and recommended these little hush puppy cheese ball thingies with jalapenos. Yum! I snacked away at those suckers while I watched an unexpected third party invited herself to dinner. (internal snicker)

I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with baked potato and veggies since I was trying to be a semi good girl and my friend and his (girl) friend who was trying to be more than a friend ordered the pot roast with mashed potatoes and fixin&#39;s. It was so cute to watch how uncomfortable he was while this woman infected him with her &#34;relationship bug.&#34; I do so enjoy a dinner and a show. 

The chicken was so tender, hot and had the right amount of salt everywhere. I wish I had more room in my stomach but it was tasty the next day in between two buns and some extra gravy. And again, our server was in and out like The Flash with iced teas and refills with a big smile. I&#39;ll definitely be back with friends if I was back in Aurora if I could get that awesome server again."

There were fresh rolls hot out of the oven and delicious honey butter waiting for us. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, our server was attentive and  generous. When the server learned it was my first trip to their restaurant, he brought me a sample of the ribs to try. Oh my goodness. The meat fell off the bone - delicious!! 

The manager also came over to make us feel welcome. The service was incredible. My steak was cooked to perfection and I will definitely be back any time I&#39;m in the mood for a great steak. 

The couple at the table next to us were regulars and gushed about how much they loved this restaurant. Apparently there is a branch of this restaurant close to their home but they make it a point to drive out of their way to this Texas Roadhouse because of the quality of the food and service. Definitely try this restaurant as soon as you can!"

The long queue shows how popular this place is, and for good reason! The nuts, rolls and cinnamon butter for starters were delicious and a nice way to wait for your food. It was our first time here and we were given a small rack of ribs to sample too! Oh and frozen margarita- yum! We had the friend onion starter (awesome) followed by steaks all round. My husband had Sirloin with a side of ribs, I had fillet steak and my 6 year old son polished off an entire 6oz junior sirloin plus ribs, rice and some fries! The food was absolutely stunning and we are super fussy about steak. My husband even got a little brownie on the house for his birthday, which was a nice touch! The service was fast and very friendly. All in all, I can happily say dining here was an absolute pleasure and we will most definitely be back."

texas-roadhouse-aurora-2,Holly K.,st-HcTLPF3hR6TXATb9DqQ,"Welches, OR",1,1,1,869,12,nNBOltTZKWjkmDy03eQUow,3.0,2012-05-11,"I can&#39;t even believe I had to put three stars on any Texas Roadhouse, especially one included in our five state tour of them, we included on our road trip. This one got the lowest because of service. I could just say, Are you kidding me? Leave at that and you&#39;d know if you went in exactly what I meant. However, some people&#39;s perception of good service varies, so I will share my experience. 

This was the second Texas Roadhouse on the trip and Utah&#39;s location had blown it out of the water with service and food. When we got here they wanted to seat us in the bar, but we wanted a table, not the tall chairs. We had been on the road 15 hours. It was about 9:15 when we went in and they had closed one side of the place out, the hostess let out one of those &#39;huffy&#39; sounds and told us they would find us a table. Clarification, we were looking for a table, not booth. 

After her theatrics, I thought we&#39;d have to wait, but they seated us right away. When they sat us down, there was a waitress sweeping the floor of peanuts. My husband likes the peanuts, and they had not put the bucket on the table, so he got up and got one from by their station. She saw him throw a shell on the floor and gave him a dirty look and swept it up. This TR has some tight spaces between the tables and the booths, so when she was sweeping she was right on top of our table. We would find she would sweep the ENTIRE time we ate, around our table. We looked to see what the frack she was sweeping, nothing people, there were no shells. It seemed like it was a tactic to move us along.

It made us really uncomfortable having her nonstop sweeping on top of us while we ate, in this little area. The icing was our waitress making comments that we were the only ones left and rushing us. She was not refiling drinks, and we had to keep asking despite sitting right by the place they are submitting orders. There were plenty of people in the bar and in the section next to us and they were still open, it was not 10pm yet. The area they sat us had been full when we got there, but now it was us and the fussy sweeping staff member. The wait staff sat at a table next to us, literally, and the manager I am assuming,  tells our waitress she can&#39;t leave until we leave. It was really put in a way that we were holding these people up from leaving work. Are you freaking kidding me? They were not even closed yet.

Between the sweeping and feeling rushed out of there I am surprised I could give this location a 3 star, but the food was good, except the potato was room temp, you could not have melted butter. I hated getting in there late for that reason. I did not want the ratty old-sorry-you-didn&#39;t-drive-faster potato. 

We were going to go to Denver&#39;s location the next night but we were tired of driving and came back here earlier on a Sunday night and had the same crazy sweeping thing going on around us. I am not sure who is OCD about the peanuts on the floor but it is a place that tells you throw the shells on the floor. Read my Billing&#39;s Montana Texas Roadhouse review to see what it SHOULD be like. Don&#39;t judge on this location. We agreed we would never go back into this location because of the service and the feeling of being rushed out."

I am a big fan of the early bird specials Mon to Thurs 4-6.  Yes, it makes me sound like I am in my later years that I eat dinner at 4:30 with no problem.   That&#39;s dinner time in my world and to be honest, why wait another hour and a half to pay nearly double. 

Last nights meal, 6 oz sirlion, baked sweet potato and corn for $7.99.  I mean really 7.99.  When the clock strikes 6 during the week that same meal is like 14 bucks!

So for 2 people, beverage, onion blossom thing and 2x7.99 dinners... total check...  26.58.  Plus it was too much even with the smaller lower priced portions, peanuts, onion and bread which is complemintary that I took 1/2 my dinner home.  

I do like that you can call ahead as well if you don&#39;t want to drop in and have to wait to be seated.  It&#39;s a nice relaxed place and even had free Wifi at this particular location, so it&#39;s good place if you&#39;re trying to plan something.  You can still have access with your laptop or ipad while you wait, or to even write a live running play by play review."

The dinner rolls were really, really good, and good thing we filled up on them, because it went downhill from there. When I found a loooooong blonde hair in my salad the manager was quick to replace the Salad. My wife asked for Hot Sauce 2 times for her catfish and after 35 minutes just figured they forgot about it. The pulled pork was seriously the most flavorless BBQ pork I&#39;ve ever had. I only say that because I&#39;ve had pulled pork in Oklahoma City, Dallas and Denver that made me say..&#34;wow&#34;. This pulled pork was very forgettable, perhaps it was a bad day for that selection.

Iliff Ave restaurant, mainly because after the first renovation we didn&#39;t care for the changes to the happy hour menu, beer glasses (thin), other menu items and the silly UPS clone uniforms.  All that came with the customary price increases.

Now 2016 they went through another renovation and since we received promotional coupons in the mail box decided to take a chance.  So we  stopped in Sunday Aug. 14th at around 11:20 a.m. to see what things were like.

We were promptly seated by the hostess at the entry and shortly afterwards were greeted by our server Rebecca.  Our server was outgoing, enthusiastic and prompt with the orders, also her timely visits to see if we were in need of anything else and making sure the order was to our satisfaction.  This attention to detail pushed this review to 5 stars.

For this visit we decided to order items we were previously familiary with to see if the kitchen did a good job and indeed they did.  Ordered the Chicago 7 with ale crust, jamaican jerk wings (a full order is now 9), side salads and four micro drafts.  The kitchen performed admirably and timely and they too get a big thumbs up.

The menu is pretty diverse and some of the new items we will return to try.  We still don&#39;t care for the thin pint glasses, they remind of diner ice tea glasses.  The original thick tavern pints just hold the temperature better.

We hope they can maintain this level of service and food preparation in the future.

cya again!"

Now that we are moving into the city, I&#39;m sure my reviews will be more hipster haunts for everyone.

In the meantime, this Old Chicago is a dirty little secret we&#39;ve been keeping. They have remodeled to be a taphouse and restaurant. I can only speak for the taphouse part. They have digital menus and many many beers on tap. We go mostly for happy hour because they have discounted beers and food and we may just be addicted to the Italian Nachos.

You seat yourself in the bar area. Your server will let you sample some of the draft beers before you choose. They carry a lot of local stuff and I&#39;m all about that. They have a pretty extensive happy hour food menu: pretzel bites, salads, mini pizzas, etc. The Italian Nachos, though. I think they are fried won tons? Tons of cheese, meats, pepperoncinis, sauce. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not good for your body, but it&#39;s good for your soul.

Service has been friendly and consistent. A few times the bar or kitchen were busy and we had to wait, but not enough to get bent about. So, solid 4 stars. Safe bet in Aurora."

He suggested the perfect appetizer....the Italian nachos! He was right! Our water was never empty and the waiter came over often! He even changed the TV station so we could watch the Grammy awards.

The food was perfect, we had the Meat Calzone, The Caesar Salad, the Fettuccini Alfredo and the Broccoli salad. The Fettuccini and the salad were the stars! 
 
At the end of the night our rewards card didn&#39;t process and the waiter still took our coupon for the free appetizer.
Old Chicago&#39;s is a great place to go and enjoy a relaxed bite or beer where people really value your business.
Its our new, GO TO local place"

They gave us the pager and mentioned they would let us know when they are ready. We checked in periodically and they knew we were anxious.  Finally around 6:45, an hour after we went in to check again and found out they gave both large table areas away.  They had no explanation on how this happened or why.  The manager could have cared less. They couldn&#39;t tell us when we would be seated that night.  They lost out on revenue as well as good referrals and our patronage. Went to Anthony&#39;s in the same parking lot and enjoyed their food and staff."

I also had the calzone and you can make it your own everything was really really good.  such big servings. you have to take home !! one of the best things here is the big cookie don&#39;t leave without it also I have to say I had the best waiter I&#39;ve had in a long time he was young and all I could think was he had it all together never had to ask for anything but a box he was the best I wish there was one of him everywhere

Start me on the drunk part of the evening, and I&#39;ll wait for a long time, but that means drinks first. Once we sat at the bar it was SO much quieter and a lot less kids. The beers were yums, and we had calzones which were super delicious. I don&#39;t know how I stopped myself from eating the second half.

Every time we have gone in lately it takes FOREVER to get service.  We wait way too long to even see a waitress, then you have to wait nearly half an hour to get your meal, then you have to wait even longer to get the check and much longer still to leave.  I get coupons in my email often but it&#39;s a huge ordeal to use them.  You have to wait an eternity for the manager to approve you using your coupon.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  We used to go there once every week or two, but now I don&#39;t think I want to return at all.  One bad experience is one thing, the same bad experience multiple times is unacceptable.  The employees seem stressed out.  I&#39;m guessing the problem is the management.  And I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s a hassle to use a coupon.  Overall, it&#39;s an unpleasant, stressful experience and that is most certainly not what I&#39;m looking for when I go out for a meal.  Oh yeah, and you better make your drink last because your chances of getting a refill are slim to none.

Was not the first time we have been here either it has been multiple times that we came and the service was bad. And i dont mean it was slow, it was bad. Our server seemed fairly busy but all he couldve done was come over and tell us he was flushed with tables and he will be right with us. Instead he ignored us, our drinks were empty, no silverware, didnt seem like he wanted to deal with us. Appetizers for one person came, then other peoples appetizers came and entrees. Some things were missing and we were ignored. We had to get up to find someone to help us. I think they need to train these servers on customer service and how to handle tables and people more.

We were nearby at best buy and decided to try this place for their pizza. We ordered the chi town trio appetizer for around $11 which consisted of a bruschetta with pesto sauce, Italian nachos made with pasta, and a rolled pretzel appetizer. All three were amazingly delicious as the waitress told is it would be. The bread for the bruschetta had the perfect crunch and the pasta chips were thin and crispy. I had never had anything like it. It&#39;s nothing like regular nachos because it doesn&#39;t have that corn flavor. The pretzel surpassed my expectations as well. I expected it to be tough and to taste like microwaved pretzel but it had a soft texture and had a sourness from the yeast that was really enjoyable. 

Our satisfaction with our appetizer gave us lots of excitement for our main dish: a 14 inch thin crust &#34;meat me&#34; pizza (for the meat-lovers). Our pizza was delicious and dad even boldly claimed the it was better than their previous favorite spot in Florida (a pizza spot that mom always talks about and craves).  The crust is crunchy and easy to cut into. The pizza served us four just perfectly. 

I also tried the craft flight beer sampler that gives you four small cups of beer for under $5. I had an apricot beer, a coffee chocolate beer, a grapefruit beer and boulder beer hazed and infused. Mom is normally not a beer drinker but she enjoyed all four. The grapefruit beer had the bitter sweetness of real grapefruit. The apricot beer was an award winning beer that definitely won as my favorite. The coffee chocolate beer was dark and tasted great after the meal. 

On top of our enjoyable drinks and food, dad ordered a black coffee and got a freshly brewed one without charge!

Food aside the decor is nice too. Walls are brick and wood which reminded me of a hot dog spot I went to in Chicago last fall. 

I&#39;d most definitely come here again."

(I got a S3 if you&#39;re curious)  While I waited for my 7000 contacts to transfer from one phone to another, I decided to get some food from across the way at Old Chicago Pizza.  The associate suggested that I actually NOT get a pizza but actually one of their calzones or chicken wings. I took his advice and ordered the calzone and salad.  They were very good as was my waitress, Amanda.  She (sinfully) recommended the margaritas to wash it all down.  I appreciate that, but what if I was on lunch break from work? My boss woulda had me hemmed up for walking into work sideways!

Good place for bar food and sports.  If I was an Auroranite (did I say that right?), I&#39;d hit Old Chicago Pizza on the regular.  The only reason why I gave it a 3 was because its supposed to be a pizza place and the pizza wasn&#39;t recommended."

They do get several things right, but what they get wrong is such a detraction that the overall rating has to be dropped to 2 stars.  

The Atmosphere:

Overall the atmosphere is good. The restaurant itself was recently renovated/remodeled, and it seems nice.  There are several televisions located around the restaurant, so watching the game is no trouble at all.  

The Food:  

I have been going to Old Chicago&#39;s for quite some time (read years), and the food has always been good.  The menu does seem to always be changing, which means that &#34;old favorite&#34; you always get may no longer be available.  However, that also means there is something new and tasty on the menu.  My current favorites are the buffalo chicken rolls, an app that is as delicious as it is filling (so share it up).  

The Drinks:

Old Chicago&#39;s has a full bar with a large beer selection that includes imports and craft beers.  The beer tours they offer are fun, providing incentive to try beers that you might not normally try.  

The Service,  A.K.A The Change:

This is where things start to take a nosedive.  The service the past several times I have gone has just been terrible.  We have waited 10-15 minutes on multiple occasions before a server even comes to the table.  Drinks frequently remain empty for long periods of time (my pet peeve), even after stopping the server and asking for a refill.  The last three visits our apps arrived along with our meals, so tonight we thought we would stagger the ordering.  However, another server brought our app, and by the time our server came back to check on us I was just ready for the check (After an hour I had received my initial order of a beer and buffalo chicken rolls).  If this was a one time occurrence I would just chalk it up to an &#34;off night&#34;, but that does not seem to be the case."

The wait for a table took forever even after we called ahead. The service was awful. After waiting so long for a table, we were in a rush. So we explained this to the server and still no response to our request. We ended up having to box up our meals to go because we had to rush and leave.  One of the most frustrating dining experiences I have had in quite awhile."

Weddings, birthday and graduations seem to bombard the terrain, and this was no exception. To celebrate my boyfriends graduation from college, I made reservations for a party of 25. I was told our large party would most likely have a back room, so we could chit chat while making our rounds. I was surprised when they showed us to our table/area to find it packed with other tables, eating their meal. We had one long table, seated directly next to others dining out. I knew this would pose a problem as we were not going to have a sit down dinner and would be up and about. I explained that to the waitress and she seemed like it wasn&#39;t a problem.

We ordered pitchers of beer, rounds of appetizers and eventually some couples ordered pizza, while my boyfriend and I talked/chatted with everyone. Before I knew it we were asked to sit down, and keep our party to just our tables...which to me, is utterly stupid. they were well aware of our situation and yet, sat tables next to us, creating conflict. 

At the end of the day, the food was good, our guests left happy and we had a good time. service was mediocre, but i suppose that&#39;s to be expected with a party of our size. Next time, i think our parties will be held elsewhere , and a dinner with less people would be optimal."

Just when I find a new favorite it&#39;s gone and replaced with something new. Never had anything bad just average food. 

They have recently remodeled and updated the beer menu. They always have a good variety of beer. The bad thing is the beers are on a TV that scrolls through the list. This takes way too long. Get a printed list if they have one.

The service...awful. When I make plans to go there I have to really think if it is worth the wait. The service is so slow that it keeps me from going back too frequently.  The server could visit the table more. If I have to sit there with a empty glass, that&#39;s a problem.  They also have a problem with bringing out your appetizer with your main course.  

I want to give OC 3 stars but I just can&#39;t. If the service was better I would."

They had everyone shoved into the back room. It was so loud you couldn&#39;t hear anything. The kids glasses came with no lids, so of course we ended up with a spill. Instead of coming out with a rag to clean the table they brought us out two lids. Wth? A little late now. I saw multiple plates sent back and heard at least 3 people ask to speak with a manager.... like Old Chi normally, but this store had some of the worst service I have ever seen! We paid for our drinks and booked it out of there...NEVER AGAIN."

The food is ok, the happy hour menu used to be better until they removed the buffalo wings from it! It&#39;s pretty pricey for wings here. Italian nachos, I&#39;m baffled to why it&#39;s still on the menu. The pizza here is good. Pepperoni pizza rolls are quite tasty. The staff here are great and they&#39;re very loyal to the regulars who frequent the bar here.

We both enjoy the salad at Old Chicago. We have been to this particular location before and have mediocre service, pizza messed up and terrible wait staff. We thought we would try again because it is right down the way from my children&#39;s school. We go in sit down at the open seating at the bar.  The hostess comes over doesn&#39;t say hello kiss my ass or anything just puts the menus on the table. So I say as she is walking away hello how are you today with no response. So my boyfriend goes to the restroom comes back still no waitress/waiter. So we get up and leave. TERRIBLE SERVICE AT ILIFF LOCATION. We went across the parking lot to Anthony &#39;s,  much better over here."

However, the service was not all that great. She checked on us right after she brought us our pizza. Soon after that, I was in need of a refill, but she was nowhere to be seen. She reappeared, walked right past us, and went to clean off a table. 5 minutes passes and she finally asks if I want a refill. Umm, yes! On the upside, I really liked their salad--nothing fancy, but the Italian dressing and sliced almonds are good! The boyfriend liked the beer blend called &#34;Snakebite&#34;. I would go back, but maybe to the Southlands location instead."

About six months ago we ordered a chicken pizza here, we each only ate one slice, and took the rest home. At about 4 am both of us were nauseous. We threw out the entire pizza and vowed never to return. Last night I decided to go again, and we thought by avoiding chicken, we would be okay. I had a Panini, and my bf had a calzone. I am very sure by our gastro-intestinal issues this morning, and today, that there is something amiss at Old Chicago. Like, maybe improper food storage? Italian food usually doesn&#39;t make you sick...well, Italian food that is FRESH doesn&#39;t make you sick. When you come back and try again, getting the same results, methinks I would like Tri-county to nose around and check the freshness dates on the stored food, and the cleanliness of the kitchen. Go here for beer, avoid the food. Sad. Old Chicago used to be a favorite. Goodbye."

My hubby and I showed up today for an early dinner.  I&#39;m assuming that was part of the problem as a lot of the dinner servers weren&#39;t at work yet.  We were asked if we wanted to sit in the noisy bar area, or would prefer a booth.  We chose a booth and were seated.  The host informed us that our waiter wasn&#39;t on yet, but another waiter that had tables in the same room would help us out until our server got there in 15 minutes.   

Well in that entire 15 minutes we sat there, I watched a server take care of two tables, bring them food, and leave.  I&#39;m not even sure if she glanced at us or not.   A bit later I watched a couple of servers walk into the restaurant, obviously getting ready for their shift.  I then watched a different server poke his head into the room of tables, make eye contact and leave.   At that point the hubby and I hadn&#39;t even had anyone take a drink order, so we chose to leave.  On the way out we walked past three servers chatting around the computer.   I was really looking forward to the meal I never got, but waiting 15+ minutes and not even being acknowledged is ridiculous."

You know what, it&#39;s true. Their pizza is pretty dang good. But this place still isn&#39;t my favorite, because of the decor, service, &amp; their other food. My favorite things are their pizza, cookies, &amp; nachos. That&#39;s it. They have a sports bar theme, but kind of old-looking. I&#39;ve had terrible service before, and other times I&#39;ve had amazing service, so I guess it varies. Just remember if you have an issue with service or food, take it up with management. Another word of warning, this place gets loud. So if your not into the &#34;people screaming so loud you can&#39;t hear yourself think&#34; kinda thing, then don&#39;t go on a day that a major sports game is playing. 
P.s. they offer military discount. depending on the manager, you could get it off your entire bill or only the portion for the military member. Also, they offer pickup."

I felt I had to review this Old Chicago because I had a great time the three times I&#39;ve been here.

The place has a large seating area and flat screens hanging on the walls so you can catch the game. Also, all the Old chicagos are linked so you can drink at any of them and your beer count will be kept correct for your card.

This Old chicago has very attractive girls at the front (at least when I go there) and the waiters/waitresses have been attentive and friendly. The menu is the same at all the others so they have the $10 and $11 dinner deals but here is why I like this place: Last time I came here, they were giving away all sorts of stuff for Halloween. Caramel apples, marshmellows dipped in chocolate, cookies in the shape of fingers and most important, bottle openers! You can never have too many. they gave away so much free food that I couldn&#39;t finish my dinner and had to take some home with me. 

If you live on the border of Denver and Aurora, check out this Old Chicagos but don&#39;t make a special trip here if you live somewhere else. Just find another one closer to you. they are all over."

My appetite was instantly ruined! Ordered a grill cheese &amp; soup but just wanted to leave! Stayed for the hubby. The tv&#39;s were up so loud you couldn&#39;t talk comfortably, and only about 10 customers in the building. Then the music came on which was even louder. My husband took silverware off another table so we could eat. Even the water tasted foul and I drink airport water everyday so for me to comment on it means it&#39;s really bad! When our food was delivered, the girl slid our food on the opposite end of the table from where we were sitting! Sliding my cell &amp; my hubbys glasses down the table, forcing us to get our own dishes! Little cheese on my grilled cheese but tomato soup was good.

I have been to numerous Old Chicago&#39;s across the United States and this one is my favorite one by far.  The primary reason is the atmosphere and their set up in the bar area.  The TVs are positioned in a way that allows the viewed to watch several different sporting events/games at one time.  A lot of the other bar and grills do not offer this arrangement.  On football Sundays it&#39;s easy to relax and watch all the games from where you are setting.  

The service I have experienced is also great.  Waiters and Waitresses are always friendly and definitely take good care of you.  I have yet to have a bad experience at this location and recommend it for a night out to enjoy a some great drinks."

So we are in a recession but I went here at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. There was no special game on TV, this place is just good for groups and obviously people like it.  

Wait time to be seated was a bit long (hostess was nowhere to be found when we arrived) but a manager walked over and promptly took care of us.  The atmosphere was friendly and there were a few employees hanging Christmas lights so that was cheery and fun.  I thought the dining experience was very consistent with the chain and my server (plus her trainee) were both helpful and attentive.  They even made good recommendations.  During the meal a manager stopped by to make sure everything was good and I was pleased with the personal service (no, not just because I take pictures of everything I eat and take notes...jk, I don&#39;t take notes...or do I?).

The italian nachos are awesome, I liked the antipasto salad and would order it again, the pizza was delicious and I had plenty for lunch the next day.  We finished our meal with turtle cheesecake and it was obviously brought in but it was delicious just the same.  

Shame on the other reviewer for giving a fine restaurant an unfair review.  I went to Old Chicago with appropriate expectations and I was not treated rudely so the establishment gets 4 stars and I will probably go back."

By the time we ordered and got our food, it was 52 minutes since we had been seated. Not to mention that he had given me the wrong salad.

Hey Corporate for Old Chicago the economy is bad and has been for a while so adjust like everyone else and offer specials. None the less the pizza is still really good. I ususally frequent the Arapahoe Crossing One or Illiff (Aurora) one due to them selling Dry Dock seasonal beer. I recently went to the Southlands Mall location and had a steak rare. Surprisingly it came out the correct temp rare is suppose to be. The steak was good!!! The server was very attentive and good. Good to see good customer service I wish I remembered his name. I gave him a good tip because he was good at his job, even though another server brought over dirty silverware to everyone at our table, it wasn&#39;t the main servers fault, that&#39;s why I still tipped him 40%.

The service has always been decent even for our large groups and they are very accommodating. There is plenty of space throughout the restaurant and the bar area is larger than some of the other locations I&#39;ve gone to. I should probably mention that this is the only location that manages to deliver pizza rolls (which is the appetizer we usually order) before the meal and when I&#39;m hungry, I appreciate that.

The personal sized pizza and drink for around $8.50 if I recall was a great value deal. You can put UNLIMITED toppings for the flat rate price. Crust is perfect.
They also have a great rewards program you can sign up for.
Would highly recommend and will be back."

If you&#39;re looking for a relatively quick meal and are in the mood for pizza this is a good place to check out. 

While the pizza was indeed done in five minutes as advertised, the service was rather slow for a normal lunch hour. This was due to there being only one person at work behind the counter while multiple people were in line. This person was doing the best they could but with only one worker, the pizzas can only get made so fast. I&#39;d imagine with a few people manning the toppings and the register in true assembly line fashion, it would&#39;ve definitely taken less time. 

I ordered the traditional Italian crust, and put my own toppings onto it. The pizza was decent, nothing to exclaim over. It was rather messy as the cheese was slipping off. I had to use a fork and knife but it&#39;s not the end of the world. 

Overall this place is similar to other quick personal pizza places, like Mod Pizza. I might prefer Mod after this initial visit to Pie Five."

The BBQ pizza I had was decent in the recommended pan pizza crust. I purchased the pizza, drink, and cheese breadstick combo. I think once you get to around $14.95 for one person you are getting pretty high as far as pricing for lunch. The breadsticks were greasy but also had a good cheese garlic mix. They&#39;re also available with bacon.

Parking sucks here. You&#39;ll probably end up in the big lot out back and not in the lot in front as new businesses continue to fill the surrounding vacant storefronts.

Overall, a solid OK. Excellent BBQ sauce, good crust, but crazy pricing."

However, the pizza was very good. Good crust, good ingredients. Best of all they serve coke products.

We ordered the Five star and build your own. Good process. 

The staff was courteous and nice but a smile goes a long way.  People are tired after a long day and if you have to wait in line,  that extra smile is often appreciated and a warm welcome is huge when walking in the door. 

Unfortunately, the line was a bit long which caused a few customers to walk out which is too bad because they missed some good pizza."

Very friendly and welcoming staff. It is like chipotle/subway style with Lot of options to choose from for toppings, cheese, sauces and dough. Several signature pizzas available as well. Everything is freshly made and ingredients were fresh as well. For $7.99, the pizzas are made for one person but if you go down the route of making your own pie, you can certainly load it up with toppings which would be enough for 2 people.

Glad to see more establishments coming to this area and hope this place gets well received when they officially open in a few days!"

I have been here at least 7-8 times with my family since they opened. This is a great affordable place to visit in Southlands. Build your own pizza, unlimited cheese and toppings. What more could you want? Pizza is always tasty. The service however leaves something to be desired. Often the employees are slow and not very hospitable. Tables and trash areas are very often dirty. I went in with my family for lunch and there were no other customers in the place yet there were 4-3 dirty tables. After we got our food all the employees disappeared to the back. I needed a to go box but couldn&#39;t find anyone. Luckily the manager was having a meeting with what looked like district managers towards the back of the place. I ended up having to go back there and interrupt their meeting in order to get a  to go box. Hopefully that helped them see they needed to have some more employee presence in the lobby....

Hoping service picks up a bit because it took about 30 minutes to give my order with only 5 people in front of me. Since each pie is personal size, each customer wants to get enough for them and their kids, hence if someone is getting 5 pies, you could be waiting awhile. Especially since the people making the pies seem to go at a snail&#39;s pace. 
They may also want to put a number system in place, since my friend had her kid&#39;s pie taken by someone else who left and when the next pie (presumably the lady&#39;s who left) came up (which happened to be an adult size), they wouldn&#39;t give it to her. Had to wait for another to be made. Not sure what happened to the unclaimed pie. Trash? What a waste. 
Pies were delicious. Lots of choices and cooked perfectly. 
Space is nice. Very clean. Bathrooms have a motion detector light so if you need to be in there for a bit to change a diaper, make sure you bust some dance moves occasionally to keep it on. :-/"

Why Wednesdays? CHEESE. MOAR CHEESE. Wednesdays at the Truffle Table means AYCE Raclette. What&#39;s raclette, you ask? A European cheese wheel that they cut in half, let it set under a broiler so the cheese gets melty. The cheese is somewhat like a swiss or emmanthaler swiss. A little stinky, has a strong nutty flavor. And is super delicious once they pour that melty goodness over a plate of french bread dotted with veggies and sausage. 

Servers will keep bringing you plates of this delicious goodness until you cry uncle. Then you get to choose to share a dessert with your date/partner/friend. Both times, I got the banana bread pudding thing, of which the highlight is the split banana with a creme bruleed candied topping. OMG. (AYCE raclette plus dessert is $40/couple)

Service: 5 stars. super friendly and knowledgeable. not speedy (but you don&#39;t care b/c they keep bringing you cheese)
Food: 4.5 stars (i&#39;m holding back b/c I don&#39;t know what else is there other than raclette)

We decided to come here before a night out and happily stumbled into happy hour.  It is a great way to save a little on the cheese selection and wine.  

We started with the 3 cheese course from the happy hour menu, the siracha caramel corn also from the happy hour menu, three meats, jambon de iberico, curried squash soup and souffle.  Now we sound like massive pigs here but the serving sizes are totally appropriate to sample all of that.  We also finished off our sampling with the butter sampler which was hands down the best part of the night.  

The popcorn was sweet with just the mildest hint of siracha; it was a lovely way to start the nibbles.  We also had ordered a glass of red wine and sparkling white wine which complimented the food perfectly.  Of course iberico ham is always good and this had a lovely marbling that just increased the tremendous flavor.  The cheeses ranged from incredibly mild to pungent and wonderful.  The squash soup was wonderful; my only suggestion would be to use toasted pumpkin seeds without the shell as it made it a little stickier in your teeth.

And then we get to the butter.  We sampled a gorgeous salted French butter, a mild and surprisingly sweet goats milk butter and another salted butter from Vermont. It might sound off putting to sample butter but I assure you it was well worth it.  

We were a little dismayed to find no chocolate or truffles of the sort as a dessert option.  With a name like the Truffle Table and in the keeping of this style of cuisine, a chocolate taster would be perfect!

Regardless, the customer service was great and we have already made plans with friends to come back!"

While waiting for a friend I had the chance to interact with a female staff. She&#39;s so genuinely friendly and very accommodating. Yet very knowledgeable about their dishes and wines. Her suggestions were all on point. 

I ventured out on a snowy day last week. It was one of those days I know I&#39;m lucky to have said yes to moving to Denver. It was beautiful watching the snowflakes settle on the branches just outside the window seat I snagged. Peaceful feeling. One reason why I am enamored with this place. 

I wanted something light. A Prosecco was a good fit for my mood that day. I wanted something less dry but what they had that day sufficed my need. 

After much help from the staff I decided to start with their Prosciutto Meatballs with Salsa Verde. I&#39;m so glad I went for this. The salsa verde was on the dry side. Which suited me perfectly fine. I also requested it on the side thinking it was wet. This is such a stunningly delicious partnership that I can&#39;t stop craving for it! The meatballs could very well handle itself without the salsa but together? A stunner!

I wanted more but wanted to try something else. The Bacon Artichoke Dip covered that need. Another perfectly executed tasty treat. I had to ask the staff to box my leftover dip and more bread to go pretty please!:)

Even the chug! chug! chug! chanting trio in the bar did not bother me at all. I had a great time catching up with my friend and I heard her pasta was delicious! 

This area is more relaxed than d/t and probably contributed to my very mellow mood. I found parking really easy that day and the whole world was alright at least for that day :)"

Pros and Cons: 

Pros:
Nice Happy Hour prices. Although if you want to have more control of your cheese options order the non HH cheese platter which is what we did.
Ordered 5 cheeses and 3 of 5 were delicious. Other two were okay. 
Ordered 5 meats. All good. 
Bruschetta special. Yum
Sangria. The best I&#39;ve had

Cons:
Would love to see more accompaniments with the meat and cheese platters
The loud hip hop music was AWFUL. Not at all a good fit. 
Hummus-very salty
Sangria-Delicious but surprised at how small the glass was considering that much of it was weighted down with fruit. 
Service-Would have liked more outgoing service around choosing meats and cheeses

Overall, it was okay. I love cheese and charcuterie but a little more variety with the accompaniments would be nice. But I notice in other yelp pictures that there were figs on some of the cheese plates which we didn&#39;t get. Also in reading other yelp reviews realize that others were given more support in choosing cheese. We ordered the five cheese and waiter was ready to walk away and put the order in until I asked for a couple of cheeses that we wanted to have on there because he had told us we would have more control if we ordered the 5 cheese vs the HH special. No offer to discuss cheeses or make recommendations on the others so we didn&#39;t think that was even an option and took what was given which were not what we would have chosen. All may have been forgiven if again not for the loud hip hop music throughout of entire dinner. Just Strange."

So much cheese. So much wine. So delicious.

Wednesday night raclette is a stinky, cheesy, comforting event. We brought a group--because that&#39;s the best way to do raclette, in my opinion. When they said, &#34;all you can eat,&#34; I don&#39;t think they understood how much cheese, pickled onions, veggies, and sausage we can eat. 

The cheese was excellent--probably the best raclette I&#39;ve tried so far. They helped us pick a wine to pair well, and it did not disappoint. We also enjoyed some delicious rillettes and olives as well. A friend noted later in the evening, when we met up elsewhere, that he could smell us across the room. Probably worth noting that you will have a lovely cheese perfume until you shower and change clothing. But totally worth it.

Staff is friendly and is really enthusiastic about their wares. They are all knowledgeable and ready to talk about the wines and cheese to help you find something you&#39;ll love.

You can pick up some cheese here, stop in for wine and/or cheese, or make it a night as we did with our raclette feast."

Fitting that I say this, since Truffle Table was the first stop on a Valentine&#39;s Day night in Denver. Being that this was my first V-Day in Mile High City, the boo and I had no idea how crowded or crazy it would be at a popular wine bar. Happy to report that the place was full, but not excessively. There were even two seats at the bar for us when we walked it. Pre-dinner drink and cheese plate, please?

Being that it was Cupid&#39;s big day, a glass of sparkling rose was necessary. Yes, I felt a bit like a basic b*tch to be drinking pink on such a cliche holiday, but I like it all the time. Not gonna stop doing what I like in fear that it looks dumb. The boy was drinking chardonnay, so if anything we both looked a bit light in the loafers.

As for cheeses and meats, we enjoyed manchego, aged cheddar and a soft triple creme cheese with an ashy rind that was absolutely heavenly. Even though it looked a little like a slice of brain on the outside, the inside was ooey, gooey and creamy. I could eat a pound of that stuff by itself!

This was my second visit to TTT and it won&#39;t be my last. I love the servers and bartenders, who are more than excited to &#34;talk shop&#34; about their offerings. That, combined with the fact that it&#39;s two blocks from my house and in one of the cutest little nooks of LoHi. 5-stars all the way, baby."

The trio of butter was delicious but the truffle mac and cheese barely tasted like truffle. Giving this 2 stars because I feel like since this restaurant is called The Truffle Table, their &#39;truffle&#39; mac and cheese should be the most amazing thing on the menu. Sadly disappointed but I will come back to give it another go because I&#39;d like to try other items on the menu."

Perfect place for wine and cheese, a little pricey but quality is great. I actually didn&#39;t get any sort of charcuterie board when I went but did enjoy a few glasses of wine. The BUTTER sampler, I highly recommend! French butter, butter from Vermont and another butter, so divine I wanted to eat it with a spoon. Pickled veggies were delicious too! Small bench patio that is perfect for people watching!"

I went into the truffle table for a snack and ordered a 3 cheese sampler, giving my server Luke free reign of which cheeses to add. I am generally very picky and he managed to choose the perfect cheeses to compliment both my palate and the delicious Grecian Cabernet (that he also recommended). 

I highly recommend both this spot -- and my server, Luke. I will definitely be back!"

This was my third or fourth time visiting The Truffle Table and while I&#39;ve always had great experiences this last time was truly exceptional.  Alyssa, Saul and Andrew had great recommendations for both wine and a couple charcuterie plates and were extremely knowledgeable and helpful explaining all the different items.

Love that you provided us with a list of all the different meats and cheeses we tried, great idea and so helpful when it comes to our next shopping trip.  Thanks again!"

Ian was our server and was amazing! He made us feel welcome, was enthused and informed about the broad menu selection, and helped us select an epic three cheese board that was adorned with dried figs and apricots, fresh apple slices and jam. Their wine selection is wonderful, I highly recommend the Rudi Wiest Pinot Noir and the Owen Roe Yakima Red.  We shared a decadent chocolate mousse dessert. We will definitely be back! Excellent service, food, wine and overall experience!"

Stopped here after reading some reviews on Yelp and now am there at least twice a month whenever a visitor is in town.  It&#39;s not only a great date spot, but a perfect place to grab some wine and catch up with your girlfriends (every time I&#39;ve been there it&#39;s a mix of the two).  

The cheesemongers are excellent.  They listen to what you like and give good recommendations.  Same goes for their wine selections and they&#39;re great about letting you sample the different types of wine to decide what you like.  I highly recommend checking it out during Happy Hour and trying their 3-cheese plate to get a feel for it.  If it&#39;s warm, sit outside on the patio and people watch.  

Thanks, as always, Truffle Table!"

Being Wednesday, we opted for the all you can eat Raclette. I would like to correct a previous reviewer and point out that Raclette special is $40 per couple, not $20.

The Raclette is one of those experiences that seems great in concept but fails in execution. I&#39;m glad we tried it once but wouldn&#39;t try it again. The cheese itself was all the deliciousness you would expect from hot melty cheese but the bread was unremarkable and the accompanying vegetables were somewhat bland and lacking consistency - sometimes completely cold and underdone and sometimes barely done and warm.

They have a nice wine list and a knowledgeable staff.

The meat boards are average and nice - again nothing exceptional and nothing too far removed from the other charcuterie offerings around town.

The cheesecake dessert was a nice option but again, not a standout.

Points on for atmosphere and definitely a nice option for a nice bottle of wine and some snacks. 

We&#39;ll definitely give them a try for happy hour or a quick drink before dinner elsewhere."

Plenty of cheese options that are written on a chalkboard with about 8 different meat selections. We decided to go with a cheese from Holland which was perfect. It wasn&#39;t too bold but had a buttery creamy taste. The jamon was from Spain and was perfectly cured. The service is wonderful, very helpful and friendly. I mentioned that I didn&#39;t like meats with a ton of fat on them and he suggested the jamon, it was a great choice!"

I&#39;ve been dying to try this place since moving to Denver last year but it has to be the right moment to have cheese for dinner. And that right moment is when your sister wants to hang out and your fiancé is in Vegas for his bachelor party. 

You know you&#39;re about to have fun when you show up to a restaurant and there&#39;s a sign that says &#34;You should probably eat some cheese.&#34; Well okay. And cheese we did. Our waitress was awesome and pronounced and described our cheese plate like a pro. Plus all the cheeses were outstanding!

Honorable mention for the mint-peach sangria. I can&#39;t wait to take fiancé there as it turns out he did survive his bachelor party after all."

We were not greeted when we walked in and just had to guess if we were ok to sit wherever. The waitresses gave us the impression that they didn&#39;t really want us there and we weren&#39;t fancy enough to be there. When my friend pronounced the complicated German wine correctly, I think the waitress then realized that we were okay to be there. Didn&#39;t really seem respectful. We had a few drinks but didn&#39;t get to try any of the meat or cheese since we were still full from dinner. 

Overall it&#39;s a nice environment, it won&#39;t be my first choice to come back to but I&#39;ll go back if someone else wants to try it."

I have never had a Spanish rose before, but this definitely won&#39;t be the last time.  We also had the duck liver mousse which was excellent as well.

We stopped in on a Wednesday during happy hour and were super surprised at how awesome this place is! It looks like a lovely French cafe, is full of light, has great service and a super afforable yet filling happy hour menu. The owner even came out to explain our cheeses and took time to chat with us. She was very welcoming. The only area of improvement would be to have fresher, yummier baguette slices with the cheese, as our bread was a tad dry. Try the all-you-can-eat scraped cheese on Wednesdays; it is delicious."

I didn&#39;t catch the name of our server last night, but she was spot on I regards to recommendations as it related to our preferences. I don&#39;t remember the red wine I ordered, but it was some of the best French wine I&#39;ve had in a while. My friend was in agreement with his as well. As for the cheeses and meats, we selected 5 cheeses and 3 meats. Again, not quite sure what we ordered, but everything was superb. 

We decided to be gluttons and order the grilled cheese as well as the Pain d&#39;Epice. While my friend was blown away by the grilled cheese, I thought it was good but not as mind blowing as I was lead to believe by previous reviews on here. The Pain d&#39;Epice however is a must have! Hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve eaten in quite a while. With the spiced bread filled with cheese to the radishes, arugula and lemon curd, I cannot begin to say enough good things about this dish! It comes deconstructed and the best part is when you put it all together and let the savory and sweet profiles blend in your mouth. Absolute heaven! I&#39;m not a huge radish person and I have to say that you&#39;d be a fool to pass this dish up. Can&#39;t wait to go back for all you can eat raclette night!"

Our server, I think her name was Michelle ( sorry if its not), was great. She and the cheese mongers decided the cheeses and meat for us. She was attentive, friendly and had a great knowledge of our dinner. We also ordered the artichoke bacon dip, that was also great. 

It&#39;s small and simple, located in the highlands. Placed at each table, an tiny deliteful succulent plant that just makes the place adorable. We will definitely be going back. Especially on Wednesday night to try their all you can eat Raclette!"

My girlfriends and I came by here after a disappointing lunch that we didn&#39;t eat. We all shared the meat board, cheese board, Sriracha caramel corn (sounds weird, but don&#39;t be thrown off), and the white truffle mac &amp; cheese. Everything was amazing. You have access to unlimited bread and crackers for the boards, which were artistically presented. We ordered the popcorn since it sounded so strange, but were pleasantly surprised. It didn&#39;t taste anything like Sriracha, but instead left a little bit of a burn on your tongue. Very cool. Also, mac &amp; cheese is to die for. It&#39;s incredibly decadent and was more than enough for three of us to share.

The restaurant itself is rather tiny, but very cozy and would be perfect for a date. I&#39;m definitely bringing my SO here soon."

If I made a theme song for myself these words would probably be the chorus because I have a deep appreciation (read: obsession) for both of them. And The Truffle Table features, you guessed it, a boatload of cheese and wine.

They have wines by the glass, the have cheese by the board, they have meat accompaniments, they have fondue!!! Melty cheese that I dip stuff into? Gah! I like it here so much I went back twice in one night. You think I&#39;m joking, but I&#39;m not.

The cheese selection is very interesting and if you are overwhelmed by it, or an adventurous cheese-eater you can just tell your server what kinds of things you do and don&#39;t like and he or she will pick your cheeses for you.

I felt like the atmosphere was lacking a bit where it was a bit too quiet for me and there was nothing super noteworthy concerning the overall ambiance. I love the big windows and it made it feel really open but for some reason the place felt a little cold to me.

The cheese we selected was great; my friend&#39;s boyfriend had pumpkin soup that he loved. They also had a salami plate, but I didn&#39;t try that, but they raved as well. 

This place is small with cute tables. They also have great wine. A perfect date place. 

But the service! Man, it was perfection. They are doing it right."

I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience. This tapas bar offers an impressive selection of wines, cheeses, meats, and small plates, and all in a cozy and inviting atmosphere. A small bowl of nuts greeted us when we sat down at our table. We began with the brochette of the day - a yummy soft cheese atop toasted French bread circles with a flavorful dollop of jam which we ordered along with a bottle of Tempranillo and both were delicious! Next we decided to try and particularly enjoyed the cheeses and meats our helpful and attentive server Alyssa selected for us at my request-I really didn&#39;t know what to order so I asked Alyssa to choose for me and I was surprised and pleased with the plates she brought us.  Everything was delicious right down to the tasty bits of fruit and honey drizzle accompanying the cheese selections and the caper berries and pickled cauliflower and cornichons which garnished the meat selections. Crusty French bread and crisp crackers were served alongside and provided a tasty vehicle for the cheeses and meats. I say go with an open mind (and open mouth) and just experience the pleasure of delicious wholesome food carefully prepared and served with style. I&#39;ll be back to try some of the other cooked items next time like the truffle Mac and cheese."

Located on that unusual corner intersected by 15th St, 29th Ave, and Boulder St, The Truffle Table is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. They&#39;re a perfect fit, offering palate challenging food, providing unique offerings like specialty cheeses, cured meats, and more. 

If you enjoy cheese, a calm dining atmosphere, and want to be figuratively to a small European neighborhood cafe that all the locals enjoy, this is your place. I merely intended to drop in, but was distracted by Pain D&#39;Epice Delight featuring Epoisses Gingerbread with radishes, greens and salted lemon curd. Was it a dessert, a savory item? I had to try it even after being full from happy hour elsewhere.

As we waited, we enjoyed a small dish of marinated olives and a small glass of Warre&#39;s 10 year port wine. The marinated olives were unbelievably tasty. It&#39;s tough to describe, but they were meaty, the pit yield relatively easy, but the soaking liquid made it for me. I want more marinated olives. 

Then the Pain D&#39;Epice arrived, the plating separating the salted lemon curd, lightly oiled and salted greens and radishes, and the dark brown gingerbread topped with Epoisses cheese. You can find two pictures of this dish if you look at their Yelp photos. The gingerbread was in the Burgundian style. If I remember correctly, this is a dish the owners had that their chef managed to recreate. It is designed to be savored and savor we did. 

I can&#39;t wait to return. Their menu offers so many fantastic options. I was doing research right now and I really want to try &#34;A Taste of Piedmont&#34;. They also offer a barley salad, a grilled cheese sandwich (The Best in All The Land), a butter sampler (what will that be like?), and burrata with a fruit terrine. This is only a small sampling of what they do. And then there are the specials like one involving Fruition Farm&#39;s sheep ricotta.

Edited to add: You must have the butter sampler. My friend will tell you that it&#39;s amazing and if you&#39;re not motivated to rush out to the Denver Truffle to purchase at least one butter, you&#39;re crazy.

Dec 10 addition: I was in the neighborhood and wanted stop in. It would be the first time since I saw some of the staff since my Southern France culinary adventure. You know what? You can&#39;t just stop in and say &#34;hi&#34;. You must eat something and they had a dish on the menu I was very curious about - Bagna Cauda. It&#39;s a dish with olive oil and salty anchovies that taste like a pecorino or parmesan (just trust me). You dip your veggies in and let it drip onto the bread. You eat the vegetable, then the bread. Voila! Delicious! And this is coming from an anchovy &#34;disliker&#34;."

It has great cheese and meat options that are easy for everyone to share. The staff is very knowledgeable about each item and know which wines to pair with each cheese to give you the perfect combo.

Great for a date night or just to enjoy some cheese, meat, and wine! Makes you feel like you&#39;re in Europe :)"

I finally walked in this place on a late friday night.  We each got a class of wine.  And they will let you taste before you commit to a glass.  My class of red was delic and he enjoyed his white.  We started with the corn and tomato salad.  It was really good, I&#39;m pretty sure it was raw corn shucked from the cob mixed with chopped mint and a few slices of tomatoes on the side, yummy!  Then we had some lamb meatballs.  Meatballs were fairly small, but very flavorful.  The tzatikiki sauce was really good, the only complaint here would be add more of your spicy red sauce.  Then we picked 3 cheeses, I remember the Gruyere being really good.  The midnight blue was not as strong as a Roquefort but not too waxy either, and I&#39;m not a bleu cheese fan.  The other one we picked was in the mixed cheese side and it had truffles in it!   Yea, for truffles!  All cheeses came with an accompaniment like almonds, jam or dried fruit.  You also get a little cracker/bread bowl which you can get refills on. 

It was a very chill atmosphere and waitstaff was fantastic.  This is an adult place to talk and have a snack.  They have just a few entrees and a few desserts as well."

Reasonably priced too.

First the space is great, intimate without being crowded (Wednesday early supper)
Staff is sublime, everyone was helpful, sweet and seemed to like doing what they did.

Wife and I had first date in some number of years, we shared the Wednesday all you can eat Raclette plate which was phenomenal, cheese was perfect, bread perfect (Trompeau) and steamed veggies were delightful.  I&#39;m a huge fan of charcuterie and salumi so i chose to go with a ridiculously affordable plate of 5 meats to accompany my side of the cheese and it was too much.  Plenty for 2 people for sure.  All the meats were delicious and served with good little bites.  We only made it through 3 portions of the cheese, next time not so much meat.

$40 Raclette came with desert to share, we went with the walnut cake with lemon verbena olive oil, it was a little savory for my taste but still nice complex flavors and good presentation.  

Overall i hope Truffle table becomes the institution in Denver that it&#39;s mother store is wildly successful."

We had the intention of going to Forest Room 5 but when we walked in it was so crowded and the music was so loud we knew we wouldn&#39;t enjoy our meal.  We had passed The Truffle Table while walking and decided to go back and give it a go. 

The atmosphere is great. The music was perfect and even with a large party in the middle of the room it was quiet enough to have a conversation. 

Our server was exceptional. I am pregnant and she was really accommodating to make sure that our cheese selections were pasteurized and safe for the baby. 

We had the fondue and the marinated olives. They were both incredible. We also had the bread pudding and the Earl Grey custard. Each were delicious. 

Overall the space was very clean including the restrooms. We will definitely be back."

Me and girlfriend went there after work. We order 5 cheeses, 3 meats, and a couple glasses of wine. I had no idea just how many types of cheeses they have. Since my knowledge of cheeses is very limited, I asked the waitress to select them for me. She did a good job. I can&#39;t remember all the cheeses we sampled, most of them are delicious. I didn&#39;t like the one made from water buffalo because it was too stinky and gamy for me. By the way, the food is plenty for two of us. Before I entered the restaurant I was going to get a cheese burger afterward, but I was completely full. Street parking is the only option and has a two hour limit, so just pay attention to time if you decide to spend more than 2 hours in the restaurant. We almost did because the food was delicious, service was excellent, and the atmosphere is very warm and inviting."

It always sounds good, and it always IS good.  Perfect for everything from girls wine &amp; cheese evenings to date nights.  The small venue has the perfect ambiance and lighting - not too bright but not so dim that you can&#39;t tell what kind of cheese you are eating - love the little two-top window tables the most.  

And the staff here - SO welcoming.  Everyone I have interacted with is knowledgable on the menu and wine list, happy to talk to you, happy to help you, and just really make the experience here.

While I adore wine and cheese, I am far from an expert - and the staff always helps with recommendations!  Every time I&#39;ve been (my count is at 5 times now, probably soon to be triple that), I have been offered a few sample sips to help select a yummy wine, and then the staff has selected the cheese &amp; meat selections for me.  I have enjoyed everything they have brought out!! And, to add, they do a phenomenal job of arranging the platters beautifully.

I think I need to go again tonight...!!!"

She asked which types of cheeses we liked, and tailored our cheese board.  My friend and I each had 3 glasses of wine and 1 cheese board and the tab came to over $100, so this is a little spendy.

If you love cheese, cured meat, and wine, then you should probably get here as fast as you can. This place is what dreams are made of! No joke. In fact, this place is becoming my own personal Cheers. I don&#39;t go every day nor week, but definitely I make a point to get there once a month. Every time I do walk through that door, I am greeted with the smiling faces and the service they give is the best in any Denver restaurant. Let me repeat that, the best service in any Denver restaurant. That said, I have a passion for cheese, meat, wine, and now BUTTER, and these cheesemongers have a ton of information to share to help bring out my inner cheese/food geek! 

When you go, let them take care of you. Tell them what you like and what you don&#39;t like, have Miguel pair some wine with the choices and you will have an amazing experience! This is my favorite date night spot!"
