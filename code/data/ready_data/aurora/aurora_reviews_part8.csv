Three Little Griddles is a festival of tastes, delights and outstanding food. Even the breakfast potatoes have a unique flavor, melting in your mouth. 

I loved the Eggs Benedict. The waiter was cool and friendly. The atmosphere felt open, happy and clean. The music was awesome. 

The place has a higher-level quality akin to Snooze but with their own unique style and flavors. The chef at this restaurant is the real deal. He&#39;s not phoning this job in - he&#39;s giving it all he&#39;s got. I look forward to going back soon."

We made plans to go to Snooze, but with a 1:15-1:30 wait with a baby, we called an audible. And, I&#39;m so glad we did! We called ahead to check their wait, decided it was reasonable, and scooted on over. 

The 20-25 minute wait for 4 + highchair was only 20 minutes, and while the kitchen wasn&#39;t necessarily speedy - the servers were polite, and kept us appraised of said kitchen status. 

Um, savory griddle cake. Enough said. Get the veggie and add meat. You won&#39;t be sorry. Also, the little Danish donut holes that I can&#39;t spell (or pronounce) are fantastic. 

Dishes that we envied going by: biscuits &amp; gravy, more savory griddle cakes, breakfast burrito, etc. 

We&#39;ll be back soon!"

Why was it so good? The pork green chili is a mix of green chili with hearty pork chunks, enchilada sauce, and tex mex queso. A very thick and excellent sauce, a meal in itself.

In town on business Kate and I were trying to find somewhere for breakfast near our hotel off i25.  Three Little Griddles looked good and it was close, so off we went.  Anyone who knows me knows I love breakfast, and looking at the menu I knew this place would be good.  Granted our water arrived in bottles that purposely didn&#39;t have ice (a little pretentious for my taste), but oh well.  

We ordered breakfast burritos smothered in green chili and they were delicious.  The green chili wasn&#39;t hot at all which could be a problem for some but it was savory and tasty.  We also ordered the pancake ball things with lemon custard in them and they were wonderful as well.  

Breakfast was so good that we went back the next day and had biscuits and gravy, a Cinnamon roll and an omelet, all of which were equally as good as the breakfast burritos the previous day.  Cost was a little high for breakfast food but not out of the ordinary. Service was good and the atmosphere was light and refreshing.  Highly recommended."

Came in super-hungry, borderline hangry.  Yeah sure fine, I was hangry, I can admit that.

The patio was packed, which led me to believe it would be packed inside.  I was moderately right, but we only waited a few minutes before being seat, and most of that was waiting for the hostess to reappear.

Our server was alright.  She was bubbly and friendly, but pretty slow as a whole.  I think she had 6 tables total, but she took 10 minutes to come back by to take our order, then another 10 to bring some drinks.  They have an open kitchen, and we could see her just sort of standing there in between.

The food was really good.  My biscuits and gravy were massive biscuits, drowning in spicy and chunky sausage gravy, topped with an egg.  Should have asked for another egg, as it was drowned out by the rest of the meal.

Seriously good.

My screwdriver was pretty weak, and tasted just like orange juice.  Bummer!

But the meal as a whole was quite good."

We went at prime time on Sunday morning and despite an empty patio, the interior was packed at 10 AM on a Sunday with every table full. We know better next time to go about an hour later when it was practically empty. We had some place to be later in the day so we chose to sit at the bar which turned out to be great from a &#39;get to sit down early&#39; perspective but we waited almost 45 minutes for our food. Mine was a slice of quiche that just needed to be cut... I can&#39;t imagine they baked a whole quiche but they certainly had enough time to do so! My husband had the pork hash and although he said it wasn&#39;t a hash traditionally, it tasted good. We both thought this place was just so so on on food quality. Our service was great. Colton was attentive however was occupied with many other tasks in the kitchen.

The highlight of this meal was the Ebleskivers. Ours were a tad under cooked but very delicious. We ordered bacon and cheddar but instead received A chocolate batter with coconut and a bit of frosting drizzled over them. They were very tasty and honestly we were quite hungry by the time they arrived so the order of four was devoured rapidly!

When the place is busy everyone appears a bit frazzled. By sitting at the counter we could see that the kitchen was producing a great quantity of meals which sometimes sat under the heat lamps for more than five minutes. We, however, are not complaining. Our food was delivered hot albeit with a long wait."

Church is in Highlands Ranch, but we wanted to try this restaurant because of the 4 and 5 star reviews, so the drive was not an issue.

AMBIENCE. One reviewer&#39;s description of the restaurant as trendy is far from the truth. The restaurant is in a trendy neighborhood, but not trendy in itself. It was so disappointing to step in and the restaurant looked and felt like an IHOP &#34;with a bar.&#34; Tables were so close together that you could hear the conversations of the people next to you. 

SERVICE. Upon arrival, we were told it was a 20 minute wait. The hostess took my cell number and I immediately received a text stating the wait time and a link to an app showing our wait in line. I was impressed with that! That&#39;s trendy!

When we were seated, our server came to take our order right away. When we told her it was our first time, she also said it was hers. Hmmmm... I asked what she recommended, and she said that the popular items were the quiche and the cinnamon rolls, but they were both out. What?! It was only 11 am!! Don&#39;t they plan the menu for Sundays when there are more people that come in for breakfast? Nevertheless, I decided on the corned pork hash and my husband had the red eye plate. Mind you...it took about 30 minutes to get our food! Unacceptable wait!!! Our server came to our table twice letting us know that our order was coming shortly. Hahahahaha...

FOOD. The reason I tried the corned pork hash  was because of a description of this dish in one review...it was exquisite!! OMG, the reviewer must not know what exquisite means. The menu described it as homemade. Yeah...very funny! I had about 3 pieces of pork that were tough to chew and the cook snuck in a couple slices of ham (maybe to replace pork, because they ran out? Surprise!!) I also had fries on the plate (I guess their version of hash). Thank goodness the eggs (2) were cooked as ordered and the toast was not burned. 

My husband&#39;s red eye plate is basically ham steak on top of grits and his choice of eggs. I asked my husband why he did not pour the red eye gravy on his ham. He said it tasted funny. Red eye gravy is a mixture of butter, coffee, maybe ham juice and pepper. This gravy tasted bitter. Did the cook taste it before serving it? I think not!

Well, now I can say we tried the Three Little Griddles, and can also say, we will not be back."

I&#39;ve ordered biscuits and gravy on every visit so far because it&#39;s soooooooooooo perfect. I&#39;m a little B&amp;G dictator so I&#39;m absurdly impressed with the soft plush biscuits and the flavorful very meaty sausage filled gravy with a hint of spice!

Service has always been excellent, friendly and helpful and very great with all my special and weird requests! 

The home fries are delightfully crunchy and tender in just the right ways. 

Banana Pancake special was a mountain of scrumptious and my BF got some eggs bene that he raved about. Yum!

I stumbled across the three little griddles and I&#39;m so glad I stopped. The breakfast burrito was simply delicious. It is stuffed full of scrambled eggs Homestyle potatoes and a choice of bacon, chorizo or ham. I opted for the bacon and it added a nice crunch to the meal. The homestyle potatoes that inhabited this burrito had the skin on them that also had a nice crunch and texture. The burrito is smother with a pork green sauce that was extremely flavorful. The ambience is very pleasant and relaxing and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. I ordered this dish based on my service recommendation. The only reason why I did not give it five stars was that the burrito came a bit cold. It&#39;s a 78° day here and so I would not expect a less than piping hot dish. However, this aside I would completely without reservation recommend this restaurant to my friends and family. Should I find myself back in this neck of the woods I would certainly come back."

Of all the Breakfast places I have tried, so far, hands down, this is the best!  Normally I don&#39;t eat breakfast out because it is so bitterly disappointing.  When you cook really good food at home this is not an uncommon problem.  I can honestly say the breakfast here is BETTER than the breakfast at home,  especially since it&#39;s so enjoyable and I DIDN&#39;T have to cook it myself!!!!

I tried the Shrimp and Grits which is completely amazing!  The flavors literally explode into a well partnered dance party in your mouth.  Everything is so well seasoned and tasty that the moderate portion sizes are incredibly satisfying.  The shrimp is grilled to perfection.  It&#39;s  paired with this absolutely fabulous melt in you mouth pork belly which is made in house with an obvious dose of Culinary Love. A slice of roasted tomato and topped off with a Sunny Side Up egg.  I ordered my egg over easy, so that is what you will see in the picture.  And let me tell you about the foundation.  The grits are a light, fluffy, creamy, and wonderful little cloud of unexpected delightfulness.  I can&#39;t say enough about how delicious the food is. 

Also, since I sat at the counter and got to chat with the very engaging owner and her son, the genius responsible for the amazing Shrimp and Grits.  I got the opportunity to get some show stopping pictures of their other mouth watering offerings.  I&#39;m so happy that I caught their sign out of the corner of my eye and decided to turn around and try it out!  What a Happy Accidental find!  

I think I mislabeled the Club Sandwich as a Rueben and couldn&#39;t figure out how to edit the photo.  

Oh, I go also forgot to mention the very great service.  I was so wowed by the food, that it almost blinded me to the super people creating it.  If you want a fully great dining experience, stop in here.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.  You will probably find it to be better than you could imagine it even from the accolades of this review.

Best Breakfast find of my entire adult life! I seriously can&#39;t understand anything less that a 4 star review here.  Try this place!  If you&#39;re a fan of bold flavor marriages, you will LOVE this place!"

I came here with a girlfriend after our workout yesterday (mostly because the name of it is so adorable and got us curious). The staff here is very friendly, the atmosphere is really nice and it smelled great when we walked in.

The menu was not too overwhelming, a double sided page and they also had a separate one with specials (which looked tempting). I was aiming for something healthy, most items here are pretty standard breakfast things (lots of potatoes, toast, etc). I was tempted by the breakfast burrito but went for the cobb salad w/o olives which was outstanding! 

My girl and I also split a cinnamon roll with the cream cheese icing and I just about lost my mind it was so good and such a well deserved, awesome cheat after an intense workout.

The service was great throughout the meal, the food was great, atmosphere as well. Check it out if you are in the area."

I have no idea how the food is because we never got it. There were no less than 8 employees on the dining room floor of which maybe 2 were acting as servers another 2 as food runners and the last 4 were socializing and standing around. 

After a 20 minute wait to be seated we waited an additional 10 minutes to be greeted at our table. 

We ordered immediately (drinks and meals), and proceeded to watch 3 tables that had been sat after us get served. All the while our sever walked by repeatedly not noticing that our food hadn&#39;t been delivered. By the way, the 3 tables that did get served were also our server&#39;s tables so it should have occurred to him that something was wrong. 

Finally after waiting almost 20 minutes we asked where our food was and low and behold it got &#34;mixed up with another table&#34; the server then got ready to walk away. We stopped him and asked when our food would be ready his reply was &#34;how long can you wait? It&#39;ll be at least another 10 minutes.&#34;. We opted to leave and he walked away and came back with a bill for our drinks, but after seeing the scowl in our faces he chose not to charge us for the coffee and juice. He blandly apologized and offered nothing in return. 

So now I&#39;m annoyed with the awful service and still hungry and it&#39;s too late to get breakfast anywhere else so I&#39;m left supremely unsatisfied. I should have just gone to Snooze, it would have still been an hour wait but at least I would have gotten my food..."

This is a really great restaurant with unique, delicious food.  I started off with the lemon curd Ebelskivers (like little pancake holes with yummy fillings), and really enjoyed them.   Shared a breakfast burrito (Huge!) with my husband and it was very flavorful and filling.  Lots of pork and potatoes in there and not too spicy.  I really liked the first batch of Ebelskivers, so indulged and ordered some fudge ones to end the meal on a sweet note.  One of my other dining mates had the shrimp and grits and it looked amazing (it included a piece of pork belly) and want to try that next time.  The griddle cakes looked amazing too - the size of a plate!  The service was very good too.  I can&#39;t wait to come back here with the family for brunch"

The Savory Griddle Cake seems like a 24 inch pancake, a layer of vegetables followed by a layer of grated cheddar cheese. Sorry I did not take a picture. This thing is huge, could comfortably feed four. I could not eat the whole thing and took most of it home to enjoy for breakfast for the next two days. Reheats well in a frying pan over a low heat.

 Sometimes you just have to be bad; next time I am ordering the Three Meat Savory Griddle Cake. I think the juices from the meats and cheese would work well together...OR, do not know if they do this, but a Veggie and Three Meat &#34;Combination&#34; Savory Griddle Cake would be awesome!

Our waitress was the best. We had met a friend to catch up over a casual brunch. Our waitress came around the right amount, not a pest or neglected us, and she was not rushing us so she could turn the table. It was moderately busy morning meaning there were a few open tables so people did not have to wait to be seated."

This southeast side of town has been sorely lacking a good breakfast restaurant so I thought I would give this a try. Walked in about 10:30am on a Sunday (the busiest time). 

The decor has a modern vibe. It was packed, but they had plenty of staff and it looked like they had it under control. It also wasn&#39;t noisy with all those people, unlike OPH. I was absolutely DELIGHTED to find that they did not overlook including COUNTERS both front and back so that single diners like myself can find immediate seating. They also have a patio in the back so in summertime that will be terrific (and very popular).

The menu is simple and straightforward and has enough selections to suit any palate. They serve DazBog coffee which is great. I faced the kitchen so I saw most of the menu items coming out and everything looked and smelled terrific. I ordered the griddle cakes (short stack, as the regular order is massive)- still 3 cakes but smaller- and they were moist and fluffy. When I got my tab I was totally astounded at the price - an unbelievable value.

I routinely patronize the half-dozen or so great breakfast restaurants in downtown Chicago, and TLG fit right in to that type of experience, aka, they knocked it out of the park. I would like to tell you to NOT to go here because once the word really gets around it going to get packed. My suggestion? Start early; they open at 6AM.

Welcome to the neighborhood TLG!"

I live next door to this place and was walking by the other day and was ecstatic that they finally got a new restaurant in this strip. I moved a couple years ago and kept seeing a sign for a breakfast place that read &#34;coming soon&#34; - it never happened. This place gave no warning, just boom, popped up and did not disappoint for my first visit in. I was greeted by a friendly staff and waited on by Stephanie, who took the time to walk me through the menu giving me great recommendations. She&#39;s fantastic!  I had trouble deciding what I wanted because everything looked good. You could see customers heads turned every time food was being delivered to see what the next person had ordered. I ended up building my own omelet. I went with a veggie omelet but got a side of green chili with it also. It was delicious and definitely filling. I was really wanting the biscuits and gravy because they looked amazing and the sign out front said they are &#34;to die for&#34; - I believe it. The atmosphere is really nice, the place was packed but there wasn&#39;t a wait, I&#39;m sure once word gets out there will be a wait for sure. They open at 6 and have a special in the morning where you can get a bacon burrito and a cup of coffee to go for only $5, they also said it would be served in less than 5 minutes. Perfect way to start your morning before work. I definitely look forward to coming back - and hope they get a liquor license because.... what a perfect place for brunch!!"

This is the second location of TLG and by my estimate it is at least three times as big as the original location. This is a good thing (see paragraph 1). 

I love this place. I am no foodie, but I can tell you that the food here is outstanding both in presentation and - more importantly - taste. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and Three Little Griddles serves up some of the best around. 

I even learned today what an ebelskiver is. It&#39;s a round pancake ball (think donut hole) with different flavors cooked up into it.  We had the bacon and cheddar. If you didn&#39;t know what an ebelskiver was, don&#39;t feel so bad. My spellchecker apparently didn&#39;t know what it was either."

We ordered the Seasonal Ebelskivers, which were the highlight of the meal. When our food came out it was a bit underwhelming. The potatoes are cooked in a different style, not crunchy or cooked through and did not seem to be seasoned.

While the food lacked some seasoning it wasn&#39;t terrible, it was just meh. The seasonal options may be the way to go on this menu and don&#39;t prioritize ordering a dish that comes with potatoes (I may be the only person that does this). 

Service/Ebelskivers = 5 stars

Doesn&#39;t seem like it would that hard to get both flavors. 2) when our waitress brought our drinks my husband asked for cream for his coffee - SHE REACHED INTO HER PANTS POCKET AND PULLED OUT THE CREAMERS! Sorry but that was disgusting. Where are aprons with pockets or how about making 2 trips?  Now for the food review: Quiche was over cooked but otherwise would have been good.

We went around 9am on a Saturday morning and were sat right away. The wait for the first visit from the waitress wasn&#39;t long, and we placed our order for coffee. I will say that the coffee is good and hot (they serve Daz Bog coffee). However, both of us were in desperate need of a refill before the cinnamon roll we ordered to share came out. No such luck. Our waitress walked by several times, and even served the table next to us, without so much as a glance to see if we needed a refill and/or to check on how the cinnamon roll was (it was amazing, by the way - probably the only good thing we experienced). I flagged a gal down to ask for more coffee, and she then went to tell our waitress - not sure why she can&#39;t bring the carafe of coffee over, but whatever. Then it turns out a 3rd woman refills our coffee. Okay great - now breakfast has arrived. Quiche for me, breakfast burrito for my husband. The quiche was gorgeous, at least 3 inches tall and made with artichoke hearts and bacon. Sounds great right? Well, it might have been if it weren&#39;t lukewarm at best. I get that they make quiche ahead of time, but geez, when it gets re-heated before serving, make sure it&#39;s re-heated! The breakfast burrito was just so-so, according to the husband. The green chile on top was clearly from a can, and the sausage inside had way too much fennel - not the type of sausage flavor you expect in a breakfast burrito. Waitress never came back to see how everything was, only to deliver the check. Thank goodness we had enough cash on hand so we didn&#39;t have to wait for a credit card to be processed. We rarely tip less than 20% and this time only tipped 10%. We won&#39;t be going back."

I knew I had to give it a try that weekend. When we got there, the hostess said there would be a 45 minute wait - much to our surprise, we got seated within 20 minutes. This is where everything went downhill.

Our waitress didn&#39;t come over for about 10 minutes. When she did come over, my mom asked her if they had soy lattes. She mumbled something than ran away for another 5 minutes. When she came back, she asked if we wanted a drink. My mom reminded her that she had asked about soymilk already, &amp; she said, &#34;No, we don&#39;t have it. Just almond milk.&#34; So my mom said, okay, I&#39;ll order an almond milk latte. The waitress goes, &#34;Okay, so you want a skinny latte?&#34; My mom said no, almond milk, but the waitress insisted that it was called a skinny latte. When I ordered my latte, I asked if they had 2% milk (a lot of places only carry whole or skim). The look she gave me though... as if I had just asked an extremely offensive question, before she replied, &#34;Uhhhhhhh yeah&#34;. So she goes to put our drink order in. The barista comes to deliver them, &amp; she drops off my mom&#39;s latte, &#34;A skim latte?&#34; We had to correct her that we had ordered an almond milk one &amp; corrected the waitress, &amp; the barista was embarrassed &amp; apologized, then made a new one very promptly. She was great. The guests @ the table next to us laughed &amp; said, &#34;We heard you order the correct one three times&#34;. They were also having issues with the same waitress. She never apologized for the mix-up.

The food was marginal - nothing special. I also don&#39;t like how with their Ebelskivers (donut-like pastries), you can&#39;t order a combination of flavors like at some other restaurants. Food was much better than service, but my overall experience made me want to never come here again. There are much better breakfast places out there."

I work for the University of Denver&#39;s child development center, Fisher Early Learning Center, and I coordinate volunteers for a non-profit respite care program for children with special needs, called Night Owls. 

Every other month, DU Illegal Pete&#39;s provides my volunteers (usually between 15 and 30 adults) with a FREE dinner before they spend 4 hours playing hard with our Night Owls kids, ranging in age from infancy through 12 years. We serve children with special needs as well as their siblings. This is FREE respite care for parents and the only &#34;payment&#34; that the volunteers receive is a delicious dinner from Illegal Pete&#39;s, and other establishments. And IP doesn&#39;t hold back on the extras either! They are kind enough to include multiple meats, multiple types of tortillas and nachos, and every type of topping and salsa for our volunteers. Devin even gives my volunteers the delicious homemade cookies (which you have GOT to try). Our catering is always on time, hot, DELICIOUS, and either Devin or Brian (supercool bar manager) always help me out to my car with the bags. And there are a LOT of bags, feeding 30 people!

I say all this, because this stellar treatment is not compulsory. I spend an insane amount of time trying to coordinate with restaurants who are generous enough to help out on the months that Illegal Pete&#39;s does not cover. For some perspective, the manager of Noodles and Co. (across the street) recently booted the Night Owls respite care program from their donation cycle in favor of sororities, because they offer Noodles more of a &#34;kickback&#34; than they would receive for helping our nonprofit. 

Please support Illegal Pete&#39;s, because the world needs more managers like Devin Rombough, who help programs serving children with special needs not because of what they GET from it, but for what they know they can GIVE. Thank you, Devin. The Night Owls volunteers love you!"

The potato burrito I had from this location didn&#39;t have crispy, hot potatoes. Instead, they were on the soggier side and the burrito itself seemed to be lacking a bit of flavor. My mom got the fish burrito and it was very, very fishy. I wasn&#39;t a fan of that burrito.

I love illegal petes. Their queso is to die for. But, we all already knew that. 

Instead, I&#39;m writing today about their fish tacos because that was something that I never thought to order before. I always used to just get whatever I could ask for extra queso on. Sometimes even just chips. The queso is that good. 

But, their fish tacos are something else! It&#39;s my new go to for sure. They&#39;re delicious and light and awesome. The sauce that comes with it is great and overall they&#39;re a huge win. Not as amazing as Hole Mole&#39;s fish tacos, if I&#39;m being totally honest, but not everyone can make it all the way out to Long Beach just for tacos!

I came in last Thursday night and experienced some of the worst customer service ever. Everyone seemed very unorganized and confused, and the guy with the dreadlocks on the register was very rude and kept pointing and yelling at us as we tried to order the rest of our food. I understand this is a fast paced restaurant but the way he treated us made us very uncomfortable and unwanted. Probably going to drive the extra 5 minutes to the Broadway location from here on."

I went to college in Boulder where it started and I&#39;m happy to move to a place with the restaurant nearby.  The staff is friendly overall but I sometime it can feel too casual with a couple of them as if they don&#39;t really care to be there and would rather talk with fellow staff members than work.  The steak is generally over cooked at this location as well.  It&#39;s just not quite as good as the Boulder location on the hill.  That would be my only critiques.

Update:  I find myself having to go to further locations because this location is quite bland. A college friend came over and said the same thing which was funny since my wife and I just had this discussion 3 or 4 days prior.  The overall taste is there but not enough salt, cilantro, or lime to make the flavors pop."

They have greater variety, fresher ingredients, and better flavor than their larger chain competitor. The attached bar is not only an added bonus, but a reason to go by itself. I&#39;ve only ever had the margaritas; they are tasty, strong, and nicely priced at five dollars. The only thing this place falls short on is its operations during peak hours. The organization falls apart. I visited during  lunch hour and was met with a long line that didn&#39;t move very fast and more than half of their open tables covered in rice, veggies, and old straw wrappers.

The ambient noise from other customers chatting around the restaurant gives a really comforting and cool feel to the place. They are also open fairly late, which makes it a good late night spot for those past eight o&#39;clock cravings. I certainly appreciate the effort to utilize local sources for their food as well.

The DU location is pretty hopping!  You can oftentimes find live music here, which is pretty awesome.  The outdoor patio/bar is a cool bonus for the area.  My only complaint is that you can smoke out on the patio, which can be a bit overwhelming these days.

While the Broadway location calls my name more often, I&#39;m a fan of the DU Illegal Pete&#39;s!  It&#39;s got all the great food and drinks that we&#39;ve come to know them for with the cool atmosphere that I&#39;ve grown to love."

I&#39;ve had the Chicken Nachos and the Carnitas Burrito.  Both very good.  

The Chicken Nachos were loads better than Qdoba&#39;s pathetic attempt at Mexican food and one order is large enough to share.  

The Park Carnitas was also very tasty, but not sure if it was quite a good as Chipotle.  Oh worth note for Illegal Pete&#39;s though is that their Pico de Gallo is better than Chipotle, according to my husband who is a chef and can taste these subtle difference.

It is also interesting how they mix the burrito ingredients with a spoon before rolling.  A good technique if you don&#39;t know how to assemble the ingredients on the burrito, but I actually like my ingredients distinctly separate.  The mixing technique reminds me of a beautiful Thanksgiving plate that you mix all together.  It may still taste good, but its better to let ingredients stand on their own."

The difference here is the food is slightly better and the servers are more granola like. Other than than, slap a Chipotle sign on the roof and you wouldn&#39;t know the difference. 

For quick style Mexican there&#39;s nothing to complain about here, however. The meats/chicken/pork tastes fine and they aren&#39;t shy about proportions.

So when I saw that Google deals had a $10 deal for Illegal Pete&#39;s for only $5, I clicked buy without even looking up the place. Sometime with the word illegal in it had to satisfy right? 

Right.

Turns out this place is similar to Chipotle or Qdoba only they serve more hooch than the other two and have beer on tap. When going to these places I only get an entrée on it&#39;s own but since I had $10 to spend this time around I went big. I got the pork carnitas salad with a soda and chips to enjoy later and didn&#39;t even hit the $10 mark. The pork was absolutely terrific--tender, moist and full of flavor but my gripe was that the actual salad was little. They don&#39;t throw on the lettuce, tomato, onion and other veggies like that do elsewhere, it&#39;s already pre packaged and more along the lines of a side salad topped with meat, salsa, cheese and sour cream if your heart so desires.

The location is smack dab in the middle of DU so it was swarming with college kids which I can appreciate. I long for the days of it being socially acceptable to wear sweats, last nights makeup, down a burrito and talk about how hungover you are."

There was no sign or rope or cone or any indication that the area was closed. Rather than ask us and the other table there to relocate, they started spraying tables all around us with chemical cleaners and loudly stacking chairs near us. It was very rude and we were obviously being intentionally rushed out. Just as they started tossing mop water around the floor near us we decided we had to go. I called the store and tried to tell the manager what had happened but she seemed to have cared less. She said the area was closed even though there was no indication of that and made no apologies for our being treated so rudely and basically rushed out of the lunches we just paid for. I felt the staff was rude and handled the situation incorrectly, the manager was rude and handled the situation incorrectly, and I felt like my business isn&#39;t valued whatsoever.

Otherwise its basically the same assembly line concept and same ingredients to choose from.  You also get chips with your meal included.

I&#39;ve never been to Illegal Petes before, and everyone I &#39;ve spoken to has raved about the food. When asking what they best thing to get was, I was constantly told that everything on the menu is good. Today I ordered the Tacitos, and have to say I was pretty disspointed. It was just beef rolled up in a corn tortilla, deep fried, and served with a side of sour cream and salsa. The Tacito really didn&#39;t have much flavor and the beef was so dry I had to slather it sour cream to get it down.

Chipotle doesn&#39;t have queso - such a drawback! The pesto was a nice twist on an old favorite, and the fact that they premixed my ingredients together was awesome. The customer service was fantastic too - despite the line that never ends. The only negatives: they charge extra for topping on tacos that typically aren&#39;t included (like beans), and they aren&#39;t as generous with the toppings (sour cream and cheese) as Chipotle is.

This is defnitely not Mexican food, but neither is Chipotle, instead it&#39;s a just a good burrito joint. I haven&#39;t been to the bar here so I won&#39;t talk about the atmosphere at the bar but I like the fact i can sit down and enjoy my burrito while watching the game. I love hitting this place up after a basketball game as it is usually moderately busy with some players and fans mixed together enjoying burritos.

If you are looking for a Burrito skip Chipotle and head to IPs. 

UPDATE:

I&#39;ve been going to Illegal Pete&#39;s a lot more recently since they serve until Midnight every night and I must say the staff are excellent. It&#39;s one the biggest assets of this location is that the staff are always cool to talk to and make you want to be there. All of the staff seem to genuinely like their jobs and that&#39;s a plus for me whenever I&#39;m patronizing a restaurant or retail establishment."

The Good:
The selection! They have just about anything you could ask for. All kinds of burritos, tacos, and other Mexican items in between. There is beef, chicken, pork, veggies, potatoes, and even fish. They pretty much custom build your burrito right in front of your face, so there shouldn&#39;t be anything in there you don&#39;t like. I got the Big Potato Burrito, and filled it with guac, salsa, veggies (grilled red peppers and squash), and black beans. They also offer whole wheat tortillas if you want. The burritos are HUGE. Think of a huge burrito, and then think bigger. There are numerous selections of hot sauces to take to your table. Tabasco, Cholula, Jalapeno sauce, etc. I partook in generous amounts of Cholula. (See below)

On a side note, I didn&#39;t experience any of the bad attitude from the staff that some people have reported. They were really nice, and even joked around with us a little. They were all wearing gloves, and I didn&#39;t see any flies (as one review mentioned). No problems at all.

The Bad:
It is very, very crowded and it takes a while to get through the line. It&#39;s worth it, but it&#39;s not that quick. It can be a little confusing to place your order if you&#39;ve never been there. The menu doesn&#39;t really tell you exactly what comes with your item and what is extra. But just ask, and they&#39;ll tell you. My sister-in-law ordered the Fish Burrito, and she was disappointed that it was batter fried fish. She wasn&#39;t expecting that, and the menu doesn&#39;t indicate that the fish is fried. (They probably should just add a little note to the menu.)

The Ugly:
Nothing really ugly. It&#39;s a walk-up burrito place, so it&#39;s not a beautiful restaurant, but it&#39;s about average for a burrito place. 

Overall, I LOVE this place. I wanted to go back the next day, but due to the Cholula mentioned above, I thought I should probably hold off.

Next time I&#39;m in Denver, I&#39;m hitting up Illegal Pete&#39;s."

While it&#39;s true that you can walk outside of Illegal Pete&#39;s doors and find at least three very similar pseudo-Mexican food places within a one mile radius, I can&#39;t think of one that serves alcohol.  That is the motivating factor in their four star rating.

The half-inside, half-outside bar area with the so-cool-it-could-be-in-the-Highlands garage door design is the perfect place to grab a few drinks with friends. It is so easy to relax there because of the unpretentious vibe: a little bit of fast food, a little bit of college dive bar, but not a lot of snobbery.  

I love Illegal Pete&#39;s quesadillas.  They are always stuffed to the brim with chicken, black beans, and veggies.  I&#39;m on  a recent queso kick, too, mainly because of the delcious concoction they have at IP&#39;s. 

For what it is (a Mexican/fast food/local chain/bar) Illegal Pete&#39;s definitely deserves the four stars."

This has happened more then once to myself, a few friends and we saw it happen a few time to other guys at the place! Half the time the dude is outside smoking and not even watching the bar?!

I&#39;ve put up with crappy attitudes from the people on the line, at the register, and even at the bar.  I&#39;ve waited in long lines for a decent taco/burrito.  

But last night was the final straw.  

1. The line was so confusing, lazy, and mumbly it took three times the amount of time it normally takes to make my order.  I&#39;ll admit I was ordering a very &#39;complex&#39; order with 3 different items... Nachos/Steak Tacos/Chicken Salad.  I ignored the huff/puffs of having to make THREE items for one person - I ignored the dramatic walk over to the fridge with my pre-made salad in it.  I repeated my order three times for each person and even tried to be polite when they mumbled and I had to ask 2-3 times what they had asked me.  Believe me I was not being difficult - there was zero communication on the line and FINALLY when I got to the register the guy who had been there the entire time jumped ship and I had to wait yet again for another girl - who of course I had to repeat my order. 

This was a rare time that I ordered for myself and my spouse and took it home.  Now this the kicker right here....took a bite of the tacos/nachos... COLD.  I&#39;m talking was just in the fridge and then on your taco COLD not to mention the beans were not cooked at ALL. It was so disgusting and disappointing to bite into something you think is warm and cooked, to find it is frigid. So already irritated we ended up microwaving the ice cold items (I&#39;m seriously not kidding it was NOT room temp).  Finally and this was the nail in the coffin - the warmed up food literally smelt like DOG FOOD.  

Sorry Illegal Pete&#39;s - We&#39;re done. We&#39;re not wasting $20+ at your DU location anymore and you know what? We&#39;re not going to any of the locations despite the fact they don&#39;t &#39;suck it hard&#39; like your DU location does."

For some reason I had it in my head that this place was not good, poor quality, and too college for me.  Boy, was I wrong! Illegal Pete&#39;s was everything but that.  The quality of the food was fantastic.  They use eco-friendly pork and beef, but I still went all veg.  The college kids were defiantly out and about, but the crowd was quite varied, and we even sat in the bar area! We took advantage of the awesome, and extended happy hour.  Everything was so affordable too.  So I guess I&#39;ll admit, college joints aren&#39;t so bad after all!

So, for our food.  I had a veggie bowl.  The corn salsa, guac, and house hot sauce took this bowl to another level.  Everyone else enjoyed burritos-chicken, carnitas, and steak.  The meat was seasoned well and very tender.  There was no fatty gristle at all.  Even though I had beans, I still sampled everyone else&#39;s.  They even have whole wheat tortillas, now only if they had brown rice.  We all shared chips and queso, and none of us could stop eating it. 

The line moved quickly, and staff was very friendly and chatty as you moved down.

This location is perfect for me coming from DU and I always seem to score awesome rockstar parking right up front (must be a sign that this is the place I should be coming to more often). 

The food is also always great. If you&#39;re craving a burrito - the concept seems better than some other burrito places around where each bite is individualized to the filling inside of your burrito (I.E. a bite of rice, a bite of chicken, an entire bite of sour cream leaving you with that WTF feeling). Illegal Pete&#39;s mixes up their burrito filling so that each and every bite you take, leaves you with a consistent satisfaction in knowing you are not going to have any unexpected bite surprises.

If you are into cheese - they also have some of the best queso I have had. If I&#39;m in the mood for a burrito, my go-to lately has been the chicken queso on a wheat tortilla (gotta keep it healthy somehow). If you&#39;re into the healthier fare, the salads are also quite tasty and reasonable.

Another rad plus if you&#39;re down to get your drink on - is they have a bar in this location (I don&#39;t know about the other locations around town). This is a nice added touch if you want a good beer with your american-mexican fare.

UGH! And this past time I went in and actually thoroughly read the menu while I was in line waiting - I noticed that THEY HAVE BREAKFAST BURRITOS! I am quite stoked to be able to come back and check this place out as that is my best go-to breakfast food."

We were interested in checking out Illegal Pete&#39;s in the DU area because it&#39;s been under construction for what seemed like forever. They took over and completely remodeled the old Piccolos space. 

First for the good...The space is really open and clean. I like that the kitchen is completely visible. They have a great looking patio which will probably be well used during the summer months.

The ordering process is identical to their competition - pick your meal, then choose fillings, salsas, cheeses etc. The staff is very friendly and for a brand new place, very competent. Offering more of a dine-in restaurant atmosphere, Illegal Pete&#39;s has a great looking (full) bar (with good happy-hour specials) and separate seating areas. Lots of big flat panels each showing a different sporting event, or in our case (since we were there for lunch) a telenovela. Also, the Hot House xxxtra hot salsa is kick-ass and flavorful.

As for the rest...we ordered the Pork Carnitas Fajita burrito to split. I noticed immediately as my burrito was being constructed that my burrito &#34;architect&#34; was being pretty skimpy on the meat :-( The resulting bundle was smaller that what we usually get at Chipotle and Qdoba, and had much less meat. After cutting it in half, my first thought was that we might not have enough to eat - my husband opened his up and asked where the meat was hiding. Not a good sign.

As far as the rest of the ingredients, the roasted onions and green peppers had been cooked properly and had the right amount of smokiness. The rice - eh, totally flavorless and in my opinion a bit overcooked. The flour tortilla became dried out very quickly which leads me to assume that it wasn&#39;t very fresh to start. Note: I never notice this happening at Chipotle.

The most disappointing part of the meal was the side of guacamole which was smooth instead of chunky and tasted only slightly better than what you can get at Taco Bell. If they make their guac in-house, you couldn&#39;t prove it by me.

I want to like this place and I definitely plan on going back to try other items on the menu. 

Two and a half stars actually but I&#39;m more inclined to round down as the Yelp definition of 2 stars really fits - &#34;meh, I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34;

Hopefully we will have a better meal next time."

We had to flag down our server for everything.....to order, get our bill, pay, etc. If it was based off of this time alone I definitely wouldn&#39;t come back but since I&#39;ve been here for lunch I will stick to the that and hope service is more consistent then.

Btw, the tune poke and seaweed salad are excellent!"

It is next to the Trader Joes off University. The inside is very new and modern. The bathroom is so clean, fresh and decorated like a dream. I love the salt water fish tank, sushi bar and wine bar.

The food was super fresh. Ask for a picture menu for the rolls- it will solidify your choices. They brought out free rice and miso soup with our order. 

I also love that they are open for lunch on Sunday because a lot of places are not. The service was incredibly nice and attentive.

Can&#39;t wait to come back!"

Service was good, it wasn&#39;t too busy on a Friday night. 

We had the spicy ramen and ramen w soy broth. I thought the soy ramen was veggie since it was a vegetarian broth but it did come out with pork. No biggie I just didn&#39;t eat it, but it did seem like this was the veggie version w more vegetables than my bf&#39;s spicy version. 

We also had the Diablo roll it was very smooth and not fishy. Great roll! Mmm and how could I forget about the salad? Comes out in a cold bowl. Very refreshing. 

Perfect stop after a shopping trip to TJ Maxx."

We had no problem getting a table right away, but we suspect that will change once this place takes off.

We had the miso and shoyu ramen with pork and chicken. The flavors were very complex with the additions of bean sprouts, radish, seaweed and the like. The miso was very spicy, the shoyu was very smooth. Best ramen I&#39;ve had!

Try the matcha green tea fried ice cream for dessert."

The rolls tasted very generic with no character.  Sat up at the bar and our sushi chef didn&#39;t even say hi or crack a smile. I get it, you&#39;re working.  However we are bringing in business for you.  We also ordered the ahi poke which was served with onions but just set on the side, not mixed together.  I&#39;d give it a pass.  Service was slow and we were passed up many times.  On the plus side though, their udon is yummy.  They greet you when you walk in and thank you for your business when you leave.  Other than that the neon lights inside are too distracting for me.  Definitely not my preference and I&#39;ll opt to go somewhere else next time."

My daughters chicken fried rice was good.

The $28 sushi &amp; sashimi special consists of only few pieces of raw fish and they were tasteless. The sushi was just tad bit better than what you get from any cheap Chinese buffet places. The $13 Tonkotsu ramen didn&#39;t even come with an egg. The soup tasted somewhat better than instant noodles.

All in all the quality of the food does not justify the price they asked for. If this restaurant was in some middle-of-nowhere I&#39;d have let it slip. The one star was given to the semi-attentive waitstaff."

We checked out Menya soon after it opened and it has become our go-to sushi bar. We try to go at least every few weeks and had such a great experience there tonight, that it prompted me to sign up and write my first review. 

Our first time there, we sat at the bar and struck up a conversation with sushi chef Luis, who is very friendly, and since then, he&#39;s gotten to know us and would serve us surprise dishes! Chef Mune-san is also very approachable and his simple saba is the best! He even tried to get me some of my favorite kohada :) 

Tonight we had omakase and Luis served us some delicious nigiri, but before that he started us off with a crazy-good dish of roasted tomato and lightly grilled salmon sashimi with a simple sauce to congratulate us on our recent nuptials. In a prior visit Mune-san made a special dish for us that had toro wrapped in salmon - it was awesome! 

The sushi - both the simple and the creative - is good, but what makes this place great are Luis and Mune-san. Sit at the bar and get to know them. They&#39;ll get to know you, and come up with some delicious dishes just for you!"

First the restaurant is really bright. It has this bright LED artistic lighting that makes me feel like I am in a fast food restaurant. The service was odd. I asked our server what special rolls were the best. I was told &#34;that&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t know.&#34; I was told that there were some new chefs specials on the door. I was advised to get up, leave the restaurant, go outside to see what they were on the outside of the door. I never have had to do that before and at that moment they lost me. We ordered about $80 of sushi rolls. One was omitted but quickly made so it wasn&#39;t a problem. The sushi was good. I could have used about ten more creative rolls to choose from on the menu but we had no complaints. The special rolls were actually bigger than I&#39;m used to so we had extra to take home. My wife liked the Kim Crawford wine. But the lighting and service was a huge turn off for me."

Decent size bowl and good amount of extras but the broth was lacking so much flavor! Bland, taste. The texture is nice but the overall taste is not right at all! I suppose having  lived in Los Angeles where little Tokyo has amazing ramen.

I usually get the Bushwhacker which is a curried chicken salad in a wrap but I ordered the Pilgrim last week and won&#39;t be ordering anything else from now on.  I tried the potato salad but it was so horribly under seasoned that I just set it aside.  

Imagine this- a toasted French baguette slices and topped with a thin layer of mayo, muenster cheese, warm thinly sliced turkey, a layer of sweet and tangy cranberry chutney and a salty layer of stuffing all in one bite.  It&#39;s heaven on a sandwich and it will make your day, night, week, month once you&#39;ve had it.  Pair it with an icy glass of San Pellengrino Grapefruit and call it a day!"

I will say that I was reached out to and that made a great difference. I was offered an option to try them again for free but I don&#39;t want to take away from a business. I understand that sometimes there are just bad experiences and truly I think this may have just been one of those days. 

Flash forward to today. I needed lunch. I didn&#39;t want all the crap that sits around us...Wendy&#39;s, Taco Bell, McDonalds. So I ordered Backcountry again. This time I went with the Pilgrim which is roasted turkey, muenster, seasoned stuffing, cranberry chutney, romaine lettuce, mayo. Can you say EPIC??? I knew you could ;)

Seriously, this sandwich took me to Thanksgiving. You know, the day after when you&#39;re a tad bit hungover from all the weird family stuff? You grab a roll, smash the fixins in there and sit on the couch watching reruns of I Love Lucy. So to this I say, THANK YOU BACKCOUNTRY! You&#39;ve brought it back for me and I truly appreciate it.

Here they don&#39;t look at you like you have three heads when mentioning your dietary restrictions. 

The staff is super friendly and the vibe hipster with the Black Keys playing in the back ground. While there&#39;s lots of meats and cheeses, they do have veg options. 

The Sherpa sandwich was prepared to order and arrived hot and crispy. Tender roast eggplant, portabella, red peppers, tomato and garlic mayo. Yum! Seriously, this may be the best sandwich I&#39;ve had. $10 isn&#39;t cheap for lunch without any sides, but the quality of it was worth it."

I went at about 7pm on a Monday and I really wanted to try the soup but they were already completely out which was kind of disappointing, so with that I had to change up my whole order. 

Instead of half soup half sandwich I went with the Cuban and an order of potato salad.   

The Cuban was delicious. It had the right amount only ham, pulled pork and a pepper mix which was outstanding. The potato salad was good and refreshing. 

It did take about 15mins to get our food which I thought was a little long since there was no other orders in front of ours but that wont discourage me to come back."

Decor is modern and well down. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Not sure what you want? Ask the staff for a recommendation and they will build you an amazing sandwich. Both my wife and I loved what we got, and even our kids why we have to usually force to eat had their fill. 

Very happy to have them moved in. They&#39;ll be a staple of our diet soon."

The female (manager? who always works in the morning and knows my husband by name) is great! She always makes the best breakfast and super fast! I like the quality of ingredients.

There was plenty of seating at the bar and booths.  I like the exposed brick and the graffitied walls! We arrived just in time for happy hour which was a great start to our meal.

FOOD: assortment of Asian street food from chicken skewers, Thai fried rice, tofu to curry.  The seafood fried rice with Thai basil was spot on!  You can really taste the fish sauce and fresh basil in there - love it!  The coconut curry was equally yummy with satisfying creaminess and it came with fragrant jasmine rice!  The chicken skewers were a bit too salty with the sauce.

DECOR:  very cool, modern decor reflecting the street style.  The presentation of food was very clever!  The coconut curry came in two aluminum bowls stacked up which reminded me of what we used in China.  The colorful chopsticks was also a refreshing touch!

SERVICE: our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  She check on us multiple times throughout our meal and even reminded us to order before HH ends!  

VERDICT: I really enjoyed my first meal at this cool spot on Broadway after wanting to try it for a long time.  The food was great but it&#39;s not particularly the most authentic...more of an Asian fusion twist on traditional food.  All in all, this is a solid option for a causal meal!"

Called at 8:15p to confirm they take carry out orders.  The gentleman that answered the phone confirmed that they did.  We said we would look at the menu and call right back with our order.  &#34;Right on&#34; he says.  Call back 5 minutes later and he says the kitchen is about to close and they can&#39;t take our order.  Couldn&#39;t have mentioned that 5 minutes ago?  Called back after it sunk in and asked for manager.....who was the same guy we spoke with.  No contrition.  Just a casual, yeah we are open until but we are closing the kitchen early sorry and have a good night.

No wonder they were closing early on a Sunday night (which is arguably the busiest night of the week for Chinese/Thai)....because their manager is garbage and biz is clearly struggling.

We&#39;ve been in before and the food is meh.  Couple decent dishes, but there is much better Thai out there and there is sure as heck better management."

The food was somewhat interesting but not as flavorful as the description made it sound. The price-point was good, i didn&#39;t feel overcharged. 
The worst part was the noise level. Yes, it&#39;s on Broadway but making the music louder to drown out the street noise just makes everyone yell louder.

Cho 77 has a lot going for it: good ambience, the clever little napkin- and chopstick-holder contraptions on the tables. I also like the bar menu, particularly the sake selection. I just think the food leaves something to be desired. It&#39;s what I would consider &#34;pretty good,&#34; but I think it is simply misrepresented as &#34;Asian street food.&#34; And I think it is overpriced for what it is. Why order expensive curries, pad see ew or pho with Americanized, middle-of-the-road flavors when you can get GREAT, authentic Thai and Vietnamese food nearby for far less? 
I leave Cho 77 with a bad taste in my mouth: the taste of having paid for a scene, or a concept, rather than food. It&#39;s too fussily focused on being hip, and the food just isn&#39;t good enough to make it worth it."

My husband and I stopped in on a Saturday about 1 in the afternoon and found the whole place to ourselves.  Our service was incredible and I think even if we hadn&#39;t been the only ones, it still would have been spot on.

I opted for the Pad see ew which is among my favorite noodle dishes.  Plus the description of house made rice noodles sealed the deal.  I found the veggies to be crisp and fresh, the egg wonderfully cooked and the noodles.  Oh the delight of home made rice noodles.  Chewy but soft, they were my first foray into my new love of fresh rice noodles.

The hubs went with the won ton noodles.  The fatty yet succulent pork belly cubes were the highlight of the dish with a second going to the &#34;pork tea&#34; that came on the side.  He was a happy man.

The waitress mentioned she really liked the coconut mango sticky rice dessert so I took her suggestion.  It was a combination of sweet and slightly tart with the mango.  Absolutely incredible and I literally scraped every last grain of rice out of the bowl.  Heavenly."

Most Asian fusion restaurants try too hard to be different, resulting in authentic traditional dishes being demoted to a confused dish at best.  What&#39;s different about Cho77 is that they throw a twist on traditional dishes without completely altering the dish to an unrecognizable and complicated meal.  I&#39;ve dined here a couple of times, each time resulting in a pleasant experience.

We&#39;ve tried numerous items on the menu including: Grilled Chicken Wings, &#34;Bao Mi&#34; Buns, Colorado Wagyu Satays, Burmese Pork Curry, Colorado Wagyu Pho, Thai Coconut Curry and Chicken Curry.  One of my favorites were the chicken wings, just love the flavor and their amazing plumpness, moist and tender throughout.  The preparation of the Thai Coconut Curry was a nice twist, served with egg noodles, departing from the traditional over rice preparation.  The curry was sublime with a very creamy and silky texture.  I can confidently say that most of the items I&#39;ve tried were quite tasty, and really came down to what I was craving that night.

The restaurant was spot on, the service, food and decor were all above the norm.  The staff was exceptional and more than accommodated us.  This place is adventurous with a great twist on the usual Asian recipes, and may not be a place for who are rigid on the traditional preparations.  I appreciate both styles, so this place offers a break for me from the usual authentically prepared cuisines."

My friends and I stumbled upon this restaurant while we are actually looking for another restaurant a few doors down. When we passed this restaurant the vibe and open window intrigued us and we wanted to check this place out instead!

Now granted it was a Saturday night and of course there is a wait time. We were given a 30 minute wait time and ended up waiting about 40 minutes. The restaurant is small and chic but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend this restaurant for a large group at least not on the weekend. 

 The menu is quite small so there is not a large selection but  I had the pad thai noodles dish and I LOVED IT! It was pretty great! If you like a lot of variety on your dishes, then this may not be the place but everything they do have is pretty good and smelled good!"

It&#39;s hip and trendy. That pretty face can back it up with some serious innovative and superb dishes. I read about their Pork Curry. Being a fan of Burmese or Vietnamese anything really got me all excited! 

One thing about dining out a lot you learn that sometimes what is bought to you table is at times alarming. Take this instance. I was a bit worried when my Pork curry came out. It was the obvious watery sauce that worried me. But oh my. No way this dish disappointed me at all. The pork meat was truly tender. The sauce was a nice blend of just enough curry and something else. Partnered with just plain &#39;ol rice. The best way. Then you can truly savor every bit of the curry.

Adam&#39;s Curry Chicken that I managed to have some was a uniquely served dish. It was served with noodles instead of rice. On the side was a small bowl of crispy noodles and some greens. To supplement the noodles that&#39;s already in the bowl. Just pure heaven!

The small table is set up so you have all your utensils really in front of you. It&#39;s a bunch of colorful chopsticks! I adore that part! I like some colors in my sticks! Try using two different colors. Your life doesn&#39;t always need to match. Live a little!:)

One thing was weak. Their cocktail. I had the Crouching Tiger. I&#39;ll skip this next time. 

Get their fried chicken. This is truly one of the best! Flavorful and finger licking good! 

The standout for me that night was their Wagyu Satay! Flavorful, juicy and tender! But also consider that I&#39;m true carnivore that puts red meat above all! But you don&#39;t need the peanut butter sauce that came with it. Alone in this instance is great!!

Fast service. Accommodating staff. You can dine in the bar if you&#39;re alone. Or dine at the bar and watch the action. That would be me next!"

Started with a yummy coconut ice green tea, my daughter had a fruity ice drink, both great. I had 4 by the way. Then my entree of a Thai coconut curry came and I was in heaven, just the right spice with my choice sides to add in. I loved the extra sauces that sit at the table to make each bite unique. My daughter had the wide Thai noodle, homemade that was not spicy to her liking. We ate it up, nearly licking the bowls. For dessert, we shared a hazelnut mousse, I would have given them a 5 star, but the mousse was frozen and very very hard to cut. Highly recommend, but park a few blocks away to avoid meters."

After not being helped at all at the bar, I asked advised a waitress that no one had helped us, so she helped us immediately. We ordered drinks from her and proceeded to wait.

Immediately thereafter another waitress walked up to serve us, but we advised her we had been helped -- she ended up taking over the order, then we waited even longer for our drinks even though we didn&#39;t see the bartender making drinks -- I asked our original server and the drinks came immediately thereafter.

While sipping our drinks, I noticed a dish that looked tasty, so I asked the manager (who was expediting orders) to describe the dish -- so I immediately ordered the same thing (so I thought) --and a completely different entree came out.... along with our appetizer.

I told the manager that wasn&#39;t what we thought we ordered, and he said he&#39;d be happy to get me another dish if I didn&#39;t like our surprise dish -- which turned out to be delicious -- but we were also warned at about the same time the kitchen was closing (9pm).

Also when our food was served, I proceeded to burn my tongue on the hot appetizer then reacted by quickly dropping the food to a napkin -- followed immediately by the manager noticing our situation and stating, &#34;oh sorry, forgot to share with you the plates, napkins and additional condiments are right here&#34; -- right in front of us, but we were new and didn&#39;t know. 

So I feel we just got the end-of-night service with everyone just wanting to go home -- everyone was generally kind, but not the best first impression."

I&#39;ve been here a few times and my favorite appetizer is the bao mi buns. The crispy and rich pork belly goes well with the pickles. They come two to an order. It would be a great travesty to not at least order one per person at your table.

There&#39;s only one way to follow up a great pork belly app... and that&#39;s to have a pork belly entrée. For $14 you get plenty of the delicious pork belly and wonton noodles. The bok choy is cooked tender and well but let&#39;s be honest, the pork belly and noodles are the stars of the dish. If this dish were the Manning brothers, the pork belly and wonton noodles would be Eli and Peyton and then bok choy would be Cooper Manning.

To top it off, you can get one of their 1.75 L bottles of sake for only $30 which is plenty for a table of 4."

If Cho77 was presented to me as an upscale, trendy, &#34;Americanized&#34; Asain restaurant I would be giving it 4 stars, but it has been publicized as an Asain street food inspired gem, and I did not find it to be that. Cho77 is definitely trendy and &#34;hip.&#34; The menu is simple and straight forward, and the dishes deliver good flavor, BUT...is it worth paying $20+ per person? No. I have heard so much surrounding Cho77&#39;s focus on Asain street food, so I was rather shell-shocked when I sat down and saw the menu prices. Considering Asain street food&#39;s two main concepts: quick &amp; cheap, Cho77 is neither. 

We ordered &#34;Boa Mi&#34; buns as a starter, and we were delivered 2 small buns. As an $8 starter, I paid $4 to eat 1 bun! Not what I was expecting. I ordered Thai Chicken Curry as my main dish. Again the flavors were good, but it is nearly identical to panang curry (but without rice), but it cost twice as much as many of our authentic local Thai shops, and you are given half as much.

Truthfully, the food is good, but I feel as if Cho77 used the gimmick of Asain street food to overcharge."

Cho77 is everything asian fushion should be but never is. Hands down the best restaurant we visited on a week-long trip to Denver. Can&#39;t recommend it enough.

We came in at about 730 on a Sunday and sat at the bar with no wait. I had a Singapore Spritzer, which is a very convincing looking faux cocktail for the nondrinkers and DDs. He had the pulled tea, expertly crafted by the very kind bartender other reviewers have mentioned, which was very good with an interesting flavor.

Appetizers: The frog legs are tender and very salty, but the stand out of this dish is the sauce, which I could&#39;ve eaten straight. The pork buns are good, but the veggies overwhelm the meat a little bit.

Entrees: Personally I&#39;d suggest just going right to these.  We&#39;re from NYC and we eat A LOT of curry. But the Thai coconut curry is the best we&#39;ve ever had. One bite into his dish my boyfriend announced that we were coming back for dinner tomorrow to eat more curry. I had the wonton noodles, which is a well thought out dish. The bok choy is a nice balance to the noodles, which have a nice bite, and the main event that is the perfectly carmalized and tender pork belly. The broth &#34;tea&#34; and dumplings are a nice touch. Both of these dishes are well worth having. 

Dessert: We opted for the sticky rice on the bartender&#39;s suggestion. The pairing of the rice with the mango sorbet/ice cream is flawless. My partner doesn&#39;t even like sticky rice and he was devouring it right along with me. 

The staff was knowledgeable and kind and the ambience was trendy but chill and welcoming. We weren&#39;t rushed out at close, with kitchen last call happening 15 minutes beforehand."

The drink specials are better. I had fun trying a sake bomb for the first time. The bao buns were nice and sticky and had a good amount of pork belly. The coconut curry chicken was delicious, perfect, and the favorite at the table. The ginger beef dish was also excellent. The portions are on the smaller side if you are sharing with a group. One thing that happened, and I&#39;m posting this to see if it happened to anyone else, was that the credit card we used here was used the next day for fraudulent purposes.

I&#39;ve never had an app I didn&#39;t like.  We just had ceviche for the first time last night, it was added to the menu the day before.  I thought it was great but my fiancé didn&#39;t care for it as much as it&#39;s not traditional ceviche.  We&#39;ve had dumplings, frog legs, steamed buns, basically everything is good.  For the main course I always have the coconut curry chicken, it&#39;s always so good so I never want to try anything else.  My fiancé is a bit more adventurous and tends to have mixed reviews of the other entrees.  

The thing is that every time we get the check I am blown away by how much we ended up spending.  I should know better now but it just seems to be a bit over-priced in my opinion."

Kale Salad - whoa!  This was my first venture into this trendy new leafy green and was not disappointed.  A huge crisp salad with a slightly sweet dressing and cashews.  Awesome.

Pork Belly Buns with sriracha mayo and pickles - whoa again, these were great. Pork belly is hit or miss with me, and if done incorrectly, is really off-putting, but these were great. Soft fresh bun and perfectly tender pork belly with an offset of crunch with the pickles

Red chile pork dumplings - these were also amazing.  Sitting in a chili soy sauce, they were a bit spicy with a hint of vinegar.

Based on the reviews, it seems they switch their menu items up a bit so can&#39;t wait to return to try the frog legs and some of their other items.

They had a great happy hour going as well from 5pm to 6pm.  Give it a try!"

We came while it was still happy hour which offers up some decently discounted drinks (think $3 drafts, $5 house wines, $4 wells, and for those making a night of it, $1 sake shots and $3 sake bombs) and $2 off shared plates.

We shared the Wagyu beef satays which were decent but nothing special. We settled on the Thai coconut curry and the Burmese pork curry. Both were beautifully and playfully presented and could easily be doctored up by the four accompanying table condiments. Both were good mind you, but nothing you couldn&#39;t get or taste at other Asian restaurants around town. Considering the heftier price tag relative to those other Asian joints, we were expecting more of a punch in originality or flavor. I guess the hip sobo location and ambiance are what warrant the extra few bucks per plate. 

All in all, we enjoyed our meal that night and my fiance enjoyed a brunch a few weeks back when they were still serving brunch. We aren&#39;t opposed to returning, however, we didn&#39;t find a need to rush back or become a regular."

By the papaya salad I was beaming and by my second bite of scallop ceviche I was in full swoon. That food lust was only further fired up by the curry chicken, served alongside some damn-addictive pickled mustard greens (I asked for seconds). 

My friend&#39;s Singapore noodles I found a little too salty/earthy/one-noted and my Hanoi Night cocktail was bitter. But the servers solicited feedback which I appreciate muchly. My guess is that after opening week, these mild kinks will be ironed out.

The interior is contemporary and warm, offering either long communal bar-height table seating or more private booth/chair tables. The kitchen is half open so its fun to witness the whirring energy of the staff. 

It&#39;ll be interesting to see where the pendulum of diner-identity will swing - so far it seems to be less of a South Broadway rocker/hipster crowd and a little more of a slightly older, uptown crowd. But we more rough-around-the-edges types can still be seen grabbing a drink at the bar - I hope this doesn&#39;t disappear.

Food is legit. Prices are reasonable - the meals eat as fine dining. And the kitchen and front of house crew really cares. Can&#39;t wait to come back."

We had a lovely Sunday night dinner here and enjoyed the ambiance (urban cool with nods to Vietnamese culture), the service (fast, friendly, knowledgeable) and the food.

We split the Grilled Peach &amp; Baby Lettuce Salad to start. The  Kaffir Lime Vinaigrette was a nice contrast with the sweeter elements of the salad and left us wanting more!

I had the Sichuan Beef LoMein. It had a rich, meaty flavor and noodles for days. Between my dining companion and I, there wasn&#39;t much left. It was a fairly simple and straightforward dish, but the watermelon gave it just enough flair to make it unique.

The only warning I will issue is that the food was VERY salty. Definitely woke up in the middle of the night thirsty and had had several glasses of water at Cho.

My husband and I have been twice now and the first time we went (on a Saturday around 3:00pm), our waiter was friendly and inviting and he went out of his way to make recommendations and let us know about the happy hour menu. We enjoyed several of the shared plates and a couple of happy hour cocktails and noted that we would definitely be back in the future to try more. 

We went again yesterday- around the same time- and decided to try 2 main dishes and split a shared plate. He had the pad thai and I had the curry chicken and we split the pork buns. The pork belly on the buns was slightly undercooked making it a little on the chewy side and the chicken curry was very, very light on chicken; maybe 2-3 small chunks of chicken in the whole dish. Also, the &#34;curry&#34; tasted so much more like tom kha gai than curry- which was very surprising to the palette. It was thin, like soup, and definitely not worth $14. If it had been a starter for $4 or $5, no problem, but for $14...I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. My husband said his pad thai was good but not great.

Then the bill came and I noticed we were charged full price for the shared plate, which should have been $2 off, and charged $4 for an iced tea. Let me say that again- a glass of plain (rather weak) iced tea was billed at $4. Next time I guess I&#39;ll check the menu for the price before I order- but come on- Starbucks doesn&#39;t even charge that much! I think Cho77 needs to stop acting like it&#39;s an Asian street food restaurant and just admit that it&#39;s a trendy Americanized Asian food joint that comes with a hefty price tag."

The dumplings were good, but the steamed buns -- my god, the steamed buns -- I never imagined that a steamed bun was capable of such heights.  Whatever elixir they put into the pork served on those buns is touched by angels.  We finished with the Thai coconut curry which, as noted elsewhere, is in a special class its own.

Situated at the bar we had a blast watching the very busy chefs and bartenders craft some cocktails and noodle after noodle dish, which by the way - were delicious. 

Kicking off the meal with glazed potstickers with water chestnut and yummy pork, we were even more excited for what was to come. Deciding to order two different things in order to get a good range if the menu - I went with the Kobe meatball soup and the hubs went with the pork belly stir fried noodles. The pork belly noodles were by far the favorite, though the noodle soup rich with star anise/Chinese five spice flavoring, the crispy pork belly and perfectly spiced noodle dish couldn&#39;t be denied.

First, if you&#39;re not interested in noodles, I think there was one main course that was not noodle-centric. The one I remember was $27. So we split some share plates, which should be noted are quite small.

The pork dumplings were the only bad dumplings I think I have ever had. Seriously, you can do better at the cafeteria of any Korean grocery store in the US for $2. Drowned in soy, they were inedibly salty. And at $8, overpriced. The $10 papaya salad was similarly misjudged; leaving aside the poorly balanced plants, the saccharine, syrupy tamarind dressing was overpowering and bad. And it was overpriced. The vegetable samosas were decent enough (although I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just relative to everything else.) But they were overpriced.

So what are we giving stars for? Good question. The drink menu was pretty good and had some inspired picks for things that come in bottles. (Yep. Overpriced. Noticing a trend?) But the ($9 I think) cocktails were more promising on paper than in execution. I would skip them. The atmosphere was okay and the service was friendly.

Check out the plethora of less bourgie Thai, Chinese, and Japanese food on and around Broadway. Your palate and wallet will thank you in equal measure. If you want tasty food from this region, head over to Federal where food that&#39;s three times as good costs a third as much. I have to admit we probably won&#39;t be back."

The location is cool as Broadway in general is becoming awesome with all the new shops and restaurants. When we got here we ordered two rounds of sake bombs. It was happy hour for $3! For apps we ordered the Peking duck buns and pork dumplings. Surprisingly I enjoyed the dumplings better. They where both tasty. For the main dish I had the pork wonton, it was really good. My only complaint was that the prices where a little steep for what it was, but if you come here at happy hour it&#39;s great."

cho77-denver,Cyn C.,ws7odoSagwni-BlTtCmmmA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,134,27,8sG8ab0B-iLuYUx4NYlTrA,4.0,2015-03-31,"Ok, y&#39;all. Take a look at my picture. I&#39;m Chinese/Taiwanese by descent, and I love love love me some asian food. Which is why I&#39;ve stayed away from ChoLon. I AM NOT A FAN OF ASIAN FUSION.

But I was invited to try this new place out by a dear friend. We met up at Cho77 on their opening day. I was prepared for some kinks in service and execution. Nope. Most everything was prepared flawlessly and the service was impeccable.

We sat at the chef&#39;s table (the end of the bar). The other place I&#39;d love to sit is at the bar at the front door (an intimate little nook with a garage style window that would facilitate prime time people watching). Chef Lon was warm and welcoming. My friend and I were drooling over all the descriptions of the food, and to appease our appetites, we decided to try EVERY SINGLE &#34;share&#34; dish. 

Roti pizza with lamb bacon and a fried egg. GET IT. Drizzle hot sauce (b/c it&#39;s a fried runny egg, duh). Eat it quickly before the egg yolk cooks more. Nom nom nommy. I guess I&#39;m not too picky about East Indian fusion food, because I loved this one.

Scallop ceviche with keffir lime and coconut foam in a sesame bowl. A perfect bite. 

Spicy pork dumplings. These were more complex than your typical chinese dim sum pork dumpling. I should&#39;ve put a bit of vinegar on them to really bring out the flavors.

Veggie Samosas. There is parsley/cilantro in the potato filling and in the yogurt chutney. They were delicately fried and not greasy, but I can&#39;t be a very good judge since the parsley/cilantro makes it difficult for me to taste anything.

Green papaya salad. This poor dish suffered b/c it was served last. I was full. However, it did brighten and freshen my palate. The roasted cashews give it a delightful crunch and I love me some long beans. 

Then we shared the kaya ice cream sandwich. Kind of like a ice cream cookie sandwich. Coconut ice cream sandwiched between two almond cookies, then rolled in toasted coconut. Cut into four pieces to make it easy to share. mmmm, yes. Be rude to your dining companions and dig in before it softens and melts. Trust the voice of experience that you do not want all your toasted coconut shavings to drip off your delicious ice cream sandwich. That would be sadness (uh... yes, that was me licking the back of my hand as ice cream and coconut shavings dripped onto my hand.) We were also treated to the chocolate sticky rice pudding. I think maybe a drizzle of salted caramel would&#39;ve helped this one compete better with the kaya ice cream sandwich. Again, it probably suffered by comparison AND b/c it was brought out last.

I can&#39;t wait for a nice cold day so I can come back for some noodle soups or some of the wok dishes. The scallop one looked/smelled fantastic. 

Oh! The cucumber spritz and the singapore spritz (with pineapple) were both refreshing. The pineapple was a bit sweeter with a hint of spice. I wonder if the bartender would add a splash of vodka to these to make them into a cocktail?"

Turns out the apple does not fall far from the tree. Cho77 resides in a very hipster part of Denver and its food seems too focused on upholding a trendy reputation of &#34;Asian fusion&#34;. 

We had 5 dishes on on our visit: roti pizza, pork dumplings, buffalo chicken baos, the coconut curry, and the wonton noodles. The pizza seemed drenched in olive oil and tasted like it belonged in an Italian restaurant. Pork dumplings looked great but flavor was underwhelming. You can find better dumplings at dim sum restaurants for half the price. The baos tasted like buffalo chicken...nothing special.

I was most excited for the curry, but once again did have the mind blowing flavor in was expecting. I would&#39;ve appreciated a little more spice as is traditional with most Thai food. And for the price I could&#39;ve had 2 orders of curry at my favorite Thai place in Boulder. The noodles were by far my favorite dish that had a light sauce and some BBQ pork belly cooked very nicely.. But who doesn&#39;t like pork belly, right?

For me, the price point is hard to justify with mediocre food. I have other go to places for Asian and Asian fusion cravings."

The bao buns are good. Have gotten ramen and the flavor just isn&#39;t amazing. I feel like if the vibe he wanted was true Thai street food, he failed on that.

Went for an early dinner/HH tonight - second night they are open.

Place is really cute and the staff is über friendly.  Lon was there keeping an eye on things and they certainly had plenty of staff.  We had almost more attention than we needed sitting at the &#34;chefs table&#34; end of the bar - but, that&#39;s where the action is.  It is also where the exhaust hoods are and I reek of grease and my friend was uncomfortably warm.  I just got back from Mexico so everything feels cool to me - lol.  Also, there was a young woman &#34;training&#34; the staff behind the line and Lon was watching every move and dish and making corrections from the service window directly to our left.  The line staff was clearly sweating bullets and it was slightly disconcerting to watch.  I&#39;d take a pass on the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; end of the bar for a while.

HH is no big whoop - $2 off some pretty pricey cocktails ($10ish) and nothing off food is a non-starter in this neighborhood.  We both had the Drunken Monk to start with (Leopold&#39;s Gin, mint, kaffir line, grapefruit, and rice beer) - best cocktail I&#39;ve had in a very long time ($10 though - $2 off for HH).  Friend changed to the Hanoi Night Train for the second round (Vodka, Thai Chili and Ginger - $9) - tasted it didn&#39;t care for it and he went back to the Drunken Monk.  I think Lon has really missed the boat on HH.  There are a dozen places with much better deals close by.  Even Luca (which has been seriously spendy since opening) has come to the party and started an aggressively priced HH.  Shoot even the egregiously expensive Sushi Den does better than this.

Food.  Shared the Green Papaya Salad - incredible - words cannot express how delicious this is.  The charred long beans really make the dish.  $10.  Also, shared the Red Chili Pork Dumplings, Crispy Shallot, Chinese vinegar, soy - $8.  Meh.  Nothing wrong with them but not terribly exciting.  There is a caddy in front of you with several seasoning options - spicy vinegar, hot sauce, etc.  My advice is to use them because most dishes lack &#34;punch&#34;- IMO.

Big dishes (not huge by any means):   He had the Wonton Noodles, BBQ Pork Belly, Bok Choy and Pork Bone &#34;Tea&#34; ($14) - OK - best of the ones we tried.  I started with the Singapore Noodles, Mushroom Gravy, Fiddlehead Ferns, and Tofu Cracklings.  ($13).  I found all of the Wok dishes to be pretty bland and greasy even after applying the accoutrements provided.  Told our very inquisitive server that I wasn&#39;t thrilled and she brought me the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Ramen, Miso Bacon, Poached Egg and Parmesan Broth( $14.)  It was certainly lighter and less greasy but still pretty bland and charged me for both dishes.  I think we should have followed Cheryl&#39;s lead and just ordered off the &#34;Share&#34; section of the menu.

So, I think the place has a lot of potential and love seeing the owner getting things rolling but it was $134 with tip for two.  Not a very &#34;happy&#34; hour and not again anytime soon."

Went last night with a friend, and we enjoyed so many delicious things including the drunken monk drink.  He ordered his without mint, and I kept mine as called for.  Both ways were delicious.  The Roti Pizza was unusual when compared to the rest of the menu as well the overall theme of the restaurant, but it was amazing.  I am even debating going again tonight.  The curry was delicious with a wonderful hint of lime.  I found it random that there were noodles (and not even rice noodles) served with it; however, it more complimented of the curry than I thought it would be.  Just go!

This feeling inspired me to write a review. I liked the food and my server was real great in explaining to me that I can order way more vegetarian options than what the menu said.
I have a complaint, though. I ordered the curry and asked my server if it came with pasta and she said no and that I should order a side of rice. So I did. Well there was pasta with my curry. Of course because I am sort of fat I ate both but I did not need to eat both. Ex: if i didnt order the side of rice, I would not have eaten it."

My husband and I stopped in on a Monday night. It was great to see the restaurant busy. We sat at the bar (which we&#39;ve never done before) and enjoyed seeing what the guys were preparing. I ordered the Crouching Tiger, which is my favorite drink on the menu with the charred pineapple garnish. My husband ordered the Drunken Monk. The reason I took 1 star off this review is because it did take an exceptionally long time to get water and cocktails. Our waitress was in training, so not sure if it was a combo of that and the restaurant being busy, but we were thirsty and shouldn&#39;t have waited that long.

For food, we ordered:
1) Chicken Wings: grilled crispy and tossed in a sweet, savory sauce that was killer. Topped with green onions and cilantro. 
2) Pork Belly Buns: we always order whatever their bun variation is, and these did not disappoint. I recommend adding some of the sriracha style sauce that is on the table.  
3) Kale Salad: This was pretty good. Their papaya salad is much better, but not in season right now. It had pears, cashews and a very light dressing. The portion was huge!
4) Thai Coconut Curry: This was my favorite dish of the night. Not too spicy, but did get the nose running. Comes with noodles in the curry, and also a side plate of cilantro, crispy noodles and pickled mustard greens. Amazing.

3 cocktails, 3 share plates and 1 large plate cost us $73 before tip. Not cheap, but worth every bite."

We started with an order of the dumplings, and the vegetable samosas. Dumplings, though flavorful, were not cooked completely. The dough was still fairly hard. The samosas were my 2nd favorite thing about my meal. 

I ordered the Thai Curry, my friend ordered the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Ramen. 

I liked the presentation and the flavor of the Thai Curry very much. I liked the buildl your own curry concept, and the pulled chicken was very good. 

As far as the ramen, we were very, very disappointed. Outside of the bacon on top of the ramen, there was almost no flavor in the dish. The broth had no flavor, was just not good. 

Drinks were over priced, small, but good."

I enjoyed it thoroughly. Further, this restaurant was all kinds of tasty. I went with a friend and my cousin and we had no problem being seated at a normal dinner time on a Sunday. We split the dumplings, which were fantastically tasty... The sauce that came on them was a good mix of salty, earthy, spicy, and fresh. For dinner, I had the fanciest pho of my life. It had thinly sliced wagyu beef that you cooked in the broth and some falling apart delicious meat that was already in the broth. It was very tasty (though I almost wouldn&#39;t call it pho...more like fancy soup ). As good as mine was, my cousin&#39;s was way better! She had the wonton noodles, which doesn&#39;t sound that exciting, but was fabulous. I would get that next time. The prices were high (15$ pp), but the portion and quality was good enough to make up for that. I would return!"

I had the crouching tiger cocktail, red chili dumplings, and pork belly won ton noodles. Everything was great. In my opinion, this isn&#39;t fusion and sticks with the true ingredients that make the dish shine. Service was great. A bit pricey for the type of food being served, but given the location and atmosphere, understandable. They should add less commonly known street foods like banh xeo or banh uoc.

So with a new concept in the Asian food scene, I couldn&#39;t wait to get my hands on the noodle bowls!!!

Cho77 did not disappoint! It was busy on a Friday night, but the wait was not bad at all! I went for the crouching tiger cocktail and Corey had a nice smooth Saki! The crouching tiger was awesome, fruity with a smoke from the charred pineapple. Not sweet, but refreshing!! 

We stared with the papaya salad and it was too.die.for!! Crunchy, sweet, spicy, tangy...just all around amazing! The buffalo chicken bao buns were delicious, a stray from a more traditional menu but I was excited to try them after seeing pictures! 

We each opted for a noodle dish, I ordered the Thai coconut curry and Corey got the meatball noodle dish. The coconut curry was definitely a favorite and will be a craving from now on! It was hot, creamy, great chicken, noodles were awesome, all the toppings make it an all around gem! The Wagyu Beef soup was good, but the Thai definitely came out the winner! 

Lastly we opted for dessert, a yummy kaya ice cream sandwich and 2 Vietnamese coffees! I live Vietnamese coffee! The desert was again to die for with toasted coconut and just all things amazing!

We ended up opting to try all the small plates.  The Kale salad was great, it was pretty heavy citrus but was so well balanced that it really worked well.  The chicken wings were surprising and amazing.  Not overly sauced and had a great grill char.  The natural chicken flavor really rang out as the sauce just really helped highlight the chicken.  

Our favorite was the Bao buns.  We had to order another round.  We&#39;ve tried Bao buns all over town and feel these are some of the best.  

I tried the Crouching Tiger drink and was really surprised.  I don&#39;t normally like coconut but it added a great dimension to the drink.  The sriracha salt added some spice but also just added the great sriracha flavor.  Finally, the charred pineapple added a hint of smokiness that added an additional fun dimension.

While we enjoyed some of the food, the peanut sauce for the beef satay was poor ... one can find a better sauce straight from a jar. The kicker was our direct line of sight to the kitchen. After watching a cook brush the grill where he cooks the satay skewers and chicken wings, we were disgusted when he left it on the floor. Yes, on the floor. Sure, it&#39;s a grill brush and not a piece of raw chicken, but I don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;d do this in their own backyard grill yet alone in a restaurant. I cannot imagine this would pass any health inspection. I commented to our server and canceled our order of wings. She did investigate and said, that&#39;s what they do. Moments later, however, someone moved the grill brush off the floor.

My wife and I were disgusted. I can only imagine what happens in many kitchens but I don&#39;t want to see all that happens unless it&#39;s clean. I bet Gordon Ramsey would want to shut them down.

In sum, my family thought it was just OK but no one suggested this a place to ever go back, unlike Cholon which we all truly enjoy and have been back 5+ times. Suggest they clean up their kitchen and taste test all the food."

I&#39;ll start out with the good.  The Coconut Chicken Curry  with egg noodles is great soup.  There isn&#39;t anything out of the box as far as new interesting flavors, it sort of tastes like a great version of pad thai in soup form with egg noodles instead of rice noodles (which I believe is the way it should be served!).  Nonetheless, the great food stops there.  My wife and I have eaten at this spot 3 times just because we thought we may have not have tried some of the best they had to offer since the second time we came the ramen was removed from the menu and my wife had tried that on the first visit and found it to be bland, small portioned, and definitely untraditional.   

The papaya salad is WAY too sour, and the ceviche isn&#39;t far behind it either.  Some of the other appetizers like the duck buns and the roti pizza are OK but nothing special.  The drinks are the worst.  We&#39;ve tried several that we thought might be unique or interesting such as the green coconut tea, and it has the worst tart after taste I have ever experienced drinking a tea.  It comes in a small glass and between both my wife and myself, we couldn&#39;t finish it.  The Malaysian pulled tea is a great idea but it has no sweetness to it.  Possibly add sugar to this or sweetened condensed milk to make it more pallet-able?  

Overall it could be a lot better and hopefully some things change over time.  The only time I see me coming back would be if both my wife and I are in the mood for Coconut Chicken Curry Soup since that is really the only good dish in the entire restaurant.  I&#39;ve tried at least 10 dishes in the 3 visits between my wife and I and only 1 of them I thought was good so I won&#39;t be trying anything else."

Have to say:
Nice space, though  lighting was super (fashionably?) dim after sunset.
Will sit at the bar next time just to watch the amazing cooks..
SUPER nice wait staff.
Very good ethyl alcohol selection
Had the pork ramen and it was good. sorry to say not great, but good. 
PERFECT  noodles but ,despite several jalapeno slices .....no heat? Also, the pork  belly (my first experience with this much lauded ingredient was...toothsome as was the  bok-choy. Beautiful but under-cooked by a bit.
. Also the noodle  broth was delicious but it sat at the bottom of my bowl . no matter how much I twirled the noodles. A little binder would go a long way here.
My noodles came with a citrus- bone broth  and a couple of  delicious dumplings. Unexpected and unusual.

I know this is the trend of LoHi, Rino and now South Broadway: open up a shop, overvalue everything and watch the Midwestern-transplant yuppies flock while they text their friends and family back home pictures of how &#34;DENVER IS SO AMAZING! You can&#39;t find this in (insert: Pleasantville, Who Cares, U.S.A.)!!!&#34; 

To start, average price of good but easy to source (and find all over Denver) beer: $8. The dumplings were great but come at $2 a bite. The thai curry was ok with a flavorful sauce and a cupful that could fit in my hand at $13 and would be hard to consider an &#34;entree.&#34; The &#34;ritto pizza&#34; was in fact a 4&#34; pizza (literally) and for $9. It was good, interesting but I have no idea how it&#39;s Asian fare. The ramen was also average at best but double the price at half the portion of anything at Uncle or Tengu. 

If this is the direction of South Broadway, and Denver dinning in general for that matter, it&#39;s sad. We shouldn&#39;t have to look forward to average fare at insane costs. Go to Sputnik across the street for food just as good and better in a lot of instances."

We heard that they ironed out the kinks and have reworked the menu, so we decided to try again. We are glad we did, as the new offerings are nothing short of spectacular. 

The restaurant was busy, yet we were seated promptly. Staff was friendly, engaging, and knowledgable of the menu. We had a large group, so we split a few apps to start. The papaya salad was light and refreshing; perfect on a hot summer day. The Roti pizza was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever tried. The toppings were uniquely appealing and the dough was the flakiest I&#39;ve ever had. The spring rolls were amazing as well. They had a little bit of an Indian food kick to them, so definitely not your usual spring roll.

By this point I am already full. I could close my tab and be content, but the menu is too tempting. I decide on the bbq pork belly noodles. The noodles and sauce excellent, but the pork belly really shines. Upon biting into one of the large chunks of pork belly it falls apart in your mouth. I also had to mooch off wife lady&#39;s coconut curry.  The curry is every bit as good as the pork belly in its own way. A perfect balance of heat and coconut, with the shredded chicken and crispy egg noodles incorporated into every bite. 

We also had drinks with our meals and they were all great. I think that the price point of the restaurant is on point.  Entrees run in the $13-$16 range. You cannot get a better meal at that price."

Cho77&#39;s space is well done and the menu reads well. We had buffalo chicken bao. It was heavy handed with blue cheese and ate like a buffalo chicken dip found at football party. The entree was Bacon Egg and cheese Ramen. The noodles were texturally sound but the broth was one note. It taste of beef broth with a few pieces bacon strips. The broth and meal lacked any complexity or layered flavors.

Our server was pushy and when we ordered our food he told us what we were getting was &#34;pretty boring&#34;. 

We started with the pork dumplings which tasted more like salt than anything else. 

The cocktails (Crouching Tiger and Drunken Monk) were good and helped wash away the salt flavor of the pork dumplings, but for $8 a pop there should have been more liquor and less ice. 

For the entree my partner and I had the wonton noodles with BBQ pork belly and pork bone &#34;tea&#34;. The noodles and bok choi were good, but could do with some more seasoning. The pork belly was crispy and added a nice sweetness to the dish. 
The pork bone &#34;tea&#34; was very porky (good), but the pork in the dumplings was raw. Once we bit into the dumplings we knew something was wrong. Both my partner and I got pretty ill almost immediately after we left.

Samosas and green papaya salad were great, but the real star was the coconut curry chicken! OH MY GOSH. I could eat it everyday! To top it off, we shared a delicious fried banana dessert. 

My one minor complaint about our experience, and the reason for deducting a star, was that our waiter seemed over-eager to clear our table. He legitimately started wiping down our table and clearing dishes as we were still eating our entrees and immediately wanted our dessert order. I should add that there wasn&#39;t anyone waiting to be seated- he was just rushing us.

Didn&#39;t know what to order but was expecting the same delicious food I tried at the bistro. So I ordered the Red chili pork dumplings and it did not disappoint. It was not your ordinary dumplings. It was open faced of sort with crispy shallots, soy and vinegar. The flavor of the saltiness and sourness of the vinegar was well balanced. 

Since it was a chilly evening in Denver, I opted to try the bacon, egg and cheese ramen. It was a good dish but portion was a bit smaller than what I expected. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the bacon because it was on the sweet side which surprised me because on the menu, it said miso bacon. I would have preferred a crispy pork belly with the ramen instead of the bacon. But the addition of the poached egg was great. It added to the flavor of the dish. Lastly, I had the tamarind sour cocktail and it was delicious. 

Overall, I enjoyed meal and would definitely come back when I visit Denver again. 

I highly recommend this place but if you haven&#39;t tried ChoLon, go to that first and make sure you order the pork belly buns"

It reminds me of something you might have experienced at Coney Island in the 50s for some reason. When you walk in everything is very simple - bags of potatoes they are using that day to make your fries, a menu board that features cheeseburgers and a couple of sandwiches, simple, solid colors, and a pretty warm and friendly greeting by the people taking orders.

I went with a simple cheeseburger (the small version actually, which is pretty much the size of a regular burger - their regular is quite large) and fries. Each burger is customized with your choice of toppings as you order, which is pretty neat as you don&#39;t have to request additions or have things left off as you do with plenty of other burger places. And after you order you get to watch them make your burger in their open kitchen area, an act that fascinated Ephraim to no end.

The burgers and fries were really good, but nothing like made me think, &#34;Oh. Em. Gee. I&#39;ll never eat burgers from anywhere else ever again!&#34; Since 5 Guys is so far away from me I&#39;ll probably stick to eating my Smashburgers or burgers from local restaurants, but if I was near a 5 Guys I also wouldn&#39;t hesitate to eat there again.

One extra note: for fries you can get them 5 Guys style or Cajun style. Cajun style is really quite salty and only a little spicy. I preferred the regular version, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of salt."

Yes, you do get 2 patties for that price. Nice.

However, I&#39;d also like the bottom of the bun to be cooked instead of borderline raw.

The meat was okay - perhaps a notch below In and Out. Honestly I think I like Smashburger better for both the burgers and the fries. The fries here were drenched in grease, although leaving the skins on was a nice touch. While drenched in grease they oddly tasted undercooked. Hmm...

There&#39;s no recycling for all the foil they are wasting - a bit of a disappointment.

On the other hand, there are bins of free peanuts and they do serve Coke Zero.

They&#39;re in a strip mall along with the prerequisite cluster f*** of parking. You&#39;ll also have to deal with Aurora drivers.

I&#39;d give it a solid 3. It&#39;s OK. That&#39;s about it. I walked out with a cheeseburger, small fries, and a large drink for around $10.45 including tax -- for that price, Smashburger is a better bet."

They&#39;re not even in the top ten. Unless you&#39;re talking only about Colorado, then they may be in the top five. 

We went into the 5 guys burgers and fries on Iliff and Parker Rd. I swear I had just walked into a In-n-out Burger minus the palm trees and plus the peanuts everywhere. 

So if you want just a hamburger, you order a little hamburger. If you want two patties you order a hamburger. Almost ordered the two patty burger, silly me, ordering a hamburger(thinking one patty). They finally had to explain how everything works. Too complicated. 

So we got our food and sat down to eat , hoping it&#39;s going to be as good as the one in Boise,Idaho. Wait for it... It most definitely was not. It was hot and fresh just lacked flavor and quality. I was really excited to try a different 5 Guys only to be let down. I didn&#39;t even finish my burger. I left feeling hungry still. 

If they were to build one really close to my house, I might try again but I definitely won&#39;t go out of my way like I did today. They&#39;re still better than any of Colorado&#39;s burger franchises."

I realized that my review last time contained some nonfactual information. This is the ONLY Five Guys establishment that I&#39;ve been to that doesn&#39;t have the big fancy coke machine. I was really disappointed by that when I was here yesterday.

Secondly, I ordered two grilled cheeses, as usual. Whoever was making my grilled cheeses must have been new because my grilled cheeses were not sliced in half (OK-fine, no big deal there) but there were also just not prepared properly. I&#39;ve been to many Five Guys locations and I&#39;ve always gotten my same-old Five Guys grilled cheese. I&#39;m not even sure what was missing. My guess is that they didn&#39;t use enough butter. The end result was that I ate 1.5 of my 2 grilled cheeses and then just stopped because they just didn&#39;t taste good.

Five Guys isn&#39;t famous here in Denver like it is in DC. If you want to make an impression in this market, you gotta keep it consistent. I will be back and I&#39;m hoping for better!"

Fries are damn fresh and the burger is very tasty. The regular hamburger is 2 patties, i think 1/2 pound of beef?

It takes a few minutes to get your order and that&#39;s because it is made fresh, to order, including any topping you want or don&#39;t want.  Burger is made well done but not dry or burned, just right. The fries are little thicker than regular &#34;fast food&#34; fries and they have the skin on, did i mention how fresh and tasty they are?

It is pretty busy on a Saturday and will cost you about $10 for a meal but it is worth it, not everyday, but once or twice a month. I&#39;ll be back."

First off, you can pick and choose from a ton of different toppings and sauces, all for free. I placed my order online so I could take my timing in designing the perfect burger. Ordering over their website is super easy, and you can choose to pick up your burger &#34;now&#34; or any any 15 increment in the near future. Since I was ordering at around 12:30 on a Saturday, I chose the &#34;now&#34; option despite my drive, figuring they&#39;d be busy, and maybe a little behind. The site showed that my order would be ready in 7 minutes - I was late picking it up, of course, but it was still warm. Staff was fine - seemed bored, but were moderately polite. No big deal either way. 

Anyway, got my burger (no fries) home and dug in. Amazing! For fast food, this is really, really good. Loved it. Can&#39;t wait to put some other crazy thing together online and drive back over - next time, with a 15 minute delay on the order."

Certainly, the burgers were HUGE.  (I gave up on the bread and eating mine as a sandwich, and just ate the burger with a knife and fork.)  That being said:  I could EAT JUST the burger. Meaning the quality of the beef was definitely above average. I just don&#39;t get the RAVE reviews this place invokes. 

They definitely overdo it on the fries.  It&#39;s too much for any (sane) one person to eat, and seems a waste as well.  Also: The grease soaking through the brown paper bag wasn&#39;t all that appetizing.

The decor is somewhere between contemporary and retro burger stand.  It&#39;s clean inside, and the employees seem cheerful.

The peanuts are an interesting, if random, choice.  You can grab a handful and munch as you wait.... just hope you don&#39;t have a peanut allergy, because the shells and &#39;dust&#39; are everywhere.

It&#39;s certainly a good (if large) quality burger, but there was nothing really outstanding or extraordinary about the actual flavor of it.  Or of the bun.  So it gets an A-OK rating from me.  Middle of the road, in my book."

The burgers aren&#39;t super amazing, but they are sufficient especially for the price.  We don&#39;t eat here very often, but for a cheap, quick, and tasty burger, this is the place for us to go.  

I&#39;m a fan of the peanuts to snack on while waiting, as well.  As far as the fries go, they seem to be a hit or miss.  I&#39;ve had fries from here that were really under done and some that were just right.  This last time they were excellent.  I do like how they post the name of the farmer who&#39;s potatoes are being used on that day.

Overall, the food is better than comparable fast-food joints for the same price.  While 5-Guys isn&#39;t a 5-star, they definitely know their quick and tasty burgers!"

First off, the burgers are made fresh to order, with handmade patties. I ordered a basic cheeseburger with nothing fancy on it, and it was so amazing. I don&#39;t know what made it so good but I fell in love (again)! The fries are thrown into your paper bag, which is fine since you do get a lot. The fries are so too d too! They still have the potato skin, which I prefer. The drinks are free refills which is nice. The decor is contemporary but comfortable. It reminds me of a 50s diner sort of. 

So price wise, they are on the higher price range for fast food. Expect to pay 10 or more for a burger, fries, and drink. You pay a flat amount for the type of burger, then get all kinds of toppings that you can add for free.

It&#39;s a big sloppy burger that is in desparate need of an interior paper wrapper- all the guts spill out the backside of the burger. The patties are not the same diameter as the bun, so it&#39;s lopsided and impossible to have consistent &#34;perfect&#34; bites. And just to show what a food connoiseur I truly am, FGBF puts diced hot dog onions on the burger. This is a crime. A burger needs a 3/8 an inch raw slice of white onion. Apparently they have never heard of 1000 island either. Fortunately, a wonderful employee made me a side of it- I watched him mix it. Fries were okay. Homemade, which I commend them for; however, fries are fluffy and crispy when they are first blanched/parboiled and then freezed until they hit the fryer. FGBF fries are a little thick for me, and not crispy because they are handcutting and frying to order. Fries looks better than they taste, which is a dissappointment. Lastly, let&#39;s tackle the bun. Why is it smooshed? It&#39;s like a picnic bun, not warm, not fresh really, and cannot stand up to the sloppiness of the burger ecoutrements. Valsic pickles, yuck. Unripe thick tomato slice, double yuck. Sorry guys, I wanted to love it. But with all these issues and the $26 price tag for two people, I gotta head elsewhere.

Two, the fries, be it Regular or CAJUN, its WAY TOO SALTY and man... they had all 6 or so fryers... &#34;up in the air&#34;.. meaning when we receive our fries it was a mixture of warm fries which the MAJORITY of the fries are FREAKING COLD..

Hubs order :

*  Mayo
*  Lettuce
*  Pickle
*  Tomato
*  Grilled Onion
*  Grilled Mushroom
*  Jalapeno Peppers
*  Double Cheeseburger

My order was :

*  Single Hamburger
*  Grilled Mushroom
*  Jalapeno Peppers

Was indeed a disappointment!  Hubs and I wont step in this store EVER again let alone, should we try other outlets aka other FIVE GUYS restaurants all across the US...  I wonder who are those who took the ZAGAT reviews claiming FIVE GUYS etc etc...

In Prose: 

Five Guys, if you were a person, I&#39;d do you. If you were, in fact, five different guys... well... let&#39;s talk first. More burgers would need to come into the picture. 

I went in. (Excitedly.)

I ordered. (The baby burger with everything on it.)

I waited 6-8 minutes. (A very decent wait time.)

I received an absolutely mouth-watering cheeseburger with everything wonderful and delicious on it, including sauteed mushrooms. I had not realized that &#34;everything&#34; meant that too, which only means 5 Guys exceeds my expectations. (Side: mushrooms on burgers = drool!) 

I paid roughly $4 for this burger; I would have been willing to pay more for it. It even made me forget it was a fast-food burger. Yum.............. 

Excuse me while I try to stop salivating."

I found it to be good, but not amazing.  The burgers are larger than average, often comprised of two pieces of beef to make up the whole burger.  They did well with cooking my requested burger temperature.  The counter service was solid and they seemed to work well as a team - my order was out quickly and correctly put together.    

There&#39;s a concept at this place about portion sizes.  &#34;Skimpy&#34; just isn&#39;t part of their process.  They would rather you throw away some food than give you too little.  I generally applaud correct portion sizes, but Five Guys has no clue about this topic.  For example, your order comes in a regular brown bag like you might use to pack a lunch.  The burger is wrapped in foil at the bottom of this bag, and there is a container for fries, but basically the entire bag is filled to the top with fries.  I happened to be dining alone, so this was waaaaaay too many fries.  Basically from the moment I saw it I was filled with regret about the amount of food I would be throwing away.  I like that the fries are fresh cut, but they are a bit too salty and the portion is literally absurd at four or five times an average size.  Two times would have been more than enough. 

I would eat here again, I just need to bring along a few friends and only get one order of fries, and then I&#39;ll probably still have some left over.

Side note:  Any comparison to In-n-Out is completely useless - this place is not that syle of burger at all."

I had heard good things for Five Guys from Yelpers and many others. I had never heard it compared to In N Out though, so I didn&#39;t go in with that expectation.  And I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t because besides the concept of everything being fresh, and the red and white decor, Five Guys is nothing like In N Out.

I ordered the Little Bacon Burger, a regular fries, and a diet coke. It came to $7 and some change. My first gripe was how long it took, but I was expecting this meal was going to be really awesome so maybe it seemed longer than it really was.

When my order was finally called I went up and I saw them put the already large cup of regular fries in and then dump another scoop of fries on top of the bag. The portion is ridiculous, and they really should offer something smaller, sure it cuts into profit, but what they are doing is wasteful. I really doubt 1 person can finish that portion of fries, and while their fries are certainly fresh, there isn&#39;t anything special about them.

And now the burger, I should have asked if it came with cheese, but I just assumed it did. It didn&#39;t. The patty was definitely fresh, but the bun was pretty bland and almost gummy. And they put way too much ketchup and mustard on my burger. It made me think of the &#34;don&#39;t drown your food&#34; PSA they showed during Saturday morning cartoons in the 80s (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPydyVBvIQA).

No it&#39;s nothing like In N Out but honestly, I can think of many places that serve a better burger for around the same price.  Including Smashburger and even Wendy&#39;s. Yes, Wendy&#39;s. If I was out in an area where I needed to grab a bite and there was a Five guys, maybe I&#39;d stop in. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be driving 15 minutes again for Five Guys anytime soon."

Why?  I&#39;m pretty sure my girlfriend will leave me over this review; accordingly, if you are available - let me know! 

Okay, here goes: this In-N-Out Burger clone is no match for the original!  At In-N-Out Burger, the same meal costs much less, has less grease and, dare I say it - tastes better than the food at Five Guys.  

I don&#39;t get Five Guys at all: more than $10 for an okay cheeseburger, very good fries and a fountain drink; at In-N-Out Burger that same meal costs $6 and a bit of change, plus you don&#39;t have to ring out the burger and fries.  

But, forget I ever said In-N-Out Burger, as they don&#39;t exist in Denver.  And, in Denver, you can forget Five Guys exists as there are so many great burger joints, you never need to visit Five Guys unless you converted your car&#39;s fuel requirements to grease.

I tried one of the regular size cheeseburgers w/ tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and mayo.  I also ordered a small (?) fries.  This was the biggest small I have ever seen, and they tasted like potatoes - actual potatoes!  They even state on the wall where the batch of potatoes originated from - and I have to say Spinner, Idaho grows some tasty spuds.

I think next time I will either get a small burger with fries or a regular size by itself because getting a reg w/ fries is amazingly more than this hearty appetite can handle."

O good you&#39;re back. This Five Guys is exactly like every other Five Guys you will eat at, in that it has yummy juicy burgers and delicious greasy fries for a decent price. I always get a little burger and little fry instead of the regular, because I simply can&#39;t eat the insane amount of food that you get. The regular burger is a double patty, with the &#34;little&#34; being an everything but little single patty. A regular fry is a kin to a small tractor-trailer full of potatoes. With a drink this is all about 11 bucks. 

What makes it for me at this specific Five Guys is the staff. They are always super friendly and look like they don&#39;t totally hate their jobs. I have gone in during lunch and night time shifts, and regardless the staff is great."

Dropped by, ravenous, after a frustrating morning house-hunting in the area. The place wasn&#39;t too busy, they took our order almost immediately, and the food was made swiftly. Although the burgers come wrapped in foil, I didn&#39;t experience any of the soggy bun &#34;issues&#34; some other reviewers mentioned. The lettuce and onions were fresh and crunchy, the tomato was decent, and the amount of ketchup and mustard was spot on. The patties were absolutely delicious - meaty, juicy, with a great grilled taste. As others have already noted, a large order of fries is more than enough for two people. The fries are amazing - well cooked on the outside but squishy and potato-y inside. The bottles of Heinz malt vinegar get a big thumbs up from me also.

Sure it&#39;s a bit more expensive than the usual fast food burger joints ($4.99 for the double patty cheeseburger; $3.99 for large fries) but the food is delicious and super fresh/made in front of your eyes, the toppings are free, and you will not leave hungry.

The atmosphere is great. But do not go there in a bad mood. Everyone is cloyingly nice. Almost annoyingly nice ! ( Leave me alone,......I just want to order a burger !!!!)"

My gentleman friend who is from D.C. kept on talking about how awesome this place was, so we took a little trip down so I could try it out.  Well first of all, he failed to remind me how BIG the servings of food was.  He did warn me that a regular cheeseburger was actually 2 patties, and a little cheeseburger was 1 (and we wonder why America has an obesity problem...) and then I ordered a large fries for the two of us, which could have easily fed a family of four. 

Besides the huge portions of food, this place served up some high quality burgers.  Very juicy and fresh.  The fries are hand-cut and crispy..very tasty! It&#39;s not nearly as good as IN-N Out (but nothing really is in my mind) but still a good place to get a decent burger.

The reason I give it 3 stars is it is way too overpriced for being a fast food joint.  You can&#39;t order a combo here-it&#39;s a la carte for everything but at least the toppings (w/the exception of bacon) are free.  Oh, and they also serve up free peanuts, but don&#39;t throw your shells on the floor unless you want people staring at you oddly.  I was in a meat coma pretty much the rest of the day but it was well worth it."

I dig that it is a fast burger and fries with out the feeling McDonalds gives me 5 minutes later. They will also make your burger with whatever you want on it. And boy do they have a lot of stuff you can put on it. &#34;What kind of stuff?&#34; you say? Let me tell you!
Mayo, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, Onions, Jalapenos, Green Peppers, A1, BBQ Sauce, and Hot Sauce. 
And each one is just as free as the last. If you are a true American you can add cheese and bacon too but you have to pay a little extra. 

I get a little cheeseburger (don&#39;t let the name fool you it is the size of a regular cheeseburger and then a regular is a double patty) with mayo, grilled onions and mushrooms. It is a big melty gooey mess of delicious love. The boyfriend gets something similar but with BBQ sauce and bacon and because he is a man an extra burger patty. 

I tried the hot dog once and it was a mistake. I am sure they are good for kids or burger hating, dog lovers but to me it tasted like a 7-11 hot dog. But that is what I get with messing with a good thing. Speaking of a good thing, the fries are yummy and they give you a TON. Not like, &#34;oh they put them in a big container yay&#34;. More like they put them in a big container and then put that in your bag and go &#34;eh...lets fill the rest of the bag up with fries to keep the burgers warm. One order is enough for a small family. I also like that they tell you every day where that days potatoes came from. And hint hint...it isn&#39;t the freezer. 

The inside is very clean and that is impressive because they have piles and piles of peanuts for people to eat all over the place. There are always plenty of people working and while it takes a little bit to get your food it is only because they actually cook it to order. There is also a fairly big patio the views are not awesome but it is nice during the summer."

They may not have animal style fries or animal style burgers, but you can get creative with the unlimited free toppings that they offer.   Their regular portion fries is a huge order.  I read the reviews on here and thought people were exaggerating but they&#39;re true.   I have to disagree with what folks been saying about the burger portions cause I think they&#39;re perfect(although I always order the bacon double cheeseburger).  

Atmosphere here is chill.  Typical fast food joint but not as crazy as the In-N-Out in SD(granted I&#39;m in a different state and population is probably different).

This is no In-n-Out.

A wannabe, sure.

Best burger, no way.

I had the small burger - upon the advice of the cashier, who while helpful, was not quite accurate in his description of size.

The burger, small and overcooked, simply did not have enough flavor to compete with the oversized, gummy, bland bun.  While the toppings were generous, they couldn&#39;t help this puny burger begin to satisfy my need for a good burger.

The fries were real potatos, but also really lacking in flavor - though they offer two types of seasoned fries (which I avoid due to an MSG allergy), a little undercooked.  There were a whole bunch of fries, but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish them.

So far, in Denver, my only solid recommendations for a good burger are SmashBurger and CheezBurger CheezBurger.

Its a little on the pricey side for fast food, but the food is good and the service is friendly. Everything is cooked to order, and all toppings (except bacon and cheese) are custom and free. Free peanuts too! 

I am mildly annoyed that their &#34;cheeseburger&#34; is actually a double cheeseburger (if you want the single, you need to order a &#34;little cheeseburger&#34;). I realize that they are trying to be cute or whatever, but it&#39;s annoying when I have to clarify what I want every order. 

The burgers come wrapped in foil, and are kinda &#34;tall&#34; (and so a little hard to eat), but very good nontheless. Their fries are deep fried and thickish cut, and are very good (and you get a LOT of them...portions on fries are extremely generous). They do have a tip jar, but the employees will not give you dirty looks or bad service if you decide not to tip. 

The lobby is always clean and so are the bathrooms. The kitchen is open to the lobby and you can see everything. service is not as fast as McDonalds, but much faster than a real restaurant.

The burgers are just plain GOOD. You get as many toppings as you want for free which is nice if you like to load up like I do. The only thing they charge extra for is bacon. 

The cajun fries are awesome (fries with old bay type seasoning) and the plain fries are good covered in vinegar. If anyone knows of Thrashers french fries, Five Guys fries taste similar. You get enough fries in one small order to feed at least 2-3 people. 

The service is always friendly and they always act really excited when you walk in, like they have never had a customer before (but believe me they get plenty of business). It does get really busy sometimes, so I would suggest going after 7:30pm when it dies down a little.

As someone who has eaten at the Denver Burger Battle twice and who frequents burger joints, I believe there are two schools of thought on burgers.  The first school of thought is the In and Out model.  The second being the fancy burger model.  I won&#39;t discuss fancy burgers in this review.  The In and Out or old school burger operates on one simple premise.  There are four types of burgers.  Hamburger, Double Hamburger, Cheese Burger, and Double Cheese burger.  That&#39;s it.  Of course Five Guys has some sides that you can slap on, but it is still ALWAYS ABOUT THE BURGER.  When you eat a Five guys burger, you know you are eating meat and you tell yourself...oh, so this is a hamburger.  And I haven&#39;t even talked about the fries yet.  Why every place that serves fries doesn&#39;t have malt vinegar is beyond me.  These are the best fries around and they are so gluttonous about the amount of fries they pour on.  NOTE:  If they do not warn you ahead of time, two people can and should share one order of regular fries.
The only downside is the service is slow, but I would still rather wait than eat any other burger in a fast food joint.  Five Guys, I will see you again, but you guys already knew that."

The fries are definitely among the best.  But the burger was incredibly disappointing.  First, I was surprised that the menu said all burgers would be cooked well done.  I get the whole cow thing and why they won&#39;t make them rare anymore, but this is a bit extreme.

Second, we took ours home and mine didn&#39;t have the right toppings.  I had asked for ketchup, mustard, and mushrooms.   Instead, I got ketchup and cooked onions.   And the burger was very dry.

The buns were also a disappointment.  They had always been this yummy, yeasty almost sweet consistency.  These were sesame seed and nowhere near as good.

For the price, it wasn&#39;t worth it.  In fact, I had one of the best burgers of my life last night for the exact same price, and I&#39;m off to review it!

6. Any normal topping on a burger such as lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, etc you can get for free on the burger of your choice.

In-N-Out obviously has 50&#39;s era type cheeseburgers with limited toppings, they do have special sauce, and the FF are thin and small.  In-N-Out is legendary and I wish they had them in Denver.   The cheeseburgers are basically the best in the world.  I would give INO five stars but the fries are only so-so.  

Five Guys is pretty awesome too.  Their fries are thicker and much better then INO.  And again, a much different burger compared to INO.  The burgers are more of a homemade style, with a sesame seed bun, and with a huge selection of toppings.  The lack of special sauce does suck tho.  But they do have bacon, and it&#39;s high quality and a perfect touch to the Five Guys burger.  Whereas INO&#39;s burger patties are small and smashed, Five Guys&#39; burgers are much thicker.  And the quality of beef is very good.  And I don&#39;t care if they only fry their fries one time, they&#39;re still friggin awesome.  I always ask them to fry mine about one minute extra and they&#39;re always perfect.  And they have the option of the Cajun fries, which are good if you&#39;re into that style.  I&#39;m really not but some of my other friends love the Cajun fries.    

Yes, the place is quite expensive for fast food, but it&#39;s hands down the best fast food burger in Denver.  And the amount of french fries you get is insane.  We always have enough to take home and eat later.  Sometimes the wait can take a little while (just like at INO), but it&#39;s worth it.  I&#39;ll pay and wait a little extra for quality and freshness any day.  

Bottom line, Five Guys is bad arse.  I make the drive from Arvada about once a month to indulge."

From the hamburgers and toppings to the HUGE cups of real fries. And the ones with Cajun seasoning, they will knock your socks off. Don&#39;t forget to get to the bottom of the bag because there will be more fries in there as well. They really load ya up! 

The environment is simple but clean. Several tables but I can see that place getting packed, especially on Fridays. 

I have not been to all of the burger joints that have been mentioned in other reviews but in my opinion Five Guys is better than most, even Fatburger and Smashburger. It is a drive even from our south campus office but I will be making the trip back without a doubt!"
five-guys-burgers-and-fries-aurora-7,Annette R.,X15oJw2RZWPPpT-gG9jOtg,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,167,114,1YeeJEeDOucDtdCokwRzEA,2.0,2008-12-21,"I&#39;ve been hyping Five Guys to my friends for a really long time now.

See, I used to date a guy who lived in DC, and the first thing I would make him do after picking me up at the train station was drive us to a 5 Guys for some hot greasy juice burgers and cajun fries.  After we split up I may have actually lamented the loss of my 5 Guys fix more than him (sorry Seth!)

So imagine my DELIGHT when I moved here and discovered there was one nearby.  We rushed right over for dinner after work.  When we got there I was a little confused, was this a Five Guys or an In n Out?  What&#39;s with the red and white checkered tile?  Identity crisis much?  At least they still have the boxes of peanuts and build it yourself menu concept!

So we saunter up to the counter and place our orders nothing terribly complicated.  We grab some nuts and our drinks and sit down.  Burgers come aaaaand, they&#39;ve gotten mine wrong, nothing serious, but they&#39;ve left off the onions.  I&#39;m not huge on complaining over something this small so I just shrug it off and we finish and go.  The burgers are tasty but really nothing even close to the ones I have become used to from the DC Five Guys.

A few weeks later we decide to give it another go.  We order, sit  and wait... They are a little busier this time so it takes a while, we get our burgers and.... wrong again.  This time they&#39;ve gotten both of them wrong.  They&#39;ve put my sauce selections on my boyfriends burger and his produce and sauce on mine.  *sigh* we swap it around as best we can and just leave.

It&#39;s still a pretty tasty burger but this is two strikes for the service now.  We&#39;ll go back one more time and see if they can get it right.  If they can, this will be a three star review.

It seems Five Guys out of the DC area just are not up to par, still an ok burger, just not the amazing beefy heaven they are there.

Wow, I&#39;ve apparently written a thesis on greasy beef here."

I&#39;m not a fan of your typical fast food chains and rarely eat from them, especially for a hamburger. My favorite has and always will be In-N-Out. Not much is going to change that. Does that mean I can&#39;t enjoy another burger? No, not at all.

So after two visits now, I must say that Five Guys has some tasty burgers. I love how simply their menu is. Burger, Fries, Drinks and that&#39;s it. All you have to think about is do you want, a single or a double, bacon and/or cheese and what condiments and extras do you want on your burger. 

I ordered (both times) a single patty bacon cheese burger with yellow mustard, mayo and hot sauce. The burger was so good and that I thought that I might showed have ordered a double, but if I had, I would have had no room for fries. I&#39;ve tried both the cajun and the regular and I have to say I like the plain old salted fries to their cajun. I love cajun seasoning on many things, but I feel that their cajun season is a bit lacking. Can&#39;t say what it was, but I feel that their fries themselves don&#39;t need anything other than a little salt. Also if you plan on ordering a large, you only need one order for two full size adults and even then I am sure you&#39;ll end up with more than you can eat in one sitting.

If you are person who loves hamburgers, it is certainly worth a visit. I just found out that there is one in SoCal and another not too far from Long Beach opening up, so although I will NEVER give up my In-N-Out, I now have variety in where I can go to get a hamburger."

That averages out to the 3.5 I originally wanted :-). I still get heaps of fries. I&#39;ve order both kinds now (I like the Cajun better. However, they&#39;re still not crunchy. They&#39;re soggy.

I looked around at this spacious parking lot under a crystal clear sky. I noticed there were a lot of older people. Ok, age is just a number, but elders know what the best is. That was why I felt at ease immediately. 

There&#39;s a gas station, which offers prices very comparable with most stations in town. So, no need to hunt for bargains before returning the rental car. 

Then, there were lots of eateries to choose from. I like the clean bathroom, children&#39;s area and free WiFi. Best of all, I was only 7 minutes away from the airport arrival area. When it&#39;s timed right, there would be no waiting from the moment he walked outside to getting on my car. Well, not quite.

Both visits left us with incorrect food, one trip had good cajun fries and the other did not.  The staff was fairly unfriendly during both of our visits and specifically the ones taking orders were rude. 

I expect the opening of a new place to not be totally on the up and up but i expect greatness on my second trip and especially for $28 for 2 people to eat, thats expensive by any fast food standards.

Its a good location next to the best liquor store in town but if they cant get it together it will lose bysiness fast, we shall see."

Kind of run-of-the-mill joint.  I would say that there was no seasoning on the burger, the bacon tasted like it was on the south side of old, and the fries were under-cooked. The thing that garnered two stars for me, however, was that I saw one of the guys who was working there picking his teeth then he put on gloves without washing his hands.  What&#39;s the point of the gloves now since you had to use that hand to put the glove on, thus contaminating them?!  Thank goodness he wasn&#39;t handling my food, though he was trying to prepare a shake for another customer."

My burger was pretty good both times but this is the loudest place that I have ever eaten.
 The kitchen staff seemed to be competing to see who could scream the loudest and most often. Every time the door opened they would holler 2 or 3 at the door and I have no idea why.
 It seemed totally unnecessary since the cashiers were both facing the door anyway.
 It&#39;s better then the big chains but if i ever go there again it will be for take out.

I enjoyed my meal. It gets I busy in the evening on weekends but still a good place. The all you can eat for $24.99 is not bad too. It needs to be clear that it&#39;s per person. The all you can eat is worth it if you find yourself and the other person eating more than 6 different rolls. You&#39;ll spend more between the two of you for just 6 different rolls because prices very. You can also add a regular menu item to the all you can eat at no extra cost for all you can eat.

I like that they have unlimited sushi, and you get to order you rolls fresh made from their little paper buffet menu. The sushi buffet located where I live just has all of the food out buffet style, so it&#39;s not really fresh. The service here is a bit spotty, and it definitely isn&#39;t the cleanest restaurant I&#39;ve visited. The food is quite good, though, but they do pretty small portions, especially during lunch - assuming so because the prices are quit a bit lower than the regular prices. Also, if you do decide to go during lunch, make sure you go when they first open, otherwise you&#39;ll be standing outside waiting for who knows how long while they try to clear people out after they finish their meals."

I had the buffet and I order a miso soup which was salty probably from the packet, I had veggie roll which from EVERYWHERE else is avocado and cucumber and this one was avocado and something else that looks like old avocado cause it was brown, California roll, the crab meat was all creamy and just a weird taste and texture and a shrimp tempura it had a this weird ass sauce like just gross.

Finding fresh fish is difficult unless it&#39;s flown in regularly. I don&#39;t think Sushi Katsu does this but they are good quality for AYCE.

The All You Can Eat is $25pp and has a large menu that includes appetizers, sushi rolls, and nigiri. If you eat nothing else, try the teriyaki salmon and salmon nigiri. Both melt in your mouth like butter! The rolls were hit or miss.

Do yourself a favor, if you come here and pretend it&#39;s and eating competition for the Guinness book of world records be sure to avoid any roll with jalapeño because it will ruin your day, unless you&#39;re into self-torture."

Found this place on Yelp and yet again a Yelp success. For $25 it truly was an AYCE experience including the special roles. The highlight for my dining companion and I was the eel nigiri. I&#39;m not typically an eel fan but we both agreed that was some of the best tasting eel we have ever had. We must have ordered around 16 pieces to share. I liked that everything was made to order and even with that in mind and a busy night service was quick.

The AYCE is a great deal and there is no limit (but don&#39;t be wasteful). The ladies room was odd in the fact that they stored all of the extra order sheets in there.  So there are boxes stacked up in the corner and you can&#39;t even open the door all the way. I would guess that doesn&#39;t meet ADA standards.

Whenever I had to eat sushi before knowing about this place, I always would spend nearly $100 to get my fill of sushi. Not anymore! For $25 ($15 for lunch and limited menu) Sushi Katsu provides me with a happy and full belly every time I eat here! The quality of the sushi is very good as well! 

For those worried about being sick at an all-you-can-eat sushi place...I have never been sick at all! Eating here over a dozen amount of times. The only problem would be overeating a few times when my eyes were bigger than my stomach. If you do not finish what you order, you will get charged for the food not eaten. I don&#39;t know what exactly, but please just be smart with what you and your party order and don&#39;t be mad when you are charged because you couldn&#39;t finish what you ordered. That being said, expect there to be a wait, since the restaurant itself is pretty small and every time I have gone for dinner, the place was always packed!

I love eating here because you&#39;re not limited to just sushi, at least for the dinner. You can also get appetizers, other entrees, such as teriyaki chicken or beef. This works perfectly if you&#39;re like me and like to switch up flavors and textures throughout your meal or just crave another menu item to eat.

There were also great drink specials going on at times as well, just ask your server. Highly recommend this restaurant! One of my all time favorites to eat at here in the Denver Metro area! :)"

A friend and I did the all you can eat dinner. It&#39;s a really great deal if you like to eat a lot of sushi. The waitress came take our drink order and forgot me? I don&#39;t know. She took my friend&#39;s beer order and never asked me anything, just walked away. I had to stop her when she brought my friend&#39;s beer so I could order some sake. Then she looked annoyed that I had stopped her. We ordered an array of sushi, miso soup, tempura calamari and edamame. The tempura batter was off putting. There was something off about it that I can&#39;t quite describe. I would not get anything tempura from here again. The sushi, everything we ordered, was great! We got everything in a timely manner. The service, after the drink issue, was still subpar. They were not friendly. You had to make a show of stopping on of the people coming by your table or they would be gone faster than they had appeared. 4 stars because I really enjoyed the sushi."

Food wise, my faves are the Alaskan, Spicy Tuna, Phili and the Volcano. The food are always good, but length of wait to order, to be served and for our ticket was ridiculous.

We got seated right away however it took our waitress more then 15 mins to get our drink order in. After that we got them delivered by another waitress.
 
We were finally able to place our first order of all you can eat sushi. It was disappointing to get our sushi before the appetizers. That&#39;s where everything went sour. 

Imagine getting sushi that has cold rise and the fish is room temperature. Some pieces actually smelled fishy! 

After each plate that came it was quickly picked up and then we sat for 10+ mins awaiting on the next dish. Now I understand it&#39;s cooked to order but when you have 5 sushi chefs and three of them were just standing around and a restaurant is only a third way full this is just insane. We spent a total of an hour and half there. We didn&#39;t even bother ordering more, the first order was more then plenty of this crazy service and smelly sushi.

There were a few, with only a couple being worth a fish skin. Being new to the area, and having some time on my hands, I decided today was &#34;Treat Yo Self 2016&#34;!  I had done my research (Googled and Yelped the category) and saw that I lived a few mintutes from a sushi place that would let me bash my open mouth against a table of endless sushi. I slapped on my eating shorts, complete with an adjustable waist band, and headed out.  I short drive down Havanna, and just north of Iliff, I arrived around 515pm, since they start offering the dinner menu after 430. The dinner menu has a bit more to offer and I wanted to experience this place for all it had to offer.  From what I saw when I pulled in, everyone else felt the same. It was packed.  People were waiting outside.  I parted the sea of people and found a &#34;Can I Help You&#34; to take down my name.  I was traveling in a large group of one, so I let them know I would be very ok with a seat by the sushi bar.  15 minutes later, I was where I wanted to be.

  So, at first glance, the place isn&#39;t huge, but it seems like the perfect size. It didn&#39;t feel cramped at all. It fit the rush.  It was busy but not chaotic and it was easy to move about. I was seated by the sushi bar, my own lil corner of it.  I had an empty spot next to me, so I figured it would be my &#34;extra storage&#34; area.  I was given my sushi list, and saw a lot to catch my interest.  It was a pretty good selection of your standard issue salads, apps, rolls and such.  Some were things I&#39;d never seen, so you know I ordered it. What really got me all hot and beefy was this lil box, on the bottom right, that had the instructions that said I could write in &#34;regular sushi item from the menu at no additional charge&#34;. Ok...what?  I took this as any roll in the entire menu was fair game.  I asked the server, and sure enough, if I wanted a roll from the full menu, that wasn&#39;t on the little paper, just write it in and it will be mine...all mine.

  I ended up ordering 6 rolls, some baked jalapeno thing, an octopus salad, a hot dish called The Dynamite, and some choice nigiri.  I had no complaints eating almost all of this.  I may have left a couple bites left, but I really enjoyed what I had.  Was it the best I have every had. No. They tasted good, though some had some flimsy construction.  A couple fell apart in my hands.  Other than that, all the components tasted fresh, the nigiri had a nice texture, and the rice was pretty good too.  Some rolls weren&#39;t my favorite but I didn&#39;t not like them.  They weren&#39;t bad, they just weren&#39;t working for my personal tastes.  Not a complaint.  

  Service was good, giving how hectic things were.  I didn&#39;t mind the wait at all, being as I expected some sort of a wait on a Saturday night.  My water stayed full, as I recieved my train of food.  At one point it did get a little overwhelming because it all came at the same time or in close proximity.  Lesson learned for the next visit.  

  So, in closing, I can say I approve this place.  Sure it&#39;s not the end all, be all, of the best sushi this town has to offer, but I&#39;d have zero reservations as to put it on the top of my go to list of places to get my sushi fix.  With a slightly under $30 bill, for one person, you really can&#39;t go wrong!"

1. We waited for our food for a good 40 minutes before a simple salad came out.
2. What shocked us the most was when The waitresses pushed our table next to another table whilst we were sitting there without asking us. Both parties were uncomfortable as we were literally touching arms with the other party next to us.
3. When we went to the bathroom, the toilet was clogged and below par the health standards. 
4. It took us 4 waitresses to get our check after waiting 20 minutes for it.

They allow you to pretty much order anything off the menu, except certain type of rolls.  My brother took me here last night and I really enjoyed it  The quality of the sushi is pretty good, not the best, but what do you expect from a place that offers all you can eat!  The rolls were neatly done and the food tastes good.  The service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy that night.  I like the variety that you can chose from.  You can order any appetizer, soups, etc.   I would recommend this place for a good night of sushi smashing.  Give this place a try!"

Sushi Katsu, where have you been all my life?  Oh wait, just down the road from the apartment I lived at for 5 years and now too far for me to go regularly.  But maybe that&#39;s a good thing; I sure don&#39;t need to be stuffing my face with delicious sushi until I need to switch to my Thanksgiving pants.

Is it the best sushi in town?  No, but it is still pretty darn good!  $15 for AYCE for lunch.  I&#39;m sold and will be back!"

They usually hand out a survey card after we pay, and they were smart enough not to hand us one because of the terrible service we got.

It was the first time I had ever been to an all you can eat sushi place. This place used to offer an online 15% off coupon, but I guess they started losing money on it and had to stop it. Even at full price this place is well worth it! 

All of their sushi tastes fresher than most of the other all you can eat sushi places in the area. My favorite is the unagi nigiri (eel on rice with eel sauce).  It&#39;s fun to go with a group, a couple of friends, or even by yourself. You can sit at the sushi bar and watch them prepare your meal which was cool to watch.

You put in a written order by marking off what you want. I think the majority of the times I go they lose track of a few of my orders. This isn&#39;t much of a big deal cause you can always order more. Just becareful cause I&#39;ve done that and gotten twice the amount I wanted since there was a double order. 

The wait staff has always been very friendly and I hardly ever see the bottom of my glass. We&#39;ve come in at 2:00 a couple of times right when they do last call and just order a large one time order. If you go right when they open you get your food a lot faster though, and are given more attention since there are less people. At dinner they have a larger menu and can order any roll on the real menu for free. The dinner all you can eat though is more expensive. 

This will probably continue to be one of my favorite places to go to for all you can eat sushi."

I love Sushi, and Sushi Katsu does not compromise quality just because of the quantity. I&#39;ve eaten at Sushi Katsu dozens of times since finding it in 2012, and have never had a bad experience with the food, the staff or the service. 

From the all-you-can-eat menu I highly recommend the tuna nigiri and the octopus, which are always very fresh and flavorful. From the maki rolls, try the rainbow roll or tuna and scallions. When the white fish is available, give it a try even if you are not a &#39;fish&#39; person, it&#39;s a very subtle flavor with a buttery texture. 

The only criticisms I have is the limited and often cramped seating space, as well as the frequent difficulty in getting a reservation/name on the list when the place is really busy. 

It is worth the wait, but I would recommend calling ahead by at least a half hour to have your reservation made, and get your name on the list, you will be much happier when you show up and get to skip the line outside. 

Pro-tip: If you are all alone for lunch, or maybe just two people, ask to be seated at the sushi bar, spots clear out pretty quickly, and the larger parties never want to be seated in a row along the sushi bar."

I went during the lunch time and got there right at 11:20 am and was seated right away. They were very quick with the first order that we put in, but it was noticeable that they got extremely busy and took a while to get us another menu for a second round. I don&#39;t know if that was to hope you would feel full if they hold you out or that they were that slammed. After finally getting our second round we were ready for the check, in which everyone was so frantically carrying orders that it took a full 25 minutes to find someone to assist us. I would definitely come back because the food tasted good and the price at lunch $14 per person is too good to pass up. I won&#39;t come if i&#39;m trying to eat within an hour lunch break."

Sushi katsu is a cute and homey restaurant where you can get some decent sushi and other delicious Japanese food for a very reasonable price. With tip and tax, my total came out to $15 because I found a coupon that was 15% off lunch buffet which ends at 2:30pm. Make sure if you are going for lunch or dinner not including Saturdays, you have the coupon printed and ready!

My favorite sushi are the salmon skin and spicy tuna. They come out delicately decorated with a sweet sauce on top of this wooden flat tray. I also got miso soup which was warm and delicious on a snowy day. I personally really liked the chicken fried rice but my boyfriend thought it was too sweet. I liked the sweet taste and the texture of the chicken. In addition, i tried the fried tofu and combination tempura which I thought was alright. A bit greasy to my likely. I absolutely adored the scallop nigiri. It&#39;s a creamy scallop mix on top of white rice wrapped with nori. Oh, and the edamame was nice as well. Basically, just go hungry and try everything you think you might like! That&#39;s the beauty of a buffet, you don&#39;t need to read about what I enjoyed, go try it for yourself!

I would definitely come back for lunch! Not to mention the service was excellent around 2pm on a weekday =) food came out like magic, super quick. i was so happy =)"

The good: food is amazing. All you can eat sushi options? And even at lunch the selection isn&#39;t half bad. The lunch prices are pretty reasonable about 16$. And the waitresses and waiters are super nice! The atmosphere is nice and clean. The bathrooms are clean.

The bad: if you don&#39;t show up right when they open, you may find yourself waiting in line. On the same roll of opening, they happen to close from 2-4:30 to set up for dinner. Once that switch happens you better be ready from the 16$-28$ price switch from lunch to dinner. The wait staff is sometimes a little forgetful and so that order of beef teriyaki may not come for a bit.

Our friends love it here so we decided to give it another go. Glad we did! Jenny, our server, was fantastic. Funny, attentive and very nice. Everything we ordered was delicious and fresh.

We had to ask 3 times for our water to be refilled.
They NEVER came back to take a second &#34;all you can eat&#34; order.
The dirty plates were left on the table. I had to ask for them to be taken.
They told us AFTER  we ordered the all you can eat that last call was in 30 minutes! 
The bathrooms seemed to be used as a storeroom as well.....boxes piled up with papers everywhere.

I never leave without a sushi baby in my belly. The dinner menu is much better than the lunch menu because there are special rolls on it and wider options overall, but there is a $10 price difference, $14.95 and $24.95 respectively. I love the Spicy Scallops, Unagi Ngiri, Caterpillar Roll, Volcano Roll and the 911 Roll. The sushi roll pieces are made just right for the mouth, not too big, and just enough rice, so you can taste the flavors of all the components of the roll. Be careful though, they will charge you for what you order and dont eat, to discourage wastefulness. Small quibble this last visit: the fried calamari was overcooked and rubbery. However, the service was really fast and relatively friendly even though the place was packed and there was a wait for a table. The place couldve been cleaner but it wasnt bad.

I stopped by last week for a quick bite while I was out and about and it was just OK.  However, one thing really sticks out that bothers me and I thought everyone needed to know about it.  I was sitting at the bar on the roll side and one of the sushi chefs reached in his pocket and pulled out his phone.  His hands were still gloved for food prep and he started swiping and poking at the screen.  He saw me looking at him and shoved it back in his pocket and with the same gloved hands, started to handle food again.  He has a piercing through his cheek, so I hope that if the management or health department reads this, you can identify him.  Cell phones are covered in germs and filth and that filth went on to the next order he prepared.  I stopped eating and left.  I didn&#39;t get sick, but that was disgusting.  If you&#39;re handling food, you need to take that seriously.  This person does not take what he does seriously.  Be warned before you eat here."

Ended up trying this place out. It was a Saturday and we arrived just before 5pm. Walking in, we noticed the place was busy. We stood at the front entrance for quite some time with many servers passing by us without an acknowledgement or eye contact. At first we weren&#39;t sure if we should seat ourselves or wait. Listen, I get you are busy, but a simple &#34;we&#39;ll be with you as soon as we can&#34; would suffice. Finally got seated and the server immediately left us to figure everything out. We ended up asking the table next to us how the all you can eat worked and such. We waited a good 30 minutes before we received our food and the servers were so busy that they would drop off the food and leave so fast that you could not ask them for anything! We had no plates or silverware. My husband ended up going over to a work area and rummaged to find some plates and chopsticks for us. 

Sushi was actually pretty good despite the service. We enjoyed all of the rolls that came to our table. Only issue, we ordered several rolls that never came. We also had our 2.5 year old with us in which we ordered udon noodles for. They never came and when I inquired about them, the server asked me if I ordered them (maybe she forgot that she was the one who wrote them down when I initially ordered them). It took another 15-20 min for us to finally get the noodles! 

Again, I get that they were busy, but it just seemed so unorganized. Our whole dining experience ended up being just under two hours and we still didn&#39;t get at least 5 items we initially ordered. 

With all that said, sushi was pretty good, and the only way I would go back is if it were during a time in where they were not busy. 

I would actually give them 1 star for service, but did 3 stars total because the sushi was pretty good."

Their chicken fried rice is the best entree there in my opinion. It is a huge proportion and I always have extra left overs for dinner. It tastes great with a side of the eel sauce drizzled on top. There is a lot of flavor included in the dish especially the onion and garlic.

The only bad thing about this restaurant is the service. Typically the wait to get in is fairly sort, but once in I feel like I never have the chance to speak with my waiter and end up asking requests from others.

For dinner it was $24 per person. You can order pretty much anything off of the menu and from my understanding, there&#39;s more variety at dinner. 

So the sushi was just ok. Nothing amazing. I realized that many of the rolls had imitation crab meat in it, which I&#39;m not sure is worth too much to the customer. Not to me anyway. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a filler. Ordered a lot of nigiri and those pieces were much smaller than you&#39;d usually get at another restaurant. could be good, could be bad depending on how you look at it. The fish itself was fine, not the greatest I&#39;ve had. One compliment I do have is that the sushi itself was rolled nicely. They were small and neatly rolled. 

The food comes out really fast too. You can write your orders on the paper menu they give you and it&#39;s at your table very quickly. The service was pretty good, though they were really not great with refilling waters. They just give you the one cup and that&#39;s all you get. 

They do BOGO drinks before 7, which was nice. However I think it&#39;s a filler so order wisely. 

Not sure I&#39;d return. I guess if you go to a sushi buffet, it&#39;s not going to blow your mind but it&#39;ll kill the craving."

-You have not had high quality sushi before (you don&#39;t know better)
-You are really looking for a sushi bargain 
-You have a strong stomach

I dated a guy for a while who is so cheap he would always insist coming here. it was fun to go with a big group. The food is good especially considering the price, they actually have an impressive selection of all you can eat items. They do put a lot of rice on it though, they want you to get full. They will charge you if you don&#39;t finish it. 

The last time we came here though, we ordered sashimi and rolls which were raw, and the temperature of the fish was not right. It was way too warm for raw fish. This could have made us sick, luckily it didn&#39;t, but I definitely have no plans of coming back. If I want sushi I go for the good stuff, but if you meet the criteria mentioned above, go for it."

Came in around 8:30 and the place closes at 10 there wasn&#39;t any wait. Here are my issues: One of the our waitresses (because we had like 3 different ones) didn&#39;t know anything about the menu, I would ask her something and she would say let me go ask, this happened at least 3 times. Around 9:30 they told us to hurry up and put in any other order because the kitchen was closing... I don&#39;t think its ok for them to rush us if they are open UNTIL 10 they should serve until 10. and then we finally put in our order one of the servers made us feel like fat asses for ordering more food! Finally we were sitting right next to the bar and you would think it would be easy to get the attention from a server but they walk by like you don&#39;t exist!!

Like, super duper hard.

How often will you fill up on sushi without emptying out your wallet? Not very. But the AYCE here makes the proposition so reasonable that I have yet to try anything else. Yes, you can - and should - sample some non-sushi items off of the unlimited menu, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d ever go to Katsu and grab a regular entree. I can only imagine you&#39;d find yourself jealously eyeing your neighbor&#39;s unending mountain of fish. That&#39;s no way to live your life. You deserve better than that.

So why 4 stars? Well, simply put, the sushi is just...okay. The quality/quantity seesaw can only teeter so far in one direction without the other suffering. It&#39;s not terrible, but you will get some nigiri with questionable rice:fish ratios. The rolls are particularly guilty of this, but if you&#39;re ordering rolls to begin with, you already know the drill.

A few other points: Don&#39;t expect a quick in-and-out meal around prime times. The lunch rush is real and dinner can be just as tricky. Arriving early is your best  bet."

And being as landlocked as this state is, I especially did not believe that I&#39;d be served anything fresh.

I&#39;d like to also point out that my ratings for sushi buffets are on a different standard (yah...a lower one...since the quantity not quality is often a selling point for buffets) than would be for a regular sushi restaurant. 

That being said, Sushi Katsu does not fall below other sushi buffets I&#39;ve tried back in CA. It was fresher than I believed it would be and I definitely satisfied my sushi cravings. For around $24 (dinner) you can stuff yourself to the rafters with specialty rolls, salad, tofu appetizers, nigiri, gyoza, calamari, BBQ beef, chicken and pork dishes, maki, scallop appetizer dish thing (I think it was called Dynamite), etc. 

So maybe it&#39;s more Korean than Japanese and maybe some of the rolls are so fried and filled with cream cheese and uberly sweet brown sauce stuff BUT, there really isn&#39;t anything better than this in Aurora. Therefore it gets a deserving 4 stars (&#34;yay im a fan&#34;).

And unlike other sushi buffets I&#39;ve been to that made the all you can eat stuff ahead of time, Katsu actually had dishes made to order. 

As for the ambiance, this place is pretty chill. Brick walls with horribly splattered grout, worn wood tiles, lanterns and wooden tables with straw mats here and there... it felt like I was in Japan; if I knew what being in Japan felt like...

It opens late on the weekends and was rather crowded even at 9PM on the Friday that I went. You wouldn&#39;t be able to tell from the parking lot but this place seems popular."

Of all the sushi restaurants in Denver, Sushi Katsu has the best! Their nigiri sushi is a perfect size; the cut of fish to the amount of rice ratio is good, and it is small enough for a one bite experience. Also because it&#39;s AYCE, the small size helps so you can get all the types of nigiri sushi you want to try. 

I also enjoy their rolls. My favorites are the Yellow Brick roll and Volcano roll. The Yellow Brick is on the sweeter side, making it great for the times I don&#39;t feel like eating spicy stuff. The Volcano roll is also good; it&#39;s not as spicy as the name implies, which I appreciated. 

The only reason why I gave it a 4/5 rating instead of 5/5 is because the place doesn&#39;t seem as clean and tidy as their other location. The last time I came, I sat at the sushi bar with my friends. One of my friends got a really sad fold chair instead of the regular ones. Poor thing, he didn&#39;t want to ask for a better chair because he didn&#39;t want to be a bother. The table at the bar was also sticky. That was a turnoff the entire time I was there. There is also boxes just lying on the side of the rooms.

We got there just after 7pm on a Friday; we didn&#39;t wait for a table, opting to sit at the sushi bar. It was one of the few times, if ever, I haven&#39;t ordered the all you can eat option. We got the lobster roll, Denver Roll, Philadelphia Roll, and the Spider Roll. Since we were waiting a bit, which I really didn&#39;t even notice, the waitress gave us a house salad on the house. I love the salad dressing at Sushi Katsu; so, the free salad was awesome for me. The guy really didn&#39;t seem into veggies, but he did like the edamame he ordered.

The Denver Roll was a bit odd, but I like cucumbers. It would have been a bit better if the cucumber skin was all removed--it&#39;s actually not good for Vitamin K levels. I had to use my hands to pick up the roll pieces because the cucumber didn&#39;t really stay together like seaweed paper.

I would not have ordered the Philadelphia Roll, personally; I just don&#39;t really get excited about that roll since it seems so common. The lobster roll was my favorite last night, though; so, the date got a couple of points for that one.

Okay, so you already know that this is a place focused on quantity at the sacrifice of quality. Let me start by saying it&#39;s not THAT bad... slightly better than the store bought variety. The sushi rice is made somewhat sloppily, meaning there&#39;s a whisper of vinegar/sugar but otherwise it&#39;s quite bland. The cuts of fish are definitely on the smaller side, you may get a tendon or two out of a dozen, and the rice to fish ratio is somewhat high. But for $15, snobby critiques be damned, this is a good place to waddle out of a restaurant full from sushi. 

The lunch time menu is quite limited if you&#39;re a roll-oriented person... the most basic cali, philly, caterpillar, etc. At night the price jumps to $25 but you get access to nearly ALL of the rolls... but at that point you may as well take your money to Hapa, Sushi Den, etc."

michael was my server, and he was super awesome.  i knew exactly what i wanted, and he was 100% supportive if my choices.  started with the valium cocktail with mezcal - delicious - and i even ate the macerated cherries!  i ordered: king crab, roti with duck, and the mister tuna toast.  the king crab completely blew my mind - and i rarely saw this. the portion was actually really good for the price - large chucks of crab, and that brown butter sauce! i&#39;d like to have that drizzled over everything i eat from here on out forever. the flavor combination with diced apples was insane. i almostttt got a second order of this dish, but thought better of it.

the roti with duck was really flavorful, but it&#39;s hard to follow the crab dish to be honest.  i really enjoyed the mediterranean spices on the roti - michael suggested folding it up and i made a mess lol. but nomsies.  michael brought out little tastes of wine to pair with the roti dish - so nice! it does made the experience much more fun cuz i could tell how the italian varietal and the santa barbara pinot paired differently.  lastly, the mister tuna toast was the most disappointing dish. the toasts on which the tuna and eggplant caponata mix rested was DRENCHED in olive oil, and it was overly salted.  super overwhelming as the last course - good thing i ordered another cocktail to wash it all down. i did finish all the toasts, dont get me wrong - it was still good, just could use WAY less oil and salt.

overall - i&#39;d definitely come back to mister tuna again! really great flavors and lots more to try from the menu, not to mention really good service!"

We order the ceviche scallops which were over pickled and there was one scallop. We should have ordered the poke, but the server didn&#39;t recommend it. We ordered the mussels which were slightly fishy and also not Hawaiian. We ended with the sea bream which we enjoyed and was cooked Hawaiian style. We had a deconstructed pumpkin for desert and it was tasty. 
I had a signature cocktail that was weak on the liquor I switch to the Hitchingpost Pinot Noir that was great. For future reference you can&#39;t buy it at a liquor store. We tried to after we left but found out that it&#39;s from the Hitchingpost restaurant featured in the movie Sideways. 
Lastly, our server stranded us after leaving the check and we ended up tracking down another server to pay our bill. 
All in all we were really looking forward to yummy Hawaiian cuisine and were sadly disappointed"

We were walking around the RINO district looking for a place to eat and not having much luck. We asked a random woman who was talking down the street if she had any suggestions and it turns out her name was Haley and she worked here. We took her recommendation and an Uber and less than five minutes later were seated.

This is a tapas style restaurant that serves an eclectic mixture of seafood, pork, vegetables, and beef. At first I was unsure how Tapas seafood would work out but boy and I glad I ordered.

First off, before you do anything else, order the King Crab, don&#39;t think about it, just do it. This is the most delicious and beautiful presentation of King Crab I&#39;ve ever had. The texture was firm and flaky and pure delicious. If we hadn&#39;t already ordered several other plates, I&#39;d have definitely ordered this at least two more times.

We also had the pork and the crimini mushrooms and several other dishes. The pork was so tender and juicy it literally melted in your mouth. The crimini mushrooms were the only dish of the night that I was ambivalent about, they weren&#39;t bad but they were not as good as everything else. I&#39;d pass on these next time.

I wanted to order the strip steak entree but was out voted by my girlfriend (still trying to figure out how that works) and we got the salmon instead. It was divine (I&#39;m beginning to see why the girlfriend wins in these situations). The preparation was perfect, the flavor burst from the dish and I couldn&#39;t eat it slow enough. I wanted another and that is a rarity for me. By the time you get to this section of the meal, if you&#39;ve tried a few things, splitting and entree is smart because they are sizable.

Now for the really good part, cocktails and dessert. The bartender mixing the drinks is a craftsman. Each drink is perfectly balanced and each note accented by the careful combining. I had three different cocktails, all off the menu and they were all exceptional. I&#39;d come here just to drink if I were in the mood for cocktails. The bar and restaurant is very modern with great art and comfortable seating. There are two desserts on the menu and both are impressive but for me the brownie was the standout for sure.

We sat on the patio and the whole wall rolls up so you can easily move between inside and out. I only had two complaints, first the music was too loud, I&#39;m not sure if they did that to cover my second complaint which was road noise. The road while not exceptionally busy is very loud. Combine that with loud music and talking becomes a bit of a chore. 

If this isn&#39;t one of the fastest up and coming restaurants in Denver I&#39;ll be shocked. Don&#39;t miss an opportunity to dine here and take the advice of the waitstaff, they know exactly what they are talking about when it comes to ordering. And, take some time, this is a foodies dream come true."

We ordered the king crab appetizer, ricotta toast bread, gnocchi, and the 16 oz pork collar. The food is impeccable. Prices of the menu ranged from $6 dollars and the most expensive were $78 for a 30oz dry aged Angus - who eats 30oz of steak to themselves?! If you can, you, my friend, are awesome!  The vibe of the restaurant is casual and relaxed, which I loved. One note about the parking - parking is limited, however, there is a valet service that is provided."

But even more impressive, the service and food timing was on point which is nearly impossible feat for a restaurant 11 days old when I visited.

We started with a couple cocktails at the bar, before moving to be seated at the chef&#39;s counter. We started with the Ahi Poke. Wow! I am a huge poke fan and this may be the best I&#39;ve ever had. In addition to the standard poke ingredients it has quinoa, hearts of palm, and avocado. The tuna was incredibly fresh and soaked up the garlic, soy sauce, and chili sauce. Our server told us that the hearts of palm get sent from Hawaii from a friend of Charlie&#39;s to ensure their freshness. It is a must order on the menu!

We also had the House Ricotta Toast and Charcoal Roasted Summer Peppers. They were both fine, but compared to the other things we had they weren&#39;t as memorable. 

Next, we had the lamb pizza. I am not a huge lamb fan, but I would order this pizza again in a heartbeat. The lamb is tender and not overpowering, like it can be at times. The spinach is julienned so its spread evenly on the pizza and the fontina cheese is sprinkled throughout the pizza, offering a earthy and mushroomy tasting balance to the lamb.

In addition to the ahi poke that I am still thinking about, I am still drooling over the Roti Taco. My co-worker exclaimed after his first bite &#34;wow if I could have this every day, I&#39;d be happy forever.&#34; I agree 100%! The duck was unbelievable tender, on a house made tortilla, with a tabbouleh style salsa. So many flavors, all perfectly balanced!

We heard so many great thinks about the Heritage Pork Collar from the cooks and servers, we decided we couldn&#39;t miss it no matter how full we were when we ordered it and we are glad we didn&#39;t. I have never had a more tender piece of pork. There was a bold crust on the outside from a perfect char. The tangy pickled mustard seed definitely highlighted the juicy pork.

Since we were looking at them all night, we also tried a chef&#39;s choice from the pickled jars. Our favorite was the pickled watermelon. It was fun to try things we had never had pickled before.

Can&#39;t wait to come back to try the other things on the menu that we missed and were too full to try!"

They serve up original fare ranging from their Hawaiian style fish dishes to local Colorado lamb chops. I had the king crab and it tasted so fresh. The peach salsa was a perfect accompaniment to balance the butter sauce. I then tried the tuna toast with eggplant/red pepper spread. It was again a great original dish I had not had before. They drizzled chili oil over top to give it a bite.

My main course was the rack of lamb. I was in search of local Colorado lamb for my visit and I am so happy I decided on Mister Tuna. I asked for it to be prepared to chefs liking which was medium rare. It was not gamy and had amazing taste. It&#39;s accompaniments were corn purée, a sort of Demi glaze, corn, green bean and watermelon salad. I also had the watermelon tequila drink which was super refreshing while not being too sweet.

My experience at Mister Tuna was made perfect by the outstanding service. From when I called to ask about availability, to the hosts, my waitress, the manager and to the chefs. Thank you!"
mister-tuna-denver,Steven B.,1xJt3jMREtMxL0zWEaWryA,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,1,1,62,354,XEMYMr4LeKflVuMGMFBYEg,5.0,2016-09-23,"A nice addition -- and downright delicious. The drinks were delicious -- and wonderfully crafted. Here&#39;s an example: Their take on a Monkey Gland (a personal favorite)-- their Inverted Monkey Gland was pitch perfect with Matahari Absinthe, Tanqueray gin, Orange and Pomegranate. Barb &amp; Richard was also delicious: George Dickel Rye, Rhubarb, Lemon and Demerara. But maybe best of all, go in and ask the bartender to make something unique for you and they&#39;ll write it down in their recipe book and you can request it the next time you&#39;re in.

Wonderfully smoky delicious from the open kitchen, the space is open, yet intimate -- Mister Tuna is a superb addition for Troy Guard&#39;s family of restaurants. If you&#39;re local, you&#39;ll know him from Tag Burger Bar, Sugarmill or Lucky Cat in Lowry. A nice nod back to his family history in Hawaii -- the menu had some wonderful raw oysters and poké choices -- and the king crab is beautiful and delicious. Also don&#39;t be afraid of moving away from the seafood. The garganelli is made right their topped with a delicious combination of soffrito and pork ragu -- and it will melt in your mouth. The &#34;heritage&#34; pork color is slow cooked on the smoked rotisserie and is so tender it doesn&#39;t even need a knife. Greens are light and a nice compliment with watercress, mizen and homemade pickle mustard seeds. 

Simple appetizers are also a nice option -- such a the house ricotta toast with cured guanciale. Again the poké served elegantly on a bed of himalayan salt is quite possibly perfect. And the &#39;shroom flatbread with amazingly spicy calabrian chilis which dances wonderfully with the sautéed mushrooms, local goat cheese and garden greens -- and also woodsy crisp grilled.

For me, the RiNo is still a neighborhood that&#39;s a work in progress. It can be burdened with hipster pretentiousness in a few unsavory moments, but Mister Tuna is approachable and welcome in the Industry complex, now among so many new apartment and condo options. What a treat to have this as a local hangout within walking distance of people living in this neighborhood. And perfect year-round, hanging out on the deck during a warm summer night or feeling snug on a snowy day -- I&#39;ll definitely be bookmarking Mister Tuna as a first option to grab something delicious."

I thought the food here was very good--especially a small plate of roasted yams--and that the service was a bit weaker.  The people busing and bringing plates were intrusive and clueless.

The men&#39;s bathroom has a graffiti theme that not only looks trashy but is offensively sexist. Something about &#34;tits&#34; and also &#34;pussy and weed&#34; painted not by patrons but by the restaurant on the walls.  It was as if Donald Trump came in to do the painting.  I talked at length to the hostess about how offensive it was and suggested repainting it the next day.  I hope that other men will do the same.

I&#39;d also suggest that women who go to the restaurant (I noticed it was a majority women on a Thursday night) go into the men&#39;s bathroom, see for yourselves, and then confront the management."

Salt definitely gave the fish a great flavor. Dish was beautiful as well. Peppers were ok. The toast was to die for. I will be back here just for their toast.  Entrees were the vegetarian meal, steak, and pork collar. Everything was flavored well. Dessert was a brownie and peach dish. Both were great. Get here definitely."

We were ok eating in the bar area and enjoyed everything we had except for the oysters. At $42/dozen I would have expected them to be much better than they were. They were on average about the size of my thumbnail. Even if they had a decent flavor, their size was just way way way too small given their price-tag. In total our bill was over $300 for 3 ladies and we left still hungry!!!!"

Maybe my expectations were high based on the other reviews but I left feeling that I spent too much money on food that was just average.  The service was fine but not sure why they need three hostess behind one small stand especially when I had to go remind them we had a reservation a few times.  We had the king crab (good but super salty), tuna (good but really spicy-wish they would have warned us about that), gnocchi (no taste) and a sea bass special (bad- super bad).  I think other people might have tried other dishes and loved them but I just wasn&#39;t that impressed.  Cute place and drinks were ok but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back."

The GUARD AND GRACE bone it rib-eye...done...TAG sashimi...done...but on a 8&#34;salt plank, TAG BURGER sliders, no problem... But a wood fired WHOLE ROASTED FISH, roasted rabbit and even a duck confit taco that is the FRANKIEWORLD special not on the menu... The space is industrial meets NYC CHELSEA!!

We were there on a Friday evening around 7 pm. The place was about 1/3 full. By the time we left it was 3/4 full. Definitely a later crowd. But wow, it was not possible to converse without raising your voice 50-100%. I found myself not talking as much after a while. That aside, this is an interesting looking space with a huge patio facing Brighton Blvd. We came by for some apps and cocktails. It was a green hostess situation where she seemed distracted as we stood in front of her...took a moment to greet us, wasn&#39;t particularly welcoming. No big deal. We had the Charlie Guard Ahi Poke, Mister Tuna Toast, and Gnocchi. Each was good, but it seemed they were trying too hard to max out the number of ingredients---&#34;more is better.&#34; We were drinking a special of the night, a concoction with bourbon and blackberry puree. It was served on crushed ice. As a cocktail snob I hated that. The drink gets diluted quickly, and it wasn&#39;t very strong to begin with. Would not think &#34;great bar!&#34; when thinking Mister Tuna. This is a fine restaurant, but I wouldn&#39;t put it on my &#34;must go&#34; list. Like other Guard restaurants it feels a little &#34;corporate-y&#34; to me. If that&#39;s not detectable to you then you may like the commercial hipster sort of vibe they&#39;re going for."

The hostesses didn&#39;t quite seem to understand the notion that talking to people standing there waiting for any response at all is more important than just staring at the computer for 10 minutes. This happened to multiple parties as we waited. The place was also very understaffed and the waitress we had gave us an attitude when we sent some really undercooked food (the actual raw bar was delicious) back. The kicker was when she asked someone in my party if they&#39;d like a new glass when going from a white wine to a red and then proceeded to pour the red into some of the remaining white.

My girlfriend brought me here for my bday as I have liked Troy&#39;s other restaurants very much. The restaurant is very hip, and on a Friday night busy, but by no means packed. I have previously worked in upscale dinning for 10+ years as a server so know that the  server was by no means too busy, just absolutely abysmal.

This is one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had. Our drinks came out easily 15 minutes after we ordered them. We ordered two raw bar items, then 20-30 minutes later ordered two hot small plate items. The first hot item came out in under 5 minutes. Our server passing us by multiple times and we were unable to get her attention. Finally I went to the hostess stand and asked for the manager. She walked to our table, apologized, and asked my gf if she could get her another round. It was quite implied and from my restaurant experience, the easiest way to make up for a mistake is a free drink, but NOPE, still on our bill at the end. The manager then walked over to the open kitchen directly in front of us, it appeared the ticket was lost. Now our second hot item comes out. Easily another 25 minutes later, we finally get the ceviche and king crab one by one, with only the simple &#34;Sorry for the mix-up&#34; from the food runner. From ordering to table, it took over an hour for our apps to arrive. 

At this point, the server was so unavailable that we actually left out of frustration after waving her down for the bill as I was still hungry but we did not want to be there for another hour. We over hear the couple sitting next to us (the tables are very close, but tolerable) complaining about the same thing. Or as they said, &#34;Good food, but 2.5 hours for tapas is ridiculous.&#34; I am not sure if the waitress was worse or the inept manager who apologized and kept saying that is not what they are about, however failed to remedy the situation in any way whatsoever.  What a shame a good looking restaurant with great food is run so terribly."

We were just disappointed with the alcohol portions.  You get a 5 oz pour of wine for a $10-$15 glasses of wine.  They measure each pour, and a standard glass of wine is 6oz+ at any restaurant I&#39;ve been to.  Do the math, you&#39;re paying for 5 glasses of wine to equal a bottle.  Cocktails are $12+ and again, they pour measured amounts with jiggers.  I don&#39;t mind paying for a nice cocktail or glass of wine, but I feel a little cheated when a restaurant is pouring me $0.50 - $0.75 worth of alcohol for $12+!  Don&#39;t expect much bang for your buck on alcohol here.  A bottle of wine is probably your best bet - at least you know what you are getting for your money!"

Sometimes new restaurants need some time to hit their stride, this place was already running like a well oiled machine.

Then vegetables! Usually for two bowls of dark meat chicken, the total is around $12. Great deal!

All the food is so healthy and the options are endless. Like between salads, bowls, sushi and build your own bowls everything is available to customize. Even better is the food allergy awareness. They defiantly make sure to let food allergies aware of all ingredients. There are Gluten Free marks next to the GF options on the menu and also vegetarian and vegan options. I love the gluten free teriyaki sauce ! I love the Mahi bowl with chicken sub for mani and gf teriyaki !! So good with the tropical salsa and lemongrass aoli. I also Love the Ichingo salad and Nikko salad. All the food has always been great ! 

My problem is this Particular Location. The service is horrible. They are so unorganized and have horrible communication with each other. I waited 15 min for togo once and they were all running around like chickens with their head cut off because no one knew what was going on or who&#39;s food was who&#39;s. People had been waiting dining in for their meals for a long time and were complaining. I feel bad for the chefs that night though, because they were doing their job and were working fast and efficiently but it was all the other staff messing around getting nothing done.

Finally dared to go back and use the freebie and wish I hadn&#39;t bothered. The restaurant was empty, and the whole place looked dirty and disheveled.

The half dazed, glassy eyed young man at the counter took my to-go order - a bowl with chicken, teriyaki, udon noodles and the &#34;no brainer veg mix&#34; -- but with mushrooms instead of edamame.

When I got to my car, I was so disappointed. Instead of the &#34;No brainer&#34; veggie mix I had ordered, the ONLY veggies in there were edamame and mushrooms! Just a big ol&#39; serving of my least favorite veg on the menu!! Since it was to-go, I didn&#39;t go back in and complain.

I find myself craving the almighty, god-blessed, drool enducing Mojo Bowl. Succulent white chicken and a pillar of white rice with the perfect dose of the angelic sweet and sour sauce! That plus the crisp veggies just create the lovliest sensation! Mix that in with some sriracha and your mouth will sing to the angels.

When we tried to make a small comment on how we were in a hurry, she looked at us as if we were out of line! Again without an apology, basic customer service. The workers at this location need some guidance and classes if you are going to work in the customer service field. I will not come back to this location."

Sushi isn&#39;t high end, but then you aren&#39;t paying $20/roll either. For the price I was pleased. Try the Crab Cheese Wonton roll. Definately the best I had there and worth much more than they charged. We&#39;ll be returning for sure."

She introduced me to a world of tokyo bowl wonder. 

My favorite meal here is the Boulder Veggie Bowl with tofu and teriyaki sauce. If you don&#39;t want to be overly stuffed, I&#39;d suggest going light on the rice. I also enjoy the Nikko and Hookipa salads (they&#39;re true, colorful artistic creations, I tell you.)

I know it&#39;s not the sauce I like the greenI&#39;m cry sauce. This bowl as well though was all loaded with noodles hardly any veggies at all.

The tattooed, scruffy, older, not wearing a uniform cashier had a bad attitude and seemed mad that I wanted to use it. I showed him my ID as he asked for and then I asked him what I could get. He said I could get a bowl and a drink. I ordered the salmon bowl and he quickly told me I couldn&#39;t have salmon, white or dark chicken only he said. That&#39;s not the promo, it clearly says bowl OF YOUR CHOICE. I didn&#39;t argue, I got a white chicken bowl which was dry and pretty flavorless. This was a disappointing experience. So JOE, you either need to educate your employees on what the promotion is and tell them to be nice about it or, educate your customers that they specifically only get chicken (which I know isn&#39;t the case).

the rice/noodle bowls are just as good, but like i said, the sauces are every so slightly different that makes me think ...&#34;did they leave xxx out of the sauce&#34; or is it super fresh and the flavors havent melted together?

Short version, it&#39;s basically like Pei Wei with a much simpler, and more customizable menu.  We got our order to go, and I (unintentionally) totally embraced the &#34;I am not from here, I have never been here before&#34; shenanigans.  The young lady was patient and kind.  But, at the end of the day, when I asked what is &#34;Spicy-aki&#34; sauce, what is &#34;Dragon sauce.&#34;  I got vague descriptions like &#34;Teriyaki Sauce with red pepper flakes&#34; and &#34;several different chile sauces.&#34;  Maybe I expect too much, but I believe there is a substantial difference between Sriracha, Sambal, chili oil, and chili paste.  Maybe they don&#39;t want to bog down the concept with information overload.  Oh well.

The food was excellent.  The one complaint is the sauces, like their descriptions, were a bit flat.  I like Asian food that is complex with lots of flavor, and the sauces were not real deep.  A solid 3 to 3 and a half.  Like I said, I will certainly return soon."

Joe&#39;s original bowl is also my favorite.  Last stop was with no brainer (assorted vegi) and it was delish..

My next will be the various offerings of Salads with different protein choices..  For summer, ichigo (strawberry) salad with grilled chicken and popyseed dressing looked very appetizing.

Yummy!

While I am on my way to sit down the &#34;waiter&#34; skinny blonde kid who is in such a hurry he basically shoves my rice bowl in my hands while I am in line to get water from the fountain. I didn&#39;t even have time to think about choosing to a table. We then wait for the second bowl to come out the Udon Noodles. Which originally was my sister&#39;s bowl. Turns out she doesn&#39;t really like udon noodles so we switched because I don&#39;t mind them. I take some big bites because I just worked out and then I start in for another noticing this clurly black wirey hair. I pick it out thinking, well I am wearing a black fleece jacket maybe it is from that. I pick through my food a little more and I FOUND ANOTHER WEIRD LOOKING HAIR. I look at it a little closer, show my sister, sure enough it&#39;s another freaking PUBE!!!!! A THICK WIREY REDISH PUBE!! I immediately gag and take it to the front show the girl at the counter. She says &#34;I am sorry can I get you a new one?&#34; I decline and had to leave right away. It immediately made my stomach churn. Luckily we do not live far at all.

She ordered miso because usually it has more flavor than the &#34;regular&#34; ramen. Not in this case. It was VERY bland. No amount of condiments from the table or adding in some of my sauce from the combo bowl was helping this dish. We also looked too quick and thought the tofu in the picture was chicken. Totally our fault but tofu needs some kind of flavor to take on. 

On a side note, my combo bowl was good. And the new dragon sauce has a nice kick.

I love Tokyo Joes for what it is, but this ramen dish is a huge failure. Be warned."

I can dunk the pieces of tofu that I pull out of the soup into it. I love the Mahi Salad and the Salmon Bowl. Or is it the Mahi Bowl and the Salmon Salad?! I&#39;m never sure.... The Mango salsa is wonderful with the fish. The Boulder Bowl is really good, too... great for vegetarians. Get it with the Spicyaki sauce! You can ask for any sauce you want with the spring rolls... you don&#39;t have to get what comes with it on the menu. They have lots of sauces to choose from and they are all yummy. I absolutely loved the Shrimp Spring Roll... but , they took it off the menu for some reason. One time they made it for me anyway!  Now, they just make the chicken or the vegetarian ones.  I really like the Spicy Tuna Rolls. Not sure how sushi lovers will like them, but a sushi novice like me enjoys them. My boys always order white chicken bowls with brown rice and snow peas... no sauce. Yawn. But, they love it! I like the employees, too; friendly and quick. The restaurant seating is comfortable and casual, with interesting walls and small televisions at the bar seating. Oddly, they always seem to be tuned to cartoons... I&#39;m sure they would change them for you. The outside seating is lovely, too."

Their Americanized, pan-Asian fusion food is fairly healthy. The menu offers options for various diets (gluten free, sugar free, vegetarian, vegan, low carb). They have a great selection of loose-leaf tea.  This location has Wi-Fi and even a couple computers which appear to be for public use. 

I like getting the Kihei salad with salmon instead of Mahi. The Boulder bowl is good and healthy. My favorite item on the menu is hot tea.

It gets crowded at lunch/dinner time, so service slows down drastically. Finally receiving my food when everyone else at my table had nearly finished eating = inconvenient and awkward. Avoiding high traffic times effectively solves this problem."

I am a fan of the rice bowls, the vegetarian gioza as well as the Joe Roll with plenty of that spicy sprinkle seasoning. No it is not as good as a regular sushi restaurant but compared to store purchased sushi Tokyo Joe&#39;s does a good enough job in a fix. I eat here fairly regularly when I need a quick meal and I would say that 4 stars is pretty accurate for a quick service restaurant. It&#39;s like the Panera Bread of Sushi. I think it is also a great place to bring people if they say they will never eat sushi...It was how I got my fiancé eating raw fish. Like training wheels. :)"

Marion Street Tavern has these gorgeous floors and a beautiful, original ceiling you&#39;ll want to be in every bar you ever go to. The service was amazing and I felt like everything was worth what I paid for it. 

Guy friend loved the build your own burger option. Not gonna lie, it looked really good. If you go for the crabcake you won&#39;t be disappointed, either. I know this place is aimed at the booze and red meat crowd, but if you like to steer clear of red meat then I promise you&#39;ll find something yummy for yourself.

I moved from Denver to SoCal a few weeks ago and had my going away party here in mid-Sept.  They were so accommodating to reserve the front room for the night (based on # of people coming) and all the guests were raving about how awesome Brandon was (our server).  He was super friendly and attentive.  Thank you to Dusty, Adam and Brandon for making my going away party so special.

We pride ourselves in our &#34;brunch snob&#34; status and have been looking for a new place for a while. Marion Street was just what we were looking for!
We had a coupon for $5 bottomless mimosas and they were delicious and actually bottomless! Great service!!

Nice to see that they kept the antique ceiling and brick wall, everything was authentic as it was in the day-
Surprisingly the drinks were not expensive as I thought it would be for this neighborhood- We were lucky to find a parking across the street which is also rare-

The food was great, all three of us really liked our brunch. Our only complaint was the food could have been a little  warmer. It came out quickly and looked great, just a tad on the less warm side but not cold, just not hot.

The waffle battered sausage is pretty awesome.  Think sausage link dipped in funnel cake batter and served with sweet sauce and syrup.  Very dessert like but a good breakfast app. to share.

The bloody was good and not overpriced.

Food is reasonably priced and they obviously put some thought into the dishes.  Well done.

I have gone there twice since it opened and have had horribly slow service every time.  We have had to go to the bar to ask if we in fact had a server and could get menus after nobody coming up to our table for 15 minutes (I mean we got no acknowledgement whatsoever and it wasn&#39;t even that crowded) and where we have had to go to the bar to get our own drinks when the waiter never returned to our table.

Beers are average price and the hh plates are tasty. I&#39;ve enjoyed the ahi tuna and the fish tacos equally and the burgers are good as well. They are still getting their groove, beer-wise, to see what their best sellers are.  This means they will occasionally run of some tap beers, as they order kegs in smaller quantities.

It&#39;s finally come and it is amazing!!! I don&#39;t know about worth the wait, but regardless this place is fantastic.  I&#39;ve been a huge fan of the owners other bar &#39;Providence Tavern&#39; in Edgewater for years and have heard rumblings that they were bringing a similar idea to the old Gabor&#39;s, but really haven&#39;t seen any movement until now. 

I went here last Friday after getting wind of the opening and was met with a moderate crowd of typical Capitol Hillians.  My gal and I sat in the corner to get a good view of the fairly large dark bar, a décor reminiscent of a Irish pub while still holding onto some of the charm of the once famed Gabor&#39;s.  As it happened we came at a perfect time to score a happy hour drink(4-7 daily) and peruse the drink and appetizers while waiting for the rest of our crew to show up.  

The menu appears to be pretty much the same as Providence and by judging by my burger and fries that I demolished in about 5 minutes, I will be back again and again based on pure deliciousness.  Overall we had 2 meals and about 6 drinks and my bill came to right around $50, Bing! Right at my perfect price point to feel like I&#39;m getting a deal! Oh yeah!

Very happy we did. The service was awesome and the food was really delicious. Of course this is your typical &#34;bar&#34; food so if you&#39;re not looking for burgers and beers this is probably not your place. They&#39;ve just opened and I&#39;ll cut right to it, the 4-star rating is simply because there isn&#39;t a ton of selection on their menu but they&#39;ve been open for 4 weeks now so this is expected and apparently they had just updated their menu when we came in so they&#39;re working on it! 

The ambiance is the best part, they have very low lighting and the tables and chairs were a good distance apart from one another (I&#39;m not a fan of being able to overhear my neighbors conversation so much that I cannot enjoy my own). Exposed brick, nice bar and old school photography on the walls was very cool. Oh and the bathrooms, they are unisex! Perfect so you&#39;re not waiting in line for the womens restroom when the mens has been vacant for the past 10 minutes. 

Our waitress was great as was the general manager (who stopped at our table to see how everything was, WOW!!). The drinks were good along with the beer selection. All in all I&#39;m very happy with this new restaurant and they are doing something very right. If you live in the area or you&#39;re looking for a good bar with good food, check this place out! We will be back!"

Menu looks appealing, and it has a nice, though dark, taverny decor. My only big issue with the place - and why I have not eaten there yet - is that virtually all the tables are high-tops with high stools for seating. No regular dining tables (think there might be one, actually).  We are often out with our young daughter and it is just not safe or comfortable for her to sit so high. Also would be an issue for older folks, disabled, etc. It&#39;s a pretty big place and think it would be good for their business if they swapped out a few of their high tables for normal height tables. Promise I will be back!"

3 stars for actual food.
5 stars for solid craft beer options and friendly bartenders who pour STRONG drinks. 

This assessment rounded out my review at 4 stars. We spent about an hour here while waiting for a delayed flight (thanks, United). While sitting at the bar, we had great conversation and service with the two ladies serving food and drinks. Decent bar space and we didn&#39;t have any trouble with a full bar with people holding suitcases. 

I ordered the caprese sandwich with sweet potato fries. I was hoping for a better sandwich after seeing their fresh and varied options on the menu, but it was just OK. Definitely a small portion for the cost, but that&#39;s to be expected for an airport. Would have preferred better bread and a fuller sandwich, but that&#39;s how it goes.

Overall, a perfectly fine place to spend an hour, but don&#39;t expect the best meal of your life."

Decent food, horrible execution and awkward space design.  I ordered a sandwich and it took 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, there was nowhere to stand while waiting for the sandwich as more and more people came into the space to order.

We had less than an hour before our United flight, and after a chaotic check in and crowded security lines (yay holiday travel!) the full bar at Etai&#39;s was like an oasis, even though the breakfast menu is sort of limited.

The full service restaurant is very cramped, and difficult to navigate with a wheelchair or any luggage.  We sat down at a small table in the corner and the service was quick and efficient- but he didn&#39;t ask what time our flight was like many establishments do.

I had the mimosa and classic breakfast sandwich, which were both pretty good.  
The boy got a super small double Bloody Mary, that was basically super watered down grocery store mix and some vodka (for $14.50!!!!!)  If I had more time, I probably would have advocated to get it taken off our bill, but oh well.  We were able to scarf down our food and get cashed out right as our flight was boarding.

Also enjoyed a sandwich with turkey, Brie and apples on a hearty wheat bread. It wasn&#39;t too heavy or intimidatingly big. And though my server was pushing the chocolate cake for dessert, I couldn&#39;t finish my main. No sweets if you&#39;re not part of the clean plate club.

It was steaming hot and delicious! This gourmet sandwich came with red roasted peppers, pesto, bacon, aioli, and melted Swiss cheese. The combination of these ingredients was absolutely mouth-watering. The roasted peppers in particular were succulent and oozed of flavour. The melted Swiss cheese over the bacon and sandwiched between the unique cranberry walnut bread slices made for an experience my taste buds will continue to crave. A nice chicken breast portion with a very generous side of fresh from the fryer fries (initially chose &#34;chips&#34; as my side order, thinking we were talking about the Britain version of chips being fries - however the cashier actually meant chips and her customer service turned sour [even after we had a nice 5-10 minutes of friendly banter] when she had to put in a special request for the intended side of fries for me). I also ordered their bottled Bhakti Chai ($5) and was very excited as it was highly recommended by the cashier and advertised as authentic Indian-spiced chai. I drank a few sips of this and instantly got a headache from the overwhelmingly strong mixtures of spices. I&#39;ve had authentic chai many times and am obsessed with it, but this bottle went right down the drain. The sandwich overshadows the turn in customer service, and since their Bhakti Chai isn&#39;t made in-house, I won&#39;t hold it against them!! Not sure about how tasty the other sandwiches are since the rest consist of deli meats (which is why I custom ordered the Chicken breast). I suggest you do the same!

I especially like the fact that every table and every stool has power outlets dedicated to the patron.  This is a great place to grab a quick bite - they can do most sandwiches in 7 minutes, or as in today&#39;s case, a great place to hang out waiting on a delayed flight.  They also have a premade carry away counter.  What more can you ask for?  I highly this restaurant!"

For those who don&#39;t know, they split their cafe up into &#34;Take-out&#34; and &#34;Dining&#34;. I initially ordered my meal through &#34;Take-out&#34; because of the limited seating in the Dining section. Once I got my food (Chicken Basil Sandwich), I noticed a spot open in the corner and decided to sit down in the &#34;Dining&#34; section. 

The individual who catered to me was a balding and well-built man in his 30s who immediately declared that they &#34;only do full waiting in this section&#34;. Based on his tone and expression, I assumed I wasn&#39;t supposed to be in this section of the cafe (even though I was a paying customer at THEIR cafe), but as I was about to leave, he brought me water anyways without looking at me or smiling. He seemed almost disgusted I was there. I felt so uncomfortable that I ended up leaving after a few minutes. The food I was eating went from great to poor because all I could think about was how I was inconveniencing him.

Bottom line: He may have not been outright insulting, but he CERTAINLY did not make me feel welcome or happy to be there, which completely killed my experience and the food I was eating."

Service has always been good when I eat on site and every take out experience has involved me getting exactly what I ordered. Sushi quality is very solid. I probably wouldn&#39;t drive across town if I lived in Denver but while living in Lakewood this is THE SPOT to get my sishi fix.
Last night&#39;s takeout for $32: yellowtail sashimi (with a touch of diced jalapeño), halibut sashimi, spicy tuna handroll (hearty &amp; with a beautiful, thick slice of avocado) and the specialty Hana Roll (tempura red snapper, spicy tuna mix, crab mix, cucumber, avocado, masago, wrapped in soy bean paper) which was 8 big pieces.

Pros: interior is clean and stylish and not what you&#39;d expect from a strip mall location next to a Starbucks; service is always friendly and efficient; I&#39;ve never had any questionable sushi here (admittedly, I keep my orders to the basic fish like tunas and typical white-meat fish); it&#39;s a great find in a city that (I think) doesn&#39;t break away from chain/corporate type eateries very easily.
Cons: not a lot of variety in their fresh fish choices ( thus my comment about keeping it to the basics) although they sure try to make up for that with such a long list of specialty rolls"

When asked what a Nigiri was she failed me right where she was standing. My friend wasn&#39;t a first time sushi lover. He for some reason decided to test this girl.

Refresher: Nigiri in Japanese means two fingers (ni = two, giri = fingers). Nigiri sushi gets its name from the rice which has to be of a very specific portion and fit on the chef&#39;s &#34;two fingers&#34; when pressing. Sushi is a Japanese term that refers to anything made with vinegared rice. You&#39;re welcome!:)

I&#39;m a sashimi girl myself. I consider rice as fillers. But I love me some good fried rice!

#2 Refresher: Sashimi is a Japanese term for pierced flesh (Sashi = pierced, mi = flesh). The term may have originated from the culinary practice of sticking the fish&#39;s tail and fin to the slices in identifying the fish being eaten. Another possibility for the name could come from the traditional method of harvesting - &#39;Sashimi Grade&#39; fish is caught by individual hand line. As soon as the fish is landed, it is pierced with a sharp spike and placed in a body of ice. This spiking is call the Ike Jime process. Ok enough refreshers!

This place I wouldn&#39;t go back if given a choice. No. Not the fact that she doesn&#39;t know her stuff ( maybe her first day on the job?) but their other comments just turned me off. I go to restaurants to enjoy the whole atmosphere, culture and whatnots. Because I&#39;m curious by nature. Here I&#39;m so turned off I just wanted to leave. 

My Saba sashimi was fresh and portioned right. The chefs were awesome. It&#39;s the two staff. Amazing what one can say or do to turn someone off. 

I&#39;m giving it a four star rating still because I can&#39;t fault this place over some worker that would probably leave next week."

The sushi is incredibly fresh and tasty. The first time we came we had four different rolls, nigiri and sashimi, udon soup, tempura, and dessert... We almost had to be rolled out of the restaurant! 

For the nigri and sashimi we had the hirame (halibut), the suzuki (striped bass), and the tai (red snapper), all were incredibly fresh and had delicious flavor. 

The rolls we ordered were the twister Roll (tempura lobster, crab mix and avocado), the Vegas Roll (salmon, cream cheese and avocado all rolled up then  tempura fried with a sweet and spicy sauce), the paradise roll (tempura shrimp, banana, and crab mix with sweet and spicy sauce), and my go-to favorite an avocado roll with cream cheese added. They were all outstanding... The rice to filling ration is spot on, it&#39;s not a rice roll, it&#39;s a sushi roll! These chefs know what they are doing! The rice is perfectly cooked and the flavors meld into what I can say is the best sushi we&#39;ve had in Colorado! Typically when I order an avocado roll you get something that&#39;s a half inch wide, these were full inch wide rolls! So much better than most places! 

My husband also enjoyed the udon soup and tempura shrimp, which we had to take home because of the huge portions! (Ok, ok, we probably ordered too much food, but how can you not when you want to try everything!)

The desserts were delicious. We had the tempura banana with green tea ice cream, and the mochi. They were both wonderful. The green tea ice cream was creamy, not grainy like it is other places, and not overly sweet, a perfect compliment to the ripe bananas. You have your choice of flavors for the mochi, we had mango, green tea, and strawberry which were all tasty!

The two times we have been to Hana Matsuri we have been blown away by the dishes, we spend too much, but we have left feeling happily and wonderfully full. I have a feeling that this will become a regular dinner spot for us!"

We sat at the bar and ordered several pieces of nigiri, a couple of premium rolls (Mango Tango and the Kobe Beef roll) and miso soup.  All were incredibly fresh, well seasoned and presented with great care.  Presentation goes a long way anywhere, and when the food and service is as good as the visual quality of the food...  that&#39;s when you pause, and just take in what&#39;s before you.  You might can spy the cool lemon in the picture as well as the delicate red sprouts, cut fresh from the plant.  Can&#39;t beat that!

The decor...  clean lines, modern feel, well dressed dining area.  And despite the limited selection of beer, they do have dollar beer and two dollar drafts as well as two dollar sake.  Oh, and to end the night, they sent complimentary ice cream.  Very nice!

His seafood is fresh, high quality, and beautifully presented.  And don&#39;t ask him about his rice!!  He has been studying and learning and perfecting rice since his childhood, and he is so proud of his craft!

My absolute favorite is his Chirashi.  It&#39;s so beautiful, you almost don&#39;t want to eat it.  Almost.  But then you&#39;d be missing out on thick, fresh slices of Sashimi, pickled mushrooms and vegetables, amazing Tamago, and of course, Chef Eddie&#39;s Rice.  I recommend experiencing the Chirashi at least once, putting yourself in the Chef&#39;s hands and enjoying his creations.  

The Hot Rock is a fun, unique experience, paired with the same quality meats and seafoods.  I&#39;ve sampled both the Filet and the Salmon on the Hot Rock, and both were quite good.  I&#39;m glad they have it, because I can bring my picky hubby along when I crave Sushi!

The interior of the new restaurant is very contemporary and clean, and the service, of course, is always friendly and efficient.  My water glass never once got below half full.  

I am SO THRILLED that my favorite Sushi place is now just a few miles from my new home.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find me here often!"

But I brought my boyfriend here for his 25th birthday. I was going to get a teriyaki bowl since I don&#39;t like most sushi but he convinced me to get the 2 people floating boat. I loved it, and more important my boyfriend loved it and he has tried many different sushi places. We checked in and got free avocado wanton that was coveted in a delicious sauce.  Overall amazing food,  great little atmosphere, with the kindest service.
Will be returning!!!"

Kobe Beef Roll- I was extremely intrigued by this- only to be super disappointed. I thought it was so creative and wondered what it would taste like- only to realize it taste like normal teriyaki beef with rice. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

Lava Roll- My favorite!! The dynamite sauce was awesome.

I can&#39;t remember the other two specialty rolls we got. My hubby picked out something spicy which didn&#39;t end up being spicy and also something with bananas. They were o.k.

I used the Yelp check in for a free chef&#39;s special appetizer. It was like a crab rangoon w/ mango sauce. Not bad but just two tiny portions.

It was my hubby&#39;s birthday so they generously gave us a large green tea ice cream w/ deep fried bananas (meh but super nice of them). 

Reminder to self: Four specialty rolls is enough for 2 people. Ask to OMIT the cucumber in ALL rolls! Unnecessary crunch that ruins the texture."

Stood at the door. Manager gabbed away at a table. No attention to the door. Awkward long time. So we moved to an open table on our own. She stopped talking and acted like we were stealing silverware. Ade sure to push us back to front door and make us wait. 

Two other experiences like that. 

Great place. Horrible management. 

Still go. Just get past her quickly and will be great evening."

The quality of the fish is better than other places in Lakewood and the rolls are creative. I have been here twice now, and both times the service was friendly and non-obtrusive. I did not go on a weekend, so the place was nearly empty. One of my visits was for a friend&#39;s birthday, so the server brought us a strawberry ice cream tempura banana sundae. It was definitely the best dessert I&#39;ve ever had in a sushi restaurant. 
  They offer grill rock entrees that I have not yet tried, but they look intriguing. Maybe I&#39;ll try that next time."

We found the Beauty and the Beast roll as well as the Spider Roll to be our favorites.

The California Roll was one of the best I&#39;ve had-not too much rice and a lot of crab mix! Also only $5.50 which is a pretty great price. The salad was okay I didn&#39;t eat too much of it because it was too vinegary or something. But more importantly I was craving the roll and it definitely satisfied me. I would come back for sure to try the other stuff here and this is a convenient location that is close to my home and work.

We talked with the chefs who really seemed to know their stuff. They ended up customizing our platter and rolls.  We ordered the big eye tuna and avocado starter - really good if you love tuna. We then asked the server if we could have a nigiri platter which was not listed on the menu.. but after much discussion ended up ordering ordering the sushi &amp; sashimi combo (supposed to come with 6 pieces of sushi, 6 pieces of sashimi, and a spicy tuna roll). When the plate came out it had a spicy tuna roll, 6 pieces of sashimi, and 9 pieces of nigiri. You really have to appreciate a place that will so easily customize your perfect order when you didn&#39;t even ask for it. We loved the white tuna nigiri so much that we ordered a tuna lover roll but had the chef change it to have white tuna. Amazing. 

This place is perfect for a relaxed/well-priced meal; the fish tastes so good (we were told it comes in every day). You can tell all the $$ goes to delicious food and not fancy/pretentious decor which makes it even better."

Fresh food with great taste. 

We order the Mango Tango Roll. It was very flavorful and the better of the two. Oppa Roll with scallops was good, had a kick at the end. 

We also ordered Gyoza. It was like Gyoza you&#39;d order any where else.

Waitress was nice. Seemed to get overwhelmed easily but this was probably due to size/amount of tables. 

We tried to use the Yelp Check In Free App. We ordered it at the beginning with our Gyoza. The waitress said the order was lost by the chefs several times, and after about the 4th time &amp; after the rolls were gone, asked us if &#34;we even still wanted it.&#34;  She went ahead and brought it out. It was a crab wonton style dish. It tasted really good. 

Took a bit to get ticket and pay as well. 

Overall great food, atmosphere, and okay staff/service."

We have been here twice; two weekends in a row. The service is excellent. The staff takes pride in the food they are offering. And the food is fantastic. 

The seafood salad and miso soup are great starters and both are really good. The seaweed salad is very fresh, crisp and the right amount of acid; a large portion that should be shared. We also had the dynamite which was good but a lot of mushrooms and spicy mayo. 

The sushi is the star. The fish is some of the if not the freshest we have had in Denver. We had a blue fin tuna sashimi special with avocado, micro greens and yuzu that melted in our mouths. The nigiri was all great. Albacore, salmon, scallop, octopus. I love that they use just a small portion of rice and the rice is cooked perfectly. The American roll with tempura rock shrimp and real king crab is delicious and the crunch is a great contrasting texture next to sashimi and nigiri.

The staff is attentive and friendly; from the host to our servers and the sushi chefs. And the food comes out very quickly but not rushed.

Our absolute new favorite sushi place in Denver. No  pretension and superior sushi compared to those other places. 

We hope they keep it up!"

I came with my mom, her two best friends and my best friend. The service was on point. We had a lovely lady named Rebecca. She was attentive and very professional even when my mom&#39;s friends kept hitting on her! Talk about embarrassing haha! The food was sooo good. We ordered the fried calamari and the gyoza for appetizers which hit the spot. As for sushi, the nigiri was so fresh and the portions were huge! Just the way I like it. But to warn you, the sushi rolls tend to be on the bigger side so it might take a few bites. The alcohol there is definitely on the pricer side. For a shot of Hennessy was $12! I&#39;ve been to other sushi places that didn&#39;t charge that much. I give this place 5 stars because of the food and service! Our waitress even gave us free mochi ice cream on the house...

Today, however, the fish seemed less fresh (didn&#39;t spring back when poked), my friend didn&#39;t get his soup, and there was cross contamination between orders.

In terms of sushi, they had numerous creative rolls that were under $10 and very good. The only part I wasn&#39;t impressed with was the spicy edamame. It had too much of the spicy sauce/flavoring. 

They finished it off by bringing a free dessert from the chef so all was good. We&#39;ll be back!"

Our meal was something we&#39;ve never experienced before - black rock grilling! They bring out a huge, super hot lava rock and you cook your choice of meat or seafood to your own preference. Something we&#39;ve never done before in our travels and was unique and fun! The had a wide variety of delicious sauces for the meat. It didn&#39;t take very long at all.

They seem to pay attention to the details, which we appreciate! The soy sauce (low sodium) is made in house and there was a small section side of red amaranth buds which appear to be grown in house as well.

And right before we got our rolls we were saying how the sushi rolls here are more boring and the taste is bland. This place is walking distance from our house and we absolutely loved it!!! Delicious rolls and we got a complimentary appetizer (can&#39;t remember the name but it had wontons). Only one thing was we didn&#39;t get our edamame before our rolls but that wasn&#39;t terrible.

We started off with some sake bombs which was great they let us do them because lets face it, they are messy and annoying. We ended up ordering a bunch of rolls (Big Daddy is my favorite, oh that roll is good too). Also the Twister roll is amazing as well. I had a weird request to get our rolls out on a boat because who doesn&#39;t want that.. the waitress had no problem with it and it really made my experience that much better. The place overall is pretty small so prepare for a bit of a wait on the the weekends. If you order your food with your chopsticks in your mouth so you look like a walrus they won&#39;t judge you.

Amazing what happens when you drive to the suburbs for dinner.  The huge menu at this place made me nervous the food would taste more like a chain restaurant, but it was innovative, unique and delicious!  The miso cod appetizer pleasantly surprised our skeptical friends.  The sauce was quite sweet so it paired well with the garlic edamame.

Great service too. 4 Asian chefs working hard behind the sushi bar and they are extremely appreciative of your business and you can tell they take great pride in their work.

The staff was very accommodating and helpful, our food was better than we expected! You don&#39;t have to be told they make it from scratch, the flavors come through! I had the chicken pesto wrap, loaded with veggies and all overpowered by the pesto - just right! My sister had the pulled pork sandwich - YUMM!! It was tender, juicy and even had carrots!

The &#34;waitress&#34; came over and explained &#34;we are a fast casual restaurant&#34; (after handing us menus) &#34;so come to the counter and order&#34; blah, blah, blah.  Kinda weird, as Chipotle is fast casual, Einstein&#39;s is fast casual.  A restaurant that delivers your food to you in 15-minutes if you are the only customers is not fast casual.  The price point also does not mesh with the fast casual concept.  I had the baked penne which was loaded with an enormous amount of cheese, and came in a foil pan, and my wife had the spaghetti.  Both were fine, but the red sauce had less tang than I usually prefer.  The penne was definitely just made in a big batch early in the day then warmed in the oven.  It was the special, so I guess I might expect that from this type of place.

The employees were perfectly attentive and nice, the place just has kind of a weird vibe.  One-thing that was kinda weird was the tables with talavera style tiles embedded in them, like you find in Mexican restaurants.  We were probably hoping for more from this place.  I hope they are busier at lunch and breakfast than they are for dinners on Friday nights."

Coming from Chicago where there are tons of delicious family run restaurants we have been hard pressed to find the same in Arvada. Mighty Joes definitely is delicious! We have had breakfast burritos (huge, filled with real Italian sausage, eggs, veggies, and a delicious red pepper dipping sauce), the chilaquiles with pork added that is used in the Yucatan pork tacos, and the frittata with breakfast potatoes. All have been delicious, freshly prepared, and great quality. If you live near (or far!) it&#39;s a great spot for brunch or lunch!"

Stopped in for lunch at Mighty Joe&#39;s Kitchen.  My buddy ordered the sausage sandwich.  Beautiful; nice toasted sesame roll with a very tasty Italian sausage (he cut me off a bite), sided with peppers and smothered in melted mozzarella.  Smothered!  After seeing that beast I was pretty sure I was going to be disappointed that I had ordered only the Pesto Chicken Wrap. But oh, no, no, I wasn&#39;t!  One bite in and I was like, &#34;sweet!!&#34;  The wrap was crisped on the grill on the outside with a hot and steamy stuffing of white meat chicken, fresh veggies, artichoke hearts, melted mozzarella, a little pepperoni and an awesome kind of pesto sauce.  Really, really good.  I brought home part of the second half to my wife, a finicky eater of celery sticks.  It raised her eyebrows and she devoured the remainder asking me to take her next time.

Mighty Joe&#39;s is casual but tastefully decorated.  Probably not your first choice for a first date unless your dating a nice Italian girl.  I might have marked it down one star to a four based on that but the food was over the top good and I just had to go with five.  Best Italian deli sandwich (and more) shop I&#39;ve eaten in since San Francisco!"

I was really craving something with pesto but couldn&#39;t find something on the menu that was exactly perfect. So I asked for a special order, a chicken pesto panini and they said NO PROBLEM. They made it exactly the way I asked for. I also had a Mai Tai and some espresso swirl ice cream.  Amazing hospitality, service, and food.

Yucatan Pulled Pork pure perfection! Oh my, a bit of sweet, with a bite of hot served in a hot toasted bun! Delicious!!!

I was also pleased with my dinner. I had meatloaf with an Italian red sauce along with mashed potatoes and a warm salad of yellow and green Zucchini, tomatoes and onions. Oh, and a delicious piece of garlic toast.

Our waitress was so accommodating and pleasant. The owner/chef stopped by our table and was so nice to hear our rave reviews. We hope to make our return home with another stop at Mighty Joes. Even if we have to go out of our way."

The food is delicious and incredibly reasonably priced. We both had entrees, drinks, and each had a dessert and our total was $30, that&#39;s probably the best deal in the Denver-area!

Her sandwich was huge to begin with but it also came with a helping of pasta salad. For dessert, we shared a huge slice of Hummingbird Cake which was *out of this world.* The portions were very generous considering the price. The only thing I&#39;ll say is that I wish there was an option to order a small side salad with the spaghetti to balance out the meal. The service was super quick and yet we did not feel rushed. We were able to stay and talk long after our kind server cleared our plates. Atmosphere is friendly and the whole place is very clean and well-lit.

The good- Nice place, nice people. 
The bad- confusing menu. They don&#39;t really specialize in any one thing.  Everything we tried was extremely greasy.  Dripping..  No flavor and to be honest things tasted &#39;old&#39;.   
Pesto wrap was a disaster. Nothing like you would imagine.  Squash that looked like it had been warmed up a dozen times dripped out of a bizarre pesto wrap. 
My cheese steak...it didn&#39;t look all that bad but just bland as heck.  The peppers were so mushy i really wonder how long it&#39;s been sitting around. 
Salad was very plain.  And barely enough dressing to dress 1/2 the salad.

I was a pain and asked for my sandwich hot and they were nice and accommodating because I was only going to eat one slice of the bread. There was so much meat!!! I eat high protein - Yee ha!

I&#39;ve been visiting the OG location for lunch for the past several weeks and wanted to see what the Tennyson version was all about. The verdict? Same great menu, more space for hungry customers. 

The classics are available at both: coconut curry chicken bowl, flatbread, mango lassi, etc. When in doubt, get the coconut chicken bowl with just a little bit of spice. This last visit I tried the special &#34;sliders&#34; -- a falafel ball served inside a little sweet bun. Even with a side of yogurt sauce, my mouth was on fire! But it was a good kinda spice that cleared up any residual sinus problems.

What I also like about this particular Biju&#39;s? Wine on tap. House red or white, it&#39;s not terribly fancy, but that&#39;s not the vibe they&#39;re going for at either spot. And as I mentioned above, there&#39;s tons of booths and tables to go around, even a patio for warm days. 

This pocket of Berkeley is poppin&#39;, so head down here for some Indian food or pizza, shop around and hang out at the park nearby. Don&#39;t be afraid of the &#34;other side of 25&#34;, it&#39;s quite nice :)"

Always great staff and help with menu. 
And at this new location the food takes exactly the same. And I love it! Love the flavors. Don&#39;t be afraid to add many flavors to make it yours. That&#39;s how I get the taste I want, I don&#39;t take the dish as it comes otherwise it&#39;s not spicy enough for me.

I ordered the coconut curry chicken ($10.50) and it was definitely, definitely geared towards the tastes of Coloradans (let&#39;s just say, not Indian people, or people who have extensive experience with Indian food). My bowl was bland, mild, had a thin curry sauce and a strange addition of cabbage slaw which I assume was to add some bulk to the bowl. My husband got the vindaloo ($10.50) and it wasn&#39;t even that spicy... and it was topped with beets, which I thought was weird, but it ended up giving the dish a little more flavor which it needed. 

The space is cool, it&#39;s in a great location, and it&#39;s an interesting concept... but the food just wasn&#39;t for me."

Crowds (2 people) are gathering in mouth-watering anticipation.
Fragrant odors of curry wafting though my nostrils. I could smell them a 1/2 block away.

Lunch - Vindaloo chicken is quite tasty with a mild kick. All the components are delicious: lentils, rice, steamed coconut cabbage.
Dinner (yes, 2 meals in 1 day) - Vegetarian bowl. Very Good. Oh, fresh jalapeños and scallions as toppings. Yes, please.

+ Super friendly staff.

-- Not spicy enough. My eyeballs did not bleed. This is/was my biggest disappointment as I have read that the spice level of southern Indian food is very hot.
- Cheap paper napkins. I brought my own cloth napkins for dinner.
- Beer is way too expensive. $3.50 for a 8 oz draft. Really?! This will cause us to do take out only.
- Not a relaxing atmosphere. Lunch, not dinner. Very similar to Chipotle in that aspect.

This place is going to be a huge success."

I will tell you: my husband and I discovered the RiNo location a while ago and loved it so much that we attempted to visit every other week.  I say attempted because the parking is a joke at the RiNo location.  Not so in the Tennyson area because it has not been as hipstered out as much as the other location.

The food is so amazing!  You pick what type of bowl you want.  I used to have the coconut chicken, but now I go vegetarian.  Still amazing, still fresh, and still so unique to me.  These guys and gals know their stuff.  They will help you if you need help deciding.  

Geez, only downside in my mind is that the curry shop in the arts district has so much more culture and vibe in it.  It looks like an Indian train, and this new shop looks like a generic version.  They threw up some tin cans of Indian condiments (I think), but it isn&#39;t as cool as the downtown.  Nevertheless, it is so amazing to have a shop near me that my very subjective rating system gives it 5 stars!  

Thank goodness it is finally here!"

The extra hot vindaloo chicken was actually quite hot. Though not traditional by any means, the cabbage and spicy pickled veggies actually blended quite well with the curry in the dish.

I went with the coconut chicken curry, and this is definitely what you should get when there. I had no idea that the flavors would be so complex-- it&#39;s way more sophisticated than Chipotle. There was shredded cabbage, yogurt sauce, creamy rice...I died and went to heaven. My dining partner had the vindaloo chicken which is mildly spicy but not overly so. They told us it was &#34;seven out of ten on the White Boy Scale&#34; haha. The portions are huge, given the $10.95 price tag for most of the dishes.

While paying for our food, I heard the bar next door, Zephyr, start a trivia game-- and lo and behold one is allowed to bring Biju&#39;s food over to the bar! Nice to hang out and play trivia while eating incredible indian food.

Think of it like everything you love about Thai and Indian food piled high in a bowl generous enough to share. No seriously though, we should have shared, though it did mean leftovers worth reheating. 

Not only was the food incredible, fresh, flavorful, and well prepared, the owner is very hands on. So much so that the night we were there he was wondering the dinning room offering samples of delicacies not found on the menu. This place, this food, is a labor of love and it shows. If we ever find ourselves in town again you can be sure that we will be returning to this fantastical eatery."

I had the Extra Hot Vindaloo Chicken Bowl and the portion was about 1:1 of Rice to everything else, a melange of the chicken, veggies, fresh cabbage, and some additional sauce. I admittedly have a pretty good tolerance for spice, but this was barely even red tabasco levels of hot - it was also lukewarm, which didn&#39;t help. Texture wise, it was great - the chicken was cooked well, the fresh slaw had a nice crunch, and there were enough different vegetables to keep it interesting. Unfortunately, the flavor was very flat - the dish was crying out for some actual spice, salt, and acid - really not what you expect from Vindaloo on either side of the Pacific.

Parking in the area is not easy, so if you&#39;re not walking be prepared to be opportunistic on the 2-hour spots. The price doesn&#39;t fit what&#39;s happening either - at $8 this would be an acceptable bowl of food, at $11 it was simply not well executed enough.

Maybe there&#39;s something that they&#39;re better at that I should come back and try, but I didn&#39;t really get the magic I was hoping for."

This place did not feel as authentic as I had hoped. I don&#39;t like saying it but yes, the set up was similar to that of chipotle&#39;s so don&#39;t expect a sit down restaurant where they take your order and bring it out to you.

You get to customize your bowl. I had the coconut curry chicken bowl and it was just all right. Not too much to it. 

This is where the low star ranking comes in.  I ordered a Mango Lassi and be warned, those drinks do not sit in a refrigerator nor are they made fresh. This drink was sitting out by the register in a tray with a little bit of ice. My drink tasted and looked like expired milk, and it honestly made me sick.

Please do us all a favor and refrigerate your milky drinks! 

Parking was limited and we had to park blocks away. Lots of construction going on when we visited."

Biju&#39;s is no different. The fast casual concept is great, quick and efficient. The flavors are excellent. Both times I&#39;ve visited, I have had the chicken vindaloo. Omg. So. Good. The first go around the vindaloo was a bit spicy for me, it had a definite after burn. This last time it was perfect. A bit more mild. I have also sampled the veggie bowl and the beef masala bowl. I can highly recommend them as well. 

Pretty much everything here is great. Biju&#39;s is now our go to for Indian."

Seriously, for me, the easiest way to describe Biju&#39;s is the the Indian version of Chipotle. It&#39;s so simple and delicious, it makes you wonder why no one else is doing it!  

Now Biju&#39;s has a menu to order from that features some tasty sounding combinations, but reading through them will make you want to try it all! So I highly recommend the Build-Your-Own option, which essentially is walking down the line of delightfully fragrant food and asking for a little of this and a little of that! Indian food has a lot of gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options by nature, so this is the kind of spot where everyone can find their happy place. 

I chowed down on a bowl with their biryani rice with cashews, braised cabbage, potatoes, spiced lentils, and a bit of the coconut curry and spicy vindaloo chicken curries. The bowl was topped with the mild mint and cilantro chutney and a healthy squeeze of their herbed yogurt sauce to cool it down. Topped with heaping pile of crispy slaw and a sprinkling of crumbled papadams, and you&#39;ve got a beautiful lunch that will fill you up without leaving you in a food coma! 

As if all that wasn&#39;t enough, the highlight for me had to be their beautiful preserved lemon pickles! They had just the right amount of sweet, sour, and spice to wake up the palate in between bites! 

Biju&#39;s is absolutely amazing, and something I wish I could eat once a week, or more! I think there&#39;s a huge opportunity in my home market of Reno and would love to see it come home! CALL ME!"

The nice thing about the menu is that it&#39;s limited. Just a few options...something for everyone...and they offer seasonal ingredients/veggies when available.

It&#39;s a small place with some seating but we decided to go the take out route and drink our homemade sangria (and other adult beverages) without having to drive back.

We had the chicken coconut curry bowls; I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect...I&#39;m used to heavier, thicker curries (both Indian and Thai). This was a lighter, flavorful curry - not too spicy at all. I&#39;m a big fan of spice, so it could be kicked up a notch, but it was still fresh and delicious. They provide a small serving of hot sauce which I gladly slathered all over mine. That added a really nice layer of heat and flavor.

Regarding layers - that&#39;s what this bowl was. Layers of rice, veggies and chicken. The veggies were crisp and super fresh...I enjoyed everything about this dish.

Staff was super friendly and I especially liked the guy behind the counter that complimented me on my shirt. Flattery will get you everywhere. He was adorable."

Expect, not a big bowl of steaming soup-like-curry, but rather a light, yet hearty bowl ranging from sweet to spicy flavors &amp; crunchy and creamy textures that truly complement one another and leave you feeling great!

They asked for spicy and I did not, but none of us thought the food was spicy enough, and my friend put a lot of sriracha on his. 

They didn&#39;t have hot chai that day unfortunately. The cold/perhaps iced? chai was unsweetened and had no masala. None of us finished it.

It&#39;s a nice little location, right next to Zephyr Brewery. The place was nearly empty when I got there and has a good amount of seating. 

They have a couple different menu items that they construct along a Chipotle-style line. I had the spicy vindaloo chicken which was indeed spicy. Huge portion, big chunks of chicken, rice, chickpeas, and a yogurt sauce to mediate the burn. I ended up taking half of it home with me.

Agree with all the praise around cool vibe, chipotle assembly line concept (Carbs, veg, proteins) and staff being bright,shiny and helpful. 

This place would be an instant hit in Berkeley near where I live! (Have investors no joke).

Agree it was inexpensive. I wasn&#39;t sure whether to get the coconut curry chicken or the chicken vindaloo... So at these prices I got both and Still have room on per diem for a few local brewskies!

I got it to go cause. Had to get back to watch the &#34;Dub&#39;s&#34; close out &#34;Rip City&#34;. And in this town a lot of Haters I noticed so no guarantee they wouldn&#39;t be watching Rockies baseball.

So onto the food. Started with Vindaloo (pictured)I asked how hot the wait staffer said 7 out of ten. I asked if she could make it hotter she added some green pepper sauce. It was a 4 on my heat scale but I&#39;m not a &#34;ladakee&#34;. I have to challenge staff wherever I go with &#34;you can not hurt me&#34;. So far so... good no challenge let unconquered. 

Side bar So- we all know people who can&#39;t have their food items touch on the plate nor would they consider eating them in one bite. This is not a place for those folks!

1) Each bite is like a snowflake- different than all the others because you get a little more of this ingredient or a little less of that with each bite. Combinations of salty, sweet, savory sour etc.
  
2) Then there is that texture thing, you have saucy proteins mixed with various soft, mushy, crunchy and chewy accompaniments.  

3) And lastly for those picky folks, you have to overcome some items are cooked and hot, others are cold or raw all mixed together in a bowl (or my case plate).

If you are none of the above, you will think you died and went to heaven.

I agree there is likely more traditional Indian cuisine to be had. However this can be the gastronomic gateway venue for folks not exposed to Indian food and ingredients. Leveraging the fact you see what they are adding and you are selecting, the staff is passionate and helpful in helping you find the perfect blend for your pallet and it&#39;s ridiculously inexpensive, you can come multiple times a week for a year and never have the same thing!
While I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve been transported to Bangalore, because this is as much hipster, and approachable as it is Indian, I look forward to my next namaste greeting when I return."

I had the Veggie bowl with the cashew rice and found it to be so-so. There were so many different things going on from the potatoes to the garbanzo to the cabbage to the rice and so on, that I had a hard time really appreciating the different ingredients. I felt as though the bowl was missing flavor in its entirety. There were a few spicy sauce things that I tried, which helped give a little more zing to the dish. The dish was on the drier side as well. However, the veggies were fresh and most of the workers were friendly.

The interior was cool and there were seats inside and outside. The food was on the pricier side (~$10/person).

Maybe I just wanted curry that day and all I got was a beautifully deceiving bowl of veggies. Either way, it was a &#34;meh&#34; experience overall, but maybe that&#39;s just me and I&#39;m picky."

As we walked in, we were immediately met with a warm, friendly greeting from the kitchen staff.  The guy behind the counter asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he gave us the menu&#39;s background (Southern Indian) and some suggestions.  I chose the coconut curry chicken.  He spooned cashew and date biriyani rice with spiced lentils into a bowl and then ladled coconut chicken curry on top with cabbage, yogurt, and cilantro sauce.  

How did it taste?  Amazing!  Hot, cold, comforting, new, creamy, zippy, and sweet.  I took in the interior while eating.  I love interior design and felt this place was bright and colorful, with an Indian vibe.  I felt the serving area was a take on a train with luggage rack.  Bright yellow and blue with authentic Indian condiment tins on the rack and on the tables.  

Heidi, another staff member, came over to see how we liked our food.  We ended up having a discussion about the bicycle charity figurines and how the restaurant got started.  Apparently, a mother or grandmother (sorry, I forgot which) had to taste test the food to make sure it tasted like hers.

Well, he did phenomenal. I got a bowl of some sort with some potato stuff and chick pea stuff... But to be honest, I&#39;m not all so sure what was in it. Oh! There was a cilantro dressing. This has a set up similar to Chipotle in the sense that you just go down the bar and get the different toppings. Indoor and outdoor seating, and wonderful customer service."

Many options to accommodate various food preferences. I went with the vegetarian combo and thought it was delicious! It was maybe a mix of too many flavors so when I go back I&#39;ll probably go with a simpler option. I also love lentils but they needed to be cooked more. My husband had the spicy chicken curry. Great flavor. If you like spicy food, which we do, then dig in!

The samosas were outstanding and mild enough to feed to our twin boys. Samosas are actually the perfect option for little people. We ran into a slight problem with only one high chair but the staff were super helpful and borrowed one from a restaurant next door. I have to mention here that we LOVED the crew working at Bijou&#39;s they were friendly and fun. Dining with 15 month twin boys can be challenging and they made us feel welcomed. 

The atmosphere and music was also a TON OF FUN! Quick, healthy, and our little guys were thoroughly entertained by the music. We will be back!"

I walked in and was greeted with such a positive welcome and everyone was so accommodating to explain every single part of the process.  
Ambiance: As other yelpers explain this is more of a chipotle style experience but better as it doesn&#39;t have the horrible corporate feeling.

Food: Like nothing you&#39;ve ever had before.  Everything had an amazing flavor and I didn&#39;t have to add any salt to the dish.  The bowls can be customized to simple and plain to complex and spicy...I chose the latter.  It was so fresh and well worth the small price.

Experience: They did not stop after paying at the register.  Our waters were constantly being filled (remember I chose the spicy bowl) and after a while found out that we had the pleasure to talk to Biju himself! He was so friendly and humble and explained that he comes from a health and fitness background therefore the bowls will leave you satisfied without the guilt of a heavy fat laden meal without even noticing.

Now I am regretting not prioritizing a visit sooner!! It&#39;s in the mix of a ton of new places in the used-to-be-sketchy five points area, so I was initially skeptical. So many new spots to eat and drink have been popping up, and its hard to tell what is worthy. Let me tell you- this place is so worthy! 

I ordered the &#34;little bit of everything&#34; bowl, which really does have a bit of everything. The flavors were all so on point and poignant. There was such a great mix of veggies, coconut chicken, and tons of spice. The bowl was huge, but I finished it all and a mango lassi too! My only gripe is that its a little pricey for a place that you order at a counter and have no actual waiter/waitress. However, the staff was incredibly friendly, and you get a big piece of thin naan with each bowl, which really made the meal 5-stars. I will be going back ASAP."

If you love Indian food, don&#39;t bother. This is a watered down Americanized version that has honestly in my opinion cut corners for all the wrong reasons. 

The food was bland. Whoever is making these dishes obviously has no idea how to make Indian food or doesn&#39;t care. The curry literally just tastes like a bunch of spices mixed together with some bland chicken. No care in properly using the spices to create a sauce as you would expect from a curry. The lentils? Disaster. Why so sour? Basically what you&#39;re getting is a bowl full of a bunch of flavors that don&#39;t belong together - which is the exact opposite of what Indian food is about. Indian food is all about exciting your palate with perfectly complimentary flavors. This is just a hodgepodge of poorly executed dishes. I know how to make most of these dishes myself and really do not understand how this can pass for good food. It&#39;s just lazy in my opinion. 

When you&#39;re paying over $10 a person you expect more care to be put into your food. You can find Indian buffets for cheaper with much better food. I understand the fast concept and I&#39;m sure it can be done, but this isn&#39;t it. The food simply isn&#39;t good. Passing up quality food for a trendy ambiance just isn&#39;t a good restaurant.

Went for Lunch with my friend.  Thankfully we opt to arrive early for Lunch, coz by the time its almost noon, this establishment is packed to the brim.  YES, there are HIGH STOOL seating areas.

YES you order at the counter.  They will SCOOP everything what you want or your hearts desire.  You want SPICY, YES they have those SPICY Chillies..

I ordered the following items :

*  Naddan Bowl ($11.95)
*  Kerala Chai ($2.00)

Overall, the Naddan Bowl, it was just &#34;MEH&#34;.  The Biryani rice was just &#34;So-So&#34;, and they could make this Biryani better in some shape or form.  It was a little &#34;bland&#34; for my personal taste bud, though with the Chicken dish and Beef Dish, definitely there is room for improvement..  I think because EVERYTHING is all in one bowl.. some flavors tends to overpower each other, hence resulting in the &#34;muddled&#34; flavors..  *SIGH*

My Dish comes with some kind of Roti.  Hmm, for those Roti..  it would be nice if they can give a separate container to place those Roti.

Maybe next time they could offer some other options.. aka, meaning like SEPARATE Everything, coz some people do eat like that, aka like me.. in one big tray then you can decide which one you want to eat with what etc to begin with..

ALL in all SEMI-Decent Lunch, though it can be &#34;pricey&#34; in terms of Lunch portion verse with pricing.  YES, EVERYTHING comes in a bowl.    I think I have written that statement several times.  But there is room of improvement in my books if I were to return.  My friend like her Lunch order though BUT NOT the service from one of the staff.

This recent visit was on Wednesday March 4th 2015.  Time was about 11:48hrs ish. Above anything else, I wish them well in their Business Venture to come.  Maybe they &#34;should&#34; have a Indian Biryani Battle with &#34;home-cooked&#34; alike.  See how things may differ especially if they &#34;highlight&#34; SOUTH INDIAN Cuisine to the masses.

I found this place by accident. I wanted to eat somewhere in downtown Denver that was different to me. I was skeptical, as I always am with new, upcoming restaurants. I expected it to be mediocre curry. It was better than mediocre, it was amazing!

I chose my meat and my flavor of curry. They added rice, lentils, potatoes, and what I asked for. Topped with yogurt, a crisp slaw, and crunchy stuff. One bowl was enough to eat one big meal or two small meals and served with a tortilla...naan? I asked for spicy, and the spice was right where it should have been.

But, I wasn&#39;t impressed as I was expecting. I had the Coconut Curry dish and my husband had the vindaloo dish.  His was suppose to be spicy, mine was suppose to be 2 star spicy.
The dishes were missing spice/flavor and I&#39;ve sadly come to realize that Denver cannot do spice/flavor, everything is bland. Biju had fresh veggies which I appreciate. However, when it came to Indian spice, its was on the Meh side.  Either they are down playing Indian flavor to cater to Denver or need to re-visit India.

Super friendly, upbeat service! We were greeted promptly upon our arrival and the guy working explained the curry bowl situation and helped us order.

I kinda wished the components were not all stacked on top of each they so I could enjoy each complex component as I craved while working through the bowl...but that can be easily fixed so no big deal.

Between road construction and the simple fact that parking is still free in that part of town, finding a place to land our truck was a bit of a beast, but we finally found a spot about two blocks away. Also note: this part of town is still ridiculously industrial and not too walker friendly. There is nary a sidewalk in sight until right in front of the restaurant!

Biju&#39;s is situated in a complex that also includes Zephyr Brewing, Park Burger, and a pot shop (go figure). It&#39;s a bit Chipotle-esque in that you can build your own bowl, or you can just choose from the pre-built options - although they will make sure to ask if you want everything as they put it on, which is kind of nice.

Veggies sounded good that evening, so I got the vegetarian combo with cashew rice, lentils, potatoes, cabbage, and the featured veggie, BEETS!  It was finished with a shallot-ginger yogurt. E went for the extra hot vindaloo chicken bowl with rice, lentils, chicken, yogurt, and a pepper slaw. Both dishes were topped with what I believe was crushed papadams, which was a nice touch and added a great crunch.

I really enjoyed the concept of this place, and I like that you can mix and match bases, meats, and sauces. However, my bowl just had SO MUCH going on!! And maybe that is my own fault in what I ordered, because the veggie combo really is a complete mixed bag. I did actually enjoy each component on its own a lot more than everything together. The rice could have had more cashews (there can NEVER be enough cashews), but I really liked the lentils, which were hearty and delicately spiced, the cabbage, which may have been fermented a bit and added a nice tangy touch, and the beets. Oh the beets. For someone who used to hate the things, I sure do try to make up for all those years lost on thinking beets tasted like nothing more than dirt. And Biju&#39;s has taught me that beets are the perfect vector for the Indian flavor profile. The curry and cardamom and masala really make the beet&#39;s earthiness shine through. These were perfectly tender and so flavorful and delicious. If they have the beets, you are missing out if you don&#39;t get them!

We sat on the patio and scarfed down our food. They have nice indoor seating as well, and it also looks like you can take your bowls across the hall to Zephyr if that&#39;s more your style, which is pretty cool. They have decent happy hour discounts, although E got a beer and apparently they only do specific beers, instead of discounting their entire line up. They have some tasty looking crafts, but none of those were on happy hour.

Overall, if you want traditional curry, this place is probably not for you. Part of me left pining for saag paneer and lamb biriyani heavy on the coconut milk and veggie korma. But if you&#39;re looking for something kinda fun and not too badly priced that&#39;s slightly slanted toward those Indian flavors you know and love, and think this place will make you pretty happy."

I was torn between a 3 and 4. Initially my husband and I were SUPER stoked about this place. It looked fresh, moderately healthy, patio seating on a nice day, and chipotle-style Indian, yes please! We ordered 2 different dishes to share the coconut one and the extra spicy one. The basically had the exact same ingredients, minus 1 of 2 things. We also ordered a side of samosas to try. There was so many things in the bowl, but honestly it tasted so bland. I tried my husbands and his tasted almost exactly like mine. (Not surprising considering they included most of the same ingredients) The samosas were ok, not amazing, but definitely enjoyable. The reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 4 is due to the fact the employees were kinda rude, not a large menu to choose from, and food was bland. When I&#39;m back in the Denver area, I will not be eating here."

The fusion thing could be interesting, but when all you do is put curry in a &#34;Chipotle&#34; type rice bowl it doesn&#39;t work that well. IMO the cabbage (slaw) on top of the bowl did not go well with the bottom ingredients.

The meat choices vary a little as they&#39;re made each morning, so no two visits will be the exact same. Hard to establish a favorite, but easy to explore. 

It works Chipotle style, pick a meat (or veggie) pick a rice, pick from a few add-ons, pick your heat level.

You can get samosa (one of my favorite Indian snacks), I&#39;d go lamb, I&#39;m told they&#39;re better than the veggie, which i actually didn&#39;t care for very much at all.

My only complaint is the doling out of Chapati is a bit random, I&#39;ve gotten one on top of my bowl and I&#39;ve had to pay for them, I don&#39;t mind paying, or getting one with my bowl, I just dislike the stress of not knowing how it&#39;s gonna go down each time i go in.

The sauces really stand out to me here. They are all so bright, so deep and with such warmth! 

A huge plus for me was how everything (except for one yogurt sauce, the breads, and samosas) were all gluten and dairy free. The gluten-free lentil crackers are the finishing touch on top of each bowl and they are so crunchy, nutty, and delicious. Yay!

Curry has very little taste and sometimes I had to use my imagination to drum up any kind of flavor.  I was hungry and ate my whole bowl.  As we were leaving, I saw a sign for Osaka Ramen.  Probably should&#39;ve gone there instead.  However, I am a huge curry fan as I make it at home from time to time.  I even suggested to my Indian friends at work to try and they said the same thing about the curry.  The food they bring from home is bursting with all sorts of flavor.  Here, not so much.  The biggest flavor I found was requesting for my curry bowl to be spicy.  

On the bright side, this place is funky and the vibe is great.  However, if this is a restaurant, it has to have good food right?  It&#39;s borderline ok/good.  However, without a groupon, I don&#39;t think I would come here."

Their French bread is so soft and all the baked goods are fresh and wonderful. We&#39;ve had some sandwiches for lunch before too and have enjoyed it all.

Narrow and rustic with a location in Denver&#39;s Lower Highland area, Wooden Spoon Café &amp; Bakery is touted by many as one of the city&#39;s best breakfast eateries and featuring a short menu of breakfast as well lunch classics made largely from local ingredients an early morning visit largely confirmed the rumors, all eight items selected not only well priced but also quite delicious.

Homey in décor with friendly service that never seems short on smiles, entry to Wooden Spoon is likely to find small crowds just minutes after opening and with several styles of baked goods offered the only question becomes whether to dine-in or opt for a to-go order, and exactly where to focus.

Truly a diverse selection, though homestyle Americana clearly is a focus, those opting to take a seat at Wooden Spoon are offered tables as well as a small bar along the window and with selections suggested warmed-to-order I could not help but pick the restaurant&#39;s bread pudding to begin with, the day-old chocolate croissants further upgraded through the addition of chocolate chips as well as coconut, each bite dense with flavor and softly accented by vanilla custard.

Maintaining some semblance of lamination even when saturated it should come as no surprise that both the Almond Croissant and fruit-filled Danish were well constructed and crisp with a shattering shell overlying buttery insides, and moving on to a scone that balances pockets of fruit with those of butter the texture is certainly more &#34;muffin&#34; than &#34;British,&#34; but in my opinion all the better for it.

Excelling in the craftsmanship of three cookies, edges crisp while the center eats soft, chewy and lower in sugar than one may expect, those fancying Carrot Cake should put Wooden Spoon towards the top of their &#34;short list&#34; when searching for the best in the Mile High City, each bite awash with cinnamon and nutmeg with tangy notes added by smooth cream cheese frosting."

The iced coffee was decent.....wished I would have gotten a regular coffee after I had paid. Someone in our party ordered a hibiscus and berry iced tea. It was amazing.

There was a line, it was busy, but service was quick. All of the little tables and bar were full so we enjoyed breakfast at the adorable tables outside. 

Customers who placed an order were given a wooden spoon (hence the name) with a number written on it and then it would be brought out to you. 

The Wooden Spoon is located in a neighborhood with what appears to be &#39;regulars&#39;. Great relaxed atmosphere.

Day 2. Sauntered over to get my morning coffee. Decided the sticky bun looked too delicious to pass up. It was incredible. My friend decided on the cinnamon roll. The cream cheese icing was delicious!"

We have driven by many times and heard good things from our neighbor. We found the selection to be great and the food wonderful. The reason I am giving the place one star is because of the incredibly abrasive and rude hostess who took our order. She is the young lady with curly brown hair, glasses, and a nose ring. We ordered the special breakfast sandwich. It had egg, hash brown, avocado, havarti, and pepper jack. We simply asked if the hash brown could be left off. I had no idea that this was blasphemous in this establishment. I tried to create the same sandwich minus the hash brown with the &#34;make your own&#34; option but was unable to so. The woman kept asking if I was done ordering when I wasn&#39;t.  I just went ahead and ordered the special and then pulled off the hash brown and gave it to my wife. All other employees were pleasant.  I don&#39;t feel that the woman working should be in customer service.

Ordered the breakfast sandwich special (egg, ham &amp; cheddar on brioche).  For some reason it was $1 more then the regular breakfast sandwich which is egg on a brioche with choice of 2 toppings (though, I don&#39;t think ham was listed as a typical topping choice).  Brioche roll was tasty.  The cheese was cold which detracted a bit from an otherwise solid egg sandwich.  Iced coffee was really good for a cafe.  Also bought a cinnamon roll.  That was very disappointing. Was hard and crusty (not flaky, crusty) with little cinnamon flavor.  Ended up throwing it out.  Neat little neighborhood.  Would definitely recommend a trip but advise avoiding the cinnamon roll."

I ordered the sandwich with bacon and sauteed mushrooms.  You get so much egg!  Nice and hot and those mushrooms added a lot of flavor.  The bun was soft, my drink matched well.  But what doesn&#39;t match well with a great cappuccino?

I went on a weekday afternoon and a lot of their pastries were sold out, so this is a happening place.  I decided to order the macarons since those are a pain in the butt to make.  I was so excited to find another place that sells them.  I got the orange one, which was okay, I tasted a hit of orange and the lavender one.  Way too much lavender!  I didn&#39;t want to eat the plant itself and the cookie just didn&#39;t work for, too gummy.  So skip the macarons here.

The place has definite charm! If you order a soft drink, it comes in a glass bottle. There is a sign discouraging the use of laptops and or tablets in the shop, due to space.

Serious selection of baked goods that all looked too good to be true.

I also had the quinoa salad today and it was fantastic. It was easily the most filling salad I&#39;ve ever had and the cranberries, walnuts and vinaigrette rounded out the flavor. 

Under the rationale that I needed some protein, I also got a side of bacon after reading several reviews. I did not regret the extra lap around the park in an attempt to burn off bacon calories one little bit. Soooo good!

The space is small but the vibe is huge.  This was my first visit. I walked in at 10:30 on Friday morning and the cafe was packed inside and out which was alright because I was taking my food to go.  I waited in line for a few minutes and as I got closer to the counter I could see barista at work and the action in the kitchen.  Then I saw the pastries in the pastry case.  Wow.  First off the food looks great.  ALL OF IT.  The pastries were a tough choice.  Which one do I want?  Everything looked good.  I ordered a raspberry scone that was light and tasty, not sweet but creamy good.  I thought about a cup of coffee but then I saw the espresso shots at the espresso machine and they were perfect.  The crema was light and foamy then it settle down into a rich creamy froth.  So I ordered an Americano.  Standard Americanos here a two shots and 16 oz. of hot water.  The counter person asked if I wanted two shots and 12 oz. of water and thinking about that crema at the espresso machine how could I resist?  Excellent choice.  My drive back to my office in traffic was painless because I had the best scone and the best cup of coffee, Americano that I have had in a long time.  The staff works incredibly hard and their dedication to their job is apparent in the way they move and the look in their faces.  I watched while I waited for my Americano and I had a great time.  

I have lived in the Denver area for almost a year now and I wish I had found the Wooden Spoon sooner.  The Wooden Spoon is as good or better than any of the cafes I loved when I lived in the Bay Area 20 years ago.  I can&#39;t wait to bring my family here.  Their going to love it too."

This is the case with the charming wooden spoon cafe in lower highlands. 

This quaint shop only seats about a dozen customers at once, in their light filled space off of 28th and zuni. Luckily, owners jason and jeanette burgett turns out their made-to-order fare in no time, so, seats open up quickly and guests can also take their meals to go. There are always fresh flowers adorning each table and a friendly staff to welcome you inside. The large handwritten chalkboards display the menus; full of local ingredients and purveyors from around town. However, what draws most customers into wooden spoon is not visible on a menu; the abundant selection of homemade pastries are ever changing and proudly displayed at the counter.

So, speaking of pastries... the sweet treats at wooden spoon are as delicious to eat as they are to drool over in the display cases. Key lime tarts, fresh scones, flour-less chocolate cakes, delicate french macarons, apple tarts with cream anglaise, chewy cookies, turnovers and more are baked fresh daily and often times, sell out before lunch. I have tried a couple of the savory turnovers too and they are quite flaky so I would suggest grabbing a couple extra napkins, a fork and a knife. They also bake cakes, pies, tarts and more for the holidays and take specialty orders but I have yet to try them out and comment on their quality.

Wooden spoon should be quite proud of their spot-on breakfast and lunch program. Six days a week the tiny kitchen produces a handful of breakfast sandwiches, a couple hearty and flavorful salads, along with about a dozen delectable sandwiches. I am partial to the fresh mozzarella, peppery arugula-pesto, tomato and balsamic sandwich for its simplicity but strong ingredients. Another favorite includes the tasty mixed greens salad; a bed of greens topped with thinly sliced pear, toasted almonds, pickled radish and a light buttermilk dressing. I have also been caught ordering the quinoa salad a time or two and it is quite filling. This salad is a mix of protein-rich quinoa, arugula, candied pecans, sweet cranberries and a lemony vinaigrette. The best part of both salads, the rich goat cheese crostini that comes on the side. Always check out the daily specials as wooden spoon serves up a different quiche each day along with one of their awesome homemade soups. 

I love finding neighborhood spots that deliver both sweet and savory options and wooden spoon is one of those cafes you cannot help but regularly visit. If its a sweet treat in the afternoon with a cup of coffee, a filling mid-day lunch or grabbing a handful of pastries to take home for a weekend brunch, wooden spook will have you taken care of."

Date of Visit: 5/7/14

Stopped by the Wooden Spoon via Yelp recommendation; after all, it&#39;s hard to carry 4+ stars as a bakery &amp; sandwich place. The seating area is small, but very lively. I had the Roast Beef sandwich (with caramelized onion, cheddar, &amp; horseradish cream). The beef was flavorful, and a great portion size. The horseradish cream made it a bit messy, but the taste trumped that aspect. The dining area was alive with people reading/working, and there were a few small outdoor tables to enjoy the sights/sounds of Denver&#39;s Highlands area. I did not get to try any baked goods (aside from the sandwich bread), but the pastries were visually impressive.

The Wooden Spoon: Starbucks with Soul."

They are small in size, but big on flavor, since their breakfast sandwiches are amazing.

The Wooden Spoon is only open for breakfast and lunch (T-F 7:00-2:00, Sat 8:00-2:00, Sun 8:00-12:00). I&#39;ve only had their breakfast sandwiches so far, but I can easily say they&#39;re the best I&#39;ve had! One of these days, I&#39;ll head over to the Wooden Spoon to their lunch menu, which I&#39;m sure it is as delicious as their breakfast.

If there is a thing you must try though, it&#39;s their baked goods. We&#39;ve had their cinnamon and sticky buns, and all I can say, as someone who does not have a sweet tooth, is that they are simply decadent and delicious! 

So if you are around the LoHi area and craving for delicious breakfast sandwiches, stop by the Wooden Spoon. You will not be disappointed."

One Yelper even seemed thoroughly pissed when she found out that they only serve breakfast until 11am. Those are some addicting breakfast sandwiches if they make someone lose their S@%* when not available :) Other Yelper, I now know what you were feeling. If I couldn&#39;t get one after making the drive I would momentary think about throwing a chair through the front window! Lol! I wouldn&#39;t, but there would be some crazy thoughts definitely. 

I have been here twice so far. Once for dessert and another for breakfast. When I came here for breakfast I was surprised at how minimal their menu is, however small it is quality! I had the mushroom, egg, bacon sandwich on a brioche bun. Sounds so ho hum and simple with these minimal ingredients you would think, but together they create a sandwich so delectable!!! Highly suggest!! They also have egg scrambles for breakfast, salads and soups for lunch and a great selection of desserts and pastries. This is my man&#39;s fav breakfast spot now and definitely one of mines too :)

The pastries and desserts are top notch! They have macarons, which are some of my favs in the city. The raspberry tarts are completely worth the trip here alone. Buttery crust, creamy and rich sauce, and plump berries to boot! Yessssss!!! This is the bulk of their selection and too many to talk about. Just go and check them out :) If you want to see everything they have you should go early because once they sell out that is it for the day. You get fresh baked goods, but with that they only make so much a day. I like that concept even though you might miss out! 

I will be coming back shortly :) I have to try more off their menu maybe lunch! I love the vibe here and the employees are always nice. I hope they put my review up on their wall :D They do that you know! Even the bad ones go up for all to see. Look for your review next time you are eating there!"

Service: friendly and I was informed of the wait time for the food that we ordered. I call that common courtesy.

Food: I opted for the breakfast special which was a pork belly egg sandwich with corn salsa for about $7. It would take an estimated 30 minutes, but well worth the wait. It was a pretty decent portion (aka I was full) and the greasy pork belly was balanced by the corn salsa in my opinion (aka it was also delicious).

Drinks: coffee, pretty damn good. OJ, perhaps from a carton? But it was $2, so I&#39;m not expecting fresh squeezed.

Other notes: this place can be hard to find as the sign in the window is hard to see. Don&#39;t give up!

Final words: Overall, this quaint little breakfast/lunch/bakery is delightful for a quick bite. The place is small so don&#39;t be an a-hole and hog the table! (Not that it happened but it totally could and I would have great feelings of dislike toward someone who did that.)"

I personally love anything with pesto and or prosciutto - especially on fresh bread.    There are a few small tables on the sidewalk, always with cute dogs nearby, and the inside offers several tables and a bar at the window.

Lucky me finds the Wooden Spoon within 12 hours to fit that need perfectly.

It&#39;s a small establishment, but it makes well of the small space with window side seating and small, French inspired tables and chairs. The menu is quite large with delicious sandwiches in every corner of the old timey chalkboard. The pastries, while mostly gone by my arrival at 1 PM, look tasty and inspired.

I went with the Brie and meat sandwich (not the actual title) and it was delicious. The bread is crusty and fresh and resembles something you could get in Paris (are you starting to see a theme?). In order to increase my caloric intake, I also got a yummy apple tart.

All in all, I would highly recommend this place for something different. Denver is fast becoming a haven for harsh atmosphere and heavy meats. This could serve as the perfect alternative."

With that said I absolutely adored my breakfast with Frances G here. My cup of coffee and breakfast sandwich was a simple order, but it was delicious in its simplicity. The space is small, but it feels friendly instead of crowded and we didn&#39;t have any trouble finding a spot to sit on a weekday around 10.

I had the breakfast sandwich with Swiss and Bacon. It&#39;s not usually the combo I go for but I really enjoyed it. The brioche was fresh, with a rich and tender crust. The egg was steaming hot and the entire sandwich was excellent overall. I took a raspberry tart and a caramel (cookie thingy). The tart is absolutely perfect... I feel like I&#39;m in Europe when I eat it. The caramel stick was like a giant twix bar but it was a tad too rich for me. Nonetheless, it was very good!!

Hands down, my favorite sandwich shop in Denver.  I had the prosciutto, brie, arugula, and seasonal fruit sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and you could really taste the difference.  They gave a healthy helping of prosciutto which really helped blend all the flavors together.  I substituted my chips for fresh fruit, expecting to get some typical fruit mix of cantaloupe, pineapple, and melon.  Instead I was very very pleasantly surprised when I got raspberries and blueberries.

Yes - wooden spoon is cramped, they don&#39;t offer wi-fi, sometime there is even a 30-min wait for their egg sandwiches, they frequently run out of a lot of pastries before noon and they don&#39;t even let you snatch their pastries by calling ahead of time - but they seem to string on a large following just solely on their mouth-watering scrumptious food.

I went on weekday mornings--late morning-- when the place is not crowded, but the inventory is pretty complete.  Coda coffee is good, and well prepared. The ambiance is nice, someone has done simple but pleasant--and vaguely humorous, just look at that great sausage poster--decorating.

The no computer policy goes too far. With limited seating, anyone who hogs a table for hours during a rush with their computer plugged into the wall should be asked to leave. Policy or no policy. But it means I can&#39;t enjoy a magazine on my tablet?!? On a weekday when all but two tables are empty? Yes, I was asked to put the tablet away, even though the day before I was told it was okay when I asked. Doesn&#39;t make sense.

What they offer, though, and what we had, tasted great and was well-prepared. The prices are right and the portions are large. Come here with your appetite.

The menu has some great apps and the sandwich and burger selection is pretty diverse. They also have soup, green chili, and salad.

The tavern tots are delicious, and the ranch dressing that comes with them tastes homemade. I ordered the mac and cheese with bacon, as well as a romaine wedge salad. My wife ordered the Boomer burger. EVERYTHING TASTES LIKE IT WAS MADE FROM SCRATCH - TRULY WONDERFUL. This is some tavern!!! 

The waitress dropped the ball at the end. We sat there waiting - and waiting - for her to come by with a box and the check. I sat there and stared at her, hoping to get her attention, but she was caught up carrying on with her co-workers. I hate this. Another of her tables next to us got up to get her and we caught her then. Bad ending to a great meal. Hence the 4 stars."

My brother and I went to Highland Tavern while visiting Denver and after seeing it featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. It was a while since I had initially seen the episode but I remember saying that if given the opportunity, I would definitely check it out.

I think I set my expectations a little too high. Based on my visit, I can confirm one thing that Highland Tavern really does right: Tavern Tots. More like hand-rolled hash brown balled up into goodness and complimented with perfect dipping sauces. I could&#39;ve only eaten the tots and be satisfied. I also ordered the roasted turkey club sandwich which was nothing to rave about. As a whole, the sandwich was average with the bread being a little dry.

Despite the sandwich, this place still deserves at least 4 stars. The menu has a lot to offer and there were good beers on tap. Our waitress was as friendly as could be and I just felt comfortable hanging here, even after finishing our meal.

I would like to come back some day and I think you should too."

Jk they were good, but personally I think they were hyped a little too much which raised my expectations too high. My wife absolutely loved them though so yes it was just me, not the batch we got. 

We came here for brunch on a Sunday morning, she ordered the chicken fried steak and I got the tavern burger with green chili topping. The burger was great, chili really put it together. Where I was surprised was the griddled potatoes on the side of the steak, those were what I was most impressed with. Texture and flavor were great! 

The staff here are awesome, it&#39;s self seating so we watched this older couple trying to put together tables for a large group. One of the staff came by and told them they have larger tables  available and to leave the tables as they were (a messy jumble) and they cleaned it up for them, I thought a little help like that was worth noting. 

Good luck with parking, luckily we went during odd hours because it started getting crowded when we left, I assume it&#39;s a hot place for watching Sunday football. Definitely recommend this placed I would like to try some more items on the menu that was not offered during brunch hours."

Okay maybe more needs to be said, but their pub food here is solid. The burger is awesome, I thought their sandwiches were alright and the french dip was a little too salty for me, but the burger! 

I guess after I went there, I found out that they were in Diners, Drive Ins &amp; Dives. But the tots were still good even though I did not know they were quasi famous!

We came here with a group of 12 and were seated promptly. The service was pretty fast given the size of our group, and at the end the waitress was kind enough to split the check a billion ways, which is a plus. The ambience is fun, with lots of different sporting events on any of the many televisions at the same time.  

I ordered the Bombshell, a pastrami sandwich with slaw and an egg, and a side of the famous tots. SO DELICIOUS, I ate the whole thing! There&#39;s something about the tots, maybe dill? They almost taste like a combination of hash browns and tater tots. My husband ordered the El Guapo burger, a burger with green chiles and pickled onions, that was pretty good. This place also has great happy hour drink deals, and a great beer selection. The apricot blonde was perfect. 

Overall, great fun place with good food to enjoy with friends."

Just outside of Denver across I-25, sits an unassuming storefront on a corner lot. 

It&#39;s decor is the usual mix of dark wood, random paintings and beer Swag. 

Pretty good tap list here with plenty for all level of drinkers. 

Multi leveled seating and bar setup make good use of the space during the peak times. 

The menu isn&#39;t going to wow people, it covers the basics you would expect and doesn&#39;t venture too far out one way or the other. 

The star attraction here are the burgers and the tots. 

The burger starts with a brioche bun that holds up to the burger and toppings, even when on the rare side. 

Decent selection of cheeses and toppings but again, nothing way outside the lines. 

They use fresh beef and cook each to order, no matter the temp they always seem to nail it, which if you eat burgers a lot, happens less than it should. 

Don&#39;t let previous tot experiences make you steer clear, they are as good as you&#39;ve heard.

What makes these so different is they are not chopped and formed like most, they are actually shredded like a macaroon, and seasoned inside and out. The texture you get from the crunchy exterior and the interweaved layers inside is perfection. 

The regular fries are good, but I don&#39;t even bother anymore, straight to the tots."

Add to that solid burgers and a great beer list and you&#39;ve got a winner in Highland Tavern!  Totally worthy of their Diners, Drive Ins and Dives fame. 

Side note for the management (if you&#39;re reading these):  Our service was horrible.  Took forever to order, we had to ask for refills and to go boxes. She spent most of her time rolling silverware.

We had a dinner party of 7 and were seated rather quickly on a Saturday night. Only complaint was that it took for ever for our appetizers, that when they finally arrived, our food arrived within minutes later. 

We had the tater tots and fried pork rinds. They both were awesome! Home made for sure. Their homemade ranch dressing is light and yummy. 

For dinner I had the turkey sandwich with a side salad. All food was fresh and portioned well. The onion relish on the turkey is a little sweet but great flavors. My bread was horrible though and the sandwich is cold, not hot.

The food here is absolutely amazing! Initially when I first tried this restaurant, they would get really busy really quickly and seating was difficult to find, but they have recently expanded and added extra tables, so that is not really as much of an issue any more.

If you come here, you HAVE to try their tater tots and pork rinds! I have taken a couple friends here and when I mentioned the tots, they were not too keen on trying them. Fortunately, we still ordered a basket for the table and they loved them! The tots are house made, so don&#39;t expect them to be like your generic tater tots you&#39;d try in school. They are well known for them and crucial to the experience. In addition, the pork rinds are also house made and served with a delicious chile lime salt and are equally addicting. Try them, you will not be disappointed!

Their entrees, particularly burgers, are also delicious and I do not think I have ever been disappointed by anything I have ever eaten here. One of the best spots in the Highlands and you will see what all the buzz is about the moment you try your first bite!"

Based on the recommendations from other Yelpers I enjoyed the Bombshell with a side of Tavern Tots. Yum and yum! The Bombshell was an incredibly delicious pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese, brown mustard, tavern slaw, and a fried egg. Yes it sounds decadent, and it is, but it wasn&#39;t over the top. The flavors all blended so well. The tots are made in-house and were delicious as well, but nothing could top that Bombshell. The hubby enjoyed the El Guapo burger with fries and was plenty happy with his dinner choice as well.

Those tots. Oh those tots. Thinking about them now still as I write this a day later. I&#39;m not a cult tots guy, some tots just suck. Too soggy, no flavor. Oh boy, not these. Amazing. Crispy, flavorful and addicting. Best I have had in my life! 

The home made pastrami and pork rinds are equally as good. The only complaint, albeit minor, was the amount of pastrami on my sandwich. I know making it from home is probably expensive, but when you think pastrami you think several inches of cured red meat between two rye slices.

Here are the untold Hollywood story&#39;s cold hard facts about this place:

1. The tots are way too salty and that depletes the quality of them. 
2. The quality of the pastrami does not taste fresh.
3. You can more than likely make a better turkey sandwich at your own house than the  highland taverns sandwich.
4. Do not order the pastrami sandwich that includes the egg and cheese unless you prefer extremely soggy bread and non-fresh pastrami meat, as mentioned above.

The quality of the food here in no way, shape or form justifies the price. The bottom line is: don&#39;t believe everything you see on TV, since fiction is often made to seem like fact and reality. And the real reality is: this is a subpar below average restaurant bar. 

P.S., just a thought question for myself - what is that smell you often find in taverns / restaurant bars when you first walk in? Is that beer mixed with pastrami or corn beef? WTH is that welcome to restaurant bar / tavern smell?????"

Instead, you&#39;re met with a smile from the friendly bartenders who are eager to serve you up some grub and brews.

First things first - TOTS. Just. Tots. Get them and never forget how those tots made you tingle in places you never thought possible. Think bathing-suit-area-tingling from the tots. 

I ordered their veggie sandwich because spotting one of those in a sports bar-like environment is rarer than Bigfoot stomping around LoDo. The sandwich was awesome! Pickled red onion, sliced apples, herbed goat cheese, spinach, and served on a warm flatbread - this was exactly what my tastebuds were after.

Even though I&#39;m a fan of the spice, something about the rub didn&#39;t do it for me and I wouldn&#39;t be eager to recommend these. What I would champion? The Bombshell! This drippy sandwich of pastrami deliciousness was definitely a winner (and unfortunately my boyfriend&#39;s dish). My friend who doesn&#39;t eat beef was along for the ride and they wouldn&#39;t swap out chicken for a burger patty which kind of surprised me. She went with a turkey sandwich that was a-ok. 

If I lived in Denver, I&#39;m pretty sure I would reside in the Highlands and this is a spot I&#39;d definitely frequent. It has a laid back vibe with ping pong, TVs for catching game, booze and food. Thanks Triple D!"

Guy Fieri said the tots were even better than his  own so we just HAD to truck all the way from Seattle to try &#39;em out. (We also will be dropping off my eldest at the Air Force Academy.).

We spoke with the owner as well.  He and the staff were attentive and the owner was very passionate about his craft. My family will definitely be returning for the food (Oh, and to visit my son at the Academy. Love ya, son! :) Of course, our son will visiting whenever he can - lucky kid.

I think tatter tots are a waste of a potato normally, but this bar showed me what God intended the tot to be. They were delicious and my bombshell was great also. That sandwich was amazing until the last bite. Beer selection was great, personally I don&#39;t know why they even bother with sh*t beers on the menu when they have such a good selection of micro-brews and seasonal&#39;s, but to each their own. 

Service was good, nothing you&#39;re going to leave 40% tips on, but solid. Food, beer it all came out in an acceptable amount of time, and nothing was cold (except the beer). 

My only knock on the place is the amount of tots you get when you substitute them into your meal. You pay extra to substitute them, I think you should have enough to be happy. I was with a buddy and he looked down at our food when they arrived and shouted &#34;we need an extra order of tots.&#34; To be honest I also thought it looked a little light, but I didn&#39;t 100% agree with him until I had my first bite. I think 3-4 more tots would be perfect. 

Next time I go, and their will be a next time, I have to try the pork rinds."

I&#39;ve been here twice already.  The tots and chicharones are excellent, mimosas aren&#39;t bad either.  all in all, the menu items are good and prices are fair.  I really love their bourbon french toast, you don&#39;t even need the side of syrup but should have an egg on the side.  They have a biscuit and gravy plate that is really best if shared unless you have a huge appetite.
The atmosphere is good for a lazy Sunday morning, kick back with coffee or mimosas and watch sports on the screens visible from most booths.  The staff are friendly and efficient.

I was almost seated in the back until I asked to be seated at a table in the main area.

They ran out of food.. breakfast food.. The first meal for the day. Who runs out of pork and grits?!?!! VERY LIMITED breakfast menu. I just walked out.

The ambiance was noisy and obnoxious.

We went there last night and had a hard time deciding what to order so we ummm... went with a little of everything. We ended up ordering the pork rinds, beets, baby bok choy and of course the tater tots. While the beets tasted great, they paled when compared to the rest. We continued with the green chili stew, pastrami bomb, pastrami french dip and the Korean rib tips. Once again, delicious. There is no way food should be this good (and relatively cheap) for a bar. 

Being from out of town, I came back with a buddy a couple of days later and reloaded on tots but tried the wings (k rub) and Dr. Pepper ribs. Fantastic.

Oh yeah, the beer selection wasn&#39;t left behind in the dust. Stellar place and service.

I got a booth but the tables are fixed to the wall so if you are a stout person choose a table. 
This place is a dive bar with a great bar menu. Nothing to high brow here but all very clever choices along with the cool bar food theme. 
My waitress was awesome! Super intuitive,  very friendly, cute as a bug, and quite personable. I told her my triple D obsession and she hooked me up. Start with the fried pork rinds. I was never a fan of the bagged version but these were far superior. Great for sitting at the bar with a beer. Way too salty for me although also second with spicy paprika. I still ate the whole bowl of them. I had the Boomer burger that is Sautéed onions and mushrooms truffle oil Brie on a brioche style bun it was excellent. it came with 6 tots at first I thought I needed more but the tots are filling.

The wedge salad is a head of romaine, so it&#39;s huge, but has the fantastic blue cheese dressing &amp; bacon, so... can&#39;t really go wrong there.  The Dr. Pepper ribs are awesome! The Korean ribs are pretty tasty.  And the seasonal dessert is fantastic!

Unfortunately, my last few visits were after  they were just featured on the food network and the whole place was totally overrun. Which is great for a local business but it seemed like the kitchen couldn&#39;t keep up with the demand. Staff was still their awesome selves but the tots were way too dark.

The owner checks on us each time we go in there and we love the waitresses.  We recently moved to California but are planning our next trip back just to go here for the food.

The show did not do the food justice.  Let start by the best Bloody Mary&#39;s.  Vodka has jalapeños that have been marinating in it giving the drink and wonderful spice.  Just the right amount of vodka and tomato juice round out this drink perfectly.

Don&#39;t forget there homemade pork rinds...with perfect crunch and good seasoning fits right up there with the orgasmic tater tots

The tater tots are amazing thing you could eat.  They are made from scratch and are so filling.

They&#39;ve expanded since the publicity by Guy Fieri  - Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

1.  The restaurant is bigger &amp; expanded.
     A.  It use to be much smaller &amp; more of a &#34;local secret.&#34;
     B.  There is now a mezzanine in the back.
     C.  The bathroom is now down a decent set of stairs.

2.  There is no more ping pong table @ the front.
     A.  Pool table on the mezzanine with video games.
     B.  More TV&#39;s, but 1 is broken by the booths.
     C.  Not sure about losing the ping pong table, it was iconic.

3.  Is mainstream better?
     A.  What if you cant walk down the stairs to the bathroom?
     B.  If you&#39;re expanding, can older folks use the elevator for the bathroom?  Stairs are very steep.
     C.  Tater-Tots haven&#39;t changed.  =D
     D.  Food is excellent, but the tin pans they come in, are okay.  I recommend nice plates.
     E.  Also, the paper napkins got to go.  Get cloth napkins, everyone benefits.

4.  Why wasn&#39;t the bar expanded?
     A.  The far end of the bar was the old bathroom.
     B.  Its now a garage wall with windows.
     C.  Nice eating area.
     D.  More of a restaurant, then the cool bar it used to be.

All-in-all, the food is still awesome, but instantly I walked in &amp; didn&#39;t recognize the place.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, its nice - its just different &amp; not what it used to be.  Good job making the place into a great family and exciting restaurant!  I am just sad its not the night bar I once hit up for an entire summer!"

Wanting an all American burger, we came here on the 4th of July based on the reviews. I started with  their Bloody Mary, it was watered down and tasteless. After that I switched to a beer, paying $4 for the waitress to hand me a can of beer with no offer of a glass. My fiancé had a couple of beers, he was given a glass for one of his. We had to request a couple of waters from her.
Based on reviews we tried their pork rinds. We both agreed that if they didn&#39;t dump seasoning on them they would be a great little starter. My fiancé had the &#39;Stupid Burger&#39; and fries. Beyond delicious! I had the &#39;Guapo Burger&#39; which was good, but not as good as his. My side, the tots, were phenomenal! 
If we based the review on food alone, it would be five stars the whole way. Their rating suffered from a waitress that cared more about talking to her friends at the bar than doing her job. Thankfully the kitchen staff were kind enough to do her job for her and bring us our food."

We came on a Saturday afternoon at about 3pm and easily found street parking. Though we just barely got a table. College football = packed.

Happy hour happens daily and is from 4-7. The specials are super good, though their regular cocktails are also amazing. I had the peach tea ($6) and a house margarita ($4 during happy hr) and both were very strong and well worth their price.

Now, the main reason for our trip was to try their tots. We ordered a large and they were brought out quickly. A large is perhaps best split between 3-4 people as we were struggling to finish them at the end (a small had ~6-8 tots). That being said, they are amazing. Super crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked and seasoned on the inside. The dipping sauce is a spicy ranch, which is a nice touch. Our friends joined us shortly after we piled these in our faces and they were equally as impressed with their smaller order.

We wouldn&#39;t hesitate to return, especially to try their other food items."

My brother suggested the Highland Tavern which he had visited once based on the Guy Fieri coverage.  We called first to make sure the place was child friendly.  We had a 3 year old and infant in toe. 

The neighborhood seems so typical of these new reviving cities.  Smaller houses have been plucked by young professionals and starter buyers to fully renovate and other spaces have interesting, new, modern architecture.  This combines with some of the old retail spaces with some fun and exciting options for dining and drinking.  As you walk in they have a PBR mural and a very modern sign.  The place is a tavern and set up like a pub.  The bar lines one side  and the place is well kept and renovated, not run down.  We grabbed a booth where we could rangle the kids.  Seating was first come and first serve.  

The menu is fairly simple which is refreshing.  Too many places like to be everything to everyone.  The theme is expanded an maybe gourmet bar food.  The server came quickly to get drinks and came back for orders in proper time.  She was careful to separate the items which were to come out first as appetizers and the items to come out with the sandwiches.  First we had and &#34;On The Bone&#34; of buffalo wings.  I would describe the taste and flavor as normal buffalo sauce but this was had the sense of homemade instead of Sysco.  It was vinegary and spice with what appeared to be asian Sambal or other hot sauce inspired.  Wings were fried, served with blue cheese, carrot/celery and meaty. 

I had the Bombshell sandwich which was pastrami, swiss, mustard, slaw and a fried egg on toasted rye bread.  I tried to eat the sandwich with my hands but had to revert to fork an knife.  Everything about the sandwich was spot on.  We also ordered the famed tots and they did not disappoint.  They are crispy on the outside with a center that is flavorful and served with ranch sauce.  My brother had the rueben which appeared as perfectly crafted as the Bombshell.  My sister in law had the burger which was made to temperature and finely crafted.  

You can taste the difference in a place like the HIghland Tavern.  When a place relies on simple classics yet innovative ideas along with scratch cooking, you are just going to taste the difference."

This is hands down my favorite pub. The pork rinds are TO DIE FOR and the Bombshell is my honey&#39;s favorite sandwich. Honestly there is nothing bad on the menu. I get the pig and grits if I&#39;m feeling super hungry but usually pick the burger or breakfast sandwich depending on when we come. The mimosas are tasty but I highly likely recommend the spicy bloody Mary&#39;s. They do not disappoint! I think they do bottomless mimosas on the weekend and $4 bloodys? Check the back of the menu to be sure. 

Over the past year the decor has changed a bit. At first it&#39;s was pretty small but they opened up the back of the restaurant and moved and upgraded the restrooms - a much needed improvement! There is neat art on the walls and the booths kinda make you feel like you&#39;re in church.  There&#39;s plenty of tvs so you&#39;ll never miss a game either."

Upon asking the server why this was happening, she told me that the bartender has the ability to change the songs or cut the songs short if/when he wants. Why give customers the option to pick music, just to change it? Plus I paid for this music and obviously wanted to listen to the songs. This alone made me not want to come back. Sorry, but either remove the option for customers to pay for and pick music or remove the songs that the bartender deems are not to his/her liking. :("

The food is good but the portion sizes are too small for what you pay for (not enough meat). The pastrami is quite tasty (the Tavern Dip) but the corned beef needed more flavor (the Reuben). The Dr. Pepper Ribs were quite tasty with a good flavor profile.  Turkey sandwich was good. You must try the pickles, they are delicious with quite a kick.

Service is excellent. All sodas were refilled without asking. The glasses were there one minute and gone the next.  The restaurant is well staffed. 

Although the restaurant is child friendly, there is nothing on the menu that is child portioned or well designed for them. 

Ambient noise is definitely up there. Not a date night restaurant but a good place to hang with friends or in case you are looking for a pastrami sandwich.  Parking is in the neighborhood, a little walking is necessary but not bad."

Walking in, the place just looks like a normal sports joint: lots of TVs and average decor. We started with the tots, which were a no brainer after reading some of the reviews on here, and wings. The wings were good, not the best I have ever had, but the tater tots definitely were. It was a different take on them, as they were more like hash browns but so, so very good. Probably could have eaten those just as my meal. As for the actual entrees, I ordered the turkey sandwich which was super good. I&#39;m not normally a big mayo person, but the way it combined with the avocado provided a lot of great flavor. I wish I could remember what everyone else had gotten, but they had different sandwiches which they also said were phenom. Added bonus was that they serve Strongbow, which I love. I do not remember too much about the service, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. If they were terrible, I would have remembered. With all the TVs, I was surprised that I just so happened to have been sitting in what felt like the one seat in the place where there wasn&#39;t one in my eyeline and had to strain to see one. Overall, I am already looking forward to going back and trying out some other stuff (plus tots)!"

The &#39;hood is a bit shady but maybe that keeps the snobs away. We don&#39;t judge; we just like good food.
I had the burger with brie, mushrooms, grilled onions, and truffle oil. I thought the truffle oil might be a bit much but it absolutely was not. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the kitchen knows what it is doing. I even had a side salad because I felt guilty about all of the face stuffing I did over the weekend and it was so fresh! No iceberg crappy lettuce here. Plus all of the dressings are homemade.
Hubs felt less guilty and ordered the Bombshell- which is exactly how it sounds. Pastrami with an egg- oh lordy it was amazing. He upgraded to the tots and yes, those bad boys are a must do for sure. 
It is diner food as an art form and I can&#39;t wait to see what other tasty delights the people at Highland Tavern dish out."

And lucky for me whenever I go out with my girlfriend and her parents they all are the type that love to share food so it was like having four food options in one!

I chose the Dr. Pepper ribs and they were delicious!  So succulent and juicy and full of flavor.  My girl&#39;s Dad had the Korean ribs and they were pretty delicious too.  My girl had a basic burger which was tasty (not the best I&#39;ve had but hey it was good and far from the worst).....the tots are what really made an impression.  Sooooooo good.  My girl&#39;s Mom ordered a wedge salad and my goodness it&#39;s like a salad bar in a bowl.  The thing is huge and could easily feed a party of two or three.  My girl said the bleu cheese dressing was good....I didn&#39;t try any but I trust her judgement ;-)  

Another thing that sets this place apart from other places around town is that they seem to create so much in house.  Aside from a menu item or two everything is made on the spot and you can definitely tell from the flavor and quality.

Said something to the bartender when she dropped off our regular meals and she got all defensive and was very very rude stating that they don&#39;t water down their ranch even tho i was very polite and all i said was that the ranch doesn&#39;t taste as good as usual. This won&#39;t stop us from going again because minus the ranch dressing being absolute garbage that night the food is always awesome.

My boyfriends brother is in town who saw this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives, so we decided to check it out. The atmosphere is welcoming and inviting, the drink selection is expansive and creative, but the food is to die for. From the outside you wouldn&#39;t expect it to be so good, but it is! I ordered the Reuben sandwich, which, being from the northeast and having worked at a sandwich shop, I was hesitant to order because I have high expectations and I haven&#39;t been able to find a decent hoagie or sandwich in Colorado since I moved here in September. But this Reuben was honestly one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! My boyfriend ordered &#34;the stupid burger&#34; and it was quite a mouthful. We got a tomato soup to split and that was fantastic as well, again one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Very creamy and full of flavor, served at the perfect temperature. My boyfriends brother ordered the ....... With the tavern tator tots, which are everything they are cracked up to be. I seriously don&#39;t know what they put in those things and that sauce they serve them with, but they are addicting. We hope to make his spot one of our new regular places to eat and drink.  The only things I could say I didn&#39;t like we&#39;re the skinny fries that came with my Reuben. Other than that this place was great.

Unfortunately our experience left a lot to be desired for. The good: the ambience is great with just the right amount of light, Windows and plenty of tv&#39;s. We went on Easter Sunday and were surprised that they were, in the words of someone who answered the phone when I called for call ahead wait list, &#34;so slow and dead&#34;. We were seated immediately, and our server approached us immediately to take our drinks. We ordered the tots as appetizers and they came out fast. We placed our meal orders and the food came out quickly as well. Typically this should be expected considering how slow they were and that was not a disappointment. The not so good: the food was ok at best. I had the pastrami hash, another had the crispy confit wings, another the tavern burger. None of which knocked our socks off. The burger came out perfect temp. The best part of the whole meal was the tots. We asked for the check and to this point service was great. I received the check only to notice that I was charged 50cents for the orange juice in the tequila sunrise and another 25 cents for the hot sauce that went into the buffalo wings!! Are you kidding me?? I&#39;m surprised I wasn&#39;t charged for the salt and pepper that went into pastrami hash. It&#39;s not the fact of the 75cents extra, it&#39;s the principle of the matter. Is this place that hard up for sales/money that you are going to charge for a basic ingredient that goes into a drink or food item I which we are already paying a pretty good price for??? When I mentioned it to the server her attitude went from welcoming to complete bitchiness. SO DISAPPOINTING. Between 3 of us my bill was $70(including the extra .75 cents). I can assure you that the end of my dining experience was what compelled me to post this. I will share this with my friends, family, etc. It&#39;s just a shame."

If I am NOT mistaken, this establishment has the Same Owners as the Bayou Snack Shack and Kathmandu Kitchen.

YES, this establishment featured 2 Cuisines - Indian and Cajun.

YES, this establishment is BIG aka HUGE to hold LARGE Parties, EVENTS what nots..

From the MENU we opt to have the following items :

*  Tandoori Assorted ($15.00)
*  Lamb Vindaloo ($15.00)
*  Lamb Biryani ($15.00)
*  Garlic Naan ($3.00)
*  Coffee ($2.08)
*  Masala Tea ($3.01)

Yes they offer Complimentary Papadum with 2 dipping sauces.  This item arrive at our table about 13:35hrs ish. 

The food did take awhile to be ready despite we are the only patrons there until mid way during dining then another party of 3 guests arrived at this establishment.  At 13:50hrs ish, our Appetizer of Tandoori Assorted is being served to our table.  Then followed by my order of Lamb Biryani and Hubs order of Lamb Vindaloo at 14:00hrs ish.  

But does the food deliver for our taste bud.  BIG NO!  BIG Mistake to dine in to begin with.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT INDEED!

Furthermore they overcharged on certain items which is by the way, I should have taken the picture of the Menu, in which I did not.  *SIGH*  Hence what reflects on the receipt DOES NOT TALLY with what is in the Menu Pricing.

The Masala Chai Tea tasted more like Tea with Condensed Milk.  NO FLAVOR of Masala Chai at all.

They tend to &#34;skimp&#34; on certain items...

In my entire life, I NEVER had Lamb Biryani that is filled with VEGETABLES instead of lamb pieces in the Biryani itself.  Perhaps to make the Biryani more &#34;filling&#34; or to make the PORTIONS look Big, this establishment tends to filled it up with Vegetables instead.  When our staff strike the conversations with us, I mentioned this issue about the Biryani.  He mentioned that it was another Staff cooking this dish etc.  Err for one, where is the consistency if you want me to return.  No flavor at all, so bland... 

In terms of spicy, NOT SPICY at all..  But they offer SPICY Sauce at a side on a separate small plate/bowl, which apparently is more like HOT SAUCE to boot!  *DOUBLE SIGH*

This recent visit was on Sunday December 21st 2014.  NEVER TO RETURN, in which both Hubs and I agree.  My apologies for this rant and this 2 STARS Generous Review.

Left this establishment MAJORLY Disappointed with our Lunch at 14:45hrs ish.  *BIG SIGH INDEED* &amp; *SAD FACE INDEED*

This establishment is open during the following hours :

*  (LUNCH) - 11 am to 2:30 pm
*  (HAPPY HOUR) - 3 pm to 5 pm
*  (DINNER) - 5:30 pm to 9 pm

No, in this case, I&#39;m not mimicking an old candy commercial - I&#39;m instead waxing about the joint Indian/Nepalese and Cajun/Creole stylings of Cherry Creek Harbor in Aurora.

&#34;Wait, they have *what* kind of food there?&#34; I hear you ask. Well, here&#39;s the explanation. Do you remember how, a while back, there was a stripmall near Smoky Hill &amp; Buckley that had restaurants called Kathmandu Kitchen and Bayou Snack Shack (sometimes also known as Bayou Cafe)? It turns out that the owners of these two establishments are very good friends, and when they both had to leave their old spaces, they decided to pool their resources and invest in the exact same spot at Quincy/Parker. And boy, have they gussied it up! Gushing waterfalls, glittery sconces, muted lighting - it&#39;s classy. In fact, it&#39;s become a hotbed for local R&amp;B/soul/jazz performances, and even the occasional fashion show or two. But let&#39;s backtrack a bit and discuss the food in more detail.

Possible starters from the South Asian side include the springy veggie or chicken dumplings called Momo or the creamy cheese nuggets known as Paneer Pakora. Meanwhile, more Bayou-style beginnings can be had with a cup of chicken/sausage or seafood gumbo, or even some chicken wings with their secret-recipe &#34;Crazy Cajun&#34; sauce. But that&#39;s just a small sampling of what you&#39;ll find. Why, you could try some creamy seasonal-vegetable curry (Navrattan Korma) or the Chicken Jwano which gets its particular oomph from the exotic seed sometimes referred to as carom or ajwain. Or, you can always laissez les bons temps rouler with some smoky red beans and rice, or a hearty oyster po&#39;boy. And don&#39;t forget to save room for a little Kheer (rice pudding) or even the fresh-fried donut cousins called beignets."

The menu is half cajun, half Indian food strangely enough.  I had only cajun items which were okay.  The shrimp etoufee was probably the best item and really spicy... almost reminiscent of an Indian curry.  All the seafood was frozen for a while and you can tell by the texture.  I know they can&#39;t help that because crawfish isn&#39;t in season and the turnover doesn&#39;t seem high enough here.

Beignets were really dense and slightly undercooked which is not like an authentic beignet.

Service was good because we were the only party eating there.  The only others were there for a group dance lesson near the stage.  I&#39;m glad they were there otherwise it&#39;d be even more quiet.  Beautiful space though."

You want Indian food, you order from an Indian restaurant right? You want Cajun, you order from one of the (very rare here in Colorado) Cajun restaurants right? 

So I see this place on grubhub and say to myself &#34;Lets give it a try. I am in the mood for Indian and Cajun and want enough for leftovers tomorrow.&#34;

And you know what? I was not disappointed. I am not sure who thought up the mixed ethnicity concept, and I don&#39;t know who is in the kitchen (I will go in and say hi some day) but it works. And it works well. I love this place and I am very picky about food.

So here I am with a fully belly giving them a thumbs up right afterwards because they deserve it."

On my last visit, I ordered the chicken vindaloo, hot, and it was packed with both flavor and heat; simply phenomenal.

Located in a strip mall, don&#39;t let your first impression fool you, Cherry Creek Harbor Restaurant is quite a gem, tucked away in Aurora and waiting to be discovered.  The interior is straight out of a 1920&#39;s Supper Club.  The art deco grey and white decorations are flawless and beautiful.  There is a large stage in the back and a separate dining room for parties.  There is a long and stunning bar in the center right of the restaurant.  (Reminiscent of the grand ballroom bar in Kubrick&#39;s The Shining).  The room is huge, but they had the forethought to carpet it, so it still feels intimate and your conversation doesn&#39;t carry, nor do you hear the click clack of a hundred feet.

My date and I both ordered from the Cajun menu (there is also an India menu).  Not authentic?  Poppycock!  I lived in Knoxville for several years and drove to New Orleans once a year for a foodie vacation.  This meal brought back those memories.  Perhaps a server might not have known the vocabulary, but the chef certainly does.  Now, if only I can get them to make a muffuletta, I&#39;ll be in Heaven.  

My date, also a foodie, ordered the catfish and we were both extremely impressed.  The breading was perfect, light and crispy, and the fish was snow white (not grey) and cooked perfectly!  The accompanying rémoulade was so spectacular he ordered more.  

I ordered the shrimp and grits, pure upscale comfort food and a complete delight.  I cleaned my plate (on a date!).  

The prices are completely reasonable for the delightful experience.  You get what you pay for here.  Our server was very attentive and eager to please.  One of the owners, Mark,  stopped by our table to chat and check on us.  I am extremely impressed with both the food and service.  Highly recommend!"

The event manager was not in, so I left a message. I did not receive a call back. I had previously made a reservation at a different restaurant, but my family was visiting from out of state for our reunion and was excited to have them try Cherry Creek Harbor as I love their food. I called again today (7/3). The Internet search engine said they opened at 11am so I called shortly thereafter, but they actually open at 3pm according to their website, but I digress. I requested to speak to the event coordinator and was told they weren&#39;t there; I asked to speak to a manager and was told the same thing. I asked if either would be there at 3pm and the response received was &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; That&#39;s pretty odd, but moving along, the gentleman said maybe he could help so I informed him that I called a couple of weeks ago and never received a call back. In a combative tone he said &#34;I called you, but didn&#39;t reach anyone.&#34; Looking at my phone history, I replied with &#34;no, I didn&#39;t get a call from anyone.&#34; He says &#34;oh well, I called someone.&#34; WHAT IN THE WORLD?!? Are you seriously arguing with me about this right now is what ran through my head. I&#39;m taken aback by that, but he says that he could help with the request and I proceed to tell him. Turns out, he couldn&#39;t and I don&#39;t think he understood English very well. While 95% of the food is good (at least of what I&#39;ve tried), the service is hit or miss. Today it was a complete miss! There&#39;s more to the story, but I&#39;m furious at the lack of customer service provided and I have to enjoy my family who drove 14 hours to be here. Cherry Creek Harbor is a good place for a party of two. Anything over that I say find another venue!"

The only wait staff member who seems to know the menu and knows how to provide good service is the young white guy behind the bar (I got his name, but am drawing a blank on it right now).  We&#39;ve gone a few times with friends and have CONSISTENTLY had service issues.  I&#39;m thinking that in the future, we&#39;ll order the food as take out and host our friends at home, where we can provide better service.

The décor is rustic and a little rugged with hard wood floors, upscale picnic tables, leather couches, Adirondack chairs, painted cow statues outside and some Colorado references. 

We came in for Happy Hour and sat at the bar. We have being eyeing these Elk Sliders for a few days. We ordered some local beers on draft (half off) and put in the order for Elk Sliders as well as the Pulled Pork Street Tacos. The Elk Sliders were colorado elk patties with dijon slaw, haystack goat cheese, mixed greens, tobacco onions. These were delicious. I liked the combination of the creamy goat cheese with the meaty elk. My favorite were the tacos, slow roasted carnitas with cabbage, cotija cheese and house-made mango salsa on soft corn tortillas. The carnitas were seasoned just right and the mango just added a nice sweet tangy flavor with the crunchiness of the cabbage. We also ordered a side of their Kettle Chips, must order these as a side, perfect side.

Service was good. Our bartender looked like he was too tired to make conversation. Luckily, I had great company with my friends and we really enjoyed our time here."

It was happy hour when we arrived so drafts were half priced. I had the Graham Cracker Porter and it was wonderful.

We were drawn in using our Indi Cards.  We decided to have Happy Hour at the bar and enjoy dinner, too.  The Happy Hour offerings were excellent, as we were able to pick some top quality beers for only $3.50.  The food options on Happy Hour menu were varied and well priced.  We had the loaded fries, which were excellent.  A lot of elk is on the menu, along with some bison.

Our bartender was fine, but he never made eye contact and was always hurried with us.  We ordered our entrees and the manager checked in with us to make sure we were ready for the course.  We appreciated that.  My salmon dish was under seasoned.  The salmon was also put on top of the two sides I ordered, the red potatoes and carrots.  This made for a sloppy, clunky presentation.  The potatoes were flavorless.  The carrots, too, needed salt and were severely under cooked.  The salmon was cooked medium well, but I was never given the chance to ask for it medium rare.  My brother ordered the barbecue burger, which was decent, but the two onion rings in the burger was obscenely too large.

Thankful we got to use the Indi Card so we could experience this location.  The value would have been poor if we paid full price.  I would come back for Happy Hour."

The food is cooked service barbecue. I definitely think they could improve on making their meat not as dry but that pales in comparison to how wonderful their barbecue sauce is and their sides! The price is completely decent and the service goes beyond just taking the order. They&#39;re sweet tea is absolutely does delicious and I love that their barbecue is served warm. Finally get free ice cream!

I&#39;ve always felt glad for patronizing any of their locations after a typical lunch here.  Anything great is usually 100% dependent on the creator, so in time, when &#34;trained&#34; employees are in charge, things always diminish.  Obviously, Dickey&#39;s circumvents this by having good standards and controls in place.  When you go into a Dickey&#39;s regardless of state or town, your favorite will always be there without variation."

Glad to have it close to my abode.  Came here during the week, late in the afternoon but earlier than dinner time.  Place was relatively empty.  Was waited on and served pretty quick.  Had the pulled pork and I liked it - great smoky flavor.  Their portions are large - had enough for lunch leftovers."

I will be getting a double order of ribs next time, even if I have to steal one from Adam like Eve. I highly recommend it mm end this place for lunch.

This Dickie&#39;s has been Colorado modified. Hot Links are not available. And, the Sauce/Pepper Bar has been reduced to 3 simple sauces.
Worse yet, the &#39;Free Ice Cream&#39; is conditional. For example, during the lunch rush today, the cone supply was empty, remained empty, and zero effort was made to replenish. Customers were deprived of one promise they paid for. It ain&#39;t free. You&#39;re paying for it in the slightly higher prices.
Looks like a Dickie&#39;s. Smells like a Dickie&#39;s. It&#39;s a D.I.N.O. 
If you don&#39;t know a Texas Dickie&#39;s, it&#39;s gonna be just fine. One cannot be disappointed in what one does not know. Those that know, will come back once. To see if they corrected the mistaken path directed by this franchise ownership. Then, not again."

So many bbq spots are dine-in only or are supposedly fast food but take over 10 mins to get your food *cough* Brother&#39;s BBQ!  I got the 3 meat combo and it was tender and tasty but I also dined in so I recommend eating there before it gets cold.

I contacted the Texas office to place a catering ordering for March 4, 2016. The experience I had with the person I talked to was very good. On March 4, 2016 I called Dickey&#39;s (where my order was coming from) to ask a question about the rolls we were going to receive. They did not have my order. Dickey&#39;s and I called the Texas office and the person forgot to send them my order but they assured me I would get my order. (If I had not called I would have never received the order.) My order arrived on time but the food was cold and the meat was dry and cold. (I live 5 minutes from Dickey&#39;s.) I was embarrassed to serve my guests the food. I contacted the Texas office a few days later and told them my experience. We agreed on an amount that I would be compensated. After many phone calls and emails I have only received half of the amount we agreed upon to this date, June 3, 2016. Because of the manager&#39;s rudeness and not getting compensated as agreed upon, I will NEVER order or go into another Dickey&#39;s restaurant.

The restaurant was clean, service was fast, and the BBQ was authentic with the perfect texture and tanginess.  They have a good selection of sides, so I tried the mac and cheese, BBQ baked beans, and green beans.  The mac and cheese was totally addictive and the BBQ baked beans packed some serious flavor. The green beans were a little bland, so next time I&#39;ll try the fried okra instead. As an extra little bonus, they have free soft serve ice cream all the time.

I told myself I wanted something healthy while I was running errands in the Havana Gardens shopping area.  As I walked by the shops, the smell of Dickey&#39;s BBQ over took me and virtuous intentions of eating healthy stayed in the car.  Outside, Dickey&#39;s BBQ is fairly non descript blending into the outdoor strip mall, but as I walked inside, the place had a modern barnyard feel to it and was very spacious.  The counter service is incredibly efficient much like a cafeteria lunch line and as they take your order, they pull out the meat, chop it, slop on the sides and then you pay.  Exactly as it should be in a BBQ joint.  
A couple of things that just make a BBQ joint special, sweet tea and fried okra.  Check and check.  The meats were fairly good, specifically the briskey was very flaky and tender.  And if you didn&#39;t pack in enough calories they have complimentary soft serve ice cream to really put the nail in the coffin of any health conscious thought."

The last place that was here left such a sour taste in my mouth that I was hesitant to give a new and totally unrelated place a try, but I had to make up with this space.
My mom, husband, and I went for dinner on a Sat night. They seemed to be relatively busy which is great. Our server Laura was super sweet and gave great service.
We started out with cocktails which were all ridiculously delicious. We had the Dr. Feelgood, the Metro, and one other. The Metro won hands down. Dangerously drinkable.
We then ordered the steak, duck, and pork belly/scallops. Everything was delicious. There wasn&#39;t a crumb left on anyone&#39;s plates. We all also agreed that that duck was the best we&#39;d ever had. Let me tell you, this is an extraordinary compliment. I&#39;ve had james beard award winning restaurant duck that wasn&#39;t this good.
They only had two desserts, milk and cookies and a pistachio crust cheesecake with a vinegar reduction. We liked both, but wouldn&#39;t be in a hurry to order them again. While the cookies were good, if they were warm aka fresh baked, that would have been a winner. The cheesecake, while we appreciated the savory and creativeness, it truthfully wasn&#39;t much of a dessert. So I guess desserts were the only could be improved upon item.
This place might be my new go to for a nice dinner."

There were a few odd exchanges with the waiter when I asked for gluten free bread and bottled sparkling water, neither of which they had.  He said that they did have &#34;club soda out of the tap.&#34; I always find it hard to believe when a restaurant in health conscious Denver does not carry a gluten free bread option.

She recommended a wine, for me, that I really enjoyed.
The food was also very good. 
The potsticker app was nice. 
My beet salad was delicious. I had it with steak, and that is the only reason I gave 4, instead of 5 stars. It was on the dry side and not really medium rare, like I requested. I just smothered it in the beet salad sauce and ate it.

They have a back room that, while small, would be a great, intimate space for a larger group (maybe 15 people). I&#39;d call this a reasonably priced upscale restaurant, but not one that I will hurry back to. 

We started with margaritas and they house-made syrup was pretty good, but a bit sweeter and more viscous than I would like. I should note that margs are not listed as their specialty cocktails, none of which appealed to me, but please see for yourself. 

We shared the fried brussels and the sausage taster, which were both incredible. I could eat those brussel sprouts EVERY SINGLE DAY!  I&#39;m salivating at the thought of them again. I think the sausage we tasted was called the Hunter&#39;s sausage and it was probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. We loved the whole charcuterie plate!  The house-made mustards, bread, and pickled vegetables were delish!  

For our entrees, we shared the fried chicken and braised pork shoulder. The fried chicken could feed 3-4 people!  It was pretty fantastic. The pork shoulder was just okay. It was dried out so it had to be mixed in with the grits and pork jus that it came with. I wouldn&#39;t order this again, nor would I recommend it. It came with brussel sprouts, which just couldn&#39;t come close to being better than the fried brussels we started with. 

We had fantastic service from Aurora and a gentleman whose name we didn&#39;t get. We shared the chocolate hazelnut pie and their special dessert, which was a lemon cake with a lavender butter cream icing and was served with a rhubarb sorbet. I love lemon cake and I loved that this dessert wasn&#39;t overly sweet, but it was really just okay too. The chocolate hazelnut pie was the best of the two for sure."

The place wasn&#39;t very crowded for lunch, which was great because we had prime seating on the patio. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. We got the beet salad, which was gorgeous! The beets were so glazed and pretty on the goat cheese. We had shrimp and grits, house salad with chicken, and the watermelon salad with chicken. We finished everything on the plates, it was delicious. 

I&#39;d love to go back for dinner and try some of the cocktails and entrees next time. I will definitely swing back in for lunch sometime as well!"

Nice folks have opened up what hopefully will be a long-lasting eatery in Cherry Creek.

My dining buddy had their over the top BLT with bacon the width of a filet (well, almost) topped off with fried green tomatoes. What a great and creative idea to bump up the level of that sammie, served along with a side of delicious fried Brussels sprouts. The plate was so filled that she could only finish 1/2 her lunch. (And guess who ate the rest:).

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which was as moist as could be and perfectly seasoned with honey slaw and what tasted like homemade pickles. Couldn&#39;t come anywhere near finishing it given the enormous size of the servings.

A truly excellent surprise of a mid-day meal and a place I&#39;ll look forward to revisiting--and to which you should definitely go. Now. Really.

I live in Denver now but felt like I was on vacation eating here since the vibe was so peaceful. Also, Nate was the bartender and our server, and he was super! Really helpful and made me a badass drink with coconut vodka, orange juice and (I think) orange soda. 

As for the food...it was excellent. We started with lamb meatballs and hushpuppies as appetizers. Both were delicious. We then moved on to the main course of shrimp and grits. Ha! A main course at lunch; now that&#39;s livin&#39;. The shrimp were huge. They had eyeballs too, but I will try not to think too much on that. The grits were very grit-like and tasty. 

Anyway, I loved this place. A perfect resting point on our 12 mile urban hike. Go here. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

Once seated, we waited almost 10 minutes in the nearly empty restaurant before getting asked about our drink orders. 

I did like the bottomless Bloody Mary ($10)--it had a bit of spice and was served in a tall glass. However, I had to ask the waiter for a refill when my drink had been empty for awhile. 

We ordered the lamb meatballs to start. The waiter said he &#34;pressed the wrong button&#34; and instead came out with an order of brussel sprouts. We ended up trying the plate despite the mix up. When the waiter asked about the brussels, he said, &#34;You&#39;re not too disappointed about the mistake, are you?&#34; It was a bit awkward since the centers of the brussels were still tough. The bacon that came with the brussel sprouts was thick cut and well-cooked, but extremely salty. 

I ordered the asparagus omelette with cheesy hash browns. The omelette was decent, but the hash browns looked like someone had melted piece a Kraft cheese on top. The lamb meatballs arrived after our entrees were nearly finished. Unfortunately they were just as salty as the bacon, and the mole sauce had been sloppily smeared around the perimeter of the plate.

Despite the horrible service, I do have to concede that the restaurant comped the lamb meatballs due to the waiter&#39;s mistake. The restaurant itself has a beautiful interior and great patio space, but I don&#39;t plan on returning."

It&#39;s in a cool neighborhood in Cherry Creek.  Parking in a garage is your best bet.  There is a nice patio area, but we sat at the bar.  They have great craft cocktails and a good beer selection.  

We started with the sausage/mustard/pickle app.  Housemade sausage that was perfect - nice skin that bursts under the tongue, two kinds of housemade mustard, and delightful pickled onions and cucumbers.  I had the BLT - nicely cooked and smoked bacon and fried green tomatoes, accompanied by a crisp dressed salad.  My husband had the fried chicken, paired with delicious country beans and collard greens.  Next time, we&#39;ll share it, it is that hearty.

The owner and bartender are awesome.  And it&#39;s clear the chefs are too.  Can&#39;t wait to return."

They opened at 11 and we were there within a few minutes. It was empty except for two other tables which was a little worrisome but between the good reviews we&#39;d read here on a Yelp and a write up in Denver Eater about best places to brunch we decided to give this empty cafe a chance. A lack of a wait turned out to be our good luck.

We ordered the veggie omelette with mushrooms and asparagus and the pork belly banh mi, and a little side of lamb sausage to start with a couple of French press coffees. I ordered the banh mi thinking it would be on the smaller side but holy cow the sandwich was huge with deliciously smoky pork belly and plenty of pickled veggies. The baguette it was made on was fresh and crust was crunchy...I loved it clearly. Served with a big pile of fries this was a hearty portion.  The lamb sausage was on the small plate menu but this was also a full serving too...luckily We came hungry. Of note, prices are totally reasonable too!

The service was attentive and happy to bring us more menus and more coffee cups and fresh coffee as we added more members to our party during our stay. We were very pleased and by the time we left the rest of the tables had filled out with other hungry patrons.

Even though the restaurant is in a downstairs garden level space it gets plenty of light and even has a few outdoor tables. Minimally decorated with wood chairs and mason jar lights Grind has a nice ambiance and it was easy to carry on a conversation in the space. 

As the word about this cute place spreads it&#39;ll be no time before people are waiting at the door for a table."

I&#39;m a huge lover of good &#39;ole southern inspired food, and the early write-ups of the chef Preston Phillips had me very interested to check it out... Went at 11:30am March 30... 

Definitely a new place getting its legs; was greeted very kindly, and a little unsure of the decor -- a little cold, super low ceilings but high-top tables -- not super intimate, felt a little exposed.... layout needs some help.... will be interested to come back to the place at probably a more popular time -- dinner. Would also be interested to re-experience the place in the summer when it&#39;s warmer -- it was simply too cold. 

What&#39;s giving this place a 5-star was the FOOD! My goodness -- the fried brussels appetizer was a knock out -- served with shiitake mushrooms, pork belly, black garlic aioli, pomegranate balsamic -- holy amazing batman! -- next courses were the beet salad: arugula, candied pecans, chevre, rhubarb vinaigrette and one of their signatures, the &#34;double cheeseburger&#34;, complete with a &#39;special sauce&#39; -- both amazing, but I need to have the cheeseburger again -- definitely ranks up there, but for some reason i&#39;m not raving about it.

Randomly the server and bartender offered a signature shot of tequila and chaser, so i obliged -- not why they&#39;re getting five stars, but a NICE touch. I&#39;m a fan.... but they need to work on ambiance -- they nailed the food...!"

Husband and I stopped in for lunch Sunday at 12:30. 
He has a shrimp po&#39;boy and I have house salad. He orders brussel sprouts instead of fries.
Our app of fried pickles arrived fairly quickly. They twice tried to deliver food that was not ours. After a good 40 min., we received our lunch. The girl said the kitchen was slammed. Bad excuse.
The sprouts were rock hard not cooked, the po&#39;boy had shrimp that had never been breaded and the house salad had a pile of greens, 2 slivers of parm and 2 roasted carrots. 
The decor is off as well, we sat in the bar as the dining room had a main aisle of people running down it constant.

I love freedom, and bleed red, white, and blue.  I have a pet bald eagle named Teddy that hunts neighborhood cats, because real &#39;Mericans own dogs.  I shoot guns, drink beer, and watch football.  American Football.  None of that sissy soccer shit.  You know what else I like?  Burgers.  Big.  Juicy.  Burgers.  And the GK+WH has Denver&#39;s best.

It doesn&#39;t have a fried egg or guacamole.  There&#39;s no bacon or chipotle bourbon spicy mustard.  GK+WH only has the basics.  Two freshly ground in-house 80/20 beef/pulled-pork, perfectly seared patties that literally MELT in your mouth.  Encompassed by two buns so soft I don&#39;t know how else to describe them but &#34;pillowy.&#34;  Yes, that&#39;s it.  They were bread pillows.  Finally rounded out by lettuce, onion, pickle spear, and special sauce that all merges into a conglomerate of American perfection.

Sure, they could do 10 variations, and have a killer burger joint.  But why ruin perfection?  I&#39;m sure they have other items that are great, but I haven&#39;t been able to stray thus far.  I like the fries and onion rings.  I personally prefer the crispy brussels.  I hear the fried chicken is excellent.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get to it someday.  But for now I&#39;ll stick with THE Burger.

You may be asking yourself: How can he go on, and on, and on describing the perfect burger and give this place only 4 stars?  The answer is simple = the beer list.  But I&#39;m told that will be changing soon, and am looking forward to adding on that 5th star."

Should have been cautioned by the lack of people inside. We ordered a bahn mi and the Blt sandwich (which had fried green tomatoes on it). They were out of the bahn mi, so we just stuck with the Blt. Our sides were fried and Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious and crispy and seasoned well. The sandwich was not so much. The bacon and bread were so hard that it made it difficult to eat. We snagged a black garlic aioli to help soften the sandwich. It did not taste like black garlic aioli. It was kind of just like flavored mayo. Our server was very nice, but it still isn&#39;t worth it. There are many other places around Cherry Creek to eat other than this place."

I had two prejudices about this place before I entered. One is the name. What is the message to the target Cherry Creek market segment? &#34;Grind.&#34;  &#34;Hey, Bridgett, shall we go to Grind and grind it out?&#34; &#34;Shall we grind our teeth at Grind?&#34; Hey, boss, shall we go to the local watering hole to discuss my job performance?&#34;

The second is the location. A failed location multiple times. There is some bad mojo inside these walls. 

As I sat at my table the server asked, &#34;Are you alright, bud?&#34; Bud? Excuse me? Perhaps I am too sensitive but this uninvited familiarity by the Denver restaurant community needs to be reviewed by the proprietors. I am not you &#34;bud.&#34;

Ordered hush puppies and fried chicken from this Alabama boy. Hush puppies arrived hot. Looked great. But when I bit into one I was disappointed with the texture. After living 30-years in Tennessee, I have a pretty good understanding of the characteristics of hush puppies. Corn flour instead of corn meal in the recipe. That objection being laid out, the flavor was good. Just wish they had the crunch of the hush puppies I remember. 

The four piece fried chicken came piping hot with two sides: black peas with corn and bacon and macaroni and cheese. Artery clogging but tasty. 

The chicken was hot and juicy and tasty but the coating was heavy and overly salty so I had to remove the coating to eat the chicken. What a shame. To my tastes, and perhaps not to all, the crust needs to be complimentary and not dominate.  It overwhelmed the lovely product underneath. 

So, this &#34;bud&#34; won&#39;t be returning. I was sent as a scout for the family and they won&#39;t be going either."

In the six weeks they have been open, I have enjoyed probably ten meals, and each is just as good as the first, if not better. 

The obvious strength here is the chef and proprietor, Preston Phillips. I have the utmost respect for any chef with the enormous balls it takes to open a restaurant in today&#39;s food industry, but this man really blows any competition out of the water. His concepts are stellar and the execution is even better. The flavor profile of each meal is rich and complex, and yet nothing is overpowering or &#34;too much.&#34; 

This afternoon I showed up late to try the brunch, but the kitchen made it for me anyways. Biscuits with sausage gravy and sunny side up eggs. Very simple, yet the best iteration of this comfort food classic that I have ever had the pleasure to try! I am no food critic, so I struggle for the right words, but this was exactly perfect. The only struggle was slowing down my tempo enough to really savor it. 

The rest staff is also really terrific. Very sweet and attentive wait staff and same for the guys behind the bar. Every time I walk in I am greeted warmly and everyone knows my name. I&#39;m sure being here at least once each week doesn&#39;t hurt in this aspect, but it still speaks to the friendly atmosphere. 

If you work in Cherry Creek, this should be the no-brainer choice for your new go-to spot. I know it&#39;s mine. Terrific food with a price that doesn&#39;t scream &#34;Cherry Creek&#34; at all, and fast friendly service make this an easy 5 star establishment. Give this man his Michelin stars!"

She recommended a great drink- sorta a spicy, cucumber marg..very good. We got into a conversation about classic drinks that have come back. I mentioned a slow gin fizz. And poof- one showed up to my table at dinner complimentary!!

The service Seems a little disorganized when it to who does what, and who plays what role. But they are new and I&#39;m sure will evolve. They also socialized a lot amongst one another rather than concentrating on customers. At times heard customers wondering where servers were- we needed more water and sat on empty for a while. Again, they are new and this is the only aspect that we didn&#39;t fully enjoy. When we saw waitress- she was friendly and attentive when present. 

Food was fantastic. We had dumplings and the sausage sampler for an appetizer. Both very good. Served with an amazing whole grain mustard. I saw a program about the restaurant that featured the fried chicken. My husband loves fried chicken and is from the south so this is why I took him to this restaurant. We both had the fried chicken. It came with delicious collard greens and red beans and rice. Red beans/rice needed more flavor...I wasn&#39;t excited about the rice but the greens- omg. So good. The fried chicken was a solid 10. It came with 4 pieces, my husband ate all his and loved it. I could only eat part of mine but not from pack of wanting to. It served with a homemade hot sauce that I could have eaten with a spoon. Dessert menu had two things crossed off- which were the lighter choices so we skipped.  We wish it had more choices that weren&#39;t so heavy. We will be back for sure."

For dinner I had the bahn mi, which was slim on the amount of pork belly and pickled veggies-which are usually the best part of a bahn mi, I was disappointed.  My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich that seemed greasy because of all the butter on the bun, but the slaw on the sandwich was good.  Seemed a little overpriced for the quality of the food.  Could be due to the swanky location."

Our party enjoyed the duck, grouper, pork and prawn, and steak entrees. All of them were exceptionally prepared. A surprise delight was the hush puppies, though. Light, airy, corny and crisp. The only downfall was the draft beer prices. It seemed a little pricey at $8. The dr. Feelgood cocktail was quite refreshing, coming with a single large ice cube. We will definitely be going back. As we were leaving we also caught a glimpse of the lunch menu which was as appealing as dinner if not more so. You should go."

The Brussels were amazing (big slab of bacon was a plus), I got the double cheeseburger which was mouthwatering (the special sauce and homemade pickles made it impossible for me to stop eating even when my stomach begged me to), the pineapple sherbet was like they took a pineapple and made it fresh right then for us. Overall the meal was very satisfying and they almost had to wheel me out of the place from eating so much!"

WeA arrived about 6:10 for a 6:30 reservation and got seated right away.  Cocktails appeared quickly and as our group trickled in, the vibe in the room started to grow.  Even though it has a tile floor and minimalist tables and chairs, it never got loud in here.   Our server, Chris, made sure we knew what the chef and bartender liked to create and gave us some time to catch up before coming back to take our orders.   I had the Bratwurst starter and Sharon had the Lamb meatballs.    Yummy.   For the main course, Sharon had Asparagus Vichysoisse, that was terrific.  I had a Pork Belly and Prawn entrée with fried Brussel Sprouts. A generous portion of pork and four prawns with the heads and tails.  When I dug into them, I realized that the chef had already removed the meat from the shrimp and replaced the heads and tails as decoration.  Very nice!   Another glass of Malbec and we were done.   Reasonably priced, good service, nice ambiance and good food.  What&#39;s not to like."

Food quality was terrific and service was friendly and prompt.  Ate outside on the small patio, which was made nicer by great weather and a lovely collection of flower boxes.  It was a Friday night, so we went a little wild and had the Fried Chicken Sandwich.  It&#39;s literally a perfectly fried breaded chicken breast with a cole slaw garnish wedged between a fresh baked multi-grain bun.  I&#39;m telling you, it was darn near perfection!  Also shared a small arugula salad and had a wonderful lemon merangue cake with raspberry sorbet for dessert.  Very close to five stars, inside is a little dark and just a tiny bit short of the ambiance you find in tonier Cherry Creek haunts, but a good choice for great food without a ridiculous wait.  Enjoy!"

In a nutshell, we enjoyed the drinks, food and atmosphere and had a good time.  All of the staff we encountered, from the bartenders to the wait staff to the hostess, were friendly and accommodating.

We had made a reservation and arrived early to partake of their 3-6 PM daily happy hour.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartenders and other patrons and started to unwind and relax.  If I remember correctly, the happy hour bar menu consisted of some assorted beers, wines and well drinks.  None of their craft cocktails had a happy hour price.  The items from the &#39;small plates&#39; part of their menu were the food offerings at the bar and were nicely priced for happy hour.  While these were tasty sounding items, none of them really appealed to us to have with the drinks we had ordered (we went with one of the craft cocktails anyway, despite not having happy hour pricing).  But since we were hungry, we went ahead and ordered the vegetarian small plate which was roasted cauliflower with a balsamic glaze.  The cauliflower would have been very good except that the balsamic sauce had been applied with too heavy a hand and the flavor and quantity of it overwhelmed some nicely roasted veg.  The drinks we ordered were good, however a tad sweet.  We both had &#39;The Metro&#39; cocktail which is (according to the online menu) Woody Creek vodka, Campari, St. Germain, blood orange bitters, and Mionetto prosecco.  According to the bartender, they&#39;ve been tweaking the recipe and have been adding simple syrup (I think he said) to make it a little sweeter.  After chatting for a while and disclosing that both me and The Hubs both are avid Campari drinkers, the bartender suggested that we try one &#39;the original way&#39; that is less sweet and has a heavier hit of Campari.  It was perfect!  Now we know what to ask for the next time we go!

Anyway, after having a couple of drinks at the bar, we headed over to our table to have dinner.  After perusing the menu, I decided on the house salad and the fried chicken dinner.  The Hubs ordered the leek soup and the steak dinner.  The salad was disappointing as it was way overdressed with a balsamic dressing (like the cauliflower appetizer was) and was missing the snap peas as listed on the menu (I didn&#39;t realize this until later).  Normally I would have sent it back, but we were celebrating The Hubs&#39; birthday and I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal out of it.  But seriously, a soggy, over-dressed salad is not good eats and I would have expected a restaurant of this caliber to be able to properly toss a salad (an old lady is giving you a &#39;tsk,tsk&#39; for this).  The fried chicken dinner, however, was outstanding and huge!  You get four pieces of crispy crunchy chicken with super moist meat and just a touch of heat (it&#39;s a LOT of chicken).  The sides that came with it (a rice and peas dish and collards) were also outstanding.  A small bottle of a warmed hot sauce/butter mixture accompanied the chicken dinner and it added some extra zing to everything on my plate.  I tasted The Hubs&#39; soup and it was nicely chilled and quite good.  His steak looked good, too, but I didn&#39;t get a bite of it so I can&#39;t really comment.

Service was excellent.  The food was very good (except for the balsamic incidents - which is why they get a &#39;4&#39; from me instead of a &#39;5&#39; rating).  The restaurant is comfy-casual (saw lots of patrons in shorts and t-shirts) and cleanly decorated.  It&#39;s a very pleasant spot that I definitely plan to return to.  Hopefully by then whoever is in charge of applying the dressing/glaze to the various plates will be adding it with a lighter hand.

As an aside, I have a few suggestions for the restaurant (these have nothing to do with my rating):
1. Add the craft cocktails to happy hour pricing.  Perhaps also add a couple more &#39;bar food&#39; items to the bar menu like a small charcuterie plate, and maybe bar nuts.
2. Add another salad to the menu that has more of an assortment of vegetables (tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, hearts of palm, celery, cucumber, carrot, radish etc. - whatever is seasonal and fresh) for the non-meat eating crowd, and for people like me who like a little veg with their meat.
3. Add the fried chicken dinner to the lunch menu, maybe as a 2-piece chicken dinner with the option of choosing either white meat or dark meat and pricing it accordingly."

It was creative and delicious with a distinct southern flair. Overall we enjoyed our evening but the service left something to be desired. We waited a long time to speak with our waiter after being seated despite the restaurant not being particularly full. The service didn&#39;t improve from there. Our waiter was not educated about the menu. For instance, there had been a wine substitution and he didn&#39;t know what the replacement was. The entrees are pricey at dinner, but the small plates made for a wonderful and tasty dinner and the wine pours were surprisingly generous. Despite the poor service, we will be back, but next time we will sit at the bar."

I also love that they offer chef sides as an option to fries and those included brussel sprouts that were really good. Three friends and I went on a Tuesday and will say the energy was a bit lacking (soft rock radio?!?) but maybe the place comes alive on the weekend.

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect but I don&#39;t think the food or service can get any better. The fried Brussels are rich with everything you ever wanted brussel sprouts to have, pork, tang and crispness. The beet salad is how everyone should be allowed to eat beets, fresh and tasty WITH cheese. We shared the pork shoulder dinner and its tender flavor on top of the amazing root mash made me want more mash! Truly a decadent meal. We opted for the Pecan Swiss Roll for dessert, it is like the best banana bread but covered with an almost too sweet layer of icing. The buttermilk ice cream tastes like cheesecake, this dish is an explosion of different sweet flavors. I will tell you throughout the whole meal, you will taste the quality in every ingredient. The owners, the artistic chefs and bartenders are not skimping on ingredients, they are locally driven recipes and you will have a happy belly. Please go check them out, and if it&#39;s warm enough, definitely enjoy the patio! Oh, and if you&#39;re gonna have dessert, by the looks of the milk and cookies, you can&#39;t go wrong."

I sent it back and when she came back with two other options, I asked what it was that she served me when I ordered the Sauv Blanc.  She said flatly, &#34;Pinot Grigio or maybe Chardonnay because we were out of the Sauvignon Blanc.&#34;  um....ok.....then TELL me and let ME choose an alternative.  Don&#39;t try to pass off a Chardonnay as a Sauv Blanc!  Ok - annoyed already - I asked about kid-friendly offerings.  She suggested chicken fingers, cheeseburger or grilled cheese.  Since they are known for their fried chicken, I thought that would be the logical choice.  The batter had SO MUCH black pepper in it that my kiddo actually choked.  I must admit - it was STRONG.

Then our waiter greeted us shortly after.  Chris was very friendly &amp; attentive throughout the night.  First we ordered a couple cocktails, I had the desperado, which was amazing! I have never had habanero in a drink before, but it added the perfect touch &amp; I&#39;m not into really spicy things.  To start the three of us shared the pot sticks &amp; the Brussels sprouts, both were delicious! For entrees my boyfriend &amp; I shared the four piece chicken plate &amp; our friend had the BLT.  Both dishes were huge &amp; very flavorful.  To keep up with the southern atmosphere everything is apparently made from scratch &amp; you can tell.  The batter fried on the chicken was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  It even came with a small thing of homemade hot sauce.  Everyone at our table was very satisfied with all that we ordered &amp; we&#39;ll definitely be going back."

The fried chicken sandwich was excellent, the pork belly in the bahn mi was a little tough and overly sweet and the lamb meat balls were good. The only issues we had were with the service. When I wasn&#39;t looking a waiter took my appetizer plate but removed the used fork and put it back on the table so I had no usable fork. We also had to chase down someone for more iced tea as nobody checked on us once we had our food.  The food was good enough that we will return."

It was fantastic! Our server, Dona, was a gem! She was bubbly (not too over the top), prompt, and definitely guided us in the best selections based on our preferences. We had the house salad, lamb meatballs, bratwurst, and chocolate hazelnut pie. Yum! The noise level was appropriate. Our only complaint was a brekenridge beer was $8 which is a little steep for a non-premium beer. Cocktails were priced appropriately. We will definitely be back!"

We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the decor is a mix of Colorado cowboy and Louisiana Cajun. 

I ordered the crawfish Monica and my wife had the gumbo. The crawfish Monica is very rich and creamy and is served on a bed of rice. The gumbo was made with chicken and andouille sausage and is topped with rice. We enjoyed both!

We finished our meal with beignets, a classic New Orlean dessert. Light and fluffy donuts topped generously with powdered sugar--what&#39;s not to like?"

Classic fried shrimp Po&#39;boys are true southern style &amp; taste.  Recently tried one of their featured apps, the Two Andouille cheese grit cakes pan fried and topped with our Crawfish Monica cream sauce which was super rich and delicious.  I&#39;ve had their Crawfish Monica over catfish which was also good.  Their prices on the soups are a bit steep, especially $5+ for a cup that is a pretty small cup serving, but it is damn delicious all the same.  I&#39;m a big fan of the shrimp bisque.

It was later I noticed it as a specific menu item. . yet the menu item went against all experiences with the coffee extender (it was used during the depression to make the coffee go further).  It cost more, with milk, AND cost for refills.  

I ordered a standard grits breakfast with eggs. Ordered the eggs over medium and they were cooked hard.  I would of noted to the waitress, but she couldn&#39;t really be bothered with coming back.


The grits were actually very good.  The roasted jalapeno that was served on the side was slightly undercooked. 


The beignets were good. .  but that wasn&#39;t enough.  I would highly recommend skipping this place and just going to Lucile&#39;s for your new orleans fix."

Let&#39;s discuss the food first.  I had Crawfish Monica.  Holy cow.  It was damn good.  Spicy, creamy, and had a good amount of crawfish in it.  I really enjoyed it quite a bit.

The girlfriend had biscuits and gravy, a side of bacon, and a side of hash browns.  Yeah, she was hungry, so what?  The biscuits and gravy were pretty good; biscuits were a little hard, but I did try them near the tail-end of the meal, so maybe they had hardened a bit?  Bacon was greasy and sweet, the first is fine, the latter isn&#39;t my jam.  Hash browns were typical hash browns, looked bagged or simply shredded potatoes.

Had a bite of their blackened porkchop, pretty good!

Service was decent: the staff was somewhat overwhelmed on a busy brunch day, and our server started off showing how busy he was (I think he had multiple large parties), but he did well.  Just had to get caught up.

It was really crowded, and the tables were a bit jumbled together: I had to scrunch in at my seat, and the person seated next to me was tucked in tight against the table.

I liked it.  But...

We had reservations at 1030am.  Reservations.  At.  10:30am.  We were seated at... 11:50am.  That is seriously the longest I have ever waited for a table that I had a &#34;reservation&#34; for.  I get that it was busy.  I get that it is one of the busiest days of the year probably.  But 80 minutes?  For a set reservation?  Makes you wonder.

I want to come back.  I want to like this place.  I did enjoy my food.

But I don&#39;t live close by, and I am wondering if the next time I stop by, I&#39;ll be told &#34;just a bit longer&#34; again, only to wait another half hour.  Then another.  Then almost another."

The food was wonderful as others have said. But I should back up to the first impression that greeted us. The gentleman at the front was so disinterested that he didn&#39;t wait for us to follow him to our table. It was strange. It took about 10 minutes to get a high chair which was also strange since it wasn&#39;t busy. After 10 minutes our drink order was taken. It was some tasty coffee. Our food took forever to get to us and we had to request syrup for pancakes as well as drink refills since our waitress didn&#39;t come back to check on us until she was dropping the check off. The food was good, but not good enough to warrant a second visit with second rate service."

Everything tasted fantastic.  The mac and cheese is on par with my mother-in-laws (which is a huge compliment...I compare all mac and cheese to hers and nothing has ever compared).

For dinner I had the Blackened catfish with the crawfish Monica sauce which was served over rice with tomatoes vinaigrette. Excellent!

My wife ordered the Crab Meat Au Gratin, while I had the Blackened Rib Eye. I don&#39;t often eat steak that much anymore, but this was probably one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had. It had a little bit of a kick, and it was cooked to juice, tender perfection. My wife loved the Au Gratin. The steak came with a side of Mac and Cheese that was about as close to my mom&#39;s recipe that I&#39;ve ever had. It was on par with my steak. For dessert, my wife had the bread pudding while I had some beignets. We visited Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans last year, and these beignets were on-par.

Eventually someone came to take our food order. The young man took the orders of us 3 ladies and walked off before taking the guys order! I called him back and he didn&#39;t even realise what he&#39;d done till we said &#34;you didn&#39;t take his order!&#34; 
The food didn&#39;t take too long to come and it was delicious. I got a chicken sandwich, one got the blackened fish, one beef strog, one steak sandwich and sides of Mac and cheese. According to feedback it was all great.

Great BTW as we watched the sunset. Started with 2lbs of crawfish from the earlier crawfish boil they have Sat afternoons! Hubs and son smashed them in a matter of minutes. They also have this bread with a ranchy, spicy oil dipping sauce that is oddly addictive.  Everyone at the table ordered the catfish monica as it sounded delish, it&#39;s what Yelp and the server recommended. Ahh-freaking-mazing. My mouth is salivating as I think about it.... So good. The owner, Brian, visited our table a couple times during the meal and was back as we were finishing our entrées. Somehow he talked us into ordering dessert even though we were miserably stuffed. We ordered beignets and the strawberry cake. Holy pillows of soft fried dough... Drooling again. Strawberry cake was great as well. But.... then Brian came back... with bread pudding.... WTF this is the BEST bread pudding ever. Seriously ever!  Not usually even a fan (consistency usually gets me) of it but this was so good. And then he came back with a jar of pickles to take home.

We started with the bread and dipping sauce as well as the Alligator Au Gratin. Both were excellent, however the bread to dipping sauce ratio was definitely wrong. 6 small pieces of French bread for a bowl of Au Gratin and a plate of dipping sauce was not nearly enough. We requested more bread, but it wasn&#39;t brought to the table until our entrees came out. 

I ordered the Blackened Salmon which was cooked perfectly and was so delicious. Others at my table ordered the Bayou Burger and the Smothered Catfish. I had bites of each and I would really have a hard time determining a favorite. They were all perfect in their own way. 

For dessert we ordered the bread pudding and beignets. OMG!!! Both were seriously the BEST I&#39;ve ever had, and everyone else at my table agreed. There was not a crumb left. Our waitress told us that really the German Chocolate and Strawberry Cakes were their signature desserts. After hearing this we had to order those too. &#34;To die for&#34; is all that comes to mind!

After we got our table, no server was assigned to us, so we just sat down and waited for about 15 mins with nothing! Very unpleasant experience. For me, no matter how good your food is, if you don&#39;t treat your customer well (at least how they should be treated) it not worth any of my time"

Their Monica out of control and  everything is spot on including the blackened catfish. Also, there are biscuits and gravy is perfect.

We read these reviews and and walked In with some apprehension.  It was somewhat late on a Saturday night. 

The staff was friendly and welcoming. Our waiter, Christian, was excellent.  He made recommendations and explained the menu and dishes. They have a good selection of Cajun and traditional American dishes.  The prices seemed a little steep at first; that was until we ate. 

The food came out fairly quick considering there were six of us. We had the ribeye, the blackened ribeye, smothered catfish, shrimp PO&#39; boy, catfish PO&#39; boy and even the kid&#39;s spaghetti. All were good to excellent and large portions. My ribeye was tender and excellently seasoned with Nono&#39;s own sauce. The smothered catfish with crawfish sauce was definitely spicy but excellent nonetheless. The vinaigrette tomatoes on the side were an awesome surprise. 

Christian was around and checked in just the right number of times. No pressure, no interruptions, just welcoming and helpful. 

Overall, an EXCELLENT experience. If we lived in the area, we&#39;d definitely go back frequently."

Could not give it 5 stars because the beignets were subpar. My husband is a dough-man aficionado and knows the good from the bad and the ugly. These were not NOLA quality.

I had the blackened catfish and it was perfect: spicy and crisp on the outside and moist in the middle. The French bread with dipping sauce was great. The sauce was reminiscent of Raising Cane&#39;s sauce. 
Others in my group had catfish smothered with crawfish étouffée. That was excellent. The beef stroganoff was enough to feed two people and apparently gets better over night in the fridge. 
The gumbo was very good. It was darker than I prefer, but still done right. 
The Mac and Cheese is like a giant tasty brick. Don&#39;t miss that. 
And the carrot cake was very good, recommended even if you are too full for dessert.

The food was good and the atmosphere would have been fun if not for the condescending a** who owns the place. He was unorganized and very rude. We got there early and were told to wait at the bar. They said they would get us when they were ready. They did not. All of the parties that arrived early and sat at the bar ended up at the end of the line. The owner ignored us and continued to seat people in line after us because he could not pronounce the name of the person on our reservation! Then he argued with her! He left before the end of the boil and was not there to fix his billing errors. The servers had to call him to fix our over-charge making us late for an appointment we should have had ample time to get to.

My friend invited me for the 2nd time around for NoNo&#39;s Café Crawfish Boil.  That faithful day was on Saturday March 29th 2014.  As usual, we opt to come early, since my friend said she was starving and need to eat something light.  We were there at about 14:30hrs ish.

So before the CRAWFISH Boil begins, we had Beignets, while she also opt to have Gumbo and some Coffee.  I just opt to have the Beignets and enjoying the nick nacks or trinkets of the Décor found at this establishment.  We waited until everyone in our party arrives for the Crawfish Boil, at the &#34;Bar Area&#34;.

Before 15:00hrs, we are seated at those tables, aka they joined all the small tables to make one long table...  Each table are given several baskets of Fried Pickles!  Then once everyone in the Crawfish Boil Feast Party are all seated, the owners, and the staffs, kept on coming with Buckets Full Of Crawfish Goodness, Potatoes, Corns, Mushrooms and Sausages!  That was about 15:30hrs ish.  From those Crawfish Goodness, comes along Orange Halves, Couple of Bay Leaves, Cloves of Garlic and Onions. 

Actually the Crawfish Boil cost is $29.95 Each Person at our table.  We have 12 adults, with 2 kids at the side table.  The kids do not par take the Crawfish Boil, so they opt to have Kids Spaghetti and Meatball ($5.25) and Kids Corn Dog ($5.25).

Yes, I enjoyed having the time with my friends and eating those Crawfish.  This time around, I play smart, NOT to suck on those Crawfish HEADS, since the SODIUM content is SUPER MAX and those Crawfish are SO Addictive!  Watch Out!  The Potatoes can be piping HOT, since it just came out from the cooking pot!  The Corn is super sweet, and the Mushrooms found in the Boil is Super Juicy!

A couple of my friends opt to have several order of Beer, Sodas, Ice Teas and Café Au Lait while having their Crawfish Boil.  To end our Crawfish Boil Feasting, we shared the Desserts such as :

*  7 Orders of Beignets ($21.00)
*  1 Order of Bread Pudding ($5.75)
*  1 Order of Strawberry Cake ($5.75)
*  1 Order of Tres Leche Cake ($5.75)

Too bad, my bad, I cannot get hold to take the picture of the Bread Pudding, since my other friend already devoured it.  *Sigh*

I cannot deny, I am also addicted to the Beignets and the Strawberry Cake!!  Though I cannot deny, this time around the Beignets are NOT as Fluffy as what I could recall from my last year trip to NoNo&#39;s Café.

Indeed we were stuffed that afternoon.  Our Main Server, his name is William.  The owner, Brian, let us stay a bit longer than the time allocated, after the Crawfish Boil feasting is over.  We left this establishment about 17:45hrs ish since by then they need the room for the Dinner Patrons, who are filling up this establishment fast in a blink of an eye.

I do have to mention that I was born and raised in New Orleans and may have a higher standard for what Creole and Cajun food is, but I absolutely adore Sassafras and Lucile&#39;s who do a fine job of executing these cuisines regardless of having limited access to authentic ingredients. I&#39;ve heard many fellow New Orleaneans and Louisianians here in Denver recommend No-No&#39;s and the menu has a great variety of dishes to choose from, however, my boyfriend&#39;s and my meals were simply bad:(. 

I started with a great salad with their house dressing. And then my boyfriend had the smothered turkey on the specials menu. The turkey was terribly salty and dried out and covered with a cream thyme sauce that did nothing for the dish. The potatoes served with the turkey were surely not &#34;creamed&#34; as they were only mashed a bit with maybe some butter? The sliced tomatoes also with the dish were confusing and didn&#39;t have any sort of basalmic flavor as the menu implied. 

I ordered the beef burgundy also on the specials menu which was $15 and included no salad like some of the other entrees on the menu that were priced less. What I received was about one pound of egg noodles with a very under seasoned and awful sauce that tasted not unlike a frozen dinner. There were NO JOKE three pieces of beef in this giant bowl. 

We also had a side of Mac &amp; cheese which I was excited about because based on the picture on the menu, it resembled a baked style using eggs that my Chalmation family always made. Also very disappointing and bland. I thought it was strange to offer Tony Chacheries on the table but I see why now because it was the only thing that made the meal edible. 

I&#39;m sorry, but I won&#39;t be back."

The gumbo. It&#39;s fine as long as I don&#39;t think of it as gumbo. Good soup with roux is what it is. But very edible and I&#39;d give it 3 stars.

We waited at least 15 mins before we were greeted and seated and it took a long time for our server to greet us as well. There were two servers and they kept getting in each other&#39;s way and kept getting our orders confused, so it was a little bothersome.

The food was beyond BEYOND. We started with two orders of beignets (between the 3 of us) as well as biscuits and gravy. My mom had the bourbon pancakes which I was extremely jealous of. I got the skillet breakfast - honestly I wish I got the country gravy burrito instead, but that&#39;s just for next time!

Mimosas (celebrating moms, of course) were a bit OJ-heavy, but it was a nice touch for the morning. They have a full bar and AHEM a crawfish boil that I will absolutely be back for.

Pork belly buns are the best variety (we tried all three.) The shishito peppers are drowned in a beautiful cheese sauce that you&#39;ll be sorry you missed, if you don&#39;t order it.

The ramen is good, but lacks depth in flavor. The broth for both the chicken and the lobster ramen was good but lacked a complex flavor profile. Lobster chunks were sizeable and delicious, and the accompanying broth was smooth and buttery. A little too much edamame, as referenced in previous reviews. The chicken ramen was good, a little too salty for my liking perhaps, but overall I would give it a solid B.

A little pricey over all, even in comparison to other &#34;premier&#34; ramen restaurants. Won&#39;t likely return, but glad I tried it just to cross it off my list."

It&#39;s good but it didn&#39;t blow my mind which is a bit disappointing.

I paid homage to my Italian heritage with the carbonara ramen--pork belly, broccoli, parmesan--it had it all! However, while it was tasty and hearty, the aromatics of the broccoli kept messing with me and was pretty unappealing. My fiancé had the lobster ramen and the broth was killer and it included huge pieces of fresh lobster so I had a bit of food envy. 

There&#39;s only nine or ten tables at Bones so be sure to make a reservation if you plan on eating here--thank you Open Table!

Two glasses of wine, four pork buns (both happy hour specials) and two bowls of ramen plus tip cost $72, a little too excessive for my liking. While I can appreciate what Bones has to offer,  I shall continue my search for kick ass ramen in Denver!"

Diced up pork belly with a good crisp outside and flavorful doughy buns. 

I got the green chili ramen and my friend got the carbonara ramen. The green chili ramen was a flavor-palette delight with ingredients from all different regions and complimentary spices - the hominy/cotija cheese/poached egg combo was a wonderful surprise of flavors though. This ramen was in a broth whereas the carbonara one was more noodle based in a sauce rather than soupy. My friend seemed to enjoy hers though! 

The food was delicious and the service great. However, this place is small and loud - the design makes noises echo, especially with an open kitchen (both good (fun to watch food being prepared and bad (noisy))."

The space is small and cozy in a way that makes it feel like the perfect romantic date night spot.  We were seated at the bar, which we usually love, but my seat was right next to the POS system and that turned out to be really weird.  I agreed to sitting there though, so not knocking Bones on that.  Service was just okay, not overly friendly or attentive and at one point I saw someone send their ramen back because it had cilantro in it and the chef just scooped it out.  I&#39;m not sure what restaurant protocol is for that kind of stuff but it ruined my illusion that when you return a dish at a restaurant they actually remake it.

As for the food, I was a fan of the steamed buns.  The buns are really fluffy, if not slightly gummy, and the pork belly was perfectly portioned and flavorful.  My green chile ramen was just okay.  It was SO HOT that my tongue felt burnt to a crisp and I thought the flavor was more like your standard beef and bean chile than green chile but it wasn&#39;t inedible or anything.  My few tastes of the lobster ramen were great!  The lobster was delicious and I really like the buttery tasting broth and inclusion of edamame.

First and foremost - the food is worthy of 4 (if not possibly 5 stars). The buns are amazing - we ordered all three! The brussel sprouts are also fabulous. I wish I could tell you our bowl was fabulous but we ended up canceling it as our server forgot to put it in.

Our server was horrendous. She was arrogant and forgot all about us. She forgot to put in our food and 40minutes later we finally tracked down another server and she was very helpful in bringing over the manager. The manager and this server are the reasons we give Bones 4 Stars. The manager apologized profusely, ended up comping our meal and giving us a card for free drinks the next time we&#39;re in.

Carbonara Ramen - a clever twist on the Italian classic with succulent pork belly and a poached egg. Be prepared for an umami tsunami with egg yolk and black truffle in the already creamy broth. The Parmesan was a little odd to me but I enjoyed this imaginative rendition of ramen all the same.

Lobster Ramen - A wholesome miso and lobster broth which was full of flavor and rich in lobster goodness. Our bowl came with too many edamame. I mean A LOT. This is really a small thing to complain about since they did not detract from the ramen. I will go back and order this ramen again.

Instead I got a bowl of ramen that heavily relied on miso paste to elevate it all.  I have a whole list of stuff I would recommend to elevate this bowl but hey, its not my restaurant.  From the pork buns to the ramen, you can tell all this food is meant to bridge the gap between people who want to eat Asian food but want it westernized.  To their credit, the pork belly buns were excellent as well as the service.  I would pass on the lobster ramen."

After looking at their Denver Restaurant week menu, it wasn&#39;t a real value. But luckily they offered their full menu so we kept our reservation. I thought it was slightly odd asking for my credit card to charge a cancelation fee if I didn&#39;t show. I know RW in Denver is popular, but no other places do this. Kind of haughty if you ask me. 

Which the food was haughty, too. It was &#34;elevated&#34; ramen but I honestly wasn&#39;t impressed. I had the carbonara ramen which was almost too rich, and I disliked the cheesy aspect. My boyfriend had the udon bowl and it wasn&#39;t very flavorful, pretty bland. My stepson had the yakisoba and it was the best of the three dishes. I did love the steamed bao buns, they were delicious, and the crispy Brussels sprouts were also tasty but not original.

Our server was helpful and friendly, so that was a major redeeming quality. I wish their drink menu had more local beers, so I opted for wine. 

Overall I&#39;d try it again, but only if they update their menu."

This was described as a ramen place that is French inspired. I could not pass this up when it was recommended. This was different then the authentic ramen noodles I&#39;m used to, but I knew that coming in. 

4 stars - Vegetable ramen: Tofu, vegetarian dashi, Shiro miso, cured bamboo shoots, seasonal vegetable, cilantro. Not many places have a vegetarian option for ramen, so I was very thankful they&#39;ve got one here. The texture of the vegetables were too soft and felt over cooked. The noodles though, were perfect, bouncy/chewy.  Ramen broth, if you&#39;re not careful, can be salty. And that was a little bit the case here. Everyone at the table felt the same way and we mostly ate the noodles and not much of the broth. They all got either the lobster ramen or green chile ramen. 

2 stars - Crispy brussels sprouts. These were flash fried, and about 30 seconds overdone. This is one of those sprouts preparations that can walk a fine line between being just right and just burnt. In this case, a tad on the burnt side. Especially the pieces of brussels sprouts that were just the leafy parts. 

5 stars - Hot ginger tea. This was a comforting cup of tea! Fragrant and the right bit of ginger flavor, not too strong. They refill them also! 

5 stars - Service. We reserved a table in advance and we were seated right away. I would recommend reservations, as this place is small. They can get busy, but the food service was so quick!

For those cold and snowy nights, ordering that ginger tea alone could make me happy. Also, it&#39;s a good place in Denver if you are craving ramen."

Absolutely the worst Ramen I have ever had. The broths tasted like they were watered down and everything was over priced. The lobster ramen was definitely not worth it. The service was good and the ambiance was great, but will never go back."

I recommend reservations, both times I have been have been on week nights and we had a reservation (fortunately) as its a small place and will fill up fast. 

Solid broth and noodles. The Lobster Ramen is worth every penny... I do wish they had more vegetarian options on the menu BUT to their credit they have a very, very good vegetarian ramen bowl and a great drink menu. Bit pricey but, with only a couple of &#34;Ramen Specialty&#34; places in Denver (especially since the authentic guy on Hampden shut down), and Asian fare being the new hip thing, it is to be expected. And it IS high quality so its not so bad. I will return and I suggest trying them out if your budget allows!"

When it comes to ramen, I can appreciate creativity, but I think there are three things that can&#39;t be comprised - the texture of the noodle, the flavor of the broth, and quality/flavor of the meat. With that in mind, I think Bones did an ok job. In my party we tried the lobster ramen and chicken ramen. The lobster ramen was by far the better of the two, generous flavorful portions of lobster, noodles were a good consistency - bouncy/chewy, but I think the soup had too much miso in it so it was too salty but otherwise satisfying. I don&#39;t even mind paying a premium ($20) but it was not good enough to make me want to pay that again. The chicken ramen broth lacked depth and umami. The confit thigh itself was good but the broth made the dish really disappointing. 

We also tried the escargot potstickers - drenched in sauce and no escargot flavor. Finally the buns.  It feels like ever since David Chang revamped the traditional Chinese peking duck bun, every Asian-inspired restaurant needs their own version. That&#39;s fine, but the bun is just as important as the filling and most places care more about inventive fillings and sauces than the bun itself. We had the Wednesday special buns - this week they were shrimp tempura, nuoc cham, and cabbage slaw. I think the nuoc cham was watered down as I didn&#39;t taste the pungency of the fish sauce at all, the shrimp tempura was well fried but the bun itself was underdone, almost raw (see picture). When I bit inside, I immediately felt the raw dough and couldn&#39;t finish it. I asked the waitress if the bun was supposed to be like this and she said  &#34;yes our buns are doughy.&#34; I would call this raw before doughy but it looks like most reviewers like how they do their buns. My opinion of a good bun is not too dense, fluffy, and definitely baked the same doneness throughout.

If you have never had ramen or pork buns before this place might be good. Perhaps my experience with better has tainted my view of this place. In the end, it was too pricy for what they were trying to serve."

Bones is solid. It hasn&#39;t changed much in five years and I was happy to see a lot of the same items on the menu as the last time we were here. The flavors are good, the portions are plenty and the service is excellent. Huge plus for the service! 

We started the night with the steamed pork buns and they were sweet, salty and soft. They were pretty good, but a little dry. The crispy Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked, not over crispy and very flavorful. The bone marrow was and is my favorite, same as last time. The escargot pot stickers were nicely done, but a little too crispy IMO. Everything was pretty delicious, but again the bone marrow was the highlight for me. I remembered having it the last time we were in and it did not disappoint this time either. The only thing it was missing this time was the seasonal fig jam bummer, not sure what season we&#39;re in jam wise, but a seasonal jam would have been nice touch. Overall the apps were good to go. 

Here&#39;s where it gets weird. My wife ordered the Udon, our friend ordered the lobster ramen, and against my better judgement, I ordered the green chile ramen. For me, the green chile ramen was a big miss. No, just no. Although the dish was perfectly prepared and the flavors were excellent, my tastebuds were so confused and put off. I just couldn&#39;t wrap my head around the idea of green chile ramen. It was just green chile trying to be a sneaky Asian fusion dish - Ninja Ramen? 

Stick with what you do best, Bones, please replace this with something else, anything else. The other dishes were spot on - rich, flavorful and robust. 

With the limited choices of ramen in Denver, Bones is a solid one. I will be back, but I will avoid the green chile ramen."

Happy Hour will get you the best bang for your buck, but that menu is limited and doesn&#39;t include any entrees (aka ramen). Drinks are decent and staff is nice.

Was super excited to try this place. It was mentioned in several blogs as a good place to eat. Here are the Pros and Cons...

Pros:
- The pork ramen was really tasty!
- Staff was relatively friendly and helpful

Cons:
- The lobster ramen is supposedly one of their most popular dishes...was not nuts about it. Especially for the price. I get its lobster but I was expecting more. It was just lobster and edemame over noodles. The broth desperately needed salt. 
- Waited forever for food!!
- Pork buns were so so. They weren&#39;t stuffed like I was expecting. The pork on them needed some seasoning. Really bland. 
- After 3 pork buns and two bowls of ramen a we paid like 70 bucks for the whole meal. Really pricey. No alcohol included! For the quality and atmosphere it wasn&#39;t worth the price....
- it&#39;s a hole in the wall. Don&#39;t get me wrong some of the BEST places are...but this is not one of them...probably wouldn&#39;t eat here again."

I often travel to Chicago from WI specifically for a weekend of ramen. So naturally, I wanted to get ramen in Denver, except I wanted to see what twists on ramen I could try. We arrived at around 6pm on a Friday, and it wasn&#39;t busy at all when we arrived (there were maybe like 4 tables in total that were full). 

The waitress told us to find our own spot, saying she would follow us out, so we picked a spot on the outside patio. However, we were left to our own devices for about 10 minutes after. No customers were behind us, so it was a bit of a surprise to wait that long for menus. Once we got our menus, we placed our orders (pork belly buns, carbonara ramen and the drunken noodles). We waited over 20+ minutes for our appetizers, and a table that were seated about 10 minutes after we placed our orders got their appetizer first (and they ordered the same thing). A while later, the server came back with some crispy brussel sprouts sent from the kitchen, because they said they suddenly had a large influx of customers come in (I was directly facing the door, and I didn&#39;t see that many customers go in, but I could be wrong).  The crispy brussel sprouts were amazing (i hate brussel sprouts, but I cleared the bowl!), and the pork belly buns arrived shortly after. The buns were really good, and I would order them again. 

I was quite disappointed in my carbonara ramen, because it was severely lacking in salt and flavor, and the yolk in my poached egg was overcooked. Lots of pork belly chunks, which was good, but again, because of the lack of seasoning, the dish was underwhelming. On the plus side, the drunken noodles were pretty good.

While this restaurant offered creative twists on ramen, it could have been better executed. The appetizers were really good though, and I would definitely come back for just the appetizers and a drink or two."

The colder the weather became, the more I wanted ramen, so we finally decided to go. I am a big fan of Frank Bonnano&#39;s other restaurant, Osteria Marco, so I had pretty high expectations going in. That said, I had never had ramen before.

Parking in that neighborhood is a nightmare, especially on a Friday night. Fortunately, they have free valet on 7th, so I took advantage of that. That was a nice bonus. I had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. The restaurant is tiny, but tables seemed to turn over quickly. The atmosphere was fun, but the music was a bit louder than I would have liked. It was difficult to carry on a conversation without yelling across our tiny table. I think I said &#34;what?!&#34; about 47 times. 

The service was excellent. I have no complaints there...we were attended to and never left wanting for anything. The staff was very courteous and professional. 

We ordered the braised pork buns and the bone marrow to start. I had been craving pork buns, and they were pretty good. The bone marrow was rich and garlicky - not my thing, but I enjoyed sampling it. We both ordered the yakisoba with shrimp and finished it. It was good. Everything was good. I have no complaints. I enjoyed my dinner, but I&#39;m deducting a star because I just wasn&#39;t wowed. I guess I expected to be wowed. It wasn&#39;t a particularly memorable meal, and with so many other amazing options in the area, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go back.

I didn&#39;t know it was a Bonanno restaurant, and though I love his other restaurants, I should have thought twice about going to an Asian restaurant owned by a non-asian guy. Anyways, we got the bone marrow and the pork belly buns to start off. The bone marrow was good, but was way smaller than I had anticipated. Lots of toast, not enough bone marrow for the price I paid. I was also super excited for the pork belly buns but honestly this had to be the worst part of my dinner. The pork buns were always hyped up in other reviews but I was extremely disappointed to find out that they were not like the buns that I grew up eating. The bun itself were not the soft white buns that pork belly buns should be, but were yellow and doughy instead. On top of this, the lobster ramen that I had ordered was just okay. Not terrible, but overpriced.

I actually ended up having 2 because I liked it so much. The restaurant week menu wasn&#39;t quite the same as the menu online.  This made me a little sad because I knew exactly what I wanted.

My fiance went with the green chile ramen because he had heard from numerous people how great it was.  I got the lobster ramen because I figured go big or go home.

-Pork Buns and Crispy Brussel Sprouts; decent. Nothing special, but tasted as expected and came promptly. 
-Lobster Ramen: this was the main reason I came and was the closest thing to a highlight....but not great. Tasty lobster chunks couldn&#39;t make up for a broth that lacked depth of flavor. Ramen was appropriate texture and I did find adding the poached egg ($2 extra for an already $20 dish) enriched the flavor of the dish. The edamame was fine but added nothing other than helping make me full. 

The very bad:
-Carbonara Ramen. Do not order this. Disgusting...no salt, broth tasted like they just poured heavy cream into the water, and the pork was mushy and tasteless. This was the first time my husband and I have ever sent a dish back in a restaurant! The waitress even mentioned that they get complaints about the flavor of this dish &#34;all the time&#34;---maybe change it or take it away then?!
-Yakisoba: got this when we sent back the ramen, and it had the reverse problem...tasted like someone let the salt shaker slip. Tasted like salt and soy sauce, nothing else. We felt bad complaining a second time so my husband ate about 6 bites, then we got the check as soon as possible.

* &#34;Apparently, he&#39;s a big immigrant activist in Rhode Island.&#34;
* (When one cook asks if it&#39;s edge to drink a beer while listening to Minor Threat, she-beaux says) &#34;Being &#39;you&#39; is the most EDGE thing you can do.&#34;

Bits like this is why I love my boo so much, ya&#39;ll.

And this is after the motown mix that absolutely slayed the place prior to Minor Threat. At one point, everyone eating at the bar sang aloud &#34;Play That Funky Music&#34; unplanned and unrehearsed. It was amazing.

The staff here are exceptional, or whatever other more superlative words you can come up with.  The ladies workin&#39; here are super rad, and gorgeous (this is a she-beaux approved anecdote), and the guys cookin&#39; it up have excellent recommendations to accommodate our desire for veggies in the ramen, and the GF necessity.

Order the shishito peppers just so my man will break out the War of the Worlds lookin&#39; blowtorch and scorch them puppies while explaining the culinary fixture attached to the nozzle.

And add an egg to everything you order.

Final words on my man-- a couple came in close to closing and tried to play that whole &#34;Oh, we&#39;ll be quick; we don&#39;t want to put you out&#34; bit with him, but he let them know they had to order what they want.  When homegirl-trying-to-be-cute/nice says, &#34;It&#39;s your job to go home&#34; (say what, girl? I wanna get paid for that job), my man raises his voice, points a ladle at her, and barks &#34;Our job is to cook. Your job is to eat well.&#34;

Plus he has the same laugh as Billy from Predator.

That&#39;s what&#39;s up.

Get at &#39;em, and do so at the bar on a weekday night near closin&#39; time for the illest experience."

Usually if we go somewhere twice its because we had a good expiernece the first time. The first time we went for lunch ordered pork belly bun for appetizer. It was good but we have had better. For our meal we had lobster ramen and chicken ramen. We really enjoyed it. We thought this would be our new ramen spot. We returned a week later for dinner to try the bone marrow. It was ok. We ordered same ramen lobster and chicken. We came to find out that they are inconsistent unfortunately. The broth in the chicken ramen tasted like a bowl of SOY SAUCE!!! The flavor was horrible! The broth in the lobster ramen was even worse tasted like ocean water! Yes i know &#34;Lobster&#34; is fishy and all but this was over bearing it tasted nothing like it did the first time. I didn&#39;t even eat it! Our server was very friendly she is the only reason im giving 3 stars instead of 2. There&#39;s better ramen out there i wouldn&#39;t recommend unless you like inconsistency.

My boyfriend got the Lobster Ramen, which tasted a lot like a watered down bisque (not a bad thing, it was actually pretty good), but the amount of lobster for the hefty price tag, and the prepackaged tasting noodles was a bit much.  

I ordered the very spicy Mexican food fusion ramen (I can&#39;t remember its fancy name for the life of me, but you&#39;d know it when you saw it on the menu. It&#39;s the one with lots of peppers in it). Really unique, very good and I loved it! What I didn&#39;t love was the fact that the waitress kept insisting how spicy it was when I tried to order extra chili on the side. She even had someone whip up a watered down version of &#34;extra chili&#34; just incase it was too spicy. I get that she&#39;s trying to be considerate (which good on her A+), but I would love for someone to take, &#34;I like my food to burn my face off&#34; seriously. I know I&#39;m whiter than the driven snow, but I love stupidly spicy food that hurts your mouth when you eat it. Just give me my spicy add ons damn it, I don&#39;t need the &#34;just so you know it&#39;s already hot&#34; lecture every time I eat out (this is totally not a problem with me, I know it&#39;s just me). Regardless, the ramen I got was brilliantly delicious and I felt well worth the price tag with it! 

For dessert, my BF and I ordered the Churro ice-cream sandwich. Holy crap that was amazing!! I would return just to eat that! I have never had something more heavenly and can&#39;t wait to get in there and have it again!"

The restaurant is definitely modern asian, it&#39;s not the most traditional, but the flavors are on point. I definitely suggest getting the brussel sprouts to start.  They&#39;re fried which gives them great texture, and they&#39;re super flavorful.  I&#39;ve had both of their vegetarian dishes, the yakisoba and the vegetable ramen.  Both were filled with fresh vegetables and the noodles were cooked well.  I think I preferred the vegetable ramen, but that&#39;s just a personal preference as there are few things I like more than a large bowl of soup. On top of it, the service is always great, and on one occasion where it was slow, they brought us complimentary sake to make up for it.  I appreciate a restaurant that goes out of their way with customer service, and Bones definitely does that."

I had the lobster ramen + egg and Chloe had the green chile udon. We started with the pork belly Buns (half and half, pork shoulder and whatever the other option was), and the bone marrow, which was AWESOME. Had the Tokyo Sour and the Manhattan variation. Also had the Sake with ginger beer and a bottle of it. Bread pudding for dessert! 

Super small, but perfect for two. No large parties here. The front doors are the tiniest doors in history. Lots of different sake bottles on the wall, and the chefs are on top of it. You get a waitress plus the manager bringing you food and checking on you, so not a moment goes by where you aren&#39;t attended to! 

One star off for the price, it can get up there when you add $12 cocktails and $14-16 appetizers! And some of the ramen bowls are a little expensive. But still worth going here!"

The place itself is a tad bit small but the quality of their food leaves an enormous impact!
We got the crispy Brussels sprouts with mustard, pork buns, and the yakisoba with tofu. The Brussels sprouts were good, the mustard gave it a nice hint of tang. The pork buns usually comes in three but since we were sharing it, they offered to add an extra bun. You get to choose between pork belly or pork shoulder buns so we opted for two of each. Both were deliciously but I think the pork belly won me over a little bit more. Since the stall knew we were sharing the yakisoba as well, they split the dish and gave us each a bowl. I got the poached egg, and since we were sitting on the counter, the chef gave my bf a poached egg as well for his bowl. Really good noodles, and the egg just puts it over the top! Yummmm!

Both men and women alike took about half their meal home. The broth is super fatty (not in an unpleasant way) and thusly super filling. If you&#39;re a thrifty vixen like myself, consider splitting a bowl. 

For &#34;asian soup broths,&#34; you can find better (more complex) and cheaper at say... Saigon Bowl on Federal. 

What you cannot get on Federal are escargot dumplings drenched in garlic sauce that&#39;ll have you fiending for more. Actually my favorite thing on the menu.

Skip the kimchi three ways. The spice level (and I like spice) will clear burn out your palate. They ought to serve a side bowl of white rice or some starch to give your taste buds a needed break.

Make reservations. It was consistently slammed from 7pm to 8:30pm on a Thursday evening. People were turned away.

Overall a totally average experience, which, for the bill and given the clientelle, will not have me returning. I&#39;m still on the hunt for some great udon or ramen (if someone knows who might serve ramen with a duck egg, please PM ASAP!)."

My reasons its not 5 star: 
1) Service was just &#39;ok&#39; 
2) Although we had reservations, the sat us next to the door (on a day that was about 5 degrees outside). They did have a space heater, but when the door opened it was freezing
3) They did not do happy hour the day we went because it was New Years (I understand this, but some notice on the site, or reservation would have been nice). 

About the meal: 
We started with the Brussel Sprouts, Pork Belly Buns and Regular Pork buns. The sprouts were a tad salty, but delish! The buns were incredible, especially the pork belly. 
For an entree I got the green chile ramen, and my partner got the udon. We were both blown away. Perfect for a cold night (especially sitting by the door!).

The staff was friendly and they had outdoor seating, which was nice.  We were super excited about eating here, but ended up not being very impressed with the food.

The brussels sprouts and yakisoba were fine, though not particularly interesting.  The udon was served scalding hot -- I burned my tongue immediately -- and after waiting 15 minutes the waitress brought some ice cubes to cool it down enough to be edible.  On the bright side, the udon was pretty tasty once we were actually able to eat it.

I could see paying that much for noodles if the food blew me away, but given the relatively lackluster food, the prices were much too high."

The ramen was good, different--not the best I&#39;ve had but very good. What really got me was the steamed pork buns. I could&#39;ve eaten those all night! I was also quite satisfied with the green tea cocktail I ordered (okay, I ordered 2 because it was so good). My fiancee had the green chile ramen and was about as satisfied with his as I was with mine. He was extremely impressed with the appetizer he ordered which was the sashimi

We happened to go on a Tuesday night around 8pm. It was steady but we did not have to wait. We were asked if we had reservations, which we didn&#39;t but that wasn&#39;t a problem that particular night. I would recommend making one though, just in case. Since it is small, it would fill up quickly and seemed like a popular spot for weekends. The interior was nice, we sat next to the wall which was lined with bottles.

We ordered steamed buns (MUST), crispy brussel sprouts, and shoshito peppers.  All 3 appetizers were just delicious.

I got the Udon noodles, and my friend got the Lobster ramen.  The Udon was AMAZING.  It was HUGE, first of all - SO much pork and noodles.  I was pregnant, and I still couldn&#39;t finish it!  Being pregnant, too, I was avoiding runny eggs, but I look forward to visiting again and trying an option that comes with a poached egg.  I firmly believe that poached eggs/runny yolks make most things better.

Highly recommend!  It&#39;s a tiny place, so you need a reservation.  We got lucky and were able to get a table after waiting only about 20 minutes at the bar - but it was a weekday and it was rainy, so I think that helped.

It would have been good if not for I guess the lemongrass they put in it, which was very overpowering. Took away from the dish entirely, tasted like they soaked the noodles in lemon. Rarely do I not want to finish my meal when we go out. Friend got the carbonara which he said could have been better as well. Also, we ended up paying 14 dollars for water which was ridiculous. They asked us when we sat down if we wanted iced tea, sparkling water, or filtered water. So I chose filtered, not thinking much of it. They brought out large bottles. When our water ran out, they asked if we wanted another, to which I said yes, assuming it was free since it was, you know, water... Each bottle was 7 bucks. Ridiculous."

We decided to have dinner there last Saturday evening and, unfortunately, found that we knew none of the staff and the Brussel sprouts have dropped back to Farm League status at best. We know that turnover is part of the game in the food industry, but just because you get a new chef, it doesn&#39;t mean his/her recipes or way of doing things is the best approach.

At Bones, they give you chopsticks to eat with which is really difficult for me usually. I was pretty successful I think because ramen noodles have some curl unlike lo mein or pho.

The chairs were good too. This restaurant is really small. There&#39;s maybe two tables that seat 4 people and all the rest seat two, and then there&#39;s the bar. So I would only go with one other person such as going on a date or going out with one friend so you can shit talk your other friends."

Start with the steamed pork buns or crispy brussels sprouts, both are salty, delicious, and won&#39;t fill you up before ramen.

I&#39;ve had the veggie ramen, which is perfectly good but not as amazing as the meat counterparts. Once of my favorites being the green chile ramen. It was the perfect mix of traditional Colorado pork green chile within a tasty bowl of warm and filling ramen. The portions are huge and you&#39;ll end up taking some home. 

This is place is very intimate, so don&#39;t bring more than a +1 if you want to be seated within an hour. Reservations are recommended. In the colder months, plan on dressing warm - the constant opening/closing of the doors in this small place cause some chilly moments.

Definitely a solid option when you&#39;re in the mood for a filling bowl of ramen."

Tried this place during a visit to Denver based on Yelp reviews and loved it!

Everything we had was excellent. The service was friendly and fast. The vibe is fun and funky and comfortable (it&#39;s hip but we didn&#39;t feel out of place as a non-hipsters). Great music. 

Lychee Sidecar - delicious. Sweet and sour with a kick.

Escargot Potstickers - my husband didn&#39;t love them as much as I did. I thought they were incredible. Rich and garlicky and yummy. I would&#39;ve licked plate if I&#39;d had a few more Sidecars in me.

Yakisoba - holy cow - seriously this is the best thing I&#39;ve eaten in a while. I&#39;m not going to say more.

I&#39;ve been here twice-both times fantastic. The ramen was great both times-the chicken ramen tastes like a way upgraded homemade chicken noodle soup. My boyfriend got the lobster ramen that he thought was ok (we both agreed it was a &#34;thing&#34; that needed to be tried, but the other ramen have more flavor). The appetizers are phenomenal. The shishito peppers are life changing and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to go without getting them. The churro ice cream sandwich works so well.

My husband and I shared the brussel sprouts which were delish - not too greasy, not too spicy but really tasty.  

I had the lobster ramen - the broth is delicate yet rich and interesting all at the same time.  The ramen noodles were delightful - great texture and plenty of them.  The actual pieces of lobster were yummy too.  

My hubby had the Green Chili ramen w pork shoulder.  There were so many flavors going on in that bowl that we both agreed it wasn&#39;t something we could make at home.  The spice level was just perfect - you could still taste the complex flavors without being knocked out with chili.  

My only regret - not ordering the pork buns that just about every other table seemed to order.  Next time!!  :)"

If you&#39;re Asian, Bones to you would be overly over-priced: you can get similar dishes more authentic for way cheaper, yes, right here in town in Denver. 

Take the steamed pork buns, the dough is too thick and too chewy for it to be called it &#34;restaurant quality&#34; (you see, in the Asian culture, restaurant quality is supposed to be better than homemade, that&#39;s why people go out to eat on holidays as opposed to hosting at home. And if you treat your guests to meals at home, it&#39;s not valued as high and as special as eating out. I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s the opposite in American culture). We could make the same dough at home, but it wouldn&#39;t be enjoyable, that&#39;s when we&#39;d go out and hopefully enjoy a better bun at a restaurant.

I was really looking forward to tasting bone marrow for the first time but after having some here, I sort of swore them off. Could be just the bone marrow itself and not Bones, the restaurant though... The Shishito Peppers were very Hot! But they sure looked pretty! The potstickers were over cooked, it was a mess, not worth it.

Only thing I really really enjoyed was the Lobster Ramen (but I&#39;m no Japanese so who knows if it&#39;s another overpriced mediore dish?) and I was OK paying over $20 for it. For the broth was very buttery, thick, and rich (could be a tad less tangy IMO). The noodles so much better than packaged ones and the edamame really dressed up the bowl of heaven!

A cute little place with an open kitchen (another concept I can&#39;t understand how it got so popular... why on earth would you like to smell like the restaurant when you put on nice clothes and dine out?). Our waitress was so so sweet and pretty! She looked half Asian and she said she gets that a lot. We got great service from her."

I order curry, she orders pad thai. Mine was quite good, hers was extremely potent in a bad way. She tried it but couldn&#39;t stomach it; the smell even made me nauseous across the table. She felt bad, but politely asked if we could order something else as she didn&#39;t like it, we&#39;d pay for everything, and apologized. Waitress asks if she&#39;s had pad thai before, we both reply we had but this was very strong and she just wanted something else. She orders, we wait 15 min, and the chef/owner comes out. He informs us that since we did not like his cooking that he would not make anything else for us and we needed to leave. 

I was floored, my girlfriend was crying. I&#39;ve never even heard of someone being asked to leave a restaurant for not liking a dish. He continued to insult us (&#34;maybe try a different Thai restaurant with better cooking&#34;) at which point I got up and walked out. 

None of this is exaggerated in the slightest. Avoid this place at all costs."

Half the times I&#39;ve gone, the food has been delicious and flavorful. I got take out on my own one night, and ate the entire portion of pad kee mow while sitting on my couch, no regrets. The other night&#39;s take out lacked any real flavor and I left more than half. 

Dining in has been the same. When we first moved to the area, I was really excited that we had found a nearby thai place that was oh, so tasty! The second time we stopped in, my pad thai tasted &#39;off&#39; and lackluster.

The building which it shares with other businesses gives it a &#34;whole-in-the-wall&#34; vibe but whoa, the interior is much better than its facade. Within has a cool Thai feel with green bamboo shoots and earth tones. There are some contemporary touches in the form stainless steel tabletops and frames contrasted by matte black chairs and picture frames that make the atmosphere a little more, dare I say, hip. Even the bathrooms are clean, well lit and stocked!  No sticky floors could my shoes detect. Three words:  clean, roomy, stylish. 

My server quickly greeted and seated me. In fact, he was attentive, polite and exhibited professional touches indicative of someone who takes pride in their work. 

In the mood for noodles, I couldn&#39;t resist Pad Thai and a Thai Iced Tea. The former is offered in levels of spice from 1-3. I wussed out and opted for the 1. That said, I was pleased to discover 1 has a bit of bite, a nice low-n-slow burn. It&#39;s just enough to let you know the cook didn&#39;t use Thai-influenced ketchup.  The noodles were of appropriate firmness, chicken ample, portion large and quality fresh. This is a very tasty example of a Thai staple. The iced tea was exactly the sweet nectar I expected.  Sadly, they were out of mangoes so no Mango Sticky Rice today. Oh well. My stomach has been yelling at my mouth to stop since my last bite of noodles. 

This a wonderful place to sample Thai cuisine if this first visit is any indication.  I opted for five stars despite a minor disappointment regarding the mango. However, it is a seasonal and temperamental fruit so I can hardly ding their rating for a lack of dessert."

This is just as good if not better than US Thai. It&#39;s a little bit more expensive but totally worth it. Simply the best / most authentic Thai I have had in Colorado. The Basil Chicken, drunken noodles, pad Thai or any of the curries are amazing and great dishes to try on your first visit.

Just know that they don&#39;t play when it comes to spice. I love it spicy but &#39;hot&#39; at Aung&#39;s is way hotter than what you will get elsewhere. I will order Thai-hot at other restaurants like Swing Thai or Spicy Basil but at Aung&#39;s I order just hot. I recommend medium for your first visit (if you like the spice) and go from there.

5 stars! I eat there at least once a week. So happy to have authentic Thai in my neighborhood again!!!"

The service was pretty slow at first but once they took our order, it sped up considerably. We started with the Thai Egg Roll which was fantastic. I usually don&#39;t like egg rolls because they are typically very greasy but this one was crisp and full of pork. 
For an entree I had the Panang Curry at a medium spice level and it was really good. The spice was just enough not to over power. My girlfriend has the Pad Thai and ordered it Thai Hot. She was warned by the waiter several times but because she had ordered the same dish Thai hot before, she wasn&#39;t concerned. A tip, don&#39;t order anything here Thai hot unless you are very sure you can handle something extremely spicy. It was without a doubt the hottest Thai food I have had.
With that said, the food was overall delicious and we will most likely be back."

It&#39;s a hidden gem that is without a doubt worth visiting.  When you sit down and watch other people come through the door, you&#39;ll notice that 9 times out of 10 they say &#34;Hi Bill&#34;.  Small and family owned, you get the sense that Bangkok Cafe is a real neighborhood gem and it certainly is.  When it&#39;s such a rarity these days to have the owners making the food, taking the orders, and chatting with the customers all day, every day, it&#39;s hard not to be charmed by Bangkok Cafe.

Then comes the food.  The Pad Thai is the gold standard for every Pad Thai dish I&#39;ve ever had.  The coconut milk soup is something I never imagine I&#39;d enjoy, but is now a staple of my diet.  The double black chicken is hard to even review because my mouth starts watering so profusely in just thinking about it.

This is a restaurant that deserves your business.  It&#39;s small, honest, and delicious.  You&#39;d never notice it from the street, but so very worth seeking out."

Customers bussing their own tables and serving themselves water????????????????????? I was genuinely embarrassed for the guy. Dude needs to hire someone.  If there would have been at least a busser they would have turned 7 or 8 more tables while I was there. I waited 20 min for my check...........screw that, 1 1/2 stars"

We split the thai egg rolls for an app and they were nice and crispy and the plum dipping sauce was sweet with a hint of spice. You could tell they were hand rolled and not from a box, yummy!

I ordered the Blackjax with pork which is supposed to be the spiciest dish on the menu. I thought it was just the right heat. It&#39;s a slow heat that intensifies the more you eat. Good flavors. The pork was a little over-cooked but other than that the rice and veggies were on point! 

My husband had the red curry stir fry and it was amazing as well. More of sweet and spicy dish. The broth was really tasty! 

The service was a bit slow but it&#39;s a small family restaurant with maybe 10 tables and they cook everything to order, I think it was worth the wait and they were super friendly and apologetic for any wait time. We&#39;ll definitely be making this a regular go to thai restaurant! No it&#39;s not fancy looking from the outside or inside, but it&#39;s super tasty and authentic thai flavors!!!!"

There were only a few people in the restaurant when I arrived, but I had to wait over 5 minutes to be seated.   The server was walking around the very small restaurant totally oblivious to the fact that a customer came into the restaurant.   After I was seated, I had to wait another 10 minutes to get a menu.   Immediately upon receipt of the menu, I was asked what I wanted.  I told him &#34;You just gave me the menu and I haven&#39;t even opened it.&#34; and sent him on his way, terrified about another long wait.  Already, my impression of this place was bad.

Eventually I was able to order and eventually I got my food.   When the food did arrive, it was really disappointing.   The curry was watery and completely without flavor.   It had diced carrots/peas &amp; potatoes in them that I swear were from one of those frozen bags you get at the grocery store.   I&#39;ve had lots of Panang curry before, but this dish was unrecognizable to me.

To top it off, it was really expensive.   If there was a lunch menu, I wasn&#39;t given one and ended up having to pay $11 for a curry."

We ordered Lad Na and Pad See-Ew. The food is pretty generic Thai food. I would rate the food three stars. However, the prices are bit high here considering how simple the interior/atmosphere is... metal tables and wooden chairs. In other words, I don&#39;t see any reason to be paying these prices for the average quality food and lack of atmosphere. Thus, I&#39;m only giving them a 2 star rating.

If you are in the area and crave Thai food, you might consider this place. Otherwise, it&#39;s not worth driving here."

The owner is incredibly pleasant and warm.  You can tell by the photos tacked on the walls that he is grateful of his customers.  Doing the cooking in the back is his wife who is a native of Thailand.    

Their snapper in red curry is excellent.  A whole snapper is pan fried and immersed in a small pool of their spicy red curry with some crisp veggies.  

I&#39;ve also had the pineapple curry with chicken.  Never having had a sweet curry before, I was surprised by the contrasting sweetness and savory tastes.  Pineapple with a little kick.

Some of us order it mild and I always order it medium or hot, I talk about this place and will go out of my way to come here or bring friends here. 

This place looks like nothing from the outside and you wouldn&#39;t realize that there is a hidden gem next to this liquor store.

I have eaten Thai food in many cities and this is by far the best Thai food I have ever eaten. It is a small family owned restaurant. The chef is from Thailand and with every dish you can tell she strives to provide fresh, authentic, and tasty dishes. Great service, comfortable atmosphere, and the food is always quick and delicious!!! I am getting hungry for one of their dishes just writing this review. 

After the first time my boyfriend and I ate here, one of the owners (who is the main server, the other owner is his wife who is the head chef) remembered us and recommended an amazing dish based on our preferences the last time. We now eat here multiple times a month. I have tried many different things from appetizers, soups, noodle dishes, stir fry, to curry dishes, and I have never been disappointed. Perfect place to eat when I am craving that spice! 

 If you decide to stop in here, I highly recommend the coconut milk soup. It can come in a single serving or a large portion to share.  It is hands down the best soup I have ever eaten! Not to creamy, but still has that comfort food quality. 

Don&#39;t be turned off by $10 a plate. (Isn&#39;t that standard anyways?) Usually I can share an appetizer and an entree with my boyfriend for dinner and we will both be stuffed. They incorporate lots of fresh vegetables and big pieces of all white chicken or whatever meat you choose, so to me the price seems spot on."

But, I thought about it, and my girlfriend and I were honest-to-god disappointed with our food. Dinner shouldn&#39;t make you feel sad, but this one did.

(We got take out)

Yeah, we had high expectations, but nothing unreasonable. I wasn&#39;t expecting a visit from Buddha after trying the curry.

We got pad see ew and a yellow curry. Both were underwhelming, especially the curry. It was thin, watery, and very, very bland. I don&#39;t just mean non-spicy either, for food can be flavorful and mild. This was not.

Additionally, we paid more than we thought we&#39;d have to (over ten dollars per entree). That never helps when you&#39;re eating mediocre to crummy food.

Would not return. Too many other good places to try."

The rice soup is great and comes with individual condiments as it should.

Here&#39;s my take aways:

PROs
+ L&amp;L Hawaiian Barbeque makes some bomb digitty macaroni salad. 
+ I&#39;ve ordered the chicken katsu pretty frequently. It&#39;s fabulous! Lightly breaded and fried chicken with a sweet katsu sauce to dip it in. Delish!
+ Portions are large. Though my beloved chicken katsu does not tend reheat the best.
+ The staff is fast, friendly, and efficient. Of course when it&#39;s during the crazy lunch rush they wont be as chatty, but they are still very helpful making your meal choices.

CONs
- They&#39;re SO popular that they need to consider making bad food or moving to a larger space! Preferably the latter!! 

**Pro Tip: Try and avoid the lunch hour. This place is HOPPIN&#39; at lunch time and seating is limited."

With L&amp;L being one of our favorite chains in Hawaii, we had to give it a try.  From the outside, the restaurant looks as nice as all of the other stores in the outdoor shopping area.  On the inside, the restaurant doesn&#39;t have too much space and it can be difficult to seat a party of more than 4 people if it&#39;s during a peak time.  The menu has many of the same basic items that you&#39;ll find at any L&amp;L and the food is just as good.  The Chicken Katsu was on point but the BBQ Chicken tasted slightly different from what we had in Hawaii.  Not a bad different, just not the same.  The regular size plates will more than fill you up, and they don&#39;t skimp on the entree.  The macaroni salad, one of my favorites, is the perfect compliment to whatever entree you decide to order.

My only real complaint with this particular location was that service was a little slow, and they don&#39;t do a great job at wiping down the tables after customers leave.  We sat at dirty tables with the table cleaning rag still sitting on it, and had to notify the staff to please wipe down the table for us.  It&#39;s still not a deal breaker though, since the food is pretty good for the price you pay."

This place was absolutely crackin when I walked in during lunch time. Line was practically out the door. Inside was packed with people basically shoulder to shoulder. Busy doesn&#39;t even begin to describe it at all. Being honest, you can look up at those 4 stars on top, and half of them would be for the staff here. They genuinely had just one girl working the cash register, handing out orders, and answering the phones. Multitasking to the finest. She was burning calories quicker than me running a marathon. So map props to the staff here for doing what they do.

The food was actually just pretty standard compared to what I&#39;m used to. Hawaiian places are pretty common where I come from, and L&amp;L in Denver was right up to par with other chain shops that I&#39;m used to. Chicken Katsu had all that crispyness that I&#39;m used to. Spam musubi was cut pretty fat and had just that right amount of sauce. I was totally a happy camper after my meal here.

Granted, it did take around 20+ minutes to even place my order, and another 30+ minutes on top of that to get my food, but it was very understandable and I knew that the wait time was gonna be that long.

Prior to coming here, I had only a small glimpse of what Hawaiian BBQ was from a Travel channel show. But I&#39;m so glad I found L&amp;L because I am hooked on it now. The pork lau lau was incredible--unlike anything I&#39;ve ever eaten--it&#39;s moist, juicy, smoky, and just...delicious. If it&#39;s your first time, try the lau lau, and you too will get hooked on Hawaiian BBQ. We also ordered the combination platter which comes with some marinated short ribs and grilled chicken, and a couple of spam musubis. It&#39;s a lot of food, but it&#39;s affordable!

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more items on their menu. :)"

Flavor is on point with the islands and  price is fair for quality and freshness....this is basically fast food dinning not the food but the store front and food presentation which is OK just don&#39;t expect to go on a serious date here or impress anyone... always backed and many regulars I&#39;ve never seen the place slow and most complaints  are superficial or people expecting  fine dinning.... because  of the popularity expect a line and a wait also if you get skipped chill all the food is fresh and certain dishes take longer... when I just get a basic teriyaki chicken dish it&#39;s usually just a couple minutes when I get more authentic  and complicated dishes expect 15min and people ordering after you and receiving  there dishes before you..."

I would like to go back and try something else. I had the grilled chicken, and it was tasty. The weird macaroni salad was so mayonnaise-y I could barely eat it.

I opted on not adding the BBQ sauce because it just tasted like generic American BBQ sauce &amp; I thought it ruined the flavor of the chicken.

Not really. 

This place is tiny and is always crowded, they seat maybe 35-40 or enough to make you feel like you should start mooing. Most people get take out since they always come in take out boxes regardless, but the best thing I&#39;ve found was to order ahead and then come wait in line just to pay. They also have good &#34;exotic&#34; drink selections if you&#39;re feeling adventurous. The staff are quick and very busy, they&#39;re just trying to get the customers in and out of there and are as polite as possible. 

The place is relatively clean but considering the rush of people and constantly being crowded, the floor does get a bit sticky from people spilling drinks, sauces, or bodily fluids, whatever the case may be. I don&#39;t think I have ever been here when it was not busy, and I have tried at many different times of the day which says a lot about how often people come here and how many regulars this place has, the combination of BBQ meat, rice, and macaroni salad is so simple yet so good. 

The only thing I would say is maybe make the scoops of rice and macaroni salad a tad bigger or add half a scoop on top of what&#39;s already there. I know this is not something that this branch is able to do because it&#39;s probably a regulated amount that all chains must comply with, etc. but maybe &#34;corporate&#34; will see this and increase the scooper size. Most likely not though."

Sure, a lot of people come and go, no matter the time of day, but seeing that the restaurant is pretty small, they really should go around more often to keep the tables clean. There&#39;s only a few tables to choose from, if any is even available. I had to ask the cashier to clean two tables for us and remove the wet rag that had been sitting on one of the tables. Anyway, the menu serves the same dishes as the L&amp;L&#39;s in Hawaii. I ordered the BBQ chicken plate in regular size. It was good and tasty, however, it didn&#39;t taste the same as the L&amp;L Hawaii. It barely had the grilled BBQ taste - it tasted more like  filipino chicken adobo.

Overpriced for mediocre food

Chicken Katsu wasn&#39;t crispy as you&#39;d find in Hawaii and the chicken tasted spoiled. 
The BBQ plate was ok, but after eating the bad chicken we were afraid to eat anything else. 
The meat was put on top of the Mac salad which made it hot and slimy, hot mayo is kind of gross.

I was disappointed by the inaccessibility and lack of variety in available sauces.  You are given a healthy serving of white rice.  There is soy sauce available on the tables, but if you desire any other condiments you will need to go back to busy counter and wait for the opportunity to request some sriracha.  

It was so crowded that my group of five crowded into a table for four uncomfortably close to strangers all around.  I literally sat around the corner from my food which was a pain.

But, I do think some menu items are much more worth it to order than others.  I would highly recommend getting the Lau Lau or the Kalua Pork. These two menu items can be ordered in a combination plate. The flavors of the pork are very good. The pork is also very delicious and savory. The Lau Lau is wrapped in several layers of taro leaves. I&#39;m a huge fan of the edible portion of the leaves. In general, these two pork dishes take a while to prepare at home and L&amp;L adds a huge convenience by offering these two items for order. Spam musubi is a very easy item to make at home. But, the convenience offered by L&amp;L in making this dish is quite nice. Personally, I don&#39;t mind order the spam musubi once in a while.

Although the above description shows the good side of L&amp;L, there are some pretty average sides on order as well. I think that the saimin is really basic. It&#39;s not very worth it to order at L&amp;L. It is something you can easily make at home. Also, I bet you can make it better if you were to cook it yourself. In general, I&#39;m a fan of macaroni salad. But, the macaroni salad at L&amp;L contains way too much mayonnaise to be enjoyable. So, I&#39;m definitely not a fan of their macaroni salad."

As is the problem with most places around Denver that are delicious, is the fact that there isn&#39;t much seating or room in the restaurant period. You pretty much have to be scoping out a seat from the time you walk in while you are waiting in line, and just hope that someone gets up by the time you finish ordering.

Granted, I almost always order only 2 spam musubis and a cup of the macaroni salad...and poke, if they have it (but I&#39;m usually too late for that, sadly), but I always enjoy my meal there.  The owner knows me by name and so he&#39;s always made sure I had a good experience there, especially while I was working nearby and eating there frequently.

My only complaints are that I always miss the poke!  Probably my own fault, though, so I don&#39;t hold that against them.  I also wish their building was larger - the lunch rush gets pretty crazy, and there isn&#39;t much seating available then, which is unfortunately for people like me who don&#39;t have a car to go sit in instead."

The following time I ordered the bbq chicken, it was burned and there was so much oil in the cabbage that it leaked everywhere.

We arrived in the middle of the lunch rush and my buddy was shocked we got a front row parking spot, by the time we entered the line to get into the door so was I. This place was happening, line out the door, standing room only and not a person was upset about this.

We finally had our turn at the counter and I ordered the #2, L&amp;L Hawaiian BBQ Mix and I also ordered the Hawaiian Plate (Lau Lau &amp; Kalua Pork) just because I had to try Lau Lau, it&#39;s been on my list for some time now.

We found a table by luck and our food was out rather quickly. Three Styrofoam boxes packed with deliciousness staked on our table. The first box I opened, #2. The mixed BBQ was amazing, the meat was all so tender and sweet with rich flavors and a wonderful appearance. Also crammed in this box was two healthy scoops of tasty white rice and a helping of macaroni salad. Macaroni salad and I are not friends, typically it&#39;s nasty. Cloying and oily, just plain gross but I always try it because I&#39;m convinced it shouldn&#39;t be bad. Well theirs isn&#39;t bad, actually it&#39;s really good, like good enough that I ate all of that in my #2 box and the popped open the Hawaiian Plate and started in on that helping too.

The Hawaiian Plate had a good size helping of Lau Lau &amp; Kalua Pork plus the rice and mac salad. The Kalua Pork was out of this world, tender shredded pork with cabbage and onions. Awesome. The Lau Lau was different from anything I have had in the past, the leaf that it&#39;s wrapped in imparts a unique flavor and keeps all of the pork flavor in the meat so what you end up with is a rich almost gamey shredded pork. It was good but kind of odd to me as I&#39;ve never tried anything like it.

So if you are reading this post in the parking lot while looking at the line, get you ass out of the car and get in it, it&#39;s only going to get longer and it&#39;s worth the wait!"

I always get an extra side of sauce to have with the rice, which is free! All the combos come with rice and macaroni salad which is probably my favorite from any place.

Some other things I love there are the spam musubi, which if you haven&#39;t had it is basically spam sushi. You&#39;ll be surprised how tasty it is. I almost always get a Hawaiian juice drink from the fridge on the right as well. Idk anywhere else to get them but they&#39;re awesome!"

I got the Hawaiian BBQ chicken and honestly it was just okay. I had the Aloha Hawaiian BBQ chain in California and L&amp;L wasn&#39;t as good. But today I came here again and I tried the Chicken Katsu which is apparently one of their best sellers. It was so good! Less healthier option since this one is fried but I really enjoyed this one. It&#39;s better dipped in teriyaki sauce that bbq sauce. I&#39;ve also tried the spam musubi here and it&#39;s pretty good although I guess I&#39;m not a huge fan of seaweed. I like just the rice and spam which i can just make myself at home. They do have really good sticky rice here though. And also the macaroni salad is good.

I always look forward to the mac salad that comes as a side with the meal. I also happen to be a big fan of Spam. So, the Spam musubi definitely hits the spot. It&#39;s basically a giant Spam sushi and it&#39;s DELICIOUS.

Seating is prime real estate here, especially during mealtimes. This place gets BUSY! Expect to wait a little while for your food too. They make most everything to order (this is my assumption), so it takes a little while for the orders to come out.

It&#39;s the only Hawaiian place in Aurora and Denver. There&#39;s one mediocre one located in Thornton, but that one is over-priced. This place has reasonable prices and builds good karma while operating because it&#39;s probably the only reason why the Wing Stop next door stays in business, people get tired of waiting in line at noon, so they just go over to Wing Stop. However, just start with a beginner&#39;s plate, such as the BBQ plates, and then go from there.

Again, lots of rice, so this can definitely serve as a medium sized snack or maybe even a meal in itself for some people."

Would give it 3.5 stars if I could just because even at its worst it&#39;s still pretty damn good but this particular location isn&#39;t as good as others I&#39;ve been to. The katsu chicken pieces were really thin and the teriyaki chicken didn&#39;t have the skin on it like some other locations (don&#39;t pander to the skin-fearing) and just wasn&#39;t as flavorful.

L&amp;L has been on &#34;The List&#34; for quite some time, so I finally made my way out to Aurora to try it.  I&#39;d heard so much about the infamous Hawaiian Macaroni Salad... And I&#39;d legitimately never (ever!) had SPAM before, and my companions for the evening are from Hawaii.  So these forces combined and Wham-O!  L&amp;L is a HIT!

Both of my Hawaiian-bred friends felt an immediate sense of home, only heightened by the cooler full of Hawaiian Juices ripe for the grabbing.  (We grabbed... Too many.  Passion Fruit.  Guava.  Pineapple.  Teas.  No High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Win.)  Between the three of us, we shared and sampled for the &#34;Full Experience.&#34;  This is what we had:

1:  Small Loco Moco.  The Island Tradition/Obsession:  A mound of white rice, topped with a Hamburger Patty, a Fried Egg, and smothered in Brown Gravy.  Waffle House ain&#39;t got NUTHIN&#39; on *this* Smotherin&#39;!   It&#39;s not winning any Heart Healthy awards by any means, but MAN is this stuff GOOD!  And it came with the ever-present side of...

MACARONI SALAD.

Don&#39;t ask.  Just eat.  This stuff is life-changing.  Life.  Changing.  And they&#39;ll sell you an extra side to-go for less than $2.  Because one scoop is never enough.

2:  Small Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Bowl.  The bowls come sans the Macaroni Salad.  I can&#39;t understand why anyone wouldn&#39;t want it... But okay, for smaller appetites, the bowls are one scoop of steamed white rice topped with (in this case) sweet and tangy Hawaiian BBQ Chicken.  Reminiscent of the &#34;Bourbon Chicken&#34; at those Food Courts, this too was favorably received and devoured.

3:  Large Chicken Katsu Platter.  Two scoops of steamed white rice, the infamous and delicious Macaroni Salad, and crisp-fried, Panko-coated Fried Chicken.  The &#34;Hawaiian BBQ Sauce&#34; on the side is somewhere between Duck Sauce and Mickey D&#39;s Sweet &#39;n Sour sauce.  Again, we devoured it happily.

Lastly, and the most exciting moment of the evening:

SPAM MUSUBI!  Yup.  I ate SPAM.  Finally.  It only took 35 years.  Bonus:  I liked it!!!  Spam musubi is definitely a Hawaiian staple... Apparently you can pick it up at every 7-11 on the Islands, and it&#39;s GOOD.  Think Spam Sushi.  A thick slice of Spam, griddled in a teriyaki sauce, rolled in seaweed with steamed white rice.  As apprehensive as I was at that first bite, I quickly realized how surprisingly good and addictive it is.  I don&#39;t know why I was surprised... The magic combination of Salty-Sweet and Porky-Goodness.  Noms.

So, yeah, L&amp;L was quite the success.  And I&#39;ll have to say how happy I am that it&#39;s all the way in Aurora, because if it were nearer to my stomping grounds, we&#39;d have a serious problem."

The short ribs (riblets) were eaten first because they at least were covered with BBQ sauce.  (thin sliced ribs).  The grilled chicken was dry and we ran out of sauce trying to rehydrate them.

Case in point: got delivery tonight and asked for Pad Woon Sen (my go-to every. time.) level 5, the second-to-spiciest; it arrived with literally no spice. Like, level 0.

There was no dance floor, there was ZERO signs of any real monkeys, and it just didn&#39;t resemble a club at all!! I can&#39;t believe how misleading the name of this place is and how led on I was to even come here! 

 That&#39;s how some of these reviews legitimately sound. Like, wow, ever think of reviewing the food rather than griping about what you think you&#39;re entitled to as a customer that is actually petty details that hardly matter? It&#39;s obnoxious and skews the actual ratings of what the food is like because your ego is too big to rate the food because you&#39;d rather spend your time talking about the lack of parking or the way someone treated you over the phone than leave a review of the food.

Getting on to the review, I ordered the Crab Cheese Wontons for my friends and I to split. As a main course I ordered the Drunken Noodles, and a Thai Iced Tea for my beverage. 

The wontons were awesome and would ABSOLUTELY recommend them for anyone who is a fan of getting those as an appetizer whenever offered! It only comes with 4 and I wish the order had the option to maybe come with 6, enough for maybe 3 people to have 2, or a larger party to split. Either way, that was hardly even an issue because they were so good, my sister ordered another round for us to once again split! They&#39;re very substantially filled with the filling and the sauce it comes with is a sweet chili sauce and was something different than the average sweet and sour sauce they may usually come with and they were a perfect pair!

The Drunken Noodles were soo yummy! I tend to lean towards that dish at most Thai restaurants as I am a big fan of that dish and kinda like to compare one place to another. Their Drunken Noodles are definitely up there with some of my other favorite places I&#39;ve gone to for that dish. The food comes out piping hot and I love the freshness of it! The scale of heat ranges from 1-6. I can&#39;t remember if the scale works like an average scale with 1 being the least hot and 6 being very hot. My sister and I got medium heat (we just asked for medium, didn&#39;t specify a number) and that was really very hot. I&#39;m not sensitive to heat at all, but that had to be equivalent to the hottest level offered at this other Thai restaurant I have gone to. It was still very delicious and edible and my own fault for maybe not specifying maybe which side of medium I wanted my heat level to be at because I assume it leaned more towards the hotter side..obviously. So if you&#39;re sensitive to heat, I would for sure say stick to the lower end of the spectrum just to be safe! A 2 or a 3 is what I would maybe order next time (assuming the scale works as I described above).

In case anyone is curious about the Thai Iced Tea, it was delicious. My only gripe ever is usually that I wish there was more. Haha! I love Thai Iced Tea and it always seems to be gone in a single sip. 

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a quick Thai food fix, this is your place! And even if you&#39;re not and you just wanna try something new, I highly recommend it! You get a nice amount of food for the price and the service was great."

When you say you want something spicy, they give you a heads up. When I asked for my entree to be hot the Asian girl on the phone said, &#34;You sure? Our hot is reallllyyyyy hot.&#34; I was like, &#34;medium it is!&#34; which was such a good move. The medium was very spicy and amazing.

We ordered edamame, pad thai, beef red curry, chicken fried rice, and egg rolls. Everything was outstanding! It came to about $40. I didn&#39;t realize their fried rice is like..a whole entree.  I was wondering why it was roughly $9 but it made sense when we got it, it was so spicy and had lots of fresh cooked veggies and a great flavor.

The interior of this place is somewhat lacking, Thai feel for sure, but very simple decor and seating. I am glad we got it for pick up. They also do delivery for free within a certain range but we were starving so opted for coming to get it ourselves. They had it all ready in about 15 minutes which was pretty impressive/awesome. 

Everything we ordered was delicious and a pretty good value over all. Just know, their fried rice is an entire entree, not a side.

Totally coming back next time I need my Thai food fix!"

Service is fast, food is well prepared and has great presentation. The crab ragoons are amazing, the spring rolls are super delicious- parking can be a little tedious but all in all this place is very good.

On a second visit, I tried the pad prik khing at a spice level four and wow! It knocked my socks off! That is the kind of Thai I have been looking for! So you may have to experiment a little here but this is a pretty solid Thai restaurant.

I&#39;ve tried 10+ Thai places in the area, and TMC is by far my favorite.

I have frequented Thai Monkey Club on Broadway for two years now and have yet to have a bad experience. My personal favorites are the curries and Tum Yum soup!

Our experience was not good, I&#39;m surprised about the rave reviews given the restaurant&#39;s poor service and low quality food.

After ordering online we got a confirmation email saying that our food would take 2 HOURS to deliver. So I called and asked to pick up instead. After we were given our food at the restaurant, we realized that the Thai iced tea we ordered was missing. Then, when I asked for a tip refund since we had changed to take out instead of delivery, the waiters were very rude and claimed that they could not refund anything. 

The food itself - Tom yum soup was overly sweet, the red curry was not memorable, and the drunken noodles had a gigantic hair woven into it. 

Definitely do not recommend."

The soup tastes like it came from a private labeled king supers can of mystery slop. The food was at least warm but also lacked flavor and any sense of freshness. 

I the cashew chicken. They were out of cashews. No problem. Ordered the curry. A few minutes later I was informed they &#34;found&#34; a &#34;few&#34; cashews they could use. Why did I think that sounded like a good idea?

It is rich with flavor and thickness, much better than the one I had recently at Tumrup and honestly probably the best Green Curry I have had thus far at any Thai place.
Note: Totally heard a neighbor table complain how spicy the curry was and I think she got Panang curry, but honestly it didn&#39;t seem like she had a knack for eating spicy food so don&#39;t let other people deter you is my point! :) Although, don&#39;t expect the curry to not be spicy...which was what she expected even when she was told that no curry is not spicy at this place. SMH people!

The Lad Na, not so much. I&#39;d say steer clear of that dish. Since it&#39;s a gravy based noodle dish, the additions of the type of mushrooms they used watered down the gravy and made it less thick. Also I don&#39;t think their noodle of choice suited this dish as well as the Lad Na offered at Tumrup Thai. (It&#39;s a tad saltier at Tumrup and they don&#39;t offer as much vegetables in the dish, but it&#39;s a must try! The gravy is the perfect consistency and the noodles are great!) or even travel up north to Woody&#39;s Wings and Things if you want good Lad Na (Rad Na as other Thai places call it)

The Drunken Noodles were great with a bold flavor. It seems like Drunken Noodles is the least consistent dish I see at Thai places. All place have their own little twist on it from Thai Avenue in Boulder to Thai Flavor in Aurora soooo it&#39;s worth a try!

They offer levels of spice from 1-6. We tried 4 since people said Medium was a decent spice level (3), but my whole group definitely could have gone with 5 and have been fine. The waitress scared us all at first when she stopped us and asked us if we were sure if we wanted level 4! Hahah I ended up having to add more thai pepper flakes on my own to get the spice level I wanted, but it&#39;s okay to be less spicy than more since it&#39;s still in our own control to adjust it!

FYI: The water had a weird grease taste...opt for Boba, Tea or Beer."

Now after waiting so long all other options were unavailable and I had to go hungry and pay for food I didn&#39;t get. I was later refunded by the delivery service but when I called in to try and speak to someone about the incident, I was told that they weren&#39;t working that night and rushed off the phone. The delivery service told the restaurant also and I still never even got an apology from them.

I chose pad thai for $8-9 and chose a 4 on a spicy scale of 1-6. As a spicy-food loving person I figured a 3 was medium and a 4 would have the slight extra kick of heat that I would want. 

I found myself scarfing my food down not because I was hungry but because the food was so spicy that giving myself time in between bites would only allow for the spices to linger on my tongue some more. I asked for a kick of heat and I got it (plus some). I definitely drank a lot of water. I will definitely get a dish with a spice scale of 3 next time. That pad thai was tad high in mad spice. I could definitely feel the heat in my body even after the dinner. It definitely boosted my metabolism. I have been trying to up my tolerance for spiciness so this definitely helped train me. 

The pad thai was very tasty. It was a little more moist than I expected it to be but it was so enjoyable that I even ate my leftovers later that same night. The presentation and aesthetic appeal of the dish could have been improved. It was just a plate with noodles (not too many vegetables, no lime/peanut garnish). I also tried some of my friends pad see ew with steamed tofu. I thought it was tasty (not too spicy, not too salty or sweet, good texture). 

The restaurant itself offers some cocktails that were surprisingly more expensive than I expected based on the restaurant&#39;s vibe. I noticed that a lot of people ordered take out. The restaurant is small and very colorful. There&#39;s a giant monkey mural on the wall, Japanese umbrellas on the ceiling and a monkey stuffed animal on the ceiling.

I would say that apart from the Thai food truck on 16th street, this is the next best option in the Denver area. Unlike most places, this restaurant also serves its lunch specials even during the weekends. However, they do not include any egg roll or soup of the day in their delivery. FYI: Delivery minimum is $15 which is pretty easy to reach.

Their prices have gone up by $1-2 and is different from what you will see on their online menu.

Even after mixing half my water and ice in. Egg rolls were pretty good. I ordered  massaman curry and hubby ordered red. They forgot the peanuts in my dish and she didn&#39;t do a check back so I sat there awhile before I could get her attention. Fixed that, but the potatoes were not cooked through.

My favorite thai place was closed for emergency kitchen repairs and based off reviews I ordered from Thai Monkey Club.

They need a new Tom Ka soup recipe. I&#39;ve never seen frothy Tom Ka soup before. It came out looking like a cafe late. It had a strange odor.. My wife thought it smelled like soap, which is weird because I thought it smelled like dirty socks. Either way you smell it. It&#39;s just not right. It had a strange taste too. My wife makes better Tom Ka soup and she&#39;s a white girl from Texas.

So here&#39;s what you need to know.

1) The food is as authentic as it gets (and I&#39;ve travelled most of Thailand).

2) on the six heat levels go for &#39;4&#39; if you like lots of heat that doesn&#39;t kill the flavor

3) prices are aligned with the location

When I&#39;m looking to treat myself to some tasty Thai, I call up Thai Monkey Club for pickup on my way home from work. A dozen or so orders later and they have yet to be late or lacking. They might be a bit understaffed, but they make it work.

While I do still occasionally bounce around on the menu, I have found my One True Love™: drunken noodles. Thick, delicious, and spicy noodles are rounded out by crunchy vegetables and a protein of your choice. I have yet to find it better (or more reasonably priced) anywhere else.

The warnings that resound throughout these reviews are not to be ignored: Thai Monkey Club sprinkles their food with PEPPERY FIRE. I go for a solid three on the 1-6 spicy scale and still find myself quaffing water like I just finished a marathon in the Sahara. Unless your taste-buds are completely fried into submission, don&#39;t be a hero.

Also - though I&#39;ve never enjoyed it owing to my preference for takeout - they offer $2 beers. Not bad, Thai Monkey Club. 

Not bad at all."

So it was embarrassing enough to ask for a proper serving size for an athletic man to eat. 

What was put on my burrito may have been a quarter of my fist. I kid you not it took me to ask for a TRIPLE egg just to get a portion size that was equivalent to what I used to get at this location (think what 2-3 scrambled eggs look like).

The food usually is top notch with exceptional service.  The food however is very pricey for what you get.  

Its nice that they cater to vegetarians and I like the selection of wheat tortillas and brown rice which used to make me come back for more.

However, my recent lunch visit today makes me rethink this location as a go to spot for lunch. 

First off while ordering today I asked for a wheat tortilla and the associate working behind the counter grabbed a white tortilla and started pouring in the ingredients I requested.  When I mentioned I wanted a wheat tortilla he looked pissed and grabbed a new one....no biggie not a big mistake and I wasn&#39;t upset at all.  

Next, I asked for my burrito to be smothered in Green chili the vegi kind because I don&#39;t eat pork. Apparently they grabbed a barely luke warm tube of green chili that was under the counter and not heated and poured it on my burrito...I didn&#39;t know it wasn&#39;t heated at the time or I would have said something.  I placed my order and even gave them a tip because I am a nice guy and always tip.

While sitting at my table 15 seconds later I looked at the green chili and noticed it looked odd and had big globs in it....it was not runny and consistent like it would have been if it was above at least room temperature.  I decided to take a bite and only tasted a disgusting cold glob.  The green chili was cold to the touch and it even made my burrito cold.

I went to the front to let them know and all they did was pour more green chili on top and it was the normal kind with pork in it. I must admit that the normal green chili was hot but it didn&#39;t make a difference because the cold green chili cooled off the hot green chili within a matter of 20-30 seconds.  Not only that but now my meal had pork in it which is a big deal if you cannot eat pork.

I will never be back to this location after that kind of lazy service.  I was only able to power through a few bites without vomiting and I had to jet off to work so I didn&#39;t have time at this point to go through the process of ordering a new one with a line going outside of the building.

A waste of 10 dollars and its sad and unfortunate that I had this experience as it used to eb a great place to eat.  However I have noticed service getting worse since I first started coming here in 2010.

I will not be back!"

My wife and I visited during the lunch rush and even though there were a lot of customers, we got through the line quick. I ordered three chicken soft tacos and my wife ordered six taquitos. My only complaint was the guy doing the condiments kept getting distracted and looking this way and that and kept talking to his fellow employees. I wanted my food, not for him to dilly dally. My wife&#39;s taquitos tasted a bit dry to me, but she enjoyed them. Great guac and nice that they serve queso. Wish the bags of chips came with a bit more chips though.

I&#39;ll consider it a trendier chipotle with a bar and more options to offer. As I&#39;m staying away from Chipotle due to the recent E. Coli outbreak and still hankering for some Mexican - my friend recommended I check out Illegal Pete&#39;s.

Very casual, informal, chill little spot. I ordered a chicken pesto burrito with a wheat tortilla (did enjoy the wheat option). They did have a good amount of toppings to offer which was a nice perk. They have squash/pepper mix I got on my burrito in addition to onions/veggie mix. In addition, I had lettuce, medium salsa, sour cream, guac (which is just OK) and pinto beans. It was a good burrito, but as an Atlantan native - I&#39;ve had better.

Chips and guac were okay. Nothing crazy, average. Guac was very creamy and tasted boxed - not fresh.

Definitely beat Moe&#39;s or Qdoba, that&#39;s for sure, but I still prefer chipotle."

I would say Chipotle has the edge since their food keeps me satisfied longer.  I had 3 fish tacos, which were alright, but I was still hungry after.  The guacamole was too salty, but the chips were good.  My boyfriend had beef tacos and the beef was soft and tasty.  I&#39;m glad I gave it a chance, and I would eat here if I worked nearby, but not something I&#39;d go out of my way for."

We usually get chicken tacos, salad and rarely a burrito (trying to watch the waistline a bit!!!). Just delicious. Real grilled chicken, great pico, delicious grilled veggies.

This is my go-to place and not because it&#39;s the best burrito place in town, or that the drinks are dirt cheap and the place is always sold out. Illegal Pete&#39;s in the DTC is the type of place that appreciates your business and they let you know every time you go. 

I appreciate the laid-back atmosphere and the servers who remember my face. The menu is loaded with the standard burrito fare: meats+rice+beans+salsa+tortilla. It&#39;s not rocket science, folks. But at $6 for a burrito and a few bucks for a beer, it&#39;s the type of place that means to keep your business for a while. 

There are highlights on the menu, for sure: Carnitas is always a good pick; their breakfast burritos are scary good (just don&#39;t go too early in the morning or you&#39;ll get under-cooked potatoes); and the veggie green chili is delicious. I suggest the chubby (chicken burrito with queso and off menu) or the chicken and potato burrito if you must. 

But Pete&#39;s has more than food and booze, it has atmosphere. So many places in the DTC are meant to rob expense accounts with $40 steaks and $12 cocktails. It&#39;s nice that Pete&#39;s feels like it&#39;s just for me."

After each and every drink request it was &#34;ok, your total is...&#34;  Irritating.  Also, some of our food required extra time to prepare, but nothing was explained - do we wait at the register?  Do we go sit and it will be brought out to us?  Do they call out a number or name or something?  Nope - they just ring us up and walk away...

The burritos were gigantic and delicious. They are definitely a substantial meal. Mine had peppers, onions, vegetarian green chili, and chorizo. Most of the ingredients were mixed up within the tortilla but I occasionally happened upon a pocket of just one component (such as a lovely bite of cheese).

The atmosphere at Illegal Pete&#39;s was casual, cool, and industrial/loft. It was spacious and laid with regular tables, tall tables, a bar (with alcohol), a counter for ordering, and two stations with condiments and napkins. It is part of a strip mall and has ample parking."

I also had a bad experience on my last visit.  I ordered nachos to go but I guess the music was up so loud they didn&#39;t hear me.  Anyway, when I got to the register I told the guy that it was supposed to be to go.  Instead of transferring my food to a larger container, the genius pulls out a flat plastic lid and crushes the nachos, I just paid for, down into a mush then puts a rubber band around it.  I should have demanded my money back but I was in shock.  How would he feel if I turned his $9.00 nachos into a soggy pile of mush?  Anyway, after I few choice words, I left with the slop.

They have a much more extensive menu than Chipotle does, which can be good if you&#39;re always looking to try new things. Or, if you&#39;re a creature of habit like me, you&#39;ll probably just get the same thing and the larger menu won&#39;t matter to you. 

I did like that they had a bar and could serve more than just a few bottles beers and margaritas. Kudos to Pete&#39;s for having that on Chipotle. 

Food wise - the hubs and I were both happy with our lunches. We went a little later (1:00 pm) and they&#39;d run out of chicken, but we were able to find something else that was suitable (beef and fish tacos).

I&#39;m so glad I moved here and want to live here the rest of my life. But there are a few things I miss from my days in Texas, and one of those things is breakfast tacos. Like a needle in a haystack, it&#39;s been a tough search. But thankfully Illegal Pete&#39;s has me covered.

Now those of you who have never experienced a breakfast taco are probably thinking: &#34;We&#39;ve got breakfast burritos. What&#39;s the fuss?&#34; Well, here&#39;s the thing. You often have to be starving to comfortably finish many breakfast burritos in this town. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a great breakfast burrito. But the beauty of breakfast tacos (when made and sold properly) is that you can buy according to your hunger...or severity of hangover...and they travel nicely. Need a snack? Uno breakfast taco por favor. Regular breakfast? 2-3 will do ya. Starving? Buy as many as the eyes think necessary. Bought too many? They&#39;re easily warmed up in the microwave. All of this makes them a nice item to buy in bulk to-go for others as well.

I&#39;ve found breakfast tacos in a couple places along the Front Range, but Illegal Pete&#39;s does it right by selling them individually and uses the right ingredients. They come standard with eggs, homefries, and cheese, but you can add bacon or chorizo and other standard options. I prefer the bacon and like to add some of their green sauce to top it off. I suggest asking to have them wrapped individually, and for the sauce in a container - keeps everything from get&#39;n soggy.

Although not the top breakfast tacos in the world, they certainly pass the test. And the one time I&#39;ve had their regular burrito, it was quite tasty as well. Illegal Pete&#39;s is quickly becoming my fast taco/burrito establishment of choice."

I mean the restaurant is fine and all. . .but if I want Mexican I eat Mexican.. . 


This place (Illegal Pete&#39;s) is NOT Mexican

It is kind of like a Chipotle type place except they offer a few taco options. Now granted, maybe thats what Chipotle does these days. . .but last time.

So mostly burritos, 6 or 7 taco options, and a full bar.  So Chipoltle on steroids maybe?

For their taco options they have a note (mix and match 2 for price of 3).  WTF. Seriously people? At Yolando&#39;s (much better and just south by 2 miles or so) you have like 20 options and a pick-3 is standard.

Okay so I got 3 beef and with a co-worker got the fish taco (and we traded one)

Then they topped it with stuff like salad, like out of the box salad greens and olives. No cilantro that I could see. . .I don&#39;t expect a lot on my tacos but I didn&#39;t expect olives and salads.

You end it with no Orchata. . .

We went with co-workers and I may be back due to them. . but I will note for the team that I would prefer to go to Yolando&#39;s taco on Arapaho EVERY time



Note: The guys working there seemed nice. . .the place was very busy.

First off, let me paint you the picture of what type of customers there were in the dining area...A family with a toddler and an infant, another mother with her toddler and my family with our young child...As we started to eat our breakfast burritos these words started to play loudly throughout this establishment &#34;Bitch Make it Nasty, make it make it nasty....mother fucker....Bitch make it nasty really really nasty.&#34;  As a mother of an impressionable 8 year old, my family, to include my son were speechless.  As I looked around at the staff with hopes the song accidentally played, it continued playing as my family quickly picked our table with unfinished burritos in hand.  This is in no means is appropriate music and it&#39;s sad that four children had to listen to women be referred at as &#34;Bitches&#34; that need to make it really &#34;nasty&#34;, I&#39;m appalled.

I stopped by Platform T last week and I have to say my review is lukewarm at the best.  I stopped by around 5:30 and thought I would enjoy an hour with a nice cup of coffee and a book I just purchased.  The coffee served was really bitter. I was a bit surprised at the $$ of a cup of coffee.  The coffee was lukewarm and it was on the bitter side.  As the coffee sat there, it actually got better.  It was late in the day so I understand that there was not  much of a selection of cookies or pastries, but what they had in the pastry case looked a bit on the dry side.  I was hopeful that this could be a regular stop for me on my way home.  I am looking for a place to grab a good cup of coffee, maybe a cookie or pastry and unwind.  I will keep searching to find that great coffee shop.  I know it is out there :)"

The environment is calm, but enjoyable (very hip and zen), staff is incredibly kind and helpful and recognizes me every time I come in.  The space is very accessible, including the bathrooms, so I don&#39;t even feel like i&#39;m in the way if I bring my scooter and hang out for most of the afternoon!

Their drink menu is expansive, and I have it on my bucket list to try all their teas!  So far some of my favorites are, the Pumpkin Spice Latte (which is tea based), the apple toffee (I got it iced with milk), and the Spearmint Verbena (super refreshing over ice).  I haven&#39;t tried a lot of their food offerings but the breakfast wrap is usually my go to!  The maple bacon they use is just OMG.  

The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5, is that I do wish they had more coffee options.  They do offer espresso based drinks, but they have limited flavor options, and I found the latte to be a little bitter.

Overall, I will continue coming here, and I cannot wait to try happy hour one of these days!!!"

A coworker and I decided to check it out.  I had the BERRY BLAST FRUIT TEA (A fruity combination of tropical berries, hibiscus and black tea.  A blast of summer.).  It was very refreshing and flavorful.  My coworker similarly enjoyed her hot tea.  For the food, we had an assortment. The OUR BREAKFAST WRAP (bacon, hash browns, green chili, egg, cheese) was satisfying.  The GRUYERE CHEESE &amp; CRACKERS (cave aged gruyere, figs with gluten free crackers) was probably my favorite item.  There was a lot of cheese on this and the flavors were good. The MIXED QUINOA SALAD (quinoa, wild rice, roasted red pepper, orange vinaigrette, serviced with cracker) was pretty good.  I found the wild rice to be a touch chewy contrasted with the other textures.  Overall I was very happy with the quality of what we had.  The question of bang for the buck is a little more difficult.  This light lunch approached $30 for the two of us, and that seems just a bit steep (tea pun intended)."

This place is gorgeous.  A lot of thought has gone into the decor, the polished wood, the shelves, the chill music.  There are a lot of gimcracks and gifty type things for sale that you can&#39;t miss, but not so many as to be obnoxious.

I stopped in on two successive days for a coffee.  The drip brew they were offering was a Panamanian specialty coffee - and it was outrageously good.  Free wifi.  Mellow beats. Friendly crew.  Coffee was about $4 bucks; toss a buck in the tip jar for the server, and you&#39;re in and out for a fiver.

A great place to meet people, to do some business in a great environment, to share some tea and sympathy with a crying friend, or to catch up on the news on your ipad.  Oh yeah, and pick up a gift for a tea-loving friend.

With a cup of really good coffee."

How can you go wrong? Their staff is also very knowledgeable and everyone can speak to the product. I wish they were open a little earlier so I could come before work, but that&#39;s first world problems for you.

  This visit was my 15th visit here - and I had not received a free drink yet with the rewards program. They were awesome about it, and adjusted off the drinks for us. I think their program is working now, but my have been lagging when they first opened. I know it was a small measure, but they will keep me as a repeat customer ! I truly appreciate them putting the customer first, and going above my expectations.

The space is open and the ambiance is dreamy, a perfect lounge spot for anyone who is a self-described tea fanatic (much like myself). 

There are plenty of teas to choose from, with customizable add-in options that include ginger, chamomile fusion, and orange medley. Alcoholic tea drinks are even available during the evening for those who want a bit of a kick added to their traditional cup of tea. My personal favorite so far is the Pineapple Passion tea over ice. I really enjoy how refreshing it is as a blend of black tea with tropical notes. 

I spent some time relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere after I finished my cup. Have to say that this will become one of my go-to spots for delicious drinks!"

I ordered the coconut tea and was very pleased with it. I would love to try their infusions as well but am still avoiding the sauce for a while.

I would be here all the time if I lived in this area; the tea options are limitless (or at least they seem that way). They have herbal teas, your regular green/oolong teas, black teas, tea lattes... It was really difficult to choose just one!

When you walk in there is a sample tea you can try, and there are menus right next to the sample cups. We were distracted by the tea display across from the registers, so we ended up spending a good 5 minutes just smelling teas before we ordered. We decided on two Jasmine teas and one cinnamon clove; I didn&#39;t realize they were going to use some space-age looking machines to make our tea! They put the leaves in the machine and it steeps them with the correct amount of water at the right temperature then &#34;french presses&#34; it into your cup! Super cool to watch. 

Service was fast, tea was hot and DELICIOUS, and the employees were awesomely friendly. Oh and they have a frequent buyer card so get it on that. Coming back tomorrow to try the peachy mango tea! :D"

The staff was very helpful in explaining how the menu is divided into categories and demonstrating the stations where you can smell the various teas. Liked that every tea could be made latte style, and also appreciated that they carried tea based cocktails, although I&#39;m not likely to indulge.

I also enjoyed the atmosphere, which Colton H. described well as rustic/modern and bright. Platform T would be a great place for a meet up with friends and an equally appropriate spot for a work-oriented gathering. The transition to tea cocktails at Happy Hour lends even more diversity.

I had the Vanilla Moroccan Mint tea and asked for it cold/latte style. First of all, the mint flavor reminded me very much of tea we actually had in Morocco this past summer and the vanilla/latte elements gave the overall flavor of a Shamrock Shake without the preservative-y feel of an actual Shamrock Shake. I think I may have discovered a new vice! Yesssss!

The macaroons were a bit hard, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;d order them again, but I&#39;m a pretty picky macaroon eater after sampling sweets at both Ladurée and Bouchon recently. Take my word for it or leave it, but it did look like there were plenty of other treats to try, so I&#39;ll pick something new next time.

Very cute place--hipster-y and chill vibe. This place is conveniently located in the plaza near Residence Inn and The Hilton. We stumbled upon this bar/tea shop. We came during happy hour, which is 3-7 pm--$5 select drinks and snacks. 

One of my cousins ordered a strawberry mint mojito, which was delicious. Apparently, they steep the rum with tea and mint which is suppose to give it a balanced taste. I thought it had a good kick. The other cousin had the lemon drop martini, which was pretty strong, but tasted good as well. I had the Lavender Kiss Prosecco, which had a nice, bubbly taste. I just learned that Prosecco and Champagne are similar, but different. Prosecco is a sparkling wine made in Italy, which Champagne is a sparkling wine made in France. But anyways, it had a nice fizz to it and tasted smooth. FYI, they also sell sake and normal teas if you don&#39;t dig the alcoholic drinks.

In terms of food, we ordered the vanilla brulee cheese cake with matcha sauce and the Gruyere cheese and crackers. I was unimpressed with the cheese and crackers appetizers, but the the cheesecake was really great. The cheesecake was not dense or heavy at all-- very light and creamy. I would recommend it!! But anyways, the service was great and the shop is very roomy. We are here in Denver for 3 days and will be visiting Platform T every day for the dranks! I totally recommend this place."

The first night, we were looking for a good happy hour place, and since I&#39;m not a drinker, this place was perfect because it had both alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic. We ordered the strawberry mojito, Lavender Kiss prosecco and a Lemon Drop martini to start. I also got the popular peach tea julep for myself. I was expecting my drink to be on the sweeter side, but it was really light and didn&#39;t have a strong peach flavor. For some snacks, we got the gruyere cheese and crackers, which came with some dried figs. I thought this dish was OK and wouldn&#39;t get it again. The vanilla brullee cheesecake on the other hand was delicious and a nice little treat to share between the three of us. 
We stopped by again before we left for some tea and this time I tried the earl grey chai and my cousins got the strawberry mint fruit tea and a dark chocolate iced tea. My chai tasted a little watered down and I preferred my cousin&#39;s strawberry tea. Overall, I&#39;d say this place for drinks and snacks is three stars but because of ambience and customer service it&#39;s a solid four."

I prefer to support local businesses though so I checked out my trusty Yelp app. This place appear to have just opened recently (men still working on the entrance as I walked in), and it still has that fresh-cut wood smell. 

I was immediately greeted by friendly faces who asked if I needed help as I overused the refrigerated case. I explained that I just wanted to check out all my options first, but thanks anyway. Some items in the refrigerated case include a charcuterie board, Gruyere cheese with GLUTEN FREE (YAS!) crackers, salads, fruit bowls, parfaits and some cute side options. 

I decided I was too full to eat and moseyed up to the counter to grab a tea while I waited on my interviewee. The selection they have is IMPRESSIVE! The girl at the counter explained that they have a list of signature drinks that are a bit sweeter and that I should check out their tea selection menu if I wanted some different options. I&#39;m sweet enough as is and don&#39;t need any extra sugar, so I checked out the list. 

The barista (are they still called that for tea?) also showed me the wall of teas behind me to compare to the list. This is such a great idea! Under each container of tea is a drawer with some of the loose leaves inside, allowing you to get a whiff of the stuff before they steep it. I thought for sure I would want the pomegranate white tea (I love the pomegranate green tea at the hair salon I go to), but I&#39;m so glad I got to smell it first...turns out, pomegranate white is NOT my cup of tea. I surprised myself by picking the pineapple white tea but it smelled so good! White tea is full of even more antioxidants than green tea, by the way (the internet told me so it must be true). 

I ordered and waited for my tea to come out at the counter and the lady steeping it complimented my outfit (flattery will get you everywhere)! My tea can out quickly and I tasted it to see if it might need some sweetener after all...nope! It was perfect. I thought to myself, this place is worthy of a yelp review! 

...And now you&#39;ve found yourself here reading this little quip. Hopefully it&#39;s convinced you to check out this quaint, but modern, new addition to Glendale!"

Cheesecake was alright.

Belgian waffle, didn&#39;t have the chocolate syrup and didn&#39;t even offer an alternative until I went and inquired about it. Took way too long to bring the alternative.

I have to say, the Mozzarella Burrata was good (of course it would be -- mozzarella, toast, balsamic vinegar, and NOT arugula. Served with basil).

Their Peach Tea Julep is good. Might come back to just get a to-go order of tea, but all in all, not somewhere I would frequent too much.

The bad: the service was poor.  We went in during the afternoon on a fairly warm day.  They didn&#39;t have the AC on, or it was set too warm.  If you&#39;re going to drink a warm beverage, you don&#39;t want to do it in a warm room unless you&#39;ve been chilled outside.  So, we asked if they&#39;d open the garage door they have to let some breeze in, or consider lowering the temp on the AC.  They were indignant about it - as if we&#39;d really crossed the line by asking.  We paid about $7 bucks for our pot of tea, so we were determined to drink it.  They said, &#34;if you need more hot water, just ask&#34;.  So we did - and it never came.  Eventually we walked up to the counter to get it ourselves, and even after doing so, it still took quite a while before they brought it out to us.  We noticed other customers had lined up to get more hot water themselves, so something was amiss.  They weren&#39;t crazy busy or anything, so I&#39;m not sure what the hold-up was.

Very spacious inside, seems like a good place to study/do work. I really like the ambience! There were tea samples when we walked in the door and self-serve water for when you need a break from your draaanks. Staff was really friendly and helpful in explaining drinks (:

We went for happy hour, which is apparently from 4-6pm, but we came a little after 6 and were told that they were resetting their system or something, so HH was actually extended to 7pm. YASSS!! Everything on the HH menu was $5. Went with two of my cousins and we got three drinks and two small bites from the HH and a regular tea for about $30 -- great deal!

Vanilla Lemon Drop -- couldn&#39;t really taste the vanilla, but then again it&#39;s just a &#34;hint;&#34; the vodka was a little overpowering but it was very smooth. 
Lavendar Kiss Prosecco -- you can definitely taste the lavendar, so if you like the flowery/tea taste this is the drink for you! It&#39;s pretty light.
Strawberry Mint Mojito -- the rum is steeped with tea and mint leaves; perfect ratio of club soda to alcohol. Just minty enough too... yummm! A bit stronger than most mojitos I&#39;ve had (not that that&#39;s a bad thing).
Vanilla Brulee Cheesecake -- I loved it!! Huge fan of creme brulee, love cheesecake, so this was the perfect combo. Thin caramelized layer on top. Not too sweet, and it comes with white chocolate matcha sauce on the side so you can sort of &#34;dip&#34; your bites. Couldn&#39;t really taste the sauce, but I guess it was a good garnish to make the presentation of the cheesecake prettier.
Gruyere Cheese &amp; Crackers -- gluten free crackers, comes with a few figs.
Peach Tea Julep -- Colorado style sweet tea! Not sweet at all though actually. Hint of mint and peach. Pretty good, very light flavor.

Will be back the rest of the weekend to try more drinks!"

You can get a milk tea with grass jelly, boba and chia seeds for that price in the Bay. I saw a bug in the pastry cabinet on the chocolate pastry but I ordered it anyway because it&#39;s my coffee shop pastry of choice. The pastry was heated so the chocolate was nice &amp; gooey. It was very large &amp; covered with a nice coat of powdered sugar. I tried that plus a creamy earl grey tea latte. I am not calling it creamy because it actually was but because that&#39;s it&#39;s menu name. It wasn&#39;t particularly more creamy than any other earl grey latte I&#39;ve had. It was tasty but tastes exactly like the earl grey latte I make at home with my milk froth machine so I probably won&#39;t order it again. The wifi here doesn&#39;t work and the worker said I could use nearby wifis but it&#39;s not possible in this distance or without a passcode. The worker here was very quick to greet me &amp; show me the tea shelf. It&#39;s organized in the following categories: fruity, classic, pure &amp; herbal (no caffeine). You can smell the tea from the shelf but some are too tall for me to reach and others were too short so it required bending down awkwardly. The space is very modern &amp; nice with ample lighting &amp; seating. There&#39;s plenty of outdoor parking &amp; spots to eat next door. This place sells a number of food options too like a beef naan with Gruyere, arugula &amp; balsamic reduction or salads and wraps. They have a water doggy bowl in the front which = a plus star for me because I love dog friendly places. The space has cute plants both in their indoor &amp; outdoor dining area which gives this place a fresh &amp; homey vibe. So far this place is better than Steep in terms of their atmosphere but I like Steep&#39;s tea latte more because it tastes like something I can&#39;t as easily replicate @ home. One thing many tea lovers might appreciate about this place is the temperature the tea is served. It&#39;s pretty hot &amp; required me to wait 5-10 minutes before drinking. They also sell espressos and alcoholic drinks that are tea infused. I thought this was awesome. They sell an earl grey martini for example. They also play music like Christina Aguilera&#39;s what a girl wants (chocolate croissant duh)."

I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn next door and was lucky enough to just stumble across the parking lot to be ever so pleasantly surprised. And btw yes there is parking aplenty.  Better yet, the tea is world class (and the servers are knowledgeable). Dozens of varieties to choose from, properly and thoughtfully served and prepared. Espresso too if you insist, but why not start exploring the wonders if Tea, Denverites?

Personally. I especially appreciated the authetic Tibetan Puer and the Iron Goddess Oolong. Second and third &#34;pour&#34;&#39;especially recommended. 

But wait there&#39;s more:  tasteful and spacious interior that smoothly fuses high tech and asian influences. The one-piece solid wood community table is worth the trip all by itself. Pleasant atio seating on offer too. Lostsa thoughtful&#34;bites&#34; on the menu, from salads and charcuterie plates to macaroons, scones, and almond croissants to die for. Healthy breakfast menu also. 

Biggest surprise:  super-reative tea-infused cocktail menu -- and $5 cocktail happy hour!  Peach bellini!  Cosmotibi!  Chai infused spicey old fashioned. Margarita blush. 

Come on, Prove me wrong Denver!!  In Brooklyn or SF or Portland this place would be yotally mobbed. In Denver it&#39;s a walk-in-anytime secret with your choice of seats."

I ordered an Earl Grey Tea with a side of Cheese and Crackers. The Pick Up system was a bit confusing, since no names are called, but they seemed hesitant when they ended up going across the shop to put the order on my table. 

The cheese and crackers came with a sliced fig, which was almost frozen, but that was okay. 
The crackers were gluten free, and tasted how you would expect. They came with a dry cheese, which tasted fairly good. 

The Earl Grey Chai was a tad too sweet, but came at perfect drinking temperature. It almost had a grainy sort of texture as you drank it, sort of like when you drink a very sugary coffee that&#39;s so sweet you can feel the granules of sugar, but the drink wasn&#39;t overbearingly sweet, and enjoyable in the end. 

My only problem was that a few minutes after finishing, I began to feel incredibly nauseous and was having cold sweats in the car on the way home. By the time I got home, I was throwing up in the trash can in front of my apartment complex, but felt better immediately after. Not sure if it was the strange mixture of food I had, or just something in it was bad, but my body rejected it heavily.

Overall experience was fairly good, would go there again."

The Rosemary scone was VERY dry and crumbled in my hands as I tried to spread the lemon curd on it. The second time I came I decided to try something new, and enjoyed the Spiced Cider.

The staff are so amazing and made me feel so welcomed, and the lounge was decorated beautifully. While I was waiting for a friend, the staff gave me free samples of tea I told him I usually like, which was really great customer service, because I am now converted from Starbucks located down the street from here. 

The ambiance was perfect for catching up with friends and just studying. The space is very spacious, so even we you are sitting near other people, you don&#39;t quite feel like your space is invaded. They also have an option of leaving a tab open, so while you&#39;re hanging out, and sipping on tea, if you decided you wanted to munch on something, they will bring it to you without having to interrupt anything to go pay. 

Then their tea, my goodness! They have everything organized in such a way that if you wanted to try something new from the type of tea you usually drink, it&#39;s easy to do so, in such a way that you are guaranteed to like the new tea you&#39;re trying. They make it easy to try something a little different, to something completely different.

(I told them it was my second, but because everyone else I was with were first timers, I still got the discount anyway, wooo!)

 I ordered the market scramble with potatoes and toast. It was exactly what I wanted. It was a great portion size and had a nice traditional breakfast look to it. The eggs however were tiny bit dry, but still good. The nicely seasoned and slightly crispy potatoes were fantastic, which I can rarely can do without for a sit-down breakfast.

It did the job by filling up my tum tum and allowed me to continue on with my day.  

This meal was good, but forgettable. The entire plate needed salt and some heat to really bring out those Southwest flavors.

My suggestions are the flatiron steak sandwich, which is served on ciabatta with arugula and SPICY chipotle sauce. Not for the spice intolerant! It has a kick! The meat is always perfectly cooked and goes so well with the greens and sauce. 

The basil chicken sandwich is phenomenal as well but tends to run a little dry, so ask for some extra basil sauce on the side!

Flatiron salad is amazing and chock full of small potatoes, onions, cheese, and delicious steak.

Plenty of seating to eat with a group and friendly enough to sit and eat solo.  The space was long and it&#39;s nice because you can see the food being prepared and coming out.

I got half of a steak sandwich and it was really delicious BUT a bit smaller portioned. Get the full sandwich. Also got the green chili chicken soup which I really enjoyed but was surprised when I didn&#39;t see bread in the to go brown a bag. The cashier def. asked and confirmed I wanted bread and when I told the guy who handed me my order, he said it was on the bottom of the bag. I poked around and said I didn&#39;t see any bread and he seemed a bit annoyed to giving me a piece of bread, ha. (I checked the bag and they&#39;re definitely was no bread on the bottom).

Food was really tasty but small portions.  Service could maybe be a bit better as my cashier was also complaining very loudly about how she was so tired and had to work BUT it meant more money for her. She then threw up both hands and made the money sign... and I&#39;m handing her my credit card. 

A good option for sit down restaurant prices and selections for take out options. Not a bad place to come for a quick bite and drink as well."

They have gluten-free options and the selections are simple with basic and healthy ingredients, which I liked.

I wasn&#39;t very hungry, which is why I went with a half order of the BBQ chicken pizza. Which was a perfect amount of food. The crust was a bit burnt, but the thin dough was good.

My friends got a selection of pizzas, sandwiches, and soups. One friend got the chicken breast plate, which he said was good but wasn&#39;t anything special. His mac and cheese side looked kinda mushy and weird.

I liked the seating, although about 70% of it was high tables with stools with backs on them. As I like to say, &#34;youthful&#34; seating because it takes more effort to get in and out of tall chairs.

It acts like a Panera Bread where you order and pay at the counter when you first walk in, given a buzzer, and pick up food at window when ready. Worth a visit, but would be careful what you order."

It has a very modern, farm-to-table feel when you walk in.  We were greeted by a very friendly guy who takes your order at the counter.  My husband had on a Red Rocks sweatshirt, and the guy gave us the &#34;Red Rocks Discount,&#34; which I thought was nice (perhaps it&#39;s code for &#34;tourist discount&#34;).  Husband ordered the eggs and bacon, and I ordered the waffle with a side of bacon.  When you order, they give you a little buzzer and your cups to go grab your drinks.  Once your buzzer goes off, you pick up your food at the counter.  They cook everything fresh to order, and it&#39;s DELICIOUS.  Husband ordered his eggs a little too runny, but the waffle is AMAZING.  I honestly could have eaten two, it was so good.  

This is definitely a good choice if you&#39;re staying in DT Denver and want something a little healthier.  Nice vibe and friendly staff."

I stopped in for lunch after discovering Modmarket on Yelp. I decided upon the maple Dijon sandwich which came with pulled chicken thighs, prosciutto, arugula, and muenster cheese. I also ordered a cup of the corn chowder. Both were a huge disappointment. Although the ingredients seemed fresh, both were lacking desperately in the flavor and seasoning department in both my sandwich and my soup. 

On a positive note, I love how they put the calories on your receipt. Everyone should do this! 

All in all, next time I&#39;m in Denver hopefully I can give this place another go and order something different. After all, they had to have gotten four stars for a reason."

I really dug the space; the decor was modern, and it was light inside with a simple menu and easy seating. Nothing knick-knacky, and nothing too precious as can tend to happen with breakfast places. I don&#39;t need ceramic roosters everywhere, you know?

This place seems to be a real workhorse when it comes to cranking out the coffee and the simple breakfast foods. But there&#39;s still a little twist to everything. It&#39;s not completely plain; indeed, you&#39;ll find a little healthy twist with lots of vegetarian and gluten free options. 

I knocked back some OJ and a simple brekkie sandwich and appreciated the quick service and come-and-get-it layout. This is the kind of place you can stop by on those mornings when you need a quick breakfast bite, or want to take an early meeting and not be bothered.

Their food is absolutely delicious, healthy, and fresh. You can see them prepare everything, and because everything&#39;s so good, they can get pretty busy. But the wait is never too bad, and you forget about it once you take a bite. Did I mention the food&#39;s delicous? So far, the eggplant goat is my favorite.

Walk up. Order. Receive buzzer. Find table. Buzzer buzzes. Pick up food. Eat. 

It&#39;s fast. It&#39;s healthier than other fast alternatives. The ingredients are high quality. And, most importantly, the food tastes really good. 

I stopped in to try the Arugula Mozz sandwich. The bread was good, the mozzarella was good, the arugula was good (fresh!), the tomato was a little hard, but still had good flavor. The real winner of the sandwich, though, was the mix of the basil aioli and balsamic vinaigrette. It was good. Seriously good. I liked it so much I licked the remaining drops off the plate. 

The sandwich, which is served with no sides (save for a pickle spear) is on the pricier side for a fast-dining lunch meal at almost $10. I suppose you pay for quality ingredients, but the price still dissuades me from eating here with any regularity. If it was a couple dollars cheaper or included a side I would be more inclined to frequent. 

The dining area is clean and modern. It feels upscale for an order-at-the-counter type of restaurant. There were plenty of places to sit (I prefer the back, by the restrooms; it&#39;s a little quieter). 

Staff is friendly and helpful. 

Overall it&#39;s a great lunch experience if you&#39;re okay with the price. Next time, I&#39;m going to try one of the pizzas."

My husband had the cinnamon waffle and it smelled sooo good, he reported that it is dilectable. 

Lunch is also good. The green chile chicken soup is awesome! I also had a chicken plate which is simple and yummy, i had the rosemary sweet potato mash as one side, which is my new favorite and the mashed potatoes which are pretty good. 

I really enjoy the availability of healthy, gluten free options on the menu at Mod Market. The staff is also super friendly and they get your food out fast.

It&#39;s a huge plate of messy veggies with dressing on the side, as I was eating my salad I felt like a grazing cattle! 

Actually there was one thing that wasn&#39;t bland: the Ginger Cookie with Maple Frosting my friend bought and split with me. The worker at the register must have been joking when we ordered around 7:30pm and was worried there wouldn&#39;t be enough time to eat (they close at 8pm), and he said &#34;yeah, we kick everybody out at 8, sharp!&#34; Because I didn&#39;t see anybody being kicked out past 8!

We walked into Modmarket, not sure what to expect. &#34;Farm Fresh Eateries,&#34; sounds like a good thing to me. Farm, Fresh, what could go wrong with that?

The menu is displayed largely over the counter where you place your order. My husband and I each had the &#34;Homestyle Plate.&#34; I had the chicken, sweet potato mash, and fruit. The chicken was fine, and the sweet potatoes were good. The fruit was cut up apples with 2 grapes. Nothing fabulous in the fruit. I was expecting other fruit besides the majority of it being apples. Oh well.  The sweet potatoes were good, and flavored with rosemary. The chicken was good too, nothing out of the ordinary, but good, not terrible, just good.

My husband also had the &#34;Homestyle Plate,&#34; with steak, mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts. The steak was dry, over cooked, and prepared at least 30 minutes before we got there. The mac and cheese was shell pasta with some cheese mixed in, not really creamy, not a lot of cheese, not really mac and cheese. It was more like shells and some cheese. The brussel sprouts, well, what can I say about them? TERRIBLE looking! Truly, terrible looking, unappetizing, blackened, just GROSS! How can anyone even serve those, I just don&#39;t know!

Like I said, we didn&#39;t know what to expect. Farm Fresh, right? WRONG! Maybe the food was farm fresh to start out with, but definitely NOT on our plates. The food is not cooked to order. It&#39;s all cooked probably 30 minutes or more before you get there. The food is not served, but it is there, all ready, just like a buffet, except you can&#39;t help yourself. It&#39;s the people that work behind the counter, to spoon the food onto your plate, and put it on the counter, for you to pickup when your buzzer goes off. I know there were about 3 people ahead of us, but we had to wait about 10 minutes or so to get our food. I would expect this if my food was being prepared/cooked to order. I don&#39;t expect this when it&#39;s already been cooked (probably 30 minutes prior), and all they have to do is scoop it up with a spoon, and put it on a plate.

In my opinion, it&#39;s not worth it. I liked the interior, and the idea is a good one, but Modmarket just did not get it right.

Update:  12-22-2015 - The business owner responded to this review, and said Modmarket appreciated the review and my honesty, and will try to make it better. I was  offered a free meal, but I declined the offer. I appreciated the business listening to and reading Yelp! reviews on their business."

When the time came, I lied to my friends and told them Modmarket was one of my favorite locations. I read the reviews....I knew I was in good hands.

We ordered beef flank with spring sprouts, salad, sesame tofu with mashed potato and salad. They were all tasted really bad.

My beef flank was served cold, sad, old and chewy. The cold gravy came with the beef didn&#39;t help at all but only added a layer of fat on the meat. Then I wonder, why do I want to eat a plate of cold steak when it is twenty degrees outside? And why can&#39;t I taste anything from this meat? (God of trendy and fad food, if you can hear me, please shape the organic gluten free quinoa or kale into the answers. Amen.) 

My spring sprouts was the best dish out of all the sad orders, however it came with pre-mixed bacon so there is no vegetarian friendly customization option for this dish. 

Salad tasted like salad that you can buy from normal supermarket salad bar.  

Mashed potato tasted like the mashed potato that you can get from the high school cafeteria.

If rubber has taste, it will probably taste like the cold unflavored sesame tofu.  

I do like their concept of putting all the calories, proteins numbers on the menu. Overall, I think this place is more suit for people who likes bland and cold food."

Pros: 1) I like this place very much because it reminds me of Tender Greens. Easy ordering at the counter, then sit down and wait to pick up food. 2) The flatiron steak was delicious. The potatoes and steak were cooked nicely and the salad was well seasoned. 3) The infused water was wonderfully fruity and not too sweet, which I enjoyed. 4) I love how the receipts show nutritional information. I knew how many calories, grams of protein, carbs and fat was in the dish. 

Cons: 1) I asked for medium dressing (as in the amount to be tossed into it), but it was doused in dressing. I loved the salad very much despite this.

It was so delicious and convenient that I ended up eating dinner there twice during my stay.  The restaurant itself has a casual atmosphere, and all of the staff members there were incredibly friendly and helpful.  The menu is somewhat small, but it includes allergen/dietary information, which is a huge plus for someone with food allergies.  Whether dining in or carrying out, patrons order at the counter, wait for their food to be prepared, and pick up their order near the kitchen area.

On my first visit, I had the Chicken Breast Homestyle Plate with Rosemary Sweet Potato Mash and Ginger Maple Roasted Veggies.  The chicken was lightly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato mash had just a hint of rosemary that gave the mash an herbal upgrade.  The roasted veggies, which included carrots, beets, and sweet potatoes, were tender and delicious, and the combination of naturally sweet vegetables was straddled the line between side and dessert.  The second time I had dinner at Modern Market, I had the same meal but swapped ranch steak for the chicken breast.  Like the chicken, the steak was just lightly seasoned and naturally delicious.  The steak was a bit chewy near the outer areas though.  I deducted one star from the rating because my meals weren&#39;t hot when I received them.  I did ask for my meal to be reheated during my first visit, but even then, it came back just warm.

Be sure to get a cookie to go.  Modern Market&#39;s cookies are baked fresh daily.  Both the oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip varieties were soft, delicate, and dairy free."

Ordered the Tender Belly BLT+A with a water. It had fresh arugula, tomatoes, guacamole, and a good portion of crunchy bacon. It was delish!

The wait for food was around 6 min. which wasn&#39;t bad at all given the time of day and number of people. I enjoyed people watching on their patio which sits at the corner of 16th St Mall and Champa. They had plenty of seating indoors for larger groups to sit together but preferred to enjoy the weather and people watching outdoors."

Unfortunately the kitchen at Watercourse blew up. Or so we were told. That last minute change of plans sent us scrambling (hehe get it?) for other breakfast options.

When I think of brunch, tofu scramble is what comes to mind. So with that I searched the term on Yelp. Modmarket popped up several entries towards the bottom. It turns out they are a local chain that I had never heard of. I checked their menu online and sure enough they had a Veganizable scramble on the menu. 

After circling the block several times looking for parking, when we arrived at this downtown location, it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. It&#39;s an order at the counter Native Foods type experience. Not the relaxing sit down brunch I assumed it was. Nothing wrong with that as the price point was spot on.

It&#39;s a clean, sterile looking environment and the cashiers were nice. Once you place your order, they give you a buzzer to let you know when your tray is ready to be picked up. 

We both got the same thing as it was the only Vegan option. The Southwestern Tofu Scramble. We asked to substitute Daiya for the dairy cheese that normally comes on it. It arrived with slightly overdone taters and small sliced pieces of plain whole grain, earthy toast. The toast was actually really good.

The scramble was outstanding! I mean, I don&#39;t mean to brag but I make the best scramble I&#39;ve ever had and this was nearly as good. Perfectly cooked tofu that wasn&#39;t in huge chunks, nor eviscerated as you&#39;ll often get at many restaurants. It came topped with salsa and a scoop of guacamole. This was the real deal and the Daiya really added that extra zing to the already pleasant dish. 

The portion seemed small but in the end, we weren&#39;t really hungry until later in the evening while were were on our flight home so it must have been filling. Then again, we could&#39;ve been stuffed from that gigantic cock &#39;n balls that we had from Voodoo Doughnuts afterwards...  It may have seemed like not much food but they seem to be going for the semi-healthy angle here and it works. Of course I would love to see more Vegan options on the menu but I&#39;ll take what I can get!"

The chicken chili was loaded with huge pieces of chicken! Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch here, the portions were large enough for me to save half and eat it again later. I really with there were a 1/2 soup 1/2 sandwich option, that would have been the perfect size for a meal. The receipt also has nutrition information on it, for those that are keeping count."

The reviews for this place sounded great, so my daughter and I went for brunch. We arrived around 11:30am on a Sunday morning. I ordered a waffle and a fruit cup, my daughter a tofu plate. The posted menu didn&#39;t say anything about it, but the cashier told me that there were no more waffles that day. Really? Sunday brunch?

I asked how the eggs were prepared for the Rocket Egg sandwich. &#34;Scrambled.&#34; I ordered that. She said OK, then said &#34;and you wanted...sausage?&#34; &#34;No, a fruit cup.&#34; &#34;Oh. Do you still want it?&#34; Yes, I did still want it.

While waiting for our food, I got my coffee; it was very good. When our order was ready I looked at my sandwich; the egg didn&#39;t look right. I asked if it was scrambled. &#34;No, on the sandwiches the eggs are fried hard.&#34; Well, I don&#39;t like fried eggs. I explained that I had been told the eggs on the sandwiches were scrambled. &#34;Well, I guess she didn&#39;t know.&#34; Another worker chimes in &#34;no eggs to order after 10:30am.&#34; I didn&#39;t want eggs to order, I wanted the sandwich that had been described to me. &#34;Do you want something else? Or do you want us to remake this with scrambled eggs?&#34; I asked if the latter was possible. &#34;We can try.&#34; Really? How hard is it to make scrambled eggs?

Eventually I was given my remade sandwich. The egg was scrambled. The bread was toasted. There was tomato, and a big pile of very fresh arugula. But the promised basil aioli and the provolone were nowhere to be found. The sandwich was completely dry. By now I was too frustrated to complain anymore, so I ate some of it. At least the fruit salad was good, even if there was too much of the citrus juice it was tossed in to prevent browning.

My daughter&#39;s sesame tofu was good, and the side of mac and cheese she ordered was also good. But the &#34;roasted&#34; zucchini was vile. It had been tossed in some spice mix, but that had simply dried onto the outside as a gritty crust, without adding any flavor whatsoever to the overcooked squash. She will typically eat whatever is on her plate, but she couldn&#39;t stomach the zucchini.

Summary: Bad food, truly awful service. We won&#39;t be back."

The food did take a while to come out.  On one side, at least I know everything is made fresh to order.  But maybe they can look into improving the efficiency at their kitchen.  Hopefully that will help with the food temperature situation.

2. healthy clean salads 
3. fast and affordable

I think in terms of stand in-line food, it&#39;s the best next to Chipotle, where I also know they care about the food quality (Chipotle now has non GMO). Mad Greens does not compare at all. The one in DTC was dirty actually."

As a vegetarian, I ordered the spiced tofu as the protein instead of chicken. The peanut mango dressing was so good and made for a tasty salad! 
Stopped in the next morning for breakfast and ordered the Market Scramble which had broccoli, caramelised onion, and white cheddar; had a side of roasted potatoes as well.

Don&#39;t get salad at a sports bar or don&#39;t order a hamburger at an Indian restaurant (my friend did that - no joke). Maybe this isn&#39;t the place to get Americanized Chinese food. Order something authentic and you will not be sorry! 

After our favorite Schezwan restaurant closed we have been trying to fill the void with no luck. Decided to give this little joint a try and it was well worth it! Upon walking in we noticed we were nearly the only white people there - I take that as a good sign for any ethnic restaurant! The place is tiny with maybe a dozen tables so we had a short 15 minute wait for a Friday night. That&#39;s ok! Gave us time to study the enormous menu. 

We went with the exact dishes we had been missing from our old favorite spot. Twice cooked pork belly &amp; boiled beef in chili oil. Perfection! So happy to have found a place to order these dishes at again. We ordered the kids their staples of steamed dumplings and wonton soup. They were nothing to rave about but refer back to my comment on knowing how to order. We decided to try the scallion pancakes appetizer at the recommendation of our server and they were fantastic! When in doubt ask your server! Thai tea boba was very good. I only wish we had room to try dessert as they sounded great too. 

Service was on point. Friendly and happy to answer all of my questions about the dishes on the menu I had never heard of. They were patient with our two small children as well. We could not have been more pleased. Disregard the negative reviews about bad General Tao&#39;s delivery! This place deserves to be successful. Dine in for fresh delicious authentic Chinese food. Don&#39;t be afraid to branch out and try something new!"

We are often in the hunt for a good Chinese place, and Hong Kong fits the bill.  Great lunch menu. Awesome food - and great service


We normally start with the hot and sour soup.  Perfect sourness and goodness, especially on a chilly day.  Like all good  Chinese place they give you those fried noodles to dump inside along with a good amount of hot tea.

I have tried a variety of dishes from Sesame fried chicken (perfect crispy and moist inside) to noodle dishes to the standard beef and broccoli.

You can&#39;t beat the lunch special - so come over here some time if you  work/live anywhere near Parker and I225.

It reminded me of a little Thai restaurant I fell in love with in L.A. so I had to try it!
I will never be able to enjoy Sesame Chicken again without dreaming of this delicious dish at HKC! And the Singapore Noodles (swoon) and Fried Shrimp Toast were OVER-THE-TOP!
Eat here! The dining room is small, but you can get it to go if the place is full!

Since Hong Kong was of course a former British possession, it should come as no surprise that their drink menu includes malted beverages such as Horlicks and Ovaltine (available hot or cold) - and luckily, I like both! Another interesting libation is the Tropical Ice which can best be summarized as &#34;fruit cocktail in a glass with 7-Up&#34; but tastes so much better than you might think from that description. On the more snack-y side, I&#39;ve become a fan of their buns stuffed with either a tender pork chop (very popular in neighboring Macau), a moist fish cutlet (think a classier Filet-O-Fish) or beef in chile-kissed Sate sauce. And even the more &#34;ABC&#34; starters like cheese wontons and shrimp toasts are excellent here.

Main dishes? Oh yes, how could I forget? The chicken, salted fish and eggplant hot pot may sound a bit daunting at first, but fear not! The admittedly, um, vocal flavors mesh together very well and create a harmonious whole. Another recent discovery for me is the Hong Kong-style egg fu yung which is presented very simply and elegantly over rice and is a far cry from the gravy-drenched orbs you usually find in Chinese eateries. But then there&#39;s also the sizzling plate (with your choice of protein, veggies, French fries and a fried egg - did I cover all the food groups with that one?) or fish with tangy pickled cabbage, or - well, you get it - there&#39;s a lot to try, so get going!"

Times are a changing and no longer do I need to browse Yelp for 20 hours looking for my go to Chinese.  
This is it.  Not overpriced, delicious and a huge menu.  Everything we had was delicious.  We kinda went overboard on the ordering for two... But it was just as good the day after!  
I recommend all of their appetizers, the wonton soup is great!  There&#39;s actual filling in the wonton and they give you crispy noodles, free of charge.  Entrees were delicious and not over cooked.
I can not wait to try their duck!  
Really fast delivery and online ordering... You can tip online as well which is nice... In case you don&#39;t have cash.

I&#39;m glad I tried something different but I wouldn&#39;t say this will be my new go-to. Some things were really good while others fell very flat. 

The crab cheese wontons were a winner. Definitely a good crab flavor (not chunks of crab inside but not just basic cream cheese that&#39;s calling itself crab) and still crispy even after being delivered. The steamed dumplings were tasty as well. There wasn&#39;t a ton of filling in each one, but I still somehow managed to devour them all.

I also decided to try the noodles with beef brisket in black bean sauce. Based on other reviews, it seems to be hit or miss as far as fattiness of the brisket. I would say about 30% of the pieces of brisket had large fat chunks on them. I tried to shred up the brisket and remove the fat before I ate it, but a few pieces slipped by me. The flat rice noodles were a little mushy but the black bean sauce was good.

The shining star of the order was the shrimp wonton soup. The broth was flavorful on it&#39;s own and the shrimp wontons were jam packed with tasty shrimp goodness.

Something that really surprised me were the vegetable egg rolls. They had absolutely no flavor. I love egg rolls. I&#39;ve been known to order just egg rolls and nothing else. But these? Bleh. The only vegetable I saw inside was one shred of a carrot. Maybe if you get them with pork or shrimp they would be better. 

My estimated delivery time was 45 min-1 hour and it was delivered in just under an hour. The delivery driver called me when he got to my apartment building and he was really nice even after having to wait for a minute in the snow.

Overall, I&#39;d be willing to try it again but I keep coming back to the egg rolls. The precious, crispy little things I normally love with every one of my taste buds. I could never frequent an establishment that claims to be a Chinese restaurant when I know they have lackluster egg rolls."

1. It was delivery, but I have never received food where the containers were covered with droplets of water. The rice container was mush too. (What the heck!?) 
2. The General Tao&#39;s chicken had no flavor and was inedible for me. I took three bites and threw the rest away (and I&#39;m starving now). There was ZERO sauce and the chicken was super dry and if had a burnt fried taste. SMHFML. No dinner for ME! Btw -I ordered extra chicken and the portion was huge. It is cheap but it&#39;s not so cheap when it goes in the garbage. 
3. Steamed dumplings 4.95: I never saw 8 dumplings offered per order so I was skeptical and fuck. They 100% buy them at Costco or Walmart. (Actually, I think I&#39;ve had better ones from Costco.) The dumpling had no/bad flavor, the wonton was thinner than normal and the ends were dried with very little filling. Some were falling apart. 
Best part of the meal?!? The mustard is pretty damn spicy. I love that. I&#39;m baffled how this place has so many good reviews with so many stars. I don&#39;t get it, was it an off day?!"

Congrats, you&#39;re one of my favorite restaurants in Colorado. 

To be completely honest with you, finding decent Asian restaurants has been a bit of a struggle out here. This is such a first world problem, but it&#39;s been a struggle not being surrounded with amazing Asian eats like back in California. So discovering a place like Hong Kong Cafe that actually serves up eats that are better than those in California is like heaven itself shining a light down directly on a tiny little shop in a beat down strip mall in Aurora. Like, wow this is actually happening.

Every single dish here I&#39;ve been a fan of. They haven&#39;t gotten a single thing wrong here. My favorite though has to be their chow mein. Their chow mein isn&#39;t like that normal stuff you get at the usual Chinese restaurant. They serve it up here with crispy noodles. It adds such a great texture to an already amazing tasting dish. This kinda blew my mind when trying it out for the first time. Have I been eating chow mein the wrong way my entire life? What is life?

Their milk tea is to die for though. Can I just install a pipe that leads from my house to their restaurant so I can get their milk tea on tap at any and all times of day? It is that good. Hong Kong style milk tea is generally more bittersweet than your normal milk tea. It has a very distinct taste. And Hong Kong Cafe really does it right. 

When I eventually move from Colorado, this is gonna be the restaurant I&#39;m gonna miss most. It&#39;s so weird to say that about this hole in the wall shop out in the middle of nowhere seemingly, but those kind of places always seem to be the best kind eh? So thank you Hong Kong Cafe, you&#39;ve truly been a beacon to me in my Asian food adventures."

What we had: 

Salt &amp; Pepper Chicken Wings (extra spicy)- Yum!  The crispness and flavor of the breading on the chicken wings is addictive and that pepper relish (only comparison I can think of) is so good we want to eat it on everything.

Singapore Rice Noodles- I was expecting a bit thicker noodle but I&#39;m glad they were as thin as the were.  They soaked up all the awesome sauce. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. 

Szechuan Chicken - I ate several of the baby corn cobs from my husband&#39;s plate.  Heard no complaints about the flavor from him or really anything bad about it.  He was happy with the extra spicy he got on it because he didn&#39;t have to add extra hot sauce!

Great news: They are open until 10pm on Saturdays (I get home at a little after 9) so we still have time to order after I get home from work.

Better news: This place has a huge menu and so many things that we can&#39;t wait to try in the future.

I love the Hong Kong Cafe and Kathy, was very sweet and made the experience wonderful. We ordered an appetizer of Sesame Balls (Careful, they&#39;re hot!) that were sweet and chewy with a dessert taste into it. The menu was so long that I had a hard time deciding what to get. They have everything from Udon noodles, Teriyaki Shrimp, to sweet vanilla dessert goodness. We had decided to get an egg drop soup for my sister, sesame shrimp, and two lemonades. 

The lemonade was amazing but a little sweet in one end and sour at the next, but overall good. I loved the sesame shrimp and it came with steamed white rice (you can choose between steamed and fried rice.) and uncooked broccoli. The service was amazing and Kathy was generous the entire time. She was taking care of 5 tables by herself and that&#39;s impressive. The dessert was a chocolate milkshake with white whipped cream on top and my little sister loved it! 

The after taste was pretty intense, I did feel pretty bloated after eating the sesame shrimp but I would most definitely come back just to chill. Everyone was so friendly and you can tell Kathy really does care and appreciate her customers!"

We couldn&#39;t help but were all jealous comparing our plate sizes to those at the table over. Curious at the same time what they ordered because it was pretty obvious we&#39;re Cantonese and they&#39;re not, lol. 

There are a lot of fried foods on the menu and I can see that being an appeal to the business. We only ordered one deep fried item and that&#39;s the Shrimp Toasts appetizer. It was definitely over-fried or re-fried in old oil - did not taste very fresh!

The rest of our orders included Beef Brisket noodle soup, Baked Tomato Rice with Pork Cutlet, and the HK Ice Milk Tea were all just fine. Actually, it&#39;s easy to make all of these at home. This is HK&#39;s version of fast food, I guess. For that reaon, Hong Kong Café does a good job sticking to the mission.

The hostess/waitress is very nice and friendly. Also very attentive and made sure our food cane out right. Upon ordering the brisket noodle soup, she asked if we wanted to add wontons. Didn&#39;t know that was an option to do half and half order.

Baked pork chop spaghetti with tomato sauce

Colorado generally has decent Vietnamese and Korean food but I&#39;ve only ran into a handful of good Chinese restaurants and most of them are dim sum or Szechuan. Therefore, I was soooo excited to see the grand opening of Hong Kong Cafe on Yelp. I immediately bookmarked it.

I finally had the chance of trying this place out with my friend today for lunch. When we arrived, there were only 2 other parties but soon after, the entire place filled up and there were alot of people getting take out as well. The owners were very friendly and were able to speak Mandarin which is rare in Colorado. I ordered the Hong Kong Milk Tea which definitely has a unique taste that is very different from your usual Taiwanese milk teas. It&#39;s almost like an acquired taste at first but I absolutely loved it here. I got it iced and it was a very decently huge portion. My friend and I shared the flat noodle with brisket and black bean sauce, the fried tofu, and the black pepper and salt chicken wings. The total came out to ~$40 but we had a lot of left overs and were very satisfied.

The noodles were perfectly seasoned, had just the right amount of sauce. It could have been spicier tho. The meat might look weird at least and kind of life tofu but they were so tender. The tofu was delicious! They were perfectly square, cripsy on the outside and delicate on the inside. I have no idea how they cooked it. I also loved how they sauteed it in hot red and green peppers which were delicious. It was supposed to come with either steamed rice or fried rice but they forgot to give it to us. It was fine bcuz we were stuffed by the end. The chicken wings were so cripsy and delicious as well! 

The service was great and they call everyone hun or honey and really try to get to know their customers. They&#39;re going to have great buisness because nowhere else in colorado can compete with their type of food. Finally an authentic Chinese place here and I am so happy!!!1"

Within minutes of being seated we were treated to incredible hospitality combined with course after course of amazing food. The scallion pancakes are the best I&#39;ve ever eaten. We also had a spicy Szechuan fried chicken dish that I was assured a version of was on the regular menu. Thank goodness because the mouth numbing quality combined with the heat and crispy chicken was addictive and by far my favorite dish. 

Definitely give this place a try and you will not be disappointed."

This restaurant was recommended by a friend, and so I wanted to have a good time eating here with them. Unfortunately, for honesty sake I can&#39;t give this place anything more than three stars.

The three dishes I had tasted artificial. The dishes felt as if they were processed dishes, as if I had ordered dinners from a grocery store. The boba drink was no better; the tapioca balls tasted as if they were old.

On the plus side, the service was very attentive, kind, and respectful. I will likely return in the future to update this review if my opinion should change of anything."

+ Shrimp Toast - deep fried shrimp on bread slice - Must try!
+ Pork sandwich - more like sliders with a pinch of oriental wam bam thank you mam
+ Beef hot pot - any of them will satisfy your hungry - especially in the cold weather. 
+ Salty Fish Chicken Fried Rice - whoaaaa party in my mouth. 
+ Salt Pepper squid - yummmm one of two spots in town that do it right! Crispy with plenty of spices, pepper and onions... guarantee to ruin your breath!

There are tons of items on their menu, dont be afraid of asking the nice ladies for recommendation. The small restaurant can be over crowded, so I would recommend call ahead or order a take out. 

I shall be back!"

This place is no exception.  I wanted to find something that was close to Taiwanese food.  Difficult to explain if you have never eaten at a Taiwanese restaurant but here is a quick run down.  Clean presentation with robust hidden flavors.  I ordered the noodle soup with beef brisket today at lunch.  This is probably one of the best bowls I have had to date.  A little chili oil to boost the spicy factor and I was on cruise control.  After my meal, I ordered a Thai iced tea to go.  A bit on the sweet side but I&#39;m definitely going to try something else next time.  My tab came out to $15 for the beef noodle soup bowl and the Thai iced tea with boba.  For the authenticity factor and the flavor, you gotta try this place.  They speak both Cantonese and Mandarin so that&#39;s awesome.  Don&#39;t worry, of course they speak English too.  This is a small cafe with limited seating.  Lunch gets full so arrive early or come late.  They do have a lunch menu and some of the dishes were Americanized Asian cuisine so they appeal to many other tastebuds.  Highly recommended.  Service is excellent and food speaks for itself.

We ordered the beef curry, which is ok... and the pork chop baked rice with spaghetti sauce, which was bomb! Hong Kong with a western flair! 

We also ordered the red bean ice drink with ice cream. They forgot the ice cream at first and when I was done with the drink, I saw another table get theirs with an ice cream scoop on top. I asked them why mine was missing and they quickly took my drink back to fix it. So unfortunately, my photo doesn&#39;t show the ice cream but you can picture that vanilla goodness on top!"

I odered online for delivery (Grubhub). It was our 1st time trying them. I ordered the vegetable egg rolls (mushy inside), pork egg rolls (mushy inside with an odd flavor - yuck), regular lo mein (tasteless), crab cheese wontons  (weird filling flavor, also kinda runny), sesame chicken (not that good at all), chicken and black bean (eh, just alright), and fried rice (no veggies in it. Tasted like cardboard).

The delivery guy came pretty quickly. But, when I was signing the credit card receipt, he felt the need to tell me I had opted for the cash tip option. Really? Little ballsy, if you ask me.

Two dishes: NOODLE SOUPS &amp; HK FRENCH TOAST! Affordable and delicious! It&#39;s really hard to find an authentic Hong Kong style restaurant in Denver, so this restaurant is one of a kind. They serve succulent noodle soups, milks teas, and many more dishes with a western twist.

Noodle Soups - I&#39;ve tried the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup with Egg Noodles as well as the Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup. Both are great, but I prefer the wontons because it&#39;s less fatty. The brisket is super tender though, but has too much fat for me at times.

Salt &amp; Pepper Wings - So good! The wings are crispy and the salt and pepper gives it a nice kick. Very addicting, and it&#39;s only $6.95 for 8 pieces!

Hong Kong Style French Toast - My guilty pleasure for only $2! Fried french toast with peanut butter spread and condensed milk. It&#39;s pretty sweet, but to die for! I&#39;m gonna just let me picture do the teasing."

The menu is quite large and the food is much better than your average Chinese grab and go restaurant.  I didn&#39;t know what I wanted when I ordered, so the waitress asked what I was in the mood for.  I told her I wanted some sort of seafood dish.  She asked if I wanted sweet or savory, and then told me what she could make, and I agreed to something that I don&#39;t think is on the menu.  Well, she nailed it.  It was perfectly cooked seafood and vegetables in a white wine sauce.  I was also surprised that their food is not overly salted, as I have had on many occasions at other Chinese restaurants.  I also had that with the jalapeno crab cheese wontons.  They too were wonderful.  I may have found a new favorite Chinese restaurant in DTC."

I tried the pepper tofu, crispy noodles with beef, triple meat stew (beef, fish and tripe), black bean flat noodle with tender beef, walnut shrimp, grass jelly milk tea, beef chow fun, green onion pancake, bone in spare ribs (or was it chicken. I don&#39;t even know). I liked the tofu and pancake the best. I also liked the spare ribs or chicken despite not knowing what meat it was (I had friends order for me). The beef for the crunchy noodles was super tender. Milk shakes and slushies are expensive! They range from almost $4 to almost $5. The milk tea was ok. I didn&#39;t care for the small cubes of grass jelly because I could barely taste it. I like the large chunks more. They have lots of classic Hong Kong and Chinese dishes as well as modern ones like baked Chinese spaghetti and toasty sandwiches. This place reminds me a lot of Davis Old Teahouse back in Northern California, a HK boba and food spot I used to frequent with a similar menu. The shop only has a few tables and I don&#39;t think they take reservations. The place is super casual but don&#39;t think that they don&#39;t take reservations! Because they indeed do!!!

Having spent a year studying in Hong Kong, I was excited to hear this place had opened up in Colorado. The food brings back the nostalgia that I can&#39;t quite seem to find at other Chinese places. I had the opportunity to try their salted fish fried rice, baked pork chop, scallion pancakes, HK french toast, and milk tea.

Salted fish fried rice: grew up eating this prototypical fried rice dish alongside the very traditional yang chow fried rice. This was well made and most definitley hit the spot. New comers to this dish, I would be wary. As it a unique smell and somewhat of an acquired taste. Though if you want traditional, you should try this. I say you get honorary badge for culture and taste.

Baked pork chop: now this dish is seen in many &#34;Denny&#39;s&#34; of HK. Such as Cafe de Coral, or MK. Very great starter dish of more mainstream modern HK foods. Has a bed of lightly fried rice layered with a pork chop noticeably flavored with Maggi baked in to a  sweet and savory tomato ketchup like sauce. Onions and tomato chunks are a fine addition with a bit of cheese to top it off. Well made and would recommend. 

Scallion pancakes: I would prefer more green onion. The batch I had may have been a tad too oily. However, they were far from dry as many places can make them inappropriately. Nice and thin as they should be. Well layered and flaky unlike some more doughy ones I&#39;ve had at other places. Not too salty, and well balanced. Minor tweaks can be made, but definitley worth as a side/appetizer/snack.

HK french toast: If you have room, I would save it for this at least once. This is pretty darn authentic. Uniquely battered thick slices of bread with peanut butter in the middle topped of with a combination of condensed milk and honey/syrup drizzle. When you bite into it, I hope you can appreciate the simple yet complex flavors if you&#39;ve never had such a dish. Leaving out the cinnamon/sugar out from a traditional french toast, you receive a more light cake like fry to your toast, and still retain all the sugar from the syrup combo. Enjoy!

HK Milk tea: love it or hate it. It may be strong at first, but that&#39;s the point. Well made. A must for any meal. 


Looking forward to try some other dishes from the menu, and hoping they have Dong Ling Mut (cold lemon honey tea) next time I go.

Happy eats!"

CALL AHEAD, or use grubhub. You&#39;ve been warned. :)

I went back to pick up some milk tea and vegetable egg rolls today, and my sister wanted some chicken wings too, so we ordered that as well. We didn&#39;t call ahead and ordered when we got there, and the food took 20-25 minutes to come out!! I was extremely upset because all we ordered were three dinky vegetable egg rolls, some chicken wings, and milk tea. There were two parties that came to dine-in after us and they both got their appetizers before us ... What? The milk teas took around 15 minutes to come out, which was also confusing. I would be even more upset if the dinky vegetable egg rolls weren&#39;t so delicious!! The wrapping was really light and crispy, and the filling was hot and flavorful. The milk tea was additionally tasty. It had a really bold black tea flavor and was not too sweet. I think my sister liked her salt and pepper chicken wings. Though, the wings didn&#39;t look like they were cooked all the way inside. Kind of creepy.

I still like this place, though, because their food is incredible. They just need to learn how to prioritize. IMHO. (Am I hip for using an acronym?)"

But I decided to wanted to try since there&#39;s not much Hong Kong type of cafes in Colorado. Since I was in the area why not right?The Restuarant is located in a small plaza next to a few other shops. 

It is a pretty small Resturant maybe with about 8 tables. The decor is pretty nice and simple, gives a very fresh and relaxing feel to it. The walls are a lavender color. It kind of reminded me of Chinese  cafes in LA. 

We ordered the Hong Kong style milk tea, fried calamari, wonton noodle soup, and the beef brisket noodle soup. The Milk tea was okay, definitely not the best I&#39;ve had maybe because I&#39;m comparing it to LA quality. The fried calamari was average, it came with a spicy mayo sauce which is a good combination. Wonton noodles was actually pretty good. The wontons was a shrimp filling and it was really good! I think the noodles wasn&#39;t that great, if only they would put fresh egg noodles in it, it would be amazing!! Same thing with the beef brisket noodle soup, the dish would be better with fresh noodles. Beef brisket was on point, it just melts in your mouth. 

Overall I give it a 4 star because this is the closest thus far to LA quality Chinese food in Colorado. I guess this place will do for now until Denver slowly gets more and more diverse in the food market! I would come back!"

My HK wife enjoyed the food too -- she got a noodle dish. My 5 year old daughter got noodle soup and she killed it. 

The toast was unbelievable! Soooo good. Great as a starter but would work well for a dessert. There&#39;s peanut butter inside and maybe topped with honey....get it!!

They way it&#39;s set up there are no lists of add on items such as vegetables or tofu but you can request them and they will update the charge on your card with a random amount. 

The food is much better during the week. It seems more fresh. I don&#39;t know if this has to do with who is preparing it during the week or how many stops are made during delivery on weekends but it&#39;s a significant difference in quality and taste. 

The salt and pepper anything is good, hot and sour soup (my favorite) is hit or miss. It seems to be better the spicier you order it. It&#39;s been sweet and syrupy a few times. They left out the rice and cabbage or green something that normally goes under the tofu this evening which is unusual.

I just so happened to drive by this place on my way to the Mexican bakery in the same strip mall. Attracted by its name &#34;Hong Kong Cafe&#34;, I slammed on my brakes so hard my bf almost got whiplash. We already had dinner but I just had to go in and grab a menu. I was oohing and ahhing when I was reading through the menu, and squealed with excitement when I saw baked pork chop rice on it. Wasting no time, we met up with two friends for dinner the next day. 

There were so many things we wanted to have but I just had to do the baked pork chop rice with red sauce. My bf ordered baked seafood rice with white sauce. One friend also ordered the pork chop rice while the other had beef noodle soup. We also had chicken wings as appetizer. For drinks, we had Hong Kong style milk tea and milk tea + coffee. 

Now let me warn you, if you&#39;ve never had Hong Kong cafe style food, it&#39;s a little different than other Chinese food you&#39;ve had.  Yes they have sesame chicken on the menu, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s good too, but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re here. Hong Kong cafe food is a little bit of a mix between Chinese and western (fusion, if we&#39;re getting fancy here). The red sauce that comes with the pork chop rice isn&#39;t exactly a marinara sauce. It&#39;s a little sweater and thicker, with cheese on top and onion mixed in. The milk tea doesn&#39;t come with sugar; it&#39;s a little more bitter than your normal tea, and you&#39;d add sugar to the sweetness of your liking. The white sauce is not exactly cream sauce you&#39;ll have at an Italian place either. But I promise you, everything is tasting as they&#39;re supposed to. They&#39;re so good, all 4 of us went back the next day for lunch.

You heard me right.... in less than 18 hours, we were there twice. This time, we tried the fried tofu as appetizer (crunchy on the outside with a yummy soy base sauce on the side), udon with black pepper sauce (amazing), the seafood tofu soup (so yummy), and baked chicken rice with garlic sauce (can anything be too garlicky? I think not!). In addition to the milk teas, we ended the meal with some delicious red bean ice cream drink dessert. Seeing a trend here? Everything here is awesome, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong ordering anything. Their prices are more than reasonable and portions are great. Pork chop rice was about $11 and you&#39;ll really have to work at it to finish it in one seating. It actually lasted for 3 meals for me.

Besides from the friendly service from our waiter, the owners also came out and chatted with us. He was super nice and friendly, explaining to us his process behind some of his food. There&#39;s the quick way of making food, and then there&#39;s the right way. They&#39;re definitely doing this right. If you want authentic Hong Kong cafe style food, look no further, they got it right here! Actually, if that&#39;s not what you&#39;re looking for, you still need to go and give them a try... you&#39;ll love it!"

Lavender painted walls, with a few floral paintings, and some oddly motivational posters you&#39;d find at an office or classroom.  Though I&#39;ve only been here a couple of occasions I&#39;m excited and eager to try other items in their comprehensive smorgasbord of a menu.  I mean where else can you find instant ramen noodles from the packet in the menu or some comfort food such as spam and rice.  The sizzling udon was good albeit a little bit salty the second time I came.  Salt and pepper wings were good.  But what I would highly recommend is the beef brisket and tendon curry.  Now that was amazingly good and tender!  Don&#39;t forget to wash everything down with some honey jasmine iced tea.  It&#39;s almost reminiscent of Hong Kong Deli minus the drunk belligerent patrons or shootings.  The service here is impeccable!  It&#39;s a rarity because many if not all Chinese restaurants tend to lack customer service.  It&#39;s the little things they do like your napkins and water are constantly replenished like clockwork.  Also they&#39;ll even take your food and pack it to take home if you can&#39;t finish.  She even took my wooden chopsticks out from the packet and rubbed them together herself before handing them to me."

Fresh veggies, tender chicken cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce with the perfect hit of spice. We kept looking at the menu oohing and ahh-ing at the delicious things we will try next time. I was asking the waitress about some their specials and she was super nice and informative. The scoop on the milk tea is that it&#39;s shipped in special from Hong Kong. Their peanut butter toast (that yelpers seem to be having about..!) sounds amazing! Breakfast spam and egg sandwich... YES PLEASE!?!

First off, I like this style of Chinese because it just feels &#34;cleaner&#34; and less greasy than the oh-so-good-in-its-own-way American Chinese takeout. There&#39;s a better quality and detail put into everything made here.
With that said, here&#39;s my review. 
I&#39;ve had the thai tea, and hong kong tea for drinks, as well as Vietnamese iced coffee. 
Thai tea is 5/5. 
Wasn&#39;t too big a fan of the hong kong tea but I&#39;m not a typical yelp snob who will diss a restaurant by giving them less stars because my taste wasn&#39;t with something. 
The Vietnamese iced coffee was very good.
For food, the egg sandwiches are done phenomenally. Best one in Denver I&#39;ve found so far. 
The cashew chicken is 5/5.
The hong kong French toast is 6 out of 5. 
I think if you like authentic Asian food with  more diversity and variety, and better quality than 99% of other Chinese  out there, then you should go here and eat. 
(Also had this spicy boiled fish dish and omg it is probably the best Chinese dish I ever had. I wish I could remember the name of it)"

hong-kong-cafe-denver-2,Jamie C.,MvxwEr1NIo2ngZXVDyQpWg,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,439,4,zqIchmZOq-TZG3tKhwPfSQ,5.0,2015-10-26,"The only restaurants of it&#39;s kind in Colorado. This restaurant is based on cafes found everywhere in the greater China, especially Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong. These places are called Cha Chaan Teng, literally tea restaurant. Here you can find, quick, cheap food, awesome drinks and a western twist. You know they are legit when everyone who works there speaks Cantonese. ;)

To start, it is very popular to order Hong Kong style milk tea. I never thought I&#39;d see this anywhere near where I live for a while but bam, of course they have it here! It&#39;s known for it&#39;s very strong tea flavor and when mixed with condensed milk, makes a creamy, smooth and aromatic drink. This can be served hot or cold.

To take it to the next level, you can order something called a Yuan Yuang and that&#39;s a mix of coffee and tea. You will need to sweeten this on your own. I found it best with condensed milk.

On a hot summer, the drink of choice is simply lemon with water. It&#39;s called Ling Mut, Ling stands for the LingMong (Lemon) and Mut standing for Honey. This is usually served cold but can also be served hot.

Now onto the food, some must haves for the first time:
-Wonton Noodle Soup. They do an awesome job here and if you want to reach the next step of really experiencing the culture, get the egg noodles as lo mein in oyster sauce. This is a unique and fun way to eat it. 
-Beef Brisket Noodle soup with Ho fun. The beef brisket is sooooo tender and maybe I&#39;m just biased to the whole soup and noodle thing but we live in Colorado! It&#39;s a must!
-Gon chaau ngau ho, which translates to Stir Fried Beef Flat Rice Noodles or Beef Chow Fun is an all time stir fry noodle favorite. You can actually get this at all the traditional Chinese restaurants like Hong Kong BBQ, New Canton BBQ, Star Kitchen, etc.
-Baked Rice/Spaghetti. Here&#39;s where the western twist comes in. There are lots of different sauces and different meats you can get with it too. This makes me think about my childhood. I love the black pepper sauce, but fair warning, it&#39;s really peppery. I&#39;d start with something simple like the tomato sauce and maybe pork chops.
-TOASTTTTTTTTTTTT. This is a must must must must try! There&#39;s a list of variations, I&#39;d start with the one with peanut butter, that&#39;s the standard or just simply toast and butter with condensed milk.

Also, you&#39;ll notice that on the menu, they have HK style sandwiches and Instant Ramen for a really cheap price. These are very traditional cafe foods. The HK style sandwiches are mirrored after Western breakfasts, usually consisting of eggs and ham or whatever Western meat they have cooking. Also the instant ramen is not cooked the way packages say, it usually includes some sort of meat, ham or spam or something and eggs. A very homey way and the only way I make my ramen. 

Enjoy! I know I&#39;ll be back and hopefully I&#39;ll be lucky and miss the rush."

This scares me because the menu items remain the same. This makes me think that they could 
(a  keep on being shut down by health dept then reopening under a new name
(b Simply some type of tax scam going on

It could be anything but I just don&#39;t feel very settled with the constant name changes, very suspicious! I&#39;ll skip on this place here on out and trust my intuition."

When I walked in, I was a little surprised at how small the restaurant is - maybe 8-10 tables.  And the walls are painted lavender (or was it pink?)!  I had read some of the other reviews and looked at the photos for this place before arriving and was glad I did.  The menu isn&#39;t terribly descriptive, so if you&#39;re unfamiliar with this style of food you might need to quiz your server.  Anyway, I was in the mood for soup, so I went with Beef Brisket Noodle Soup (with egg noodles).  Yummy!  When the bowl was placed in front of me, my first thought was that it looked kinda small.  I guess I was thinking about some of the humongous bowls of pho I&#39;ve had in the past!  As I started eating, I realized that what I received was a very substantial amount of soup.  The broth was flavorful.  The brisket was tasty and with just enough fat.  And those egg noodles were fabulous with a great chewy bite to them.  This soup is served with a spoon filled with toasted garlic to mix into the broth.  My only critique was that it was a little too much garlic for me (and I LOVE garlic) and I dumped it all in.   I wasn&#39;t given a plate or small bowl to use for any excess, but next time I&#39;ll ask for one so I can add the garlic gradually.

Service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was clean and the tables were kept bussed.  I&#39;m not a fan of the pink walls, but whatever.  I did find it interesting to see that I was the only non-Asian eating here that day.  I think that says something positive for the food.  I definitely will be back.  I want to try more of the menu!"

Kathy at the front kindly explained that the kitchen had gotten busy, and our order wasn&#39;t ready yet - she offered to throw in cookies and bring our order out when it was ready. After waiting a while, Kathy came out and apologized again - another customer had picked up our order! Oops. We understand that things happen, and we weren&#39;t in a hurry, so we waited a bit longer. When she brought our order out, we could not believe the amount of extra food that had been included as an apology (also, Kathy apologized personally, and we were impressed by her professionalism - she went above and beyond to correct the mistake). The vegetable udon was pretty good, and the orange tofu was pleasantly sweet and orange-y. My husband liked the tofu egg drop soup quite a lot, and we both enjoyed the almond cookies. The tofu fried rice is full of delicious tofu, and was nicely seasoned. We will definitely be back."

Refills, check backs, speed, you name it, she took amazing care of us.  Second, the food was delicious, and the portions were generous on our entrees.  I don&#39;t know how to describe this well, but the breading/coating they used for the egg rolls and orange chicken was crisp and flaky.  Like it crackled in your mouth, unlike the more chewy texture you sometimes get at other places.  We loved it.  As others said, their preparation was considerably less greasy or oily than other asian restaurants, and we really appreciated that too.  It was a great experience, and we can recommend it."

Hong Kong Cafe has one of the most unique menus I have ever seen from a Chinese delivery  restaurant.  When I talked with one of the employees about the interesting menu, her response was that they where doing authentic Hong Kong dishes.  It may be odd to see an egg sandwich or a milk shake on a menu but they are quite good actually.  The Milkshakes are a little different then what we consider a milkshake but they are still pretty good.

Everything I have tried so far has been fairly good and consistent.  
Sesame Chicken 4/5 (only one place gets a 5 in denver) 
Walnut Shrimp 5/5 (ZOMG SO GOOD)  

Fried rice is average 
Hong Kong style Spring Rolls (thinner wrapping)

If a person is looking for soups, salads, sandwiches, desserts, soft drinks and can&#39;t find it here then he/she isn&#39;t looking very close. Meat, veggies, vegan are all available and the best part is that it tastes homemade.  But don&#39;t think this is a fast food joint. It took about 15 minutes which is cool.
Now for the constructive criticism. My wife ordered the New York Reuben.  It came out COLD! As a side order I wanted MAC and cheese -- COLD. Kind of hard to enjoy a meal with my wife if we have to wait for her &#34;second&#34; order. MAYBE the way they prepare their Reuben&#39;s the meat is supposed to be cold.  BUT once we got it zapped it was ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!! Same with the mac and cheese! Once they got it hot it WAS GREAT TASTING!!

My issue stems from the customer service. If I had time during my lunch break, I would drive across town the location off of Mississippi to get food. I continue to come to this location because of the convince. 

My order is almost always incorrect, and I&#39;ve begun checking every single time before I leave. When I mention that my order is incorrect, the guy in the back acts like its a burden to fix the issue (that he messed up to begin with). I order over the phone, in advance, that way my food is ready for pickup when my lunch break starts, and about 50% of the time, my order hasn&#39;t even been processed or started when I get there. 

The &#34;waitress&#34; girls seem more interested in talking to each other than actually doing their job. The only good thing about this location, is the manager. He is always very polite and prompt. I question his leadership style though, since the rest of the employees are absolute trash.

I would love to not support this location at all, but like i said.... The food is really good when your order is correct."

I got the grilled cheese and some potato salad. The grilled cheese was good but definitely lacking on the filling.

Based on TAKE OUT. Late Dinner Sunday October 21st 2012.  Time : 21:18hrs.  The person who took our order was Grecia S.

Ordered these items :

*  Kids Mac &amp; Cheese ($3.49)
*  Chocolate Lovin&#39; SpoonCake ($3.69)
*  Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller ($6.99)
*  Large Coke ($2.10)

Total cost for Late Dinner with tax was $17.67.

The Kids Mac &amp; Cheese comes with Applesauce and Diet Pepper Drink and a snack.

Hubs opt for the Spicy Southwest Chicken Griller without the Guacomole.  His order comes with a Pickle and Potato Salad.  I managed to get a bite from Hubs order.  I like what I ate.

The Chocolate Spoon Cake is a standard chocolate cake.  Not too sweet for our taste bud.  All in all, another A-OKAY take out dinner order.

This place is awesome. You can see from my reviews that I was introduced to one of these in Missouri over the summer, and I was way stoked to find out just today that we had one in town!

This place gives you amazing sandwiches, soups, and salads with a touch of southern exposure. You can have sweet tea or any number of drinks, and they all come in oversized cups that are great to not have to refill.

Today I had the grilled chicken club that comes along with smoked bacon, honey mustard, and the other standard sandwich fixins that you&#39;d expect from a deli. You also get a pickle and a side. My personal favorite is the mac-and-cheese because it&#39;s with real melted cheese, and it reminds me of childhood down south with great grandma&#39;s cooking.

First, I have to say they have the best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had!  Problem is, if I eat a grilled cheese every time I go, my birthday suit may be a little unflattering.  So, I had to deviate from my fav and try other things on the menu. 

Today, I had the chicken tortilla soup and the Savannah chopped salad.  The chicken tortilla soup was a bit too spicy.  I needed a gallon of water to cool my mouth.  But, the salad was lovely.  It had grilled chicken, gorgonzola crumbles, dried cranberries, honey roasted almond, and sherry shallot dressing.  The chicken, cheese, and dressing were devine.  The pungent cheese was balanced perfectly by the smoothness of the dressing.  I would have preferred pears and walnuts to cranberries and almonds, but that&#39;s just a personal preference.  All-in-all, it was a good salad.

I just can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s really just a deli or a full restaurant. The kitchen is huge which makes it feel restaurant-y...but you order at the counter which is deli-ish...not to be confused with dee-lish!

The service is pretty quick, but it almost seems like everyone there hates working there. It also seems like the staff turn-over is pretty high. Management might want to take a look at better insentives or motivation...but, who am I to tell them how to run their business?

The prices are slightly California-esq, but I&#39;m ok with it because the food quality is there!

I hate all the local sports posters and memorabilia and nonsense you see in say a Chili&#39;s or Ruby Tuesday. 

McAlisters, a deli chain, does the local look much better. 
Instead of random stuff on the wall, there are actual pictures from the local community. Places I ride pass everyday, like the Aurora Sports Complex for example. 

The food is pretty good, I like that the portions aren&#39;t giant, helps my waste. The menu is fairly comprehensive for a Deli: Sandwich&#39;s, Soups &amp; Baked Potatoes. 

I like the New Yorker: Roast Beef and Pastrami. The Club is good too.

They do have a punch card and on your tenth visit, you get a free lunch! Very handy, especially if you come often. I love their new Savannah Salad with brown sugar type dressing.

I had the chicken and sausage gumbo with half a BLT sandwich, and my wife had the broccoli cheese soup.

The gumbo had lots of chicken and sausage in it, along with rice and okra.  There was enough spicy heat in it to be interesting, but not so much you wished you had a beer to wash it down.    Very good.  The sandwich was on a thick slice of sourdough with plenty of fresh ingredients, and more bacon than you typically find in a full sandwich elsewhere.

I got the large short ribs and the pineapple cheesecake.

Mashed potato marvelous mysteries dance in my belly as I type. 

The cheesecake is almost a molten cake. The inside is so creamy and pudding like, while the outside has a classic cheesecake poténdure layer. For those less educated in cheesecake a poténdure layer is something that I made up only seconds ago. 

The short ribs are as tender as the kiss from a storm-trapped temptress of the sea known only as a merhmaid. Unfortunately they are not as delicious as the kiss from a storm-trapped temptress of the sea known only as a merhmaid.

Plus, it got great reviews so I was eager to try it out. Parking was easy, too, which was nice.

I had read the reviews so I knew we were walking into a fast-casual kind of set-up, which had me wondering about some of the higher priced menu items. I had thought maybe the portions were large, because if I&#39;m going to pay $20 for a plate of short ribs I better have leftovers to take home. However, portions looked smaller than anticipated for the entree-type plates like the short rib and the meat loaf. What a bummer! And you aren&#39;t even paying for table service...

Also, I understand the upcharge for soup or salad if you order a sandwich, but an extra cost for fries? No thank you.

E ordered the chicken pastrami sandwich and I got a burger. Despite not being able to order a temperature for the burger, it came out a perfect medium, which is so much more preferable than well-done! The burger was good, nothing too exceptional, but solid and well seasoned. I also liked the house chips that came with it, especially the taro root ones. E&#39;s sandwich was good, more smoky than I normally like, and was essentially a southwestern-themed reuben. He added the french onion soup for an additional cost, which was pretty decent. 

Overall, we spent $30+ for a dinner that was so-so. I would have been super disappointed if we had gotten higher priced items - they looked really delicious, especially the meatloaf, but the plates I saw go out appeared to have more mashed potatoes than anything else. And potatoes are cheap! So if you&#39;re making the biggest portion of your entrees the mashed potatoes, and charging extra for fries, what exactly are customers paying such high prices for?"

Their fries and Taro chips are very good, but need extra salt. My friend liked her burger, and my other friend ordered the French dip sandwich.

3.5 stars.

Before entering this establishment, I thought Chop Shop was a full-on restaurant, but I guess I didn&#39;t initially notice the &#34;casual urban eatery&#34; part at the end. Regarding the interesting part of this place, and for first-timers, Chop Shop works like this:

1. Go up to the ordering counter.
2. Order from the menu (pick from plates [usually one protein] with sides, or build-your-own-salad , etc)
3. Get assigned number from the order counter.
4. Pick a table to sit at
5. Wait for food. 
6. Food arrives. Eat!

You still have a person who comes around and checks on you and people who take the plates away. Hence why there is a line for writing-in the tip when you pay at the front... However, I&#39;m conflicted when places do that because you never know how much to tip based on service that you haven&#39;t received yet (I gave them a full, good-sized tip anyway, and they were quick and cleared everything quickly).

FOODWISE:
I really liked the steak filet. It was surprisingly tender, and not super tough or chewy. It tasted delicious. The potatoes and sides with it weren&#39;t anything out of the ordinary.

I tried some of the BBQ ribs, which came with the polenta fries (SO GOOD!!! I could not stop eating these). The ribs themselves were kind of dry, unfortunately. The &#34;40-hour&#34; short ribs was another dish I tasted, and one that everyone raved about on Yelp. I was actually a bit disappointed in these as well. 

Overall, Chop Shop had really good steak, but I don&#39;t know if I would return based on the other food. I think they also ran out of the characteristic wood boards that they serve your food on (to be honest, this was a big part of the appeal of coming here because it looked nice/cool), so two out of three of us had plain white plates."

Really good food. Nice presentation worthy of a $$$$ place. Very reasonable price. $14-$20! The drinks! They&#39;re seasonal imbibes that&#39;s worthy of a Caribbean transfer. The staff? Ah-mazing!

We shared about three meat filled plate and one salad bowl as big as my white friend&#39;s &#39;fro. Yeah he&#39;s got a &#39;fro worthy of a stare. Lol! I digress...

So. The Grilled Marinated Bistro Fillet was my choice. So tender. Well seasoned. Perfect portion. Potatoes. It&#39;s got the greens to complete my trifecta. I was happy! Beautifully served on a white plate.  With this I paired their seasonal Moscow Mule. This is no ho hum M.M. This was partnered with calamansi and mango. Tangy and sweet and boozy! Yup! I am looking forward to having this again! 

I think their signature dish here is the Short Rib. This btw sits at the top of their menu when you look up behind the counter. I tried this and I can only say I&#39;m heading back to C.S soon!

Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf. This wasn&#39;t for me because it was drizzled with some slightly sweet sauce. It&#39;s not them it&#39;s me. I don&#39;t like anything remotely sweet. My group liked it! 

So. Order at the counter on a first come first served basis. Find a table and they will deliver the food to you. Outside sitting for my first time. Inside wasn&#39;t too cold. Just perfect! If you&#39;re alone there&#39;s a counter that runs along the window facing the street that would be ideal for you. I would like to try that myself even if I&#39;m not alone.

Maybe I&#39;d prefer to have a waiter rather than order, pay, and take your number. Maybe it is that just now we waited 30 minutes for them to process about 4 orders ahead of us.

To drink, I tried the moscow mule, which was mango flavoured. It was more of a ginger ale vs beer and so was quite sweet. Tasty though. To start, my husband and I each had a small onion bliss soup. The portion size was ample and I loved how the bread was served on the side. For entrees, I had the grilled chicken and husband had the st louis ribs. My chicken was fork tender and I loved the fig sauce it was served with. The arugula salad had too much salt added but I liked all of the textures present with the almonds, olives, and grapes.

She really enjoyed her sandwich, commenting that it was really fresh which is her hot button. My veggie burger was good but I did find most of the flavor was in the toppings versus the burger itself. We both agreed the Brussel sprouts were spot on. 

The rest of the menu is intriguing to me so  I will be back for more sampling."

The place is very casual and somewhat small. They have some indoor seating at tables and counters along with a little patio. The wood tables and cute orange chairs gave the place it&#39;s charm. You walk up and order at a counter and then seat yourself which is great but the food has a wow factor that you would get from a restaurant with table service. 

We started out with two orders of the Brussels sprouts which was the perfect amount for 4 people. They were really unique because they were drizzled with Greek style yogurt sauce. I&#39;ve never tasted Brussels sprouts like them before and I really enjoyed the crispyness of them!! For my entree I had the fried tofu which was a little out of my comfort zone. I don&#39;t really eat tofu but I would order this dish again in a heartbeat. The tofu was crunchy on the outside while warm and soft in the middle. It was piled on top of white rice with a tangy sauce and grilled bok choi. It was made with fresh and simple ingredients but somehow packed with flavor. All the dishes were really unique and presented beautifully. My sister orders the salmon every time she eats here and she raves about it because she enjoys how they prepare it differently based on the season and it is served on top of a huge bed of fried rice. My boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf that came with mashed potato and onion rings, wow those potatoes were smooth! My brother in law ordered a French dip that looked perfectly melty and toasty at the same time! 

The food at Chop Shop is top notch due to the quality of ingredients, presentation, and unique flavor. The food is pretty fancy for the environment of the restaurant but the prices are very fair, not cheap, but you&#39;re paying for exactly what you get. I wish Chop Stop was in my city but I&#39;ll make a point to eat here every time I go to Denver!"

I would say that the food is comparable to Acorn or similar and brooks no criticism.  

Personally, I think I actually prefer fine dining in a finer establishment.  There&#39;s something a bit heavy about a perfectly cooked filet when eaten bra-less in a summer dress.  I miss having the slight discomfort of heels slowly being tempered by a bottle of chilled french chardonnay. Not that every meal has to be an event, but the joy of going &#34;someplace fancy&#34; isn&#39;t just the decadent food; it&#39;s the whole experience and that you feel like you can take your time to savor. I wouldn&#39;t say this is the right environment for savoring. 

That&#39;s all philosophy and opinion, though.   More importantly, here&#39;s a fact: the tips are shared with the kitchen staff, who do the heavy lifting in a place where you order from a counter, so be sure to take that into consideration when you sign the receipt."

This place rocks. It&#39;s quick and totally casual, but the food is quality stuff. Like hearty, colorful, gourmet, thoughtful dishes ordered at the counter and brought out to you within 10 minutes.

I ordered the chicken breast entree for $12.99 and a fountain soda for $3; a little pricey for a place where you take a number and seat yourself, but I didn&#39;t mind the price since I enjoyed everything so much -- the atmosphere, the service, the food. I sat at the little bar which faces an opened window to the outside, so I could enjoy the weather and work on my laptop while I ate. 

My chicken had a wonderful lemon vinaigrette, arugula, olives, and a fig jus. Served alongside cheesy scalloped potatoes. Bright, full flavors. Gluten free/vegetarian options are clearly marked on the menu, and all the staff I interacted with were friendly and helpful. Plus this place is sparkly clean and has a great menu filled with real food. Can&#39;t wait to spend more time here."

The last time I was there I tried the short ribs. This time I wanted to sample the meatloaf: excellent. The meatloaf had a nice smoky flavor, wrapped with bacon, onion rings, and fluffy lite mash potatoes. 

The following day I took my kids there to sample their food since they had never been. They loved it. One of the great things about this place is their consistency, a pet peeve of mine, especially when it comes to restaurants. Whenever I come to Denver, the Chop Shop will always be on the itinerary.

You walk up to a counter and order your food, a food runner brings you high end culinary dishes and that is pretty much it. The atmosphere is a cross between semi fast food and an upscale eatery. You don&#39;t really have a server per say.  If you want to order anything else, you go back up to the counter.  It is interesting, and a bit odd.  Maybe because I am just not used to it yet, but it looks like this is how the food scene is going.

The food on the other hand is amazing. Where else can you get medallioned filet for $14? The price is just right for a beautiful tasty dish. The filet fell apart in my mouth, it was so tender. Served with asparagus and grape tomatoes covered with a demi chimchurri sauce.. I love the food, just still not quite sure about the quick dining experience."

This place put a fresh and modern twist on the classic diner and did a great job!  Obscurely located on Colfax in Park Hill, this place is great if you&#39;re in the area. I&#39;m a student on the Anschutz campus and Chop Shop is close enough to stop by for lunch. 

The burgers are always cooked perfectly medium, and the salads are great!  This place isn&#39;t too adventurous with their menu, but they keep it simple and do it well!

My only complaint is that the chips are thin and tasteless, but it&#39;s probably for the best if you&#39;re working on those New Years resolutions.  Five stars!"

We had the braised short ribs (large), bacon wrapped meatloaf, fingerling potatoes and the mango/calamansi Moscow mule.

They implemented a fast food model , but with fine dining meals. When we went to the counter to place our orders and received a number to place on our tables, I assumed we were going to get your typical semi-fast food service type plates. However, our dishes were far from ordinary. We ordered a veggie burger and it had delicious smokey flavors and great chewy textures, unlike your typical bean veggie burger. We also ordered the Mediterranean chicken and it was yet another amazing dish. The chicken was cooked perfectly, soft, tender, and moist. The chicken came on top of --what I think was farro-- and topped with a delicious creamy tzaziki sauce. My mom ordered the burger, so I didn&#39;t get the opportunity to try it.

Casual cozy non- pretentious &#34;hole in the wall&#34;. My date and I encountered a couple at the front door on their first visit as well and i could feel the giddiness off all of us. The smell even upon the approach was intoxicating which was an omen of the wine that would accompany the meal. I ordered the kimchi marinated beef tenderloin with chimichuri. Along with fingerling potatoes blistered cherry tomatoes and broccoli.  Mary had the pork tenderloin with sweet potatoe puree with mushrooms &amp; Italian sausage. Accompanied by a baby kale, arugula, Apple and goat cheese salad with walnuts and a wildflower honey vinaigrette.  I know! Your mouth is already watering. The wait staff was crazy nice and the wait time was crazy short. The portions were almost too much...almost.
We were joined at the end of the meal by the fabulous Laura who bought the desserts. Banana cream creme brulee and caramel cheesecake with coconut tres leches pineapple compote....yeah you read right...OMG!
I could go on but I&#39;m getting faint from the digestion going on. If you&#39;re in Denver i cannot reccomend this joint any higher. Chop Shop!!!!"

I didn&#39;t have very high expectations since my friend and I wanted a quick lunch before heading to the airport, but this meal was a pleasant surprise. The ordering setup was a little reminiscent of Chipotle, but the food was quite the opposite. The 48 hour slow-cooked short rib is one of the best pieces of meat I&#39;ve ever eaten. Just pay the difference for the larger $20 portion size (you won&#39;t regret it). The short rib was so tender and flavorful, especially with the amazing hoisin demi-glace. The whipped potatoes were was fluffy as could be. I also tried the smoked chicken pastrami sandwich with a side of the daily soup, which was a salmon chowder. The salmon chowder was great and better than the sandwich itself. But, back to the short rib - don&#39;t consider ordering anything else. 

The concept of a fast casual restaurant is interesting. The prices are reasonable and you are getting your food in a quick manner, but it doesn&#39;t sacrifice food quality in this case. I can&#39;t believe you can even order this food for delivery. Sign me up!"

I originally found this colfax eatery via a yelp search for French fries. Unfortunately the French fries served here are very dry despite the sprinkle of parsley? and bits of some cheese like substance not sure what exactly cuz I don&#39;t taste the flavor. It seemed like the fry was baked and no frying or oil was involved which took away from the deliciousness that is a French fry. Was underwhelmed by this since I was specifically searching for fries.

Anyway the shop itself is cute with its exposed brick and pay first get served type of way. I appreciated the exactly spaced two person booth I sat in for this experience.

I got the 48hour short rib that everyone is raving about. The meat was tender and on first bite with its slight sweetness combined with French onions I was saying yum. But after adjusting to the flavor and topping this off with dry fry syndrome I wasn&#39;t super excited about finishing my small plate. I guess there is a reason why the whipped potato usually accompanies this dish? I did eat all my meat like my momma taught me but I was kind of over it after the third piece (of 6 slices I believe). I think it needs a little kick or pepper to make me happy it was on the sweet side.

My sister got a veggie burger. As usual it was sadly dry (no veggie burger has the moisture of a real meat burger!!) but the slightly spiced pickle that came on the side was a winner. She also had dry fries to complete a very dry meal.

Overall I like the concept of this restaurant but I haven&#39;t been won over by these choices. There are a few other interesting sounding dishes that may be better."

I think I got the skirt or flank steak with mash potatoes. The meal was quite tasty as I wolfed it down within minutes! The presentation was super cute...the food laid out on a chopping board. The portion was perfect...just enough to make my belly happy! 
The staff were friendly and the interior of the restaurant had a nice BBQ type setting. The bathroom was clean and had a pleasant smell. They also have an outdoor patio, which is always great for those beautiful warm days.

Dessert was Butterscotch pudding + Brownie. 

My favorite - the bacon wrapped meatloaf and the brussel sprouts. The salmon dish was good but not spectacular. 

I think the only real qualm I had was that I found the food to be too sauced (everything was doused in something - even the brussel sprouts) and therefore, everything was a little salty. The Butterscotch pudding and Brownie were a little sweet and a little overpowering for my palate. 

Overall, I loved that it&#39;s casual and easy, but also served good food. Next time, I will ask for all sauces + glazes on the side."

I&#39;m not even a huge fry fan, but I couldn&#39;t stop eating these! They were seasoned perfectly and not oily which was a nice surprise. For entrees, I had the salmon and my husband ordered the small short ribs. We were both happy with our choices. The salmon came with couscous, wilted spinach, and cucumber noodles. Each component was full of flavor! The short ribs were also delicious and came with mashed potatoes and crispy onions.

The 48 hour short rib - tender and moist and savory, over mashed potatoes. 
The filet - cooked to perfection with roasted vegetables.
The pork ribs (good) - polenta fries were the only meh thing on the table.
Even the salad was exceptional.

It was Friday night and got my trusty black book called &#34;yelp&#34; and started to check out the usual and familiar place that I have been to till the Chop Chop Casual Eatery stood out.  My eyes caught the cutting board presentation of bacon wrapped meat loaf  and started packing for long journey. 

When we stepped in, we were expecting a hostess to greet us but didn&#39;t see anyone. Place was packed but there were few clean tables nearby so we sat down expecting someone to comeby and put us on the waiting list.  After few minutes of scoping the scene, things started to make sense.  It wasn&#39;t Lingers, it wasn&#39;t Park burger either.   

While waiting for other foodies to arrive from their long trek,  I walked toward the back checking out the scene and I was definitely getting into this restauant.   Quick stop at the rest room and..  wow..  rolled up hand towels nicely stacked up to use instead of paper?  Very nice touch!

Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf (5 Stars - $14):  Awesome!  I&#39;m not usually a meatloaf person, but the smokey, bacon-wrapped &#34;filet&#34; of meatloaf was wonderful and complex, paired with whipped potatoes and mile-high onion rings.  One of the best onion rings I&#39;ve had in my life.  The mango barbecue sauce brought it all together.

72-hour cooked French Onion soup: (4 stars - $3.50) this, too, was excellent and with a beautiful presentation.  

Ginger-Hazelnut Vanilla Bar(4.5 stars - $6) This was complex, with a cherry infused hazelnut mousse and dark chocolate bites.  Delicious.

Eager to come again!  Still have to try the famous short ribs!!"

It&#39;s a casual setting where you stand in line and order and they bring you your food. There&#39;s a small outdoor patio on the side which is great when the weather is nice. It may seem to be a little pricey but the food is delicious! I highly recommend the short ribs

Quality ingredients make a difference- everything was the bomb. We both ate everything on our plates. 
Not sure why people are complaining about prices. Our meals, the watermelon marg, and a soda only ran us 40 bucks. That&#39;s pretty typical for two people, especially when you consider the quality of this food. We will be back."

What a gem. This concept is killer. Had a party of 4 late at night, maybe an hr before they closed, still got friendly service and most importantly -- scrumptious food.

Food- 5 stars. It&#39;s awesome, seriously. The ribs, short ribs, chicken, etc. It&#39;s all good. High end quality and huge portions. 

Value- Again, for what you pay, you get a TON of really, really excellent food with great ingredients. Great for grabbing something quick without settling for low quality. Love the model. Blows mod market out of the water.

Experience- This is the only aspect that makes coming here tough sometimes. The place is small, and they enforce a policy where you can&#39;t sit down until you order. For some reason ordering takes a long time, so the line can be out the door. If you arrive and it&#39;s overflowing, it defeats the whole fast casual purpose. No a short term fix here but hopefully their success will allow them to open a second location."

I have had a birthday party here once and come on several occasions. The food is always great. It fits all different types of preference pallets. The bday party was a bit intense, as the seating is limited. But it was fun to have people sit at different seats and meander around to meet everyone. Everyone enjoyed the food and drinks. The menu is absolutely perfection. I highly recommend it. The best part is you don&#39;t have to worry about splitting the bill. You walk in and get what you want and pay for it.

Wow! I wish we had something like this up in my neck of the woods - I&#39;d eat here every week if I could.

I had a hell of a time trying to decide what I wanted because every single thing on the menu sounded fantastic. Wound up getting Braised Short Rib and a cup of French Onion Soup. The rib was tender and flavorful, served up with whipped potatoes, carrots, and crispy onions. It basically was a deconstructed pot roast.

The onion soup was packed with flavor and delicious tender pieces of onion. It was served with melting Gruyere on top, but with a slice of grilled bread on the side rather than floating on top. More deconstruction of classics I can get on board with.

Did I mention this place was counter service and it took all of five minutes to get my food? Because yeah - this is stuff you&#39;d normally be sitting down for a half hour or more to eat.

Brilliant."

I have only been here twice, however, each time was very satisfying.  From my last two experience, I can definitely say food here is consistently good and fresh.  It is amazing that you can get good quality and gourmet food from a fast food dine-in.

Yes, I would consider this place a fast food joint, despite them serving alcohol and their beautifully crafted food presentation, because upon entering, you have to order at the counter and then find your own seats.  I am not complaining though because this method works well for them and is actually pretty efficient.  Another plus to being a  &#34;fast food&#34; place are the prices.  I think the prices are reasonably cheap for the food quality and I am definitely loving that.  Another thing I love is that they have Boylan soda as their fountain drinks and its free refills!!!"

It all tasted great, but the soup didn&#39;t meet expectations. It was just okay. The meat was tender and flavorful though. 

I wasn&#39;t pleased that they charge for ONE extra piece of bread! Which I was never informed that there was going to be a charge. All I have to say if I&#39;m shelling out $44 for two dishes and a cup of soup, there shouldn&#39;t be a extra charge."

I was so happy with our experience here, I am having withdrawals. We came here on a friday night and it was busy because this place does it right.  You step up and they take your order, fill you in on what you need to know, and you are on your way to a table of your choice.  

I ordered the grilled marinated flank steak.  It is presented on a cutting board, ready for you to chop away and dig in.  They have nice meals for kids and their moscow mule was pretty tasty.  We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the street noise, conversation and delicious food."

It&#39;s a hip fast casual restaurant. Had the bacon wrapped meatloaf topped with onion rings. My wife had the pork tenderloin with spätzle. Both plates were incredibly good!  Prices were reasonable. They serve wine and have a good selection of craft beers. Service was spectacular. An employee overheard my friend comment that she did not like the sourdough bread that came with her sandwich and they brought her a new sandwich on different bread. Usually you don&#39;t get much personal attention at a fast casual restaurant but here they were very attentive and made sure we were happy with everything.

Both times I&#39;ve ordered the 48-hour short ribs, and they are perfect! Cooked perfectly, and seasoned beautifully. The sides are delicious, the mashed potatoes are so good! 

We ordered the banana creme brulee and it was awesome! I fell in love, for sure, I would recommend grabbing dessert! 

The atmosphere is really fun, and energized too. The place is a bit cramped, grab a booth if you can, to avoid people trying to get by your chair to get to the soda."

Time and Day: Ate on a Thursday afternoon at 11:30 AM. There was no one here so no wait time at all!  

Food: Ordered a large 48 Hour Short Rib ($20.00) and I liked it. The Short Rib was moist, soft, and delicious, but it didn&#39;t completely blow my mind. The accompanied sauce and carrots were good, and I was impressed with its presentation. However, the mashed potato was mediocre. The food deserves a 3.5/5 so I round it to a 4/5.  

Service: At this establishment, you order at the counter and they will bring you the food. Since there was little interaction, I can&#39;t make a comment about the service other than the cashier was friendly.   

Price: Just a tad bit too pricy for me for the food. 

Overall: The food is good, no comment on service, but I felt that the price for the 48 Hour Short Rib is a tad overprice for the food. Overall, a 3.5/5."

The calamansi and mango combination reminded me so much of being back in Bora Bora laying on the overwater bungalo and my only worry was to get a perfect tan. The pandan cheesecake was TDF. So smooth and creamy and simply amazing. My husband had the bistro filet. The meat is tender and the vegetables were full of flavor. The grilled salmon filet is  also a must try. The salmon was moist and the rice and vegetables were simply bomb. The staff were friendly and very helpful!  We&#39;re definitely coming back.

The place is pretty small so there wasn&#39;t much seating- we had to shark around for a bit. 

I got the French dip. It was really good! Very tender and the dip was different but tasty. I was def not a fan of the crunchy fries. I hate crunchy fries- they might as well be potato chips!

My hubby got the chop shop burger and said it was good!

My MIL got the grilled marinated filet. It was so tender and juicy. The marinade was so full of flavor- I would definitely get this next time!

For 3 people, the bill was $60. Fast casual is so expensive these days!"

The dining area was a little cramped and we didn&#39;t have too many seating options even at 2:00.

I ordered the short rib on potatoes with carrots. The flavor was good but the crispy onions on top looked a little unappetizing. The short rib itself was very tender but I actually thought it lacked flavor and was a little on the bland side. Combined with the sauce and potatoes, it tasted better.

Unfortunately, it was a giant let down.  For the price of all their food, we were expecting much better flavors and taste.  There were four of us who went here, and we all got something different.  None of us were blown away by the food, and it was unanimous that we&#39;d likely never return simply due to the price of such bland food.  

It also took a while to order because there was only one person taking orders and she was also bogged down with pouring drinks (which they are also very proud of...$6 for a beer?)

They serve everything on some sort of small &#34;chopping block&#34; i imagine, but it makes for a holy mess. I felt like a child at their first birthday part eating spaghetti.

Came here with my bf for lunch during a sunny day. We decided to sit out on their side patio area to enjoy the weather but the seats inside were comfy as well. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to your table and also clean up after you&#39;re done. The staff was very nice and gave us suggestions on what to get.

For the food, I got the crispy tofu and my bf got the pork tenderloin. My tofu came with quinoa with bits of Brussels sprouts and a side of some sweet and sour sauce. It was amazing! I loved every bite. The tofu had a nice crisp and the quinoa was well seasoned. The pork tenderloin was also tasty! My boyfriend let me try a bite, and I must say the tart cherry sauce is such a perfect combo for the it!

Will definitely come back and try other dishes, especially their desserts bc it all sounded so tasty!"

I&#39;d read the online reviews, so I knew it was a stand in line type of place to order. What I didn&#39;t expect was the line to wait. It was about 4:30-ish and it was pretty busy.

This place is amazeballs.  It&#39;s like your not so attractive friend who turns out to be utterly charming and so interesting.  It certainly isn&#39;t much to look at in a little store front a couple of doors East of the Bluebird.  Street parking which is a pain.  Interior is Spartan and tiny and they don&#39;t take reservations.  But, if you are a serious foodie - this place is the bomb.com.  I wouldn&#39;t take a finicky eater here - they are exploring some more challenging corners of the culinary world - foie gras, sweetbreads, steelhead, bison tongue, rabbit.  And, if they make accommodations for vegan, gluten free, lactose intolerant diners the short and sweet menu makes no mention of it.  In fact, you&#39;ll need to grill the very knowledgeable waiter on many of the preparations because the menu is not very descriptive - more a list of ingredients.  Prices are pretty reasonable - mid to high teens for starters and mid to high twenties for mains.

So, went with a fellow culinary risk taker on a sleepy Tuesday and got in with no problems - in fact the table next to us was never filled while we were there.  Started with martinis - gin for him and vodka for me.  All of the choices are artisanal/craft bottles - no common brands - and, no martini glasses just a rocks glass sans rocks.  Served with complimentary boiled peanuts - not a fan so off to a slightly rocky start.  But, then the glorious food started arriving.

We are sharers so we both got to sample the wonders coming out of the kitchen beginning with the sweetbreads (pan crisped with a garlic veggie jus) and are you ready for this?  Bison tongue pastrami, rye and Swiss gnocchi, sauerkraut.  Waiter described it as a deconstructed ruben.  Simply divine.  Portions are smallish but so packed with flavor that each dish is so satisfying on a very deep level that any more would be too much.

For mains he had the steelhead presented almost as a &#34;do it yourself&#34; lettuce wrap - gorgeous and unique plating.  I had the trio of rabbit (braised leg, roasted loin, confit front leg).  It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen rabbit on a menu and this plate was beyond delicious - each piece stood on it&#39;s own highlighting the different textures of mr. bunny.  It was served with a wonderful little cheesy flatbread.

No room for dessert but I was sorely tempted by a beautiful fresh berry pudding that our neighbors were demolishing - next time and there WILL definitely be a next time I&#39;ll save room for it.  Washed all this deliciousness down with a lovely little Côtes du Rhône.  Check totaled out about $145 so not cheap but I&#39;ve spent so much more and been left so much less satisfied.  So, if you are serious appreciator of the culinary arts this place is a must try - go and taste the love that goes into every dish.  Maybe sit at counter and watch the magic happening."

It&#39;s an adorable restaurant that seats about 20 (including the bar) and is run by a very small staff. We only ordered two entrees, two desserts, and two drinks, so I can&#39;t speak to the appetizers, though they looked good. Next time, I&#39;ll have to try the buratta. 

I decided to go with their vegetarian option because I find that that&#39;s where a lot of chefs can show their creativity. It was a chanterelle clafoutis which is kind of a souffle/fluffy omelette. It came with a salad of microgreens and radish in a preserved lemon dressing. The salad was completely perfect and I wouldn&#39;t change anything about it. As for the clafoutis... well... it was SO tiny. It&#39;s just so hard to call it a &#39;chantarelle&#39; anything if there&#39;s maybe one mushroom in it. I understand fine dining/small portions but for a vegetarian dish, this was really, really insubstantial. It was very tasty but even a doubled portion would still have been small. 

My husband ordered the duck. It was beautifully cooked to medium-rare and served on a bed of lentils and beets and it was delicious. My husband is of the belief that a properly cooked duck is the best meat there is to be had. Certainly, TTW did a fantastic job with that. 

For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and the summer pudding. The summer pudding was essentially homemade bread soaked in stewed fruit juice, topped with a light whipped cream. It was lovely but a little too tart. The nice thing about it is that you don&#39;t feel *too* bad eating it. The chocolate cake was a twist on a s&#39;more. All in all, a good cake, but I could have done without the smoked cream on the plate. If the cream was bruleed, maybe that might have been the better way to convey the toasted marshmallow taste they were going for. 

The wine and spirits list looked beautifully curated. For a couple, expect to spend roughly $150. As an aside, I really enjoyed the music they played. No idea what it was but it was cool :)"

I think there was a punk rock club next door with what looked like the entourage of the Ramones and the Sex Pistols hanging around ourside. Don&#39;t be afraid, the inside was very cozy with some bar seating overlooking the kitchen like a sushi bar. The seating is limited so It&#39;s not for big parties as it seemed to be mostly couples. The cuisine is absolutely top notch through and through. 

Small plates... 

The Cornmeal Waffle small plate is actually more about the roasted marinated pork shoulder mixed with the fresh carrot-heavy slaw. Wow, what a great combination of the sweet pork and cool slaw!

The Veal Sweetbreads are very tasty especially with the garlic consomme they pour after the fact like a shot of Grand Mariner into a Cadillac Margarita. There is some macaroni and spinach to soak in the consomme, but it was so good I had to ask for a spoon to lap it up.

The Bison Pastrami was pretty good, but I didn&#39;t enjoy it quite as much as the two above. 

Onto the larger plates...

The Loch Etive Steelhead warns on the menu that it can be cooked rare. In the center it had that ruby orange look to it, but it was absolutely delicious. It comes with a decent size cube of pork belly that isn&#39;t rare, but oinking just enough. Both proteins on the plate were scrumptious, as we&#39;re the potato wedges and veggie garnish. I definitely recommend this plate for fresh Colorado fish. 

The Trio of Rabbit is apparently a new dish and definitely a keeper. There&#39;s a bone-in leg and thigh glazed with some yummy sauce, a boneless leg on top of a homemade garlicy cheesey Flatbread, and best of all some Rabbit confit in sauce with shitake mushrooms and spinach. Awesome... all of it. I love trying stuff I can&#39;t get anywhere else, and I&#39;ve never had wabbit. I certainly won&#39;t be able to have it prepared this good anywhere else. 

Must leave room in this review for desert...

The Bread Pudding whose ingredient description are &#34;berries, berries, berries&#34; was phenomenal. Apparently they make the white bread from scratch and it looks like a sponge full of purple ink, but it&#39;s really just berry juice. There are chopped blackberries and strawberries on the side, but the flavor of the berry soaked bread is just a amazing. The dollop of whip cream helps tone down the tart and sweetness too. It&#39;s a perfect blend. 

To The Wind Bistro is definitely worth a visit when in Denver. Just go."

After knowing of its existence since it&#39;s opening, my boyfriend and I were waiting for the perfect time to visit (both because they don&#39;t take reservations, so you&#39;re waiting for walk-in-good-luck, and for a special occasion).  We decided to visit for our 2 year anniversary.

To The Wind has a surprisingly wide selection of beer, wine, and whiskey.  But we really came for the food.  And luckily, we came hungry.  We started with the cornmeal waffle, which is topped with savory and tender pork shoulder and homemade coleslaw.  The best coleslaw I&#39;ve ever had.  Because I couldn&#39;t decide between the gnocchi and the steak for my entree, and because we came with our appetites, we decided to also split the gnocchi as an appetizer of sorts.  The caraway gnocchi was reminiscent of rye bread, had been sautéed (so they were nice a crispy, but fluffy on the inside), and had melted cheddar cheese all over them.  Placed on top of radicchio, and topped with raisins and cauliflower salad - this was the star of the whole evening.

For entrees, I ordered the steak with root vegetables and pickled ramp over an incredible parsnip ranch.  Delicious and perfectly cooked between medium rare and medium.  My boyfriend had the buttermilk chicken with crispy parmesan bread pudding, shaved asparagus, and thinly sliced chorizo.

My favorite part - outside of the gnocchi - was our service.  Despite being one of the best restaurants in Denver, the atmosphere feels comfortable and our service was completely unpretentious and fun.  When we have family come into town later this year, this is definitely where we will try to take them."

(We ate between 6:30p and 8p 3/3, and we had the &#34;Mixed Mushroom Tagliatelle&#34; and the &#34;Bistro Steak&#34; -- We were asked if &#34;medium rare&#34; was ok, but the steak came out truly rare and decided to just take it home and cook it longer; he didn&#39;t eat much of the dish. The mushroom dish was incredible, however.)

Upon arrival of our whiskey, we both immediately thought that it was a smaller amount than they should be, then when we got home, we measured both 1 and 2oz liquids, and we both felt like we were shorted whatever would&#39;ve been a full drink -- an ounce doesn&#39;t sound like much, but at $15 and $10, that&#39;s exorbitant, and it was straight whiskey.... We both felt like we had a 1-ounce shot -- is that correct?

Service was attentive and friendly

The only thing that keeps me from full stars is that the entrees didn&#39;t feel complete to me, especially in the veggie section.  The sturgeon sits on basically a chicken pot pie, so it is a weird melding of two meats and not enough veggies, although extremely delicious.  The pork two ways comes with beans, some potato salad, and a few leaves of lettuce.  Again, delicious, but you just feel very heavy at the end.

The appetizers were delicious and well balanced.  But again, our table was looking for a lighter break from the meat heavy entrees, and there was no salad, so we went with the panzanella and crudo.

The restaurant doesn&#39;t play around with frills. Meaning: no reservations (but they do allow you to call ahead to get on a list) and a seating area of about 15. They also don&#39;t have daily specials. The menu is what you can choose from.  Oh and they actually close during the week and on some holidays! Hooray for treating staff right! 

Was lucky to be able to get a table for 6 at 7 on a Friday.  We basically took up half the restaurant; thank you guys for such a great experience! 

While waiting for your meal they serve you boiled peanuts. Never had them! Can&#39;t believe how tasty they are. They have a simple but great wine and cocktail list. 

For starters we had the bone marrow (I can&#39;t even begin to explain how buttery and fatty it was. Taste buds exploded); octopus (most tender octopus I have ever had) as well as the veal sweetbreads. 

If you really want a treat make sure you ask them for some shaved truffles over everything. Huge beautiful slices! 

For my main dish I ordered the sturgeon.  Have you ever had a meal that was so good you didn&#39;t want to finish it? So good you ate it slower than anyone else at the table? Yes it was that good.  Every bite kept releasing different flavors depending on which bits you had on your fork.  So decadent.

We stopped in right after work on a Friday (5:30 pm), and had we waited 10 minutes more, we would have missed out on a table. As small as this place is (maybe six tables and four seats at the bar), and because they don&#39;t take reservation, you need to arrive early in the evening with your entire party if you want to get a table. We managed to snag the last four top before the 6:00 pm rush.

As many others have pointed out, the menu is very limited. However, that&#39;s a good thing since you don&#39;t have to wade through an extensive list of options. I ordered the Berkshire Pork, my wife the Bistro Steak. The pork was well seasoned and paired with braised cabbage, brussell sprout leaves, and a petite sweet potato pie. The steak was served with a parsnip puree (amazing), beets, braised beef cheeks, and horseradish. Both dishes were great (I managed to graze off my wife&#39;s plate), but I enjoyed the pork dish more.

I am excited to try this place again later this year. I imagine that with a small restaurant like this, the chef&#39;s mix up the menu throughout the year."
to-the-wind-bistro-denver,Daniel M.,7ZTUsS5ZUdhxP1YobghBnA,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,0,158,Auii2DNMoafTsfrPOP_l9g,1.0,2016-09-22,"Full disclosure, I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of dining here.  But it&#39;s not for a lack of trying!  Turns out they DO NOT take reservations...and we have obligations that make it impossible to just &#34;show up and wait&#34;.

Back Story: For our birthdays in March, my brother gave my wife and I a gift certificate to &#34;To the Wind&#34;.  We were excited to try out this new restaurant.

As professionals both working demanding hours while trying to balance the responsibilities of parenthood, we rarely get the opportunity to share a date night.  So this gift certificate presented the perfect excuse for a night out! 

We planned ahead of time, and called to get a reservation.  Their response: Nice try...we don&#39;t do reservations.  I did my best to explain our situation, and the gal offered that we could call in and hold a table, but they would only hold it for 15 minutes from the time we called.  That would be great if we lived less than 15 minutes away and didn&#39;t have to arrange for child-care.  

Alas...we don&#39;t live in Cap Hill and honestly just aren&#39;t that cool anymore.  [Aside: This kind of &#34;new-age&#34; policy not only exudes a level of arrogance it also ostracizes potential patrons who might consider driving a distance to dine here. What&#39;s more, it excludes parents, those who need to plan ahead to arrange for dining out at a restaurant and thus find a babysitter to make it all possible...all reasons why &#34;reservations&#34; were invented in the first place]

-&#34;To the Wind&#34; is to pretentiousness what Donald Trump is to....hmmm...pretentiousness 

Back to the gift certificate... So, after calling ahead, hiring a babysitter to watch our son while we celebrated our anniversary, calling ahead again and asking the restaurant to hold a table for us, and hoping it would still be available after hustling across town, we arrived at 6pm and were promptly told upon arrival that 9pm was the earliest they could get us in.  No f&#39;ing way!!?

Their response: Yup, a large party showed up, others called in and took our place, and that&#39;s how the cookie crumbles.  

That being the new reality, we expressed our frustration and accepted the impossibility of our dining experience.  Rather than finding another time to do the same thing over again and expect different results, we decided to buck the definition of insanity and simply ask the hostess to give us money back for the gift certificate. The certificate was for $150.00 (actual money my brother gave via debit card to the restaurant in exchange for the certificate).  She referred us to the owner, who (as it turns out) was right behind us in the kitchen and popped his head out.  I again explained that as much as we would love to dine at &#34;To the Wind&#34;, it just didn&#39;t seem like it would ever happen logistically, so I asked that they refund the value of the gift certificate.  

He agreed but said he would only be able to do so on the same card as the original purchase.  Since the gift certificate was purchased by my brother, I said I would have my brother call for reimbursement.  The owner acknowledged that, and we left.  

Fast forward a few weeks, my brother calls, and the owner refused to refund the card.  No joke, my brother called the owner.  And straight up, he refused.  $150 was given to &#34;To the Wind&#34; by my brother as a gift for our future redemption.  We tried several times to redeem the gift and to no avail.  Seeing as thought Futility is an exercise we try and avoid, we asked for the money back so that we wouldn&#39;t have to continue wasting our time.  The answer was no.  

Who takes your money, is not a charity, and offers nothing in return?  &#34;To the Wind Bistro&#34; 

We&#39;ve asked you directly, and now we&#39;ll ask you publicly - give us our money back."

The setting is cozy and intimate with pillows to lean up against the benches.

For the starters, we went with the bone marrow and escargot empanadas.  I cook with bones but have never intentionally eaten bone marrow.  The thought of it, quite frankly, grossed me out a tad.  And now I realize the folly of my ways. Simply delicious and the essence of cow.  This version was served with Texas toast, short rib jam and whole grain mustard.  Exquisite.

The empanada dough was lovely but I like more garlic with my escargots.  For my main, I ordered the barley risotto with fiddle head ferns, carrots and pecans. Imagine my surprise and delight when our mains came to the table and I also had fav beans in my risotto.  Two short season, hard to find in Colorado vegetables in the same dish?  Get outta here!  I was beyond excited.  The flavors all came perfectly together and if I could cook carrots like that I&#39;d eat them every day.  

My friends ordered the hangar steak with cucumber toubbouleh and the roast chicken dish.  Both were wowed away. 

Not that we needed dessert but we felt compelled to sample the whole range. The pineapple upside down cake and chocolate stout cake were the selections. Both proved that this restaurant has it down pat.  My only slightly negative feedback is I wish they had killer cocktails on the menu.  It is a beer, wine, spirits set up.  

I have been telling anyone who will listen that they simply must come here!"

I&#39;ve been twice and both times I&#39;ve left exceptionally happy and satisfied with the experience. The food is phenomenal, the ambiance is adorable and the service is really really good. The whole place just has good juju. The wine and beer menu is well curated in my opinion, and the food is really thought out but not fussy and just super tasty. Aps, entree and desert are all equal. I&#39;ve had the gnocci twice (because they were just that darn good) and the scallops my husband had were like butter melting in your mouth. The fois gras is exactly what it should be and then some. Everything is really balanced and the staff is well educated on their product. 

I would highly recommend this place!"

Go to order: pastrami and pate for starters and the duck confit for main course followed by the creme brûlée. Our waiter Greg was hilarious and made the experience that much better. Eat here now.

My wife and I went to To the Wind Bistro on a whim...it had stellar reviews and we had some free time on a Thursday.  So we called ahead around 4:45 and made sure to get seats by the kitchen (of which there are only four) at 5:00.  When we walked in, the chef-owner was meeting with Black Shirt brewing in coming up with a specialty beer cocktail I think?  His daughter was doing math homework at the bar and his wife was buzzing around setting the place up for service.  I absolutely love supporting families who are taking the risk on a place and really making it a family-run restaurant while still maintaining high professional standards.

As we sat, the owner nodded over at us and got Black Shirt to let us try their beers -- what kindness!  I felt an immediate connection to the owner and thought &#34;that&#39;s how I would act if I had my own place.&#34;  We chatted briefly about our first time coming in and where I worked and then we ordered our food.

And my god, this is incredible stuff.  We started with the bone marrow, which I CANNOT oversell.  Best bone marrow I have had in my life, without question.  The bone is hewn lengthwise and served with oxtail jam and butter-basted housemade sourdough with parsley onion salad; this dish is the definition of decadence.  We also got the cornmeal waffle with roasted pork shoulder and slaw -- divine.  This dish would be the absolute best in many of the top restaurants in Denver, but at To the Wind it was simply great.  We then followed it up with entrees, In which I ordered the Bistro Steak and my wife ordered the Sea Bass.

My steak was cooked perfectly, served with a luscious parsnip puree, demi and beets with freshly grated horseradish.  Hearty beyond belief and well worth the price.  My wife ordered the sea bass, her favorite fish, which was served over potatoes, caperberries and calamari in a tomato broth.  I myself am not a huge fan of calamari, as I believe it always gets rubbery, but this dish was phenomenal.  The tomato broth had some of the best flavor I&#39;ve ever tasted in a tomato product, especially in January.  

The only thing that was not absolutely phenomenal was the dessert; offerings are slim and lacking creativity compared to the rest of the menu.  That being said, Denver on the whole does not do desserts justice, and the rest of the meal was so overwhelming I dare not dock points. 

Do yourself a favor and try this place out.  We went on a sleepy Thursday as soon as the doors opened, but around 6:45 the restaurant was full, so call ahead or get there early if you can."

I found a restaurant that I DO NOT want to Yelp about because I don&#39;t want anyone else to go there but ME.  Seriously took me one month to write this.  No really, To the Wind Bistro is fantastic!! All of the accolades go to Chef Royce and his staff! Keeping his concept small on Colfax is genius.  The restaurant seats only 16 and then there are 4 spots at the bar.  Chef makes all of your delicious meals with the help of his sous chef.  All of the dishes are creative, well portioned and damn good.  The head server, Reayanna (spelling? Sorry girl) is a delight! She is knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.  She keeps the many diners corralled with a smile.  Although many people were turned away (no reservations) because the restaurant was full, not one diner walked away in a huff due to Reayanna&#39;s shining personality and the fact that Chef Royce called his buddy - Awesome Adam - at the Plimoth to take care of his overflow.

This restaurant is NOT about being cool, attracting entitled hipsters, or being on the cutting age of nouveau cuisine.  Chef Royce came from Mizzuna where he excelled at his trade! This restaurant is about serving imaginative, delicious food and making you super pleased that you came in for a visit.

No snooty cocktails, you can have wine, beer, and the most excellent Sazerac, Manhattan, or Maple Old Fashioned out of the home made barrel!

I imagine that the menu changes periodically, however I cannot type enough accolades about the Kampachi Poke, Foie Gras Torchon (to die!!), the Rockfish, and the AMAZING seared duck breast.

Get over to To the Wind Bistro immediately - just don&#39;t take my seat!"

We were promptly seated and enjoyed some quiet moments looking over the menu. They have a well curated menu of small dishes and entree plates along with a much larger selection of wine, cocktail, and assorted booze. 

Everything we tried was fantastic - the oxtail and fig jam marrow, the cornmeal waffle with pulled pork, and mushroom tagliatelle. My only complaint would be the sometimes underwhelming portions. 

It began with the dry white. The wife was fine with it at the $8 price, but compared to other places - started my complaint meter. Then the bone marrow and cornmeal waffle wowed us. I really enjoyed how the waffle, pulled pork and cole slaw came together. On the bone marrow plate, everything impressed, but most impressive was the delicious sourdough bread that is made in-house. We finally finished with the tagliatelle - rich in flavor, large taste presence, scant noodles. It would have been more impressive as a small plate and not as entree. It didn&#39;t feel main course.

Would we go again? Of course"

We ordered a selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts and absolutely everything was amazing! Some standouts: the bison pastrami (extremely tender bison tongue smothered in sauerkraut) and the carrot cake, which was accompanied by the most wonderful caramel sauce that had a bit of tanginess from craisins! Sounds weird, tastes incredible."

My friend recommended To The Wind to try out so we came here on a Tuesday night. Even at 6PM, there was a wait, so we headed across the street for a drink and waited it out, which I&#39;m so happy we did. 

We started off with the cornmeal waffle, which I would have eaten two of if it were a main dish. The waffle was perfectly cooked and the slaw and pork were a great combination of sweet and salty. YUM!

I chose the duck confit, which was amazing as well. I&#39;m a huge sucker for duck and this literally fell off the bone as I was eating it. 

No complaints here!"

Although the restaurant is small (we had to wait forty minutes for dinner for two on a Tuesday night), it was well worth it. We got the chicken and risotto, both of which were delicious. We also had peanuts in the beginning, boiled in some amazing sauce I couldn&#39;t quite decipher. Our waitress was also incredibly nice and helpful. It is definitely a unique and unexpected find on Colfax. The food is American/European, with some unexpected twists. I would definitely go back again."

Appetizer: lamb empanadas
Crispy on the outside, perfect amount of filling inside, not greasy at all...amazing.

Entrees: buttermilk chicken; and a steak dish I can&#39;t remember the name of.
The buttermilk chicken was the juiciest, most tender chicken I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life. The first thing I said when I took a bite of the chicken skin was that I only wish I could order more of it as an appetizer it was so delicious! 

Dessert: chocolate cake with a pear marmalade&#39;ish layer in the middle. The wife of the chef makes all the desserts and this was the best chocolate cake I&#39;ve ever had...there was something seriously magical that the pear marmalade created in this dish...I know that sounds cheesy...but I literally had to close my eyes while I took the first few bites, because it was such an intense and unique taste/experience. 

They were playing blues music in the background which made my boyfriend very very happy. Additionally, the ambience was intimate, Indy eclectic&#39;ish (took me back to my Portland days :), and romantic. 

Dining here, I felt as though my whole body was tasting and experiencing the food it was that good. Ahh...such a wonderfully fulfilling dinner and evening!"

It reminded me of SF restaurants (small little bistros). I came on a Saturday night &amp; got lucky because they were already full for the night by 6PM but a group of 4 canceled thus allowing my party to replace them. They do not take reservations but I called at noon that morning, like others suggested, to get my name on the waitlist. They told me to call 30 minutes before the time I wanted to arrive to get put on the waitlist but when I called they were already booked. They were also hosting an abstract art viewing night at 9PM there. The restaurant is to the right of the Bluebird Theater and is super small and easy to miss. The interior is cute with white wainscot by the kitchen area (which is exposed and viewable) and a classic/original architecture door frame with thick dark wood. There were a couple little kids in the restaurant who I imagine were the daughters of the chefs/waitresses. There were 2 chefs &amp; 2 waitresses running the show so it took some time for us to get our order taken. Our waitress was super friendly &amp; fun. They were out of the Spanish octopus (smaller dish/appetizer) that night that we came so I am assuming this is a very popular dish.

What I tried:
1. Cornmeal Waffle            9
Roasted pork shoulder, coleslaw
2. Yakama Sturgeon             23
Potato gnocchi, Picholine olives, zucchini
3. Duck Confit                19
Onion soubise, root veg, radish slaw
4. Bistro Steak                  20
Smoked parsnips, spinach, port reduction

They first start you off with a small bowl of boiled peanuts (shell on) that are drenched with some sweet brown sauce. This is their &#34;bread &amp; butter.&#34; It reminded me of being home because Vietnamese families often snack on boiled peanuts.The waffle appetizer itself wasn&#39;t too spectacular because it was a bit soft but the pulled pork on it was sweet &amp; tasty. The coleslaw was also nice &amp; subtle. The sturgeon was beautifully presented with thinly sliced zucchini. The waitress gave a side of almonds for us to toss on the top of the sturgeon. The duck confit was a perfect portion size &amp; was cooked to perfection. It was tender/moist &amp; the skin was full of flavor. The sauce at the bottom of the duck was onion based &amp; the slaw, similar to the waffle appetizer, was subtle &amp; fresh. The bistro steak was really smokey tasting &amp; was presliced for easy eating. I thought the beef was cooked very nicely but the smokey flavor was a bit too strong. It didn&#39;t allow for me to taste the natural flavor of the beef as much. They had a dessert menu that featured creme brulee (among other desserts) but I didn&#39;t order any (because I was the only 1 in my party that wanted dessert :( .....). I&#39;d love to try their bone marrow + desserts next time!"

But in that time, we&#39;ve tried to visit as many stand-out restaurants as possible.  I can say without hesitation that To the Wind is at the very top of the list.  Michelin Star-caliber food served with highly attentive and friendly service WITHOUT any pretension.  Get a seat at the chef&#39;s table if you can - and watch the masters at work.  The foie gras is as rich as it gets AND is a *huge* portion.  Entrees were perfect and desserts were positively sinful without being too sweet.

I wanted to write a review while the food was still fresh in my mind. We were seated to boiled peanuts that were not unpleasant but not my taste. The we had the bone marrow which was to be spread on large, thick cut pieces of lightly buttered and toasted french sourdough. The bread was delicious as it was but then to add the mixture of quail egg and beef carpaccio and top it with fresh radishes was transcending. The best bite I&#39;ve had in Denver, really. Our entrees were equally outstanding. I had the duck which had so many layers and flavors going on. My husband had the scallops. The were plump and perfectly seared.  Dessert was pineapple upside down cake and cream brulle. Wait staff and kitchen staff all friendly. Would love to go back  again soon."

We had seen a couple of great reviews in the Post and Westword. We have been hesitant with Westword reviews ever since our experience at Lower 48. This experience was different. 
We showed up fairly early, which was fortuitous. We sat at &#34;the bar&#34; immediately, but watched as people that showed up minutes were put on an hour long list. Timing is everything. 
You may ask why the wait was so long, the restaurant is very small, and that is a definite positive. The atmosphere was comfortable. It was the exact opposite of the Cheesecake Factory in every possible way. I could talk more about the ambiance, but that isn&#39;t nearly as important as the food. 
To start we were served boiled peanuts. I had never eaten boiled peanuts, despite the fact that I left Denver for nearly a decade and lived in the south. I was tempted many times to grab some boiled peanuts at the local gas station, but I never did. I can&#39;t attest to those gas station peanuts, but the boiled peanuts here were delicious. Cocktails were whiskey-centric, and included the greatest hits. We ordered the Spanish octopus as an appetizer, and were both surprised and ravenous. Everything about the dish was unexpected, and appreciated. 
I ordered the Berkshire pork chops, and they blew my expectations away. They were supremely fatty, as I hoped, but the crust was a perfect counterpoint to the buttery fat. The strained yogurt, mung beans, pancetta, and baby carrots complimented and enhanced the dish. My wife had the rockfish. I can&#39;t tell you how good it was, all I can say is that it must have been amazing because she refused to give me a single bite. She is from New Orleans, and she cleared her plate, which is high praise. We ordered the stout chocolate cake for dessert, and it did not fail to astound. The cake was soft and moist, and the coconut flakes provided an amazing textural counterbalance. 
This place is amazing, and I hope nobody ever treads this review because we want it all to ourselves."

Not sure if they&#39;re still doing this, but at arrival rather than having bread to start, they brought out boiled peanuts! Nice touch! Spiced with something I couldn&#39;t place, but definitely a great way to start out. I had the Escargot Empanadas to start and a chicken dish that I don&#39;t believe is still on the menu, unfortunately. 

Everything was completely delicious. No complaints whatsoever! The staff was very friendly and attentive. The space is extremely small, which I believe helps to keep the food quality above average. Though I visited in a slower time when they were still brand new, so it wasn&#39;t over crowded or noisy. I could see that happening, though.

Me? I got no complaints about the somewhat limited menu since they&#39;re doin&#39; a great job of keepin&#39; it focused; and everything we had was superb. 

Sat at the chef&#39;s bar/table and watched &#39;em do their kitchen magic, up close and personal (my favorite place to eat when it&#39;s just my honey and I out to dinner).

As starters we had the braised endive salad with blue cheese, and the Spanish octopus (now that was an interesting and surprisingly tasty dish:). Followed that up with the trout and a sturgeon special they had that night and they were two of the finest, most succulent fish dishes I can remember having had in years. Accompanied the food with a modest pinot noir that was just great, and congratulated ourselves at discovering one of the newer dining gems Denver&#39;s throwin&#39; down these days.

Don&#39;t know what they can do about it, but the storefront door opens directly onto the diners at the chef&#39;s bar/table, so be careful if you&#39;re thinkin&#39; about visiting during the course of a blizzard. But other than that, no complaints or suggestions to offer other than to kindly recommend that they keep hittin&#39; it outta the park &#39;cause they&#39;re rackin&#39; up their fans with what they&#39;re doin&#39; now.

Highly recommend both the waffle and bone marrow. We ordered the chicken and biscuits and the steak. Both were good, but we couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the appetizers. The blood orange creme brûlée was amazing. The thick, sugar shell on top was to die for. You could smell and taste the blood orange flavor. It was perfect. Definitely go here.

My husband enjoyed the duck, repeating many times how perfectly the flavors melded. My rockfish was ok. While it was cooked just right, flaky and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside, it fell a bit flat in taste.

Before I get into what was fantastic, I will let you know the bad things.  First the parking sucks because its right next to the Bluebird theater.  Then its a little small, but I feel it adds to its charm.

The food WOW and the service is good too!

What we had:
1.) Spanish Octopus - Very good, never had it uniquely like this, full of the flavor and adding it with the Jicama slaw with the Macadamia nuts, what a combination.
2.) Cornmeal Waffle - WOW talk about bursting with so many flavors of sweet, sour, and just great pork flavor.  
3.) Rock Fish - Full of flavor, this is a citrus flavored dish and the fish was prepared so well.
4.) Preserved Yakama Sturgeon - This was extremely good too.  Much different than the Rock Fish.  This was buttery, fresh still, but it had this hearty warming flavor to it.  The Sturgeon was prepared so well it melted in my mouth.  The Gnocci is made fresh and it was fantastic!

Overall, please do try this because it is absolutely fantastic."

Upon the advice of the staff, I ordered the sturgeon - best I&#39;ve had.  Everything from start to finish was a great experience; and the prices didn&#39;t break my back.  We were able to order a drinks, two entrees, and two deserts for under $70 for what I&#39;d most certainly consider fine dining.  

**If you&#39;re looking at the pictures - don&#39;t get too hung up on the appearance and sizes; they almost look like tapas.  Rest assured, they&#39;re decent sized and the rich nature of the food was enough to leave us full and happy.

**About me: I tend to leave reviews for either horrible experiences or wonderful experiences.  You can guess which side I took on this one.  I had one of those nights where I said to myself, &#34;this was too damn good to not give a review - they earned it&#34;

And that would be a shame friends. This tiny eatery on Colfax immediately became a new favorite for Sir Nicholas and I when we ventured in for a date night recently for a variety of reasons.

+ The menu is small, but so full of delicious items that making a choice was difficult.
+ The beer and wine lists are also small with the same amount of delicious offerings.
+ The staff here are so, so friendly.
+ The atmosphere is cozy.

Nick and I shared two small plates:

+ A Warm Squash Salad with whipped ricotta and confit tomatoes - a really lovely warm salad
+ Cornmeal Waffle with roasted pork shoulder and coleslaw - Yes, this is as good as you are imagining based on the name alone.

And two bigger plates:
+ Bistro Steak  with onion puree, green beans, and gorgonzola - So good I didn&#39;t want to share even though I ordered it with the intention to do so
+ Buttermilk Chicken with new potatoes, bitter greens, and corn relish - Nick felt the same about his chicken.

A cool thing they offer is a prix fixe menu that changes daily. It&#39;s three courses for $39 and everyone at the table has to participate. I believe for a bit extra they&#39;ll add in beer pairings.

The only problem I had with our dinner there was that the dining room was super, super cold so I would recommend bringing a sweater if you chill easily.

I&#39;m really excited to have To The Wind nearby and am looking forward to heading back sometime soon."

It was one of the best dining experiences I&#39;ve had in Denver. Since we had a group, we literally tried everything on the menu. The menu is rather small, but with every dish having delicious, unique ingredients, it&#39;s more than enough variety. 
To start, our waitress, Reanna, told us they were out of the prawns, which obviously wasn&#39;t a big deal. I only bring this up, because a few appetizers in, she surprised us with the prawns, on the house. The Fois Gras Torchon and Panzanella were absolutely incredible, but the general consensus of the table was that the Bone Marrow took the cake. Any time I&#39;ve had marrow, its been a smaller, round bone, but To The Wind serves the whole bone, sliced in half lengthwise. The first one we got was shallow, but before we even dug in, Reanna told us sometimes that happens, and she gladly brought us one with more marrow. 
As far as entrees go, the Rockfish was my favorite-- cooked perfectly, so much flavor that you almost don&#39;t even want to swallow it. The Buttermilk Chicken was also a table favorite. The portions here are very generous, and every entree was just as pleasing aesthetically as it was flavor-wise. I highly recommend the Duck Confit also. 
As amazing as the food and wine was, I have to say, the service is what really brought our experience over the top. Reanna was extremely sweet, knowledgable, funny, and attentive. We were the last people in the restaurant, but she never once got impatient with us. The chef&#39;s seemed in good spirits on the way out as well. Reanna told us that To The Wind is owned by a husband and wife, and you can absolutely tell. There is a family vibe there that sets this bistro apart from any other restaurant I&#39;ve been to. It&#39;s obvious that the people who are a part of To The Wind really put passion in to what they do, and, to me, that&#39;s where the best food is derived from."

I checked out their Great American Beer Fest dinner several months back and was satisfied; this encore with Great Divide has moved me. Sun Tzu famously says in Art of War that there are only 5 basic tastes - sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami - but that there are an infinite amount of combinations to entice the palate. TTWB exec chef Royce has mastered the art of balancing these flavors in the perfect ratio to complement different styles of beer. The abalone salad with the Hades Belgian, foie gras torchon with the Old Ruffian Barleywine, and stilton and chocolate pot de crème with the Yeti Imperial all renewed my faith in food - what I ate this evening was divine and beyond worthy of the food gods. If you&#39;ve been searching for a truly exceptional beer-food pairing, search no further; To The Wind is the answer to your prayers."

Cocktail selection is a little lacking.  The food was absolutely amazing.  Everyone in the party tried something different, we basically ordered everything from the menus.

Note that they do not take reservations, so we called ahead and tried to show up early (around 6:00) as half our party had another obligation that evening. 
The staff saved us a table, which is pretty great considering there is only seating for around 20 people in this restaurant. The drink list is small but reasonably priced; I got a red Zin that was very reasonably priced and quite tasty. We ate a few of the boiled peanuts that are served on every table but they weren&#39;t really our thing. We ordered a cheese plate to start and it was fine but our server didn&#39;t tell us what any of the cheeses were so we were a bit on our own trying to figure them all out. 
For mains we ordered most of the menu: pork, chicken, and I think steak. All the entrees were very good. My chicken was very well cooked and all the flavors across the meals made a lot of sense. 

We decided to order dessert and we went with the lemon tart. My husband put it best when he said &#34;these are cooks trying to bake&#34; meaning they didn&#39;t do a very good job. The &#34;curd&#34; of the lemon tart had the consistency of a pudding that hasn&#39;t set yet...it dribbled out of the crust as soon as we cut into it. The poor crust was just not well made; very brittle and hard, probably not enough fat and just not very well executed. It didn&#39;t taste bad but the textures were not right; these chefs are very good chefs but not bakers, or at least not yet. 

On the plus side, in addition to the great flavors of our dinners, we were admiring the art all night. We decided to come home with a painting from the restaurant and the staff went above and beyond to package it up, and contact the local artist to alert her of the sale and get us her card. I had a great time here and I&#39;d happily come back but I will likely wait to give other people the opportunity to discover this great new restaurant on East Colfax."

Second, drink selection - not large, but well thought out, with interesting choices for wine and beer too! Tastings offered, cool. Water filtered, why don&#39;t all restaurants offer free filtered water?
Third, food - six appetizers (we had five) and five entrees (we split one).
Each one was brought with a full explanation, and best of all, the succeeding one was not brought until the prior one was finished. This made for a relaxing pace (no rush to turn tables here!). All were delicious and unique.

I was lucky to join my colleague from CA and his friend from Denver to eat at this place a few days ago. 

We had the duck empanadas and bone marrow for appetizers. The empanadas were really good and the bone marrow was very well prepared, luxurious and a special treat. 

For meals, the three of us had Lamb Osso Buco (me), Buttermilk Chicken (the local guy) and Sturgeon with Clams (the other guy from CA). The other guys enjoyed their meals. My lamb was one of the best things I have eaten. Super tender, rich sauce and  served over a creamy polenta. 

I had a couple of the BSB Red Rye Farmhouse Ales with dinner (excellent beer) and instead of a typical dessert, I had a glass of Ransom Old Tom Gin which was listed on the dessert menu. It was just a nice small glass of cold gin with a bit of citrus peel in it. Wow - it was a perfect end to a great meal. 

The food and drink menus were very well thought out and had some great choices.

As others have said, it is a very small place but that is part of the charm. We got there around 6 pm on a Tuesday evening and there was no wait - but we did get the last available table."

We chose the salmon and the chicken &amp; gnocchi for our main courses.  Both fish and fowl were cooked &amp; portioned to perfection.
 
I have to rave about the pillowy deliciousness of the gnocchi! 
I truly believe the gnocchi are the best we have tasted in Denver - I know this is a large statement.

I got the buttermilk chicken, and it was the most moist, perfectly seasoned chicken I have eaten in recent memory! We polished off our meals and followed it with the chocolate torte, which was topped with homemade whipped cream - again AMAZING, chocolatey, and moist.  The wait between ordering and receiving our meals was longer than other places, but once we got our entrees, that wait was forgotten.

To diners - I recommend that you call ahead about 1 hour to 30 minutes before you plan to come and eat to put your name on the wait list (if there is one).  It&#39;s a small restaurant with limited seating, which means every plate gets the chef&#39;s attention, and you can tell!"

Food was just okay... Nothing memorable as far as flavor even though the menu had a lot of &#34;flair&#34; to it.  Staff were friendly and nice.  The bone marrow was most disappointing.  Not a lot of bone marrow (maybe a tablespoon worth at most)  and there were a lot more &#34;toppings&#34; than the actual bone marrow which took away from the flavor.  The bread that came with the dish was tastier actually.  The eggplant and buffalo mozz appetizer also fell flat.  Pate with fois gras was just ok... We had something else but I can&#39;t even remember what it was since it was not memorable.  If you are a foodie then you will most likely be disappointed and go away hungry.

These are some of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had (and I am no stranger to seeking out great food).  So far, I&#39;ve tried the Buttermilk Chicken, Lamb Osso Bucco &amp; Bistro Steak entrees.  All three were equally thoughtful, complex and perfectly delicious.  Each plate carefully combines flavors you don&#39;t come by very often or at all.  Every bite is a euphoric adventure.  

The atmosphere and service are well above average.  Friendliest and most helpful staff in any CO restaurant. They had useful tips about how to enjoy the food, recommendations, etc. that were actually very informative and helpful.  They clearly thought out every aspect of this food and have very purposefully curated this experience.  

It&#39;s a very small restaurant, so expect a wait (no reservations, only call aheads) -- but, you won&#39;t regret it.  It&#39;s on a trendier block of Colfax, so there are plenty of decent places to grab a drink while you wait.  Even as they explained the wait to me, she was just so friendly and personable that I was really happy about the whole experience.   

Before discovering this gem, Black Cat in Boulder had my favorite food.  To the Wind&#39;s food is slightly more thoughtful and pleasing while costing less.  It&#39;s also a much less stuffy environment -- much more inviting and enjoyable.  The drink list is very thoughtful as well.  I discovered a couple new local beers that have also become my new favorites.

Out of the other dishes I tried (Duck Empanadas, Spanish Octopus &amp; La Tur Cheese for appetizers; Bread Pudding, Creme Brulee &amp; Choc Cake for desserts), the Spanish Octopus &amp; Choc Cake were equally as surprisingly delicious as the entrees.  The chocolate cake with a taste of the tap local oatmeal stout was an enlightening experience!

This place will ruin you for all other restaurants, but it&#39;s well worth it!"

I love duck, and stout, and was not let down with this dish. Only wish I could have had the whole thing to myself! Next time.
Dessert, baba is a must order, I am a chocoholic and it was one of the most delicate and scrumptious, perfectly balanced desserts. Chocolate stout cake was good, I have a bias against citrus and chocolate but if that&#39;s your thing I think you will enjoy it just fine. Can&#39;t wait to make this a regular spot for dinner!"

My father was in town, and he leaves in a food desert so he likes to come visit and eat his way through denver.  We hit 3 marquee restaurants around town, you know the hot spots, and to the wind along with a few brunch spots.  All of the diners agreed that To the Wind was the best meal we had!  

I had the buttermilk chicken, and i normally don&#39;t like chicken at restaurants but it was recommended, and it was great.  The wife had the Gnochi and it was great!  My father had the duck.  All of the entrees were excellent.  My step mother had a salad, which she liked.

We also had a waffle, goat cheese and the sweetbreads.  Again, all were solid but I didn&#39;t like the sweatbreads a ton.  But my father loved them.  

They have a great whiskey selection, and beer selection.  Not a ton of diversity but what they had was well rounded.  Solid wine selection.

Only downside is you have to call ahead to get seating.  Its too small to walk in, and they don&#39;t take reservations."

My crab cream cheese wonton was undercooked :(  I noticed the color of the wontons and they were very pale. Opened it up and the bottom was doughy.

Most places just fry up some frozen battered chicken (like you&#39;d get with sweet &amp; sour) and drizzle on some Tsao-ish sauce.

Little Panda gets it right! (And that first, overcooked dish hasn&#39;t happened again since.)

We read the other reviews and figured the food would be fairly reliable. It was, by far, the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten, and I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Chinese food.

I never order sweet and sour anything, but we wanted something with pineapple. Not only did the sweet and sour pork not come with pineapple, it did not come with any vegetables whatsoever- no bell pepper, onion, nothing. The sauce was thin and brown (not even the usual crappy neon stuff) and tasted extremely bitter. The closest thing I could equate it to would be sweet and sour motor oil. The pork was in hard, overcooked lumps that were barely chewable. So bad we called to ask for our money back (which, nicely enough of them, they complied).

The veggie egg rolls and fried rice were passable, but if you can&#39;t even do sweet and sour sauce right, something there is very, very wrong."

Not to worry...the owner...yes!...the owner of phillys called me, apologized and said my stuff was headed my way, with some extras!!

Long story short, I expected it to be cold, undercooked and expectedly voodoo cursed!...BOY was I wrong!!!!...IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!.....30 minutes and 1 buffalo philly, 1 original w Cheez wiz...3 cannollis and some magically delicious breaded delight w marinara later...DADDY WAS HAPPY!!

It was so good! Fresh, meaty and flavorful. The bread was absolutely complimentary to the texture of the perfectly seasoned animal flesh mound located between those two fluffy grain brains.

However, I will say that they do make a tasty ass sandwich (sub, etc.). Heavy and filling, I&#39;m glad they are close. My $8 sub was and yummy and I kept going back for &#34;just one more bite&#34; until all that was left was foil. 

Tucked inside the Peak to Peak Tap room, we had to double-check where PoP was located. Simple menu, but that is a huge plus since they can focus and this uses good thing. 

Filled with meat, this cheeseSTEAK is not pumped up with veggies or too thick bread. The mushrooms and peppers were an accompaniment to the meat, and like the provolone cheese (3 options of cheese: American, Cheez Whiz, or provalone) was a match that did not overwhelm the star of the sandwich. 

The bread was also just right. As I understand it, a true Philly cheesesteak has a particular bun I&#39;m too lazy to google for this review. Well, The bread here may not be that particular type, but it really enhanced to cheesesteak. It was soft, but firm on the outside. Hard to explain. Let&#39;s just leave it at the fact it was perfect for the sandwich not too much to where you can&#39;t taste the meat.

Good cheesesteak."

The cannolis (2 for $3) were SO SMALL. Like, almost a joke how small these cannolis were. Garlic knots were just little lumps of bread covered in chunks of garlic and some parmesan. They were okay. The marinara dipping sauce was pretty bland though. Delivery got here fast and driver seemed very nice. Unfortunately doesn&#39;t make up for the food... It isn&#39;t terrible but for the price it&#39;s just not good. $8-9 for a cheese steak. I can&#39;t believe I even tried them out."

His van is a little shady, like a scary Mystery Machine, but the food is incredible. 

I had the &#34;Heisenburger&#34; which was an all beef patty stuffed with cream cheese and covered with peppers from New Mexico (hence the name). I inhaled it within 30 seconds and I&#39;m currently considering getting another.

I would give him more stars, if only Yelp would let me. Legitimately one of the best burgers of my life."

Both dishes were very good. The meats were tender and flavorful, which isn&#39;t always the case in Asian type restaurants. The drunken noodles were a little sweeter than I prefer, but it was still very good. The tropical fried rice was the winner between the two, though. I will definitely be back to re-order this-- it was delicately flavored, and just scrumptious. They didn&#39;t skimp on any of the fruits, nuts, etc that come in the dish. A little drizzle of soy sauce gave it just enough salt to make it really magical. The default heat level of dishes here seems to be somewhere around a 2 out of 5; just enough for a little kick without burning your lips or mouth off."

You also don&#39;t get soup with lunch which was a little disappointing. Last time we got take out there for lunch, even though both meals should have come with a spring roll and fried rice, we only got fried rice in one of the containers, and only a single spring roll, which left me a little sad.

They said it would be 45 minutes and it was about 10, I honestly don&#39;t know how they cooked everything and drove it over that fast, but fine by me! We devoured it all, no regrets.

Their food is so authentic and amazing, the prices are right and it is obviously prompt for delivery. This place and Aungs are the best for local Thai."

It has always been my favorite thai dish so I thought I would try it from this place! It was fine, but it didn&#39;t have an option for the level of spiciness like other place I have tried... So it was very sweet and a little dry to be honest. I wish it had more sauce and broccoli. I also wish it had carrots. All of the other pad selews I have had have had carrots.

The prices are very reasonable, absolutely a good deal. Plus when we went they were doing a special - half off wine and only $1.50 for any beer you want. 

My boyfriend ordered hot and sour soup, and it was too spicy for him, so he set it aside. As the they were cleaning off the table one of the girls noticed he didn&#39;t finish his soup, so she asked if he didn&#39;t like it. He told her it was too spicy so she took it off the bill for us!

We should have known when the utensils given out were forks instead of chopsticks and the menu had selections from thai, japanese, vietnamese, and chinese.  A little of every asian culture but nothing done well.  First left me dissect the pad thai...it was gross.  I have never had pad thai that had an orange colored sauce on it.  Please see my photos...it tasted like KETCHUP...what the heck...horrible...like inedible and the asian in me took it home and promptly tossed it in the garbage...I never throw out leftovers so that&#39;s a huge deal.  The other noodle dish was so heavily sauced with a sickeningly sweet sauce...please see Frank T&#39;s review as I totally agree with him...this was pretty yuck too and I also threw out the leftovers...we barely ate any...a total waste of money especially when the prices weren&#39;t super cheap.

Nothing you get on your plate shows any signs of being prepared with care or passion. This place might as well belong to Sodhexo or some other institutional food processor.

Both the Pad Thai and the Lo Mein are prepared with way too much sugar. In fact the entire menu is full of items with too much sugar.

The ingredients themselves all seem fresh and everything looks appetizing. Unfortunately nothing served here is really good. It&#39;s sad more than anything else.

The interior is clean and spacious and the environment is slick. There is a full bar but price wise it&#39;s not really a place to sit and drink at.

This location is the second Spicy Basil with the original downtown.

Nothing on this menu is authentic Asian. It offers Asian style food trying to represent many different parts of Asia.

The one thing this restaurant does that other Asian restaurants in the area do not do is open before 12:00 on weekends.

If you are desperate for something that tastes vaguely Asian and you are hungry eating at Spicy Basil won&#39;t get you sick with anything other than regret and sadness."

We especially liked the spicy basil shrimp, with great veggies in a great sauce.  By contrast, the Pad Thai was not good.  

The night we were there, they featured two for one craft beers and glasses of wine.

Overall a great dining experience, and one soon to be repeated."

Oh how I do like my eats to be a well balanced combo of cheap and delicious. Spicy Basil is just that sort of place! I received a to-go menu in mail, so I decided to check it out.

The first thing that caught my eye was a huge sign reading &#34;Happy Hour! Buy 1, Get One Free!&#34; Okay, sign me up. We were greeted immediately upon entering by two, super nice waitresses. The building is brand new and super clean, complete with a huge T.V, digital fireplace and nice restrooms. The booths and chairs were particularly comfy. 

We started out with our buy one, get one bottled cold sake. Both types were amazing, they offer three different types of cold and hot sake. Spicy Basil also has wine, beer and cocktails. (Wine by the glass was quite the hefty pour indeed!) I have yet to try their cocktails. 

Spicy Basil&#39;s menu has quite the mix of authentic Asian cuisine. Everything from Hunan to Vietnamese to Japanese. We got an appetizer each, an order of fresh shrimp salad rolls and crab ragoons. Both were good, although I liked the crab ragoons better. It came time to order, I had trouble deciding what I wanted. My boyfriend got the Seafood Satay with fried rice and I ended up getting the Udon Yakisoba with shrimp. The wait for our food was not long at all, plus we had sake to drink! 

The food was just what we wanted. Flavorful, perfectly cooked and delicious. This is what I call comfort food. His satay was a mix of scallops, tuna and shrimp skewered over a bed of veggies with a delicious sauce. My yakisoba was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delightful! Not sure I will get it again because I want to try everything! Both of our seafood was cooked perfectly, nothing was overdone. We ended up eating everything on the plate. 

To finish of our meal we decided to get a Vietnamese Iced coffee. Spicy Basil serves this drink traditionally with the coffee and condensed milk steeping and a separate glass full of ice. It was so good, whatever coffee beans they used were to die for! I will definitely be back for round 2 Spicy Basil!"

The pad Thai was weird as it had a red coloring almost like they threw a bunch of sweet and sour in. The chicken tasted funky. Everything tasted like it was defrosted in the microwave. Even the dumplings seemed thawed and microwaved. I ordered $50 worth of food and threw away almost all of it.

The food is decent, nothing above and beyond. See below a list of my dislikes. 

I adore the Thai Curry Lamb, but it really lacks in the meat. It&#39;s mostly veggies. 

I go there often for business meetings, and often, they will bring 1 or 2 orders out, and there will literally be up to a 10 minute wait for subsequent orders to come out. Not cool. The orders that have arrived are sitting and getting cold, while those people politely waiting for others to get their meals. It&#39;s ridiculous."

We ordered the basil fried rice and the drunken noodle (I was dreaming of the drunken noodle dish all day). We also ordered the pad Thai to go for my mom. 

The food was okay. This place is not very authentic; it was not spicy even when I ordered extra spicy. Also, they do not have the mango and sticky rice dessert that is usually served at every Thai place!!If you want authentic, spicy Thai food I would not recommend this place. I give this place two stars just for their excellent service! Our servers were very nice and attentive, though."

The quantities were substantial and again, the presentation was very nice.  My favorite touch was the rice was pressed into a heart shape!

The first time, we ordered take out, and last time we ate in. I got the kung pao chicken both times. It&#39;s a seemingly-Thai preparation. I&#39;ve never had kung pao chicken that was made with coconut milk before, but it&#39;s delicious. The vegetables that they use are fresh. There were bell peppers and onions along with a generous portion of chicken and the traditional peanuts.

My wife enjoys the pot stickers, and I did, too. They&#39;re full of meat. We order ours fried, but you can get them steamed if you like. They came perfectly-cooked and with a nice presentation.

Last time, she ordered sesame chicken. It&#39;s pretty tasty, but most appealing is that it comes  served with fresh steamed broccoli. I really appreciate it when a restaurant takes the time and effort to use fresh, not frozen vegetables. It shows that the chef cares about the quality of food that is leaving the kitchen.

The restaurant is a clean, open space with an ample beer and sake menu. One note: The TV was on when we were there, and it was fairly loud where we were sitting, but we were still able to engage in conversation. I&#39;m sure that they would have turned it down a bit had we asked. 

Neither the wife nor I had adult beverages, but they are available if you choose to partake. This will be my go-to Asian restaurant in the neighborhood. Food quality is good. Two meals, a single non-alcoholic beverage, and an appetizer came to right around $30, so the prices are reasonable as well. We will return."

Ordered a glass of Merlot (again) and it came out ice cold (again)....gross. Ordered the Thai Peanut Chicken. After about 15 minutes my food came out, only it was he wrong dish. The waitress had mixed up my order and the lady at the table next to me. Unfortunately, she delivered the lady next to me first and she took a bite out of the dish. Waitress told me the kitchen would make me a new dish - well I would hope so since someone just ate off the plate. Literally THREE minutes later (yes, I timed it as I was HUNGRY), she brought my food out. Well, I don&#39;t know about you, but I would most certainly wonder if it was actually a new dish due to the extremely quick cook time, so I asked. She said &#34;you don&#39;t believe me??&#34; to which I replied &#34;it only took 3 minutes to cook.&#34; I didn&#39;t want to make a scene at the restaurant but you and I both know you cannot thoroughly cook chicken in 3 minutes, so I&#39;m positive they took the plate that someone had eaten off of and replated it.

The Calamari is more than generous despite being just the core. I had specified tentacles and someone was kind enough to call me and let me know that they didn&#39;t have &#39;em-- so considerate!

The Peanut Curry is just spectacular. The right heat, the right texture, a terrific variety of veggies... I&#39;m so chuffed!

To top it off, the delivery mister from Eat24 was just the sweetest dumpling!

Not that being on the bland side of things is bad, which I understand for a lot places who serve the masses, but this place does it right. I&#39;ve ordered from them thrice now and been happy each time.

Green curry, pad thai, spring rolls, and pot stickers are all excellent. You could do a lot worse by not ordering from them. I would suggest it and I&#39;m kind of a prick &amp; picky eater, so you won&#39;t be disappointed."

It is completely solid American style Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese. If you&#39;re looking for authentic It-feels-like-I&#39;m-in-Bangkok/Shanghai/Hanoi-right-now food then you&#39;re gonna wanna look elsewhere but these guys make food that is still fast, fresh and delicious. I even liked their spring rolls which I ordinarily despise for being tasteless wads of grease, noodles, sparing meat and crispy crap meant to be dipped in thin, died red syrup. I honestly have no idea why I continue to try putting them in my mouth but when I did this last time I was pleasantly not disgusted! I ate both of them! :D

Oh, and when I say fast? I mean FAST! I have ordered delivery online before and it was at my door 20 minutes later. For those of you who frequently order delivery you understand that that is sehr unusual but a welcome surprise! Their summer wraps are pretty delicious thanks to the thick salty/sweet peanut sauce. When I&#39;ve had these other places they have herbs inside but I rarely come across this in the Denver area. I will say every time I meet a Summer Wrap with not herbs and only lettuce it makes me a little sad... But then there is peanut sauce so I still feel like a winner in the end... 

My friend really likes their veggie pad thai. I like it with shrimp and while I won&#39;t say it is the very best pad thai I&#39;ve ever had, I will say that this is filling, satisfying and fresh and they give you a whole hell of a lot. Even during lunch! 

Oh and soft shell crab lovers? Get the dish called One Night in Bangkok. I effin&#39; love that ish! Karee curry, steamed veggies and soft shell crab? I can eat that curry sauce with a spoon and the crab and the veggies and the rice can go home.... No wait! Come back, I was kidding!

I have never seen the inside of this place since I shamelessly order delivery all the time. From what I hear, it&#39;s pretty nice though. Can&#39;t comment on service other than the fact that, like I said, delivery is usually insanely quick and the dudes that bring it are super friendly."

I ordered Drunken Noodle with chicken to go, and it was done in about 4 minutes (should&#39;ve been my first clue). I brought it home, and opened the container to: overcooked rice noodles, a horrible soy broth, no vegetables, some wilted basil, and the rubberiest &#34;chicken&#34; (in quotes because I&#39;m not sure it was chicken) that must have been frozen for the last decade before they cooked it.

Took one bite of noodles, spit it out. And then one bite of chicken, and spit that out too. Threw it away after those two bites- a first for me. 

Don&#39;t go... Trust this Thai loving California girl."

After that great experience I just had to order it for delivery today when the craving for Asian food hit me. The portions from this restaurant are HUGE!  If that wasn&#39;t reason enough the fact that everything I&#39;ve had from them is delicious should help convince you. My first visit I had the peanut beef and gyoza which was great and the leftovers lasted me through three whole days!  Today I got the golden pork chop with fried rice. The pork chop had so much flavor but my big winner was the fried rice. Spicy Basil&#39;s fried rice is probably the best I&#39;ve ever eaten!!  I definitely recommend this place!

As for the place in Englewood I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re even associated with them. 
Let me start off by saying that you have a 50/50 chance of getting a half decent meal or the most pathetic Chinese food you&#39;ve ever paid for here. They must treat their cooks like crap because it shows in their end product. I literally think the cook goes on smoke breaks and forces the hostess to cook the meals in his absence; that or there is some 12 year old back there pretending to be a chef. It&#39;s that bad at times. 
One time when I was dining in I ended up ordering some fried rice with my entree. When they brought my plate out I noticed they had just put oil in the rice and maybe heated it up a tiny bit. There was no salt, no soy sauce, no veggies, no egg, and above all absolutely no flavor. When I pointed this out to the waitress she argued with me that it was fried rice until I just told her to throw it away. 
I can literally go on and on and on with terrible experiences here but I feel like I&#39;m just wasting finger energy. I doubt they&#39;ll even care about this review."

In fact, I&#39;d have to say this is the best Thai we&#39;ve had since moving to Denver in August &#39;14. The restaurant is really nice with a modern feel to it and the food (Panag Curry w/ Chicken and the Pad Thai w/ Chicken) was great. The only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars is the fact that we still think our favorite Thai place in San Diego is better.

Staff was very friendly and attentive. Only reason I didn&#39;t give 5 stars was that usually when I order Thai food restaurants will ask you how hot you want the food and they did not. I think they did not ask about the spicy ness because it&#39;s an Asian fusion restaurant not an all Thai restaurant. Nonetheless it was very decent pad Thai. Boyfriend has Thai Bbq Chicken and it was very delicious! I loved the peanut sauce covering the chicken. Also the Spinach wontons were very delicious as well ! Cooked just perfectly with a good amount of cheese! Yum! Would like to eat here again and would recommend! Nice little place in Englewood!"

Most of the &#34;home cooking&#34; selections are bland, frozen food, barely better than school cafeteria fare. The Mexican food is a bit better (but, no Texan will be satisfied with bland, Colorado-Mex). Breakfast is their strongest area, but still nothing special.

The staff is very friendly, when you can wade through their thick accents. (It took me four tries to figure out that, &#34;Issno tebble jew wet ok?&#34; means there&#39;s a wait for a table.)

We gave them an honest try. Supporting small business is important to me. But I won&#39;t be back. Village Inn is much better (and that&#39;s bad)."

When only the freshest, most rib-sticking fare will satisfy, stop by Jus&#39; Grill in Aurora and prepare to be pleased, nay, delighted.

Breakfast items are a particular draw at Jus&#39; Grill, and for good reason - each dish I&#39;ve tried there has been very yummy indeed. Whether your little heart pines for some sticky-melty chocolate-chip pancakes, yearns after a plump crab-cake Benedict, or just can&#39;t do without an omelette chock-full of spinach, mushrooms, bacon and tomatoes, you can be sure every &#34;T&#34; will be crossed and every &#34;I&#34; dotted in the pursuit of prandial pleasure. But c&#39;mon now - you didn&#39;t think those were your only choices did you? Oh pleez! How about a skillet with bacon, sausage, *and* ham (plus peppers, onions, potatoes, cheese and two eggs)? Or that same bacon &#39;n&#39; eggs sandwiched between two fluffy waffles? Or biscuits &#39;n&#39; gravy, or a gargantuan caramel/pecan cinnamon roll? Or even a nice big bowl of oatmeal? (Some people do enjoy it, y&#39;know, so don&#39;t knock it &#39;til you&#39;ve tried it).

And I haven&#39;t even begun to talk about their lunch and dinner possibilities, so pull up a chair while I babble some more. The other day, I had some gooey mozzarella sticks and green chicken enchiladas with fried eggs that were both amazing. (Yes, I did eat them at the same meal, thankyouverymuch). But gosh, you could also do a burger with Anaheim and jalapeño peppers, or some slurpable spaghetti &#39;n&#39; meatballs, or a grilled tilapia fillet, or a lemon/pepper chicken breast, or a sirloin steak cooked to order! Not bad huh? And it gets even better when you consider their array of dessert options, from pie (apple, cherry, pecan) to cake (chocolate, carrot, coconut) to cobbler (they&#39;ve got a different one each month, so don&#39;t be a stranger). And those are only a few ideas for you to slobber over. I think when all is said and done, you&#39;ll agree that Jus&#39; Grill is, well, jus&#39; plain tasty."

They also have a bar! So of course I ordered a Bloody Mary! Nothing fancy but still delicious and refreshing.

For a first impression, I was nonplussed. The whole dining room, while quaint, felt like it needed a good vacuum or shampoo, not to mention a thorough dusting. I felt like I had to wash my hands after handling the menu, and I&#39;m not that type of person.

As for the food, my skillet was nothing as it should have been. The meat tasted microwaved warm, the eggs likely from a bag or carton, potatoes barely fried, and peppers and onions which seemed more warmed in hot oil than actually cooked. As for the hollandaise that blanketed the whole thing? I have had better hollandaise made from a powdered mix. I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was NOT hollandaise.

My wife&#39;s reuben sandwich was all corned beef without the added tastes of dressing, kraut, or rye.

The one redeeming factor were the pancakes. Light, fluffy, very good! Not those flat lifeless discs from other diners. I was surprised at how fast I ate it.

Overall, I doubt we will return. Which is a shame since it&#39;s very close, and our parents all like eating at diners when they visit."

We arrived at 1 pm for lunch and were seated right away.  The servers were quick to seat, take our orders, and deliver our food.  They are polite and brief.  They did deliver our check with our meal and let us know &#39;no rush&#39; but we never saw another server at our table again.  

The menu is vast, they offer everything and the kitchen sink.  It reminded me of the diners we use to go to as a kid and breakfast is served all day.  I ordered a breakfast skillet and my husband had a French dip sandwich.  The food was good, not excellent, served quickly, and a hearty portion.

She told me to go sit over by the wall, I was hesitant, as I didn&#39;t want her to forget all about me.   All told,  my pancake craving took about 40 minutes out of my day.

Along with their expansion, they definitely didn&#39;t let their menu suffer, nor the quality of their food. They have items that I can assure you would be in line with the best breakfast, brunch, or lunch, on any menu. If you are looking for good food for a great value, this place would be in line for a good dinner as well. 
As far as their food goes, I went with the beef and been burrito smothered in green chili. To my surprise, it had a very authentic taste. The meat was tender the beans were cooked perfectly, and the chili was delicious. The green chili was good, however I like my chili SPICY and this was the only place they missed on. The server recommended that I top it off with jalapeños, which I did, but it just wasn&#39;t what I was looking for. 
All in all, the food was good, hearty servings, and a great customer experience. I will definitely be back!"

On Tuesday morning (4/14/15), our breakfast was delivered quickly, and everything was delicious and appetizingly presented. (The Santa Fe Scramble with wheat toast for my boyfriend and the Denver Scramble with pancakes -- and real butter! -- for me.) Our server was efficient and remained friendly despite putting her off from taking our order numerous times. All the choices were so tempting, it was hard to choose! She paid attention to our needs without ever hovering, so she earned a healthy 20% tip. 

I later added a side of bacon to my order, requesting they make it crisp. Most restaurants can&#39;t be bothered to cook bacon to my taste. Even when I do specify &#34;crisp and dry&#34;, they still tend to bring me floppy, fatty bacon, which I detest. At Jus Grill, four bacon strips were delivered within just a few minutes and cooked to absolute perfection - very crisp and dry, deep red, but not burnt. I was already pleased but that really put it over the top for me. I only wish I could give a rating of more than 5 stars! We will definitely return to Jus Grill. 

One note: my Denver Scramble was pretty heavy on the diced green bell peppers. Some people might not like that, but I love bell peppers, so I didn&#39;t mind at all."

Despite the place being full I was seated right away.  The server spoke broken English so it was a little difficult communicating with her but the order was placed correctly - Chicken Fried Steak with English Muffins and eggs over medium.  The food came out suprisingly fast - maybe 5-10 minutes.  The portions for the price - $8 - were big.  Unfortunately the food wasn&#39;t very good.  The steak itself was actually pretty tasty, as was the homemade gravy, but everything else on the plate was pretty gross.  The eggs were way overcooked, totally hard yolks.  The hashbrowns were undercooked, mushy, and flavorless.  Even after dousing them in salt and pepper they were inedible.  The English Muffin was barely warm, not toasted at all and topped with some weird liquid margarine.  

I may come here again to try something on the Mexican side of the menu and see if that food has any more flavor, but my expectations are definitely low at this point."

The waitress did a good job taking and delivering our orders, she receives the only star I have awarded this restaurant. Also the chicken decor was a little cheesy but cute. I have been to Jus Grill three times and each time I have been disappointed however in the quality of the food. Today I ordered the Ruben sandwich with fries. The thinly sliced &#34;corned beef&#34; which should be salty and tender was flavorless and chewy. Although it was advertised that it had thousand island dressing, it was absent.  The sauerkraut, while it tasted fine, there was barely more than a tablespoon full on the whole sandwich. The &#34;Swiss cheese&#34; had less cheese in it than the chickens statues on the walls. It was more like cheese whiz without the yellow food coloring. The french fries were limp right out of the kitchen. Hardly worth the money I paid for it. In addition my cousin has a food allergy to paprika along with a few other items which she provided to the kitchen ensure she was not served any of those items. She ordered the grilled salmon with rice pilaf, as long as the pilaf did not have anything on her list of allergens. Instead of rice pilaf she was brought french fries with, wait for it ...Paprika! Had she eaten it, it surely would&#39;ve been a quick ride to the emergency room.  The dish was return to the kitchen and within 10 to 15 minutes her original plate, that probably had paprika residue, was returned to her. The salmon was dry and tasted like it had been through microwave oven and the broccoli was cold.  The waitress was gracious enough not to charge her for her meal. The gentleman at the register whom I understand is a co-owner of the restaurant, asked how was our meal. I let him know that I was disappointed in the Reuben sandwich and he actually argued with me! No apology whatsoever, and I doubt he will be changing the recipe. Needless to say I will not be returning."

If  it&#39;s not a national chain it&#39;s not here or it&#39;s hard to find.

This is very much a greasy spoon type diner nestled in  the oddest of places.  The food is great.  The service is sometimes akward but always acceptable.

I would recommend this over more commercialized fare anytime."

There are no signs or anything directing me either way. Soon enough, a waitress asked me how many, grabbed a menu, and then showed me where to sit.

                When it comes to service, I like to be served with the perfect balance of interaction with the server.  The perfect balance would be a not rushing me so giving me at least seven minutes to look at my menu, and ask me for my drink right away. From the very beginning, I felt like my meal was rushed. Right when I sat down, I was questioned if I was ready to order. She did ask for my drink as well, which is a plus on good service. I ordered regular water and was brought a pitcher of lemon water, good thing I am not allergic to lemons. Another down side to my water is I was given a glass but no straw. I looked at the menu for a few minutes more until I was asked again if I was ready to order (again making me feel rushed). I gave in and ordered the turkey sandwich, priced at $7.99 which is advertised to have Swiss melted on top of turkey topped with avocado and a choice of grilled bread. I got just what was advertised. The only complaint I have is that I was not asked on what kind of bread I would like my sandwich on. The food would be the reason I went back to this place because it was absolutely amazing. They did not skimp out on my turkey at all. The bread, cheese, avocado, and turkey all blended perfectly. 

            I will defiantly be going back to Jus Grill because of the wide variety in the menu. They have everything on this menu from waffles to smothered burritos. The breakfast had items such as waffles, pancakes and a wide variety of different omelet. Lunch and dinner is where the authenticness settles in they have average American lunch and dinner including different soups, salads, and sandwiches as well as burgers, seafood, steaks, and pasta. They also offer a ton of Mexican entrees, such as: tacos, enchiladas and other authentic Mexican foods. Although their specialty is hard to determine I would say it is omelets because their menu is filled with different types.

            I am not one to be too picky on the cleanliness of restaurants, but I do believe the tables and carpets should not have stains on them. Jus Grill had an absolute clean restaurant my table had nothing on it but the condiments: jelly, hot sauce, ketchup, sugar, salt and pepper. The only down side of the table is it was a little small it was fine for just me but there is no way a family of four could have enjoyed a meal at the table, but there are booths and other tables that looked bigger that could defiantly fit a family. I usually feel uncomfortable sitting too close to the costumers next to me where I can hear their conversation. The layout of Jus Grill was very capable it was close but not close enough to where I was in other peoples conversations. I understand what it is like to work in restaurants and customer service business, but one thing that should always be on the workers&#39; mind is the cleanliness of their hands. The restaurant has a layout that I can see what is going on in the front side of the kitchen. I was watching what was going on in the kitchen when I saw a waitress touch a dirty rag and then put two pieces of toast in the toaster, without washing her hands in between. I mean we all do this when we are cooking for ourselves once in a while, but staff of the kitchen should be washing their hands every time they go to prepare food. 

            My overall favorite part about this place is the décor. The theme seems to be roosters. There are roosters everywhere, no matter what direction I look I would find about 2 roosters. It made the place seem more homely and less like a restaurant. 

           It is a simple family style restaurant. It&#39;s clean and the food is just like a home cooked meal. On interior design, the bathroom could use a little updating; it is a huge room with only one toilet (which had a few stains inside the bowl) and a sink. The service was unsatisfactory because of the unsanitary hands of the waitress and how I was not asked how my food was."

First off, the decor is kind of adorable, you can tell things haven&#39;t changed in a long time, and there are regulars everywhere. People know everyone&#39;s names and it&#39;s comfortable. Service was fine, nothing exceptional, nothing horrible. My glasses were filled and my food came out fast.

I had the chicken fried chicken, which I always judge a restaurant off of - and it was great! Huge portion and delicious. My husband had the guacamole burger, which he said was good, and the fries were YUM.

Burritos are HUGE and need four more bellies just so you are not rolled out in a wheel barrel.  
I have to say I have never had any spirits here, but they are not small drinks from what I have seen. 
There is every item under the sun and they serve full menu all day.  Great prices for the amount of food."

When we got there around 11 AM., the place was packed.  Its kinda small place inside the strip mall, about 3000 square feet.  Nothing special to write home about..  and I forgot to bring the coupons.. darn it.

We were seated promptly, the waitress came over quickly and brought the water and took the drink order.  

I must say, they had great selection of breakfast entries and also lunch and such.  Each of our order had big serving of breakfast potatoes (scalloped kind) and the usual sides of bacon, eggs and such..  I had waffle combo and the price was reasonable and tasted  good.  

Just like the sign, they serve home style cooked meal.  The food reminded me of Dimitri&#39;s on Havana before they sold it to someone else.. the menu reminded and price reminded me of Le Peep in the olden days.

I will definitely do the repeat business.  Keep up the good work.

Vegetarian green chili, three of the best words in my vocabulary. A rare find, and very good here! Green Chili in breakfast is awesome! There breakfast burrito is super yummy, very filling and a fantastic deal! Less than 6 bucks!

Service is friendly, owner is cool, just expanded it too, lots of room and lighting. Plus is a small business, love supporting my neighbors!

jus-grill-aurora,Jason N.,1QTTTHL-V7hWfGxWqor_RA,"Englewood, CO",0,1,0,0,4,NFAQJjt0KuVtogQJmIaWVQ,3.0,2014-03-29,"This was a good dinner with good service, but not  much for decor.  Just to be fair, I will say up front that I basically reserve 5 stars for a Gordon Ramsey quality restaurant.  If I was just rating  this place against similar styles of restaurants I would give it 4 out of 5.  

When you walk in the decor is pretty basic, but It looked very clean and well kept.  I also noticed the clientele was mostly over 50.   This is definitely not a place for 20 somethings to go out to on a friday night, but it might be a good place to stop in for a quick lunch or breakfast.

As I walked in I was greeted very nicely and brought to a table.  I started reading the menu and it had a lot of standard diner type food, such as pancakes, eggs, BLT&#39;s, and hamburgers.  The thing that threw me off was that the back half of the menu was all Mexican dishes.  I always get a little nervous when a restaurant can&#39;t decide what style of food they serve.  Also, the menu was a little too large.  It took me a while as a first time visitor to go through it all and decide what I wanted. 

After looking through the menu i decided to go with something light, a BLT with chicken noodle soup.  The chicken noodle soup came first and I thought it was one of the best chicken noodle soups I have eaten.  The veggies tasted like the soup was cooked freshly that day.  There were large pieces of celery and carrots that were nicely cooked but not mush.  The chicken looked like it was freshly grilled chicken breast cut it into small pieces.  The broth was very tasty and perfectly seasoned.  

Next my BLT came and it looked really good.  It was a large sized sandwich with perfectly grilled bread.  The lettuce and tomatoe looked very fresh and the bacon was large and crisp.

For desert I had a piece of coconut cake. It tasted like coconut cream pie.  My only complaint is that the cake was a little dry and had so much frosting on the outside that I could not eat that part.

Overall I had a good experience and will probably stop in again to try breakfast. If I have as good of an experience next time as I did today I probably will move my rating to 4 stars."

I ordered the chili-mac bowl, and man was I disappointed.  Imagine if you were to take a can of cheap, bean-less chili, mix it with about 2 cups of water and throw it over a large bowl of pasta; that is what I got.  Some sliced canned jalapenos and burnt to hell cheesy garlic bread slices garnished the bowl.  My husband&#39;s large plate of supreme nachos was absolutely nothing made of scratch, i.e. we could&#39;ve bought everything from King Soopers and spent less then the meal.  Husband also pointed out his beer glass was not cold...if that&#39;s important to you.  The best part of the meal was my salad, and only because I like house dressing.  

What attracted me to this place was the sense that everything there was comfort food...of course, not everything in any place is going to be made from scratch, BUT, its like, NOTHING was made fresh.  Even the nachos in the supreme nachos were cold and stale.  Honestly, I was embarassed after the meal because I had to convince my man to come out to this side of town just for a dinner.  I&#39;ve had worse, hence 2 stars...hopefully others have had a better experience."

These folks don&#39;t waste their time or money with a lot of nonsense, and this is the place for that kind of crowd.

They&#39;ve recently expanded - doubled the size of the dining room. I&#39;ve also noticed that this end of the parking lot is always full. Lots of good signs for Jus&#39; Grill. I had the breakfast chicken-fried steak and eggs. Large portions. The hash browns were okay - certainly not bad; but I imagined they&#39;d come with onions in a place like this. Everything else was really good. Fast service, food at the table almost immediately.

I have to admit, there isn&#39;t much to say about Jus&#39; Grill.

The food is good but not fall out of your chair good/great. The service is for those that like a hands off kind, they give you crafts of water or your drink so they don&#39;t have to keep refilling your glass. The decor is almost non-exist, and small tables.


The food as I said is good but nothing that I can&#39;t make at home. The flavoring is there but nothing pops. I had the stake and cheese enchiladas. The stake was flavored well and it came through with all the cheese and green chili sauce. The rice was just another version of Spanish Rice, some seasoning but not a lot.

Simon had the Jambalaya with a house salad. The dish had good flavoring and the pasta was cooked well. He did find a shrimp shell mixed in.  Our friend had the Tilapia fish with rice and broccoli. He said that the fish was cooked well, not dry and the rice and broccoli was good.


 After asking the waiter for a desert menu, I ordered a Sunday, Simon ordered a Apple Pie and our friend ordered a Blueberry Pie. The pies were reheated. Simon&#39;s was nice a warm but our friend&#39;s pie had sections that were still frozen.

Over all, I can&#39;t help but think of Jus&#39; Grill, as just another grill/restaurant with a large menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good food but not great. Ok service and small tables. If you don&#39;t feel like cooking and want to spend little money, Jus&#39; Grill is the place to go. Maybe we&#39;ll go back for breakfast, as I hear that it what they are known best for."

How can you tell if a place gives a crap? I walk over to give the cashier the coupon sheet I got in the mail, she takes scissors out, cuts out the one I am going to use and gives me back the rest. Most places grab the whole sheet, heaven forbid we would come back again and use ANOTHER coupon.

I had the corn dog which is a beef hot dog dipped in a root beer batter that is super light and airy and creates a very crispy exterior.  You can get whatever type of dog you want too (veggie, chicken, etc).  I paired it with a side of onion rings which were fried to perfection and went perfectly with ketchup.  

My husband had the Downtowner which was a bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog served on a sweet Hawaiian roll and topped with pickles, mustard, ketchup and more.  He had a side of chili cheese tater tots which were AWESOME!

Did I mention the chili is delicious?   It&#39;s a smooth chili, not chunky whatsoever, seasoned well and goes great with crispy tater tots and melts in your mouth with the cheese sauce.

Today I tried the one night in bangkok, which is a spicy thai currywurst (does pack some heat but not ridiculous) with haus slaw, peanut sauce and crushed peanuts. You either need a fork as the smaller buns are hard to hold with all of the toppings or a lot of napkins as holding it gets messy quickly.

I tried their fries, which were salted well and crispy but not burnt. 

For Yelp you get a free slider with dog or burger purchase. It was actually phenomenal with caramelized onions, cheese and a tasty beef patty.

Once I took a bunch off, it was great, but man it was amost too overstuffed - I can&#39;t unhinge my jaw to eat so it was hard maneuver.

I had the chili cheese Fritos dog, with a Haus Slider and an order of cheese tots. Very good beef hot dog, with grilled Kings Hawaiian Sweet Rolls as the buns. What an awesome idea! Why aren&#39;t more places utilizing these little squares of deliciousness??

The slider was also very good with a hand formed mini patty, good seasoning, white American and again, on a Kings Hawaiian bun.

There wasn&#39;t much special about the tots themselves; just your run of the mill frozen tots fried up. Their niche here is the cheese sauce. Really nice consistency and flavor. It reminded me of the fondue sauce I like to make at home from a roux base. 

I would definitely agree with some of the other reviewers, that while the music selection in the dining room is nice, it is way too loud. Our group constantly felt like we were having to make an effort to talk over it just to have a simple conversation."

I forget the exact name of what i got, but it was a bacon wrapped dog that was then deep fried and had pickled jalapenos and a bunch of other stuff on it

The bun was also a very big piece that was just slathered with butter and then placed on the griddle to warm up.

I thought the meat was very tasty and a much bigger dog than I had thought I was going to get, which was a plus.

There were way too many ingredients on it, but maybe that&#39;s my fault for not having them removed.

The bun was really soggy, which was a disappointment. It really needed to hold together well given everything that was on it.

I&#39;ll probably give them another try, but just order off the BYO menu."

I ordered online a couple hours in advance using their online ordering tool. The tool is great, easy to use, you can fully customize anything without worrying whether or not they will get it right - and you can build your own anything too! The location is easy to get to and I walked straight up to the pick up line and they had my food already waiting. 

Holy Giant Veggie Burger Batman! I got the &#34;Little&#34; Mule with a Veggie Patty swap and swapped the american cheese for cheddar. I also ordered a side of Tots and after 18% gratuity spent only $12 on what will definitely be 2 meals. I mean, they use 4 of those Hawaiian king buns for ONE burger so.... yeah. 

The Veggie Patty was really tasty, it had chunks of real vegetables and did not fall apart! I repeat..... it didn&#39;t crumble. It was not dry. It did not have Quinoa. (#thankgod). The toppings were amazing. It all paired well with the Hawaiian buns (what doesn&#39;t?!?) - and my tots were  crisply perfect. 

My ONLY gripe is that my burger was cold when I picked it up (I opened it in my car and it was already cooling really fast, I think their timing may have been a bit ahead of what my email confirmation said)  and their packaging, while eco-friendly, recyclable all-cardboard, allowed for a lot of movement of the burger and open air to make it to the burger (thus the cold) and you can&#39;t save anything with it. I mean how the heck am I supposed to eat this 1 lb. veggie burger all at once?!? And I don&#39;t recommend traveling far with these. The burgers (and I imagine the dogs/sausages) all have sloppy, delectable toppings that will inevitably soak into the bun and make it all messy. I had to eat mine with a fork and knife (yes, i know, shuddup, at work ya know) but it was still great. 

I will be back to try the veggie dogs and veggie sausages next!!!"

My downtown dog was drenched with caramelized onions, roasted bell peppers, mayo and ketchup. I opted out of mustard, it&#39;s not my favorite condiment. The hot dog itself was wrapped in bacon. The bun was toasted king Hawaiian&#39;s bread. 

The hot dog itself was just meh, a tad burnt and dry but with it dripping in condiments, it wasn&#39;t horrible. The bun is another thing! Honestly, I could just eat the sweet bread all on its own, which I had to because I was eating my dog with a fork.

I am seriously in love with the sweet rolls made by King&#39;s Hawaiian.  Thus, whoever came up with using them as hot dog buns is a pure genius.  This bread definitely makes the hot dogs one of a kind.  They also use these sweet buns as hamburger buns (that is a lot of buns).

Not being much of a burger person, I ordered the Sooo Cali Haus dog and I had upgraded it to a pastrami bratwurst.  My boyfriend had the Das Brat which is a very traditional brat made with cheese, caramelized onions, and sauerkraut.  I really enjoyed his over mines.  Mine was good nonetheless.  However, it was pretty far from traditional.  It was made with wild arugula, crispy dried onions, avocado, tomato and spicy basil aioli.

The good thing about Dog Haus is that you do not have to choose their signature dogs or burgers; you can build your own.  They give a lot of choices  for your type proteins, toppings, and sauces.  It can get a bit overwhelming so its nice they already have things picked out for you.  Another plus is that they do support local breweries in Colorado and they serve my new favorite soda brand, Boylan, made with real cane sugar."

every burger and dog are cooked to order with fresh fries or tots and we loved that they have all the different meats in a glass display right up front so you can pick and choose how you wanna get down....I could spend a month eating here and trying out all the different dogs and sliders and burgers.

very clean spot also and they guys im assuming were the owners really take pride in what they have created and that always a plus when people are serving you the best they have to offer.

I also liked their buns that was semi-toasted. I&#39;m not a big fan of toasted buns b/c they always end up hurting my mouth, but this was the right kinda toasted!

First Hot Doug in Chicago made gourmet sausages cool.    Biker Jims was previously Colorado natives go to spot for gourmet sausages.

Now a gourmet sausage AND burger place.   Of course they have to do something different. . and by different I mean put your burgers and hot dogs on those Hawaiian bread rolls you get at wal-mart

It certainly isn&#39;t a bad idea.  The bread worked really well for the sandwiches and hot dogs.

I ordered the Cordon Bleu 2.0.  IT was some sort of blue cheese sriracha type of burger.  Good - but not really spicy (which you would expect from sriracha burgers).

The fries were good.  One small annoyance (not enough to nock down to 3 stars) was that we didn&#39;t notice the combo meals.  They didn&#39;t mention it. I had ordered a beer but some places will give you the combo discount on an upgrade. This place didn&#39;t. That wasn&#39;t cool.

I liked the place but tell you the truth . .I don&#39;t see myself coming back often.  1) Juicy Burger does burgers and is really good.  2) My son has peanut allergies and this place specializes on toppings and sauces with peanuts on your burgers/etc.  3) its way over-rated at this point.

Instead of making my own custom dog or burger, I chose one of the menu items, the old town dog with a pastrami snap dog (instead of normal beef). My first bite of the pastrami dog had me saying &#34;whoa&#34;, and I excitedly gobbled the rest. The bun is thick sweet Hawaiian rolls, which is a product differentiator if I&#39;ve ever seen one! The hotdog was served warm to our table, but the pepper and onion ingredients on my dog were luke warm at best, perhaps a little soggy. I went at dinner time, so maybe I had bad timing with a fresh batch of the veggies on my dog, if they had been more crisp I may have enjoyed it more. The meal for two was under $20, appropriately priced.

My overall impression was &#34;this is good but it&#39;s no Biker Jims.&#34; However, this is only my first impression as I&#39;ve only been to the Dog Haus once. When I return I will make a monster custom creation and perhaps that will enhance my satisfaction with this new restaurant."

Ordered the Little Leaguer - cuz it was supposed to be SMOTHERED in chili, cheese, and Fritos...11 Fritos later, and I had to add mustard because it was DRY - definitely NOT smothered in chili. AND, no ranch dressing to go with my tots - although I paid for a side of ranch...this was a To Go order...we literally live a minute and a half away - dogs were COLD, not warm, COLD. I usually give a place three chances...but this was terrible. The only reason I&#39;m giving it two stars is because the service was...well, adequate. Not great, adequate. We so wanted this place to do well. 
Disappointed."

I got the pig lebowski. I didn&#39;t like the fries on it the first time I ordered it, so I ordered it the second time without. The slaw wasn&#39;t to sweet, it added great congrats to the spiciness of the kielbasa sausage. 

All in all not a bad place."

Wife had the Freiburger with sweet potato fries and I had a dog that they tried to make as close to a Chicago Dog as possible. Good size portions. Burger was very tasty. Fries were fresh cut and hot. The dog was not very hot (lukewarm at best) but was very good. They would do well to put an authentic Chicago Dog on the menu. The egg on the burger was perfect!

I went there with my sister and her husband. We were greeted right away and patience was given when we were making our decisions. The ambience was warm and laid back. 

I tried the Cowboy with a side of chili cheese tots. I love that Dog Haus uses sweet buns, it rounds out the whole meal. The buns are hefty as well, and are able to endure all of the toppings on the hot dog. The Cowboy consisted of a bacon wrapped dog with crispy onions and BBQ sauce. I liked the texture that the crispy onions added to the dog and it was a great combination. The chili cheese tots were smothered in chili and cheese sauce and the tots stayed nice a crisp. Perfect for a cheat day. I will definitely be going back to try all of the other menu options they have and maybe even build my own."

My family had never been here so I recommended it for lunch. Granted, I was somewhat hesitant. Dog Haus is in LA, a new one just opened right near USC, however it is still working out the kinks. My experience there was no good, but I hoped for better here. 

Service: 5/5. Patient, generous, and helpful. The manager taking our order made our process as smooth and enjoyable as possible, all while being genuine and lacking the &#34;I&#39;m here because I have to be&#34; attitude. Also, the food came out quick!

Price: 5/5. Not only do you get free food with check in, the prices are very reasonable too. Especially for the size and quality of food you&#39;ll be getting. 

Food 5272/5. No that is not a typo. Let me tell you the little mule was hands down the best burger I have ever had, and this is a hot dog place! It wasn&#39;t as if I was super hungry or anything, that burger was just divine with every bite. The little mule comes with two types of cheese, a fried egg, avocado, and two types of sauce on a sweet bun. I can&#39;t really describe how great that burger was in words. You have to try it, it was just the best burger I&#39;ve ever had, it didn&#39;t really last long in my hands. As for my family, they really enjoyed their food too, I tried my brothers burger and that was just as good as mine.

Seriously I know dog Haus has many locations and stuff but this was just a really great experience. Would absolutely recommend."

It took us almost 15 minutes to get to the counter and place our order.  The guy at the counter even had to stop taking orders for a few minutes so the kitchen could catch up.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I also think this place has some operational efficiencies to work on, but the restaurant is so new that I&#39;m sure the ordering process will get better.

The food was pretty good.  I had the Brat special that was on the board, but I like that I could make my own if I wanted to.  My husband had one of the specialty hamburgers.  I liked the Hawaiian rolls for the Brat I ordered, but I think I would have preferred just a regular hot dog bun.  We got a side of tator tots and those were yummy too.  All the food tasted really fresh.

I think I&#39;ll wait for a while before I come back to try Dog Haus again so they can work out the kinks in their newness and popularity.  However, I do like the fact that they will have an app where you can order ahead of time and quickly pick up the food."

The delicious smell of grilled sausages and the wide range of selection had me at hello. Slightly overwhelmed, I asked for a recommendation, and was quickly steered to the Old Town Dog.

They advertised an Ocktoberfest dog that sounded amazing, but we&#39;d already eaten that day. We went to the storefront a few days later, hoping they&#39;d have the same dog. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t on the menu and the cashier had no information about it. Frankly, the cashier wasn&#39;t very personable. The staff wasn&#39;t all that welcoming at all; it kind of seemed like no one cared to be there. 

We were disappointed, but went ahead and ordered other dogs. I can&#39;t remember the names of what we had, but my boyfriend had the one with the egg on it and I had the California inspired dog with avocado. Both were delicious, but it took a while and we watched our tots and sweet potato fries sit out, not under a warming tray, for some time. Fortunately they weren&#39;t cold when we got them, but the tater tots lacked seasoning. The sweet potato fries were delicious.

After today I have serious doubts about ever returning to the Dog Haus. First off - I really enjoy their food. They make some damn delicious stuff. I love the music selection. I always hear classic rock and anyplace that plays Pink Floyd or Rush gets an extra notch in my book. However, this doesn&#39;t out weigh the frustrations I&#39;ve experienced in my last few visits, and today&#39;s visit was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.

I am tired of fighting the families with kids to find a place to sit and eat. Two visits ago, I was forced to sit at one of the long tables by myself because there literally wasn&#39;t any other place to sit. Just as I get my meal, I start to get harassed by the mother in a family of 4 who stood at the edge of my table and glared at me the entire time I was eating, while letting her kids run rampant through the restaurant and especially on the other side of my table. I was here first - why is it that you expect that I should give up my space for you just because you got there later than me and you have a family? If you were handicapped, I would absolutely give up my space for you. If you asked me nicely, I would give up my seat for you and your family. But when you stand there and glare at me, and try to make me so uncomfortable that I&#39;ll get up and leave... you can BITE ME. I have also seen this behavior on other occasions done to other patrons. - Note: I understand this isn&#39;t Dog Haus&#39;s responsibility or fault. But it IS a reality of visiting this place. 
So - fast forward to today. It&#39;s a Sunday afternoon, around one o&#39;clock. The place is fairly busy but not jam packed like lunch rush on a weekday. I order a simple corn dog with fries and a drink. I find a place to sit at one of the small tables and I wait. I watch as my corn dog gets finished and then sits at the end of the counter while waiting for fries to be done. FOR 15 MINUTES. I watch as the dad in the family gets back up - goes over, orders additional food and gets handed fresh hot fries in a matter of minutes. Meanwhile I wait and I wait and I wait. I watch as food sits on the end of the line after it is prepared and a little boy comes by AND STARTS HANDLING OTHER PEOPLES FOOD! WTF?!?!? Finally I get my order and my corn dog is lukewarm because it has sat for 15 minutes. I take two bites, eat a few fries and decide it&#39;s time to get the hell out of there. I seriously doubt I&#39;m going to be back. Which is too bad because I used to really enjoy this place, but it&#39;s just not worth the hassle."

With that said, I will say that the food here is top notch and warrants the price. The quality and flavors/tastes are amazing. Though I had one of their burgers, I can tell that probably everything tastes amazingly delicious. And as others have mentioned, their tots are the best tots ever...perfectly crispy as tots must be. 

The three stars lost come from my observation of the staff. Young teens, loafing about on their phones. More concerned with talking and phone-ing than looking professional. THEIR FREAKING PHONES WERE ON THE FOOD PREP MAT WHERE MY BURGER WAS BEING PREPARED. PHONE. LET THAT SINK IN. PHONES THAT PEOPLE TOUCH WITH SHIT COVERED HANDS AFTER WIPING, PHONES THAT ARE COUGHED UPON, USED TO TAKE SELFIES (IN SOME CASES THESE DAYS, NUDE). NAS. TY. Yeah no point to those gloves they were wearing. No it wasn&#39;t just one phone but two. I don&#39;t know who was in charge but no one looked old enough to carry any sort of professionalism or responsibility. 

Again, the food, fantastic. The service...teen service. Apathetic. Facebook more important. Tweeting....this isn&#39;t acceptable. Phones in the food prep today? NO. BIG FAT EFFING NO. I&#39;m shocked that this is ok. We&#39;re becoming too lacks with keeping teens to some sort of status quo or some iota of responsibility. I would NOT recommend this place based on what I saw during my lunch break today (7/30/2015)...it&#39;s no wonder I heard a co-worker got sick after eating here. Shame."

My order consisted of the Taekwon Dog, some chili cheese tots, and I split a corn dog with my friend. 

Let&#39;s start with the hotdog. The toppings were decent,I liked the bulgogi sauce a lot. However, the dog itself tasted mediocre. Its hard for me to enjoy the experience when the bread is the best part. The tots were probably my favorite. Tots were crispy and I appreciate the shredded cheese along with the cheese sauce. Chili was great! The corn dog was second runner up. They appeared to be hand dipped and the batter was good but I personally like a thicker batter in the dog.

IMO, there are better places for hot dogs in CO. If I do go again, I will have to try the sausages."

Being a lover of burgers and gourmet dogs (Biker Jim&#39;s, Billy&#39;s, etc.) I&#39;ve been so excited to get inside!

The menu is manageable with options from their &#34;Haus Dogs&#34;, &#34;Haus Sausages&#34;, &#34;Haus Burgers&#34; lists or you can build your own. On this (my first visit) I jumped on the &#34;Old Town Dog&#34;. This bad boy is a smoked bacon wrapped dog w/ caramelized onions, roasted jalapenos, chipotle aioli and cotija cheese served on THREE toasted King&#39;s Hawaiian rolls. Although the combo of jalapenos and chipotle aioli was spicy, the freshness of the King&#39;s Hawaiian roll made me forget all about it. 

My 5 year old joined me on this visit so we also ordered a kids meal for her. This is where things went a little south. 

The option here was either TWO sliders, TWO rootbeer battered corn dogs or an all-beef mini dog w/ tots and a fountain drink. Now if your kid can take in 1,500 calories a day...no big deal. For most kiddos a single corn dog, slider, small fries and a small drink is perfect. 

There are no kid drink sizes and a full boat of tots comes with it. Honestly a real bargain so I neglected to order any sides for myself and helped with her tots. Tots...AMAZING!

The all-beef dog was a little &#34;too gourmet&#34; for my kiddos taste buds, so she just ate the rootbeer batter and tots. :(

The Dog Haus interior is cool. If the 4-5 tables seating 4 at the front of the store are full, your group may have to sit at the two large community tables toward the back. A cozy patio with 4-5 tables is out back, however the traffic of Arapahoe Road is a little loud if you&#39;re trying to enjoy your meal.

Another feature I liked and one that will bring me back is their solid local beer menu and the &#34;spiked shakes&#34; as they were described by the person at the register. Their happy hour is also something worth stopping in for especially if you&#39;re looking for a beer and a dog before a night out.

I wanted to LOVE Dog Haus and I might after another visit. For now...it&#39;s 4 stars working on 5.

The first time I wanted to order the Sooo Cali but they were out of arugula so I went with the Another night in Bangkok. The curry wurst was awesome. Really spicy. Really great flavors. 4 stars because it took them about 15 minutes to make the new wurst after they realized they were out of the arugula. The rest of my family was already done with their food by the time I got mine. I went again last night and ordered the Sooo Cali. It was really good. Their hot dogs are very flavorful and the basil aioli was great. If you feel like spending the extra $4 go for the chili fries. Very tasty.

My husband had the Das Brat. He said the brat had a casing that was very thick and since it wasn&#39;t cooked long enough it didn&#39;t crunch or snap but instead was like peeling off. Overall the brat had a bland taste to it. 

I had the Downtown Dog. Absolutely gross. It was covered in ingredients- which I expected- but something caused the bread to get all soggy. King&#39;s Hawaiian Bread is one of my all time favorites but not when it is dripping and falling apart. I decided to just eat the dog and about four bites in my stomach started to churn. I had to stop. 

The girls got corn dog sliders that were burnt and substantially different sizes. They refused to take more than two bites apiece. 

We threw out almost half our food and will not be back. We did run to King Soopers and picked up some tums though."

I brought my son there after school just this afternoon and as always the food was delicious, the people uber-friendly, and the music memorable. They always offer my little guy a free Otter Pop, which makes him very loyal to their brand. :-) Today he said, &#34;Mama, we should eat here EVERY DAY!&#34; Usually I might launch into a lecture about how impractical that would be but today, with a bite of wurst exploding with flavor in my mouth, I just smiled and nodded my head in agreement."

It is a little hard to get to but once we got there we walked in and at the counter they have all the dogs on display that you can order. I went with the old town dog. A smoked bacon wrapped dog with caramelized onions, roasted jalapeños, Chipotle aioli, and cotija cheese. Wow this dog blew me away. A great tasting dog with just the right amount of toppings but what really made it special was the Hawaiian buns they use, sweet and just a nice taste for a gormet dog. Everything was perfect the staff was great and they really seemed to be enjoying their jobs. With so many other great dogs, sausages and burgers I will be back for sure. Keep up the great job."

The Good: OMG, this pizza was so pretty, perfectly and evenly distributed through out the entire pizza. No piles of one topping on one side and all the rest on the other or not cutting all the way through. This pizza was amazing, cut straight and even, and all the way through. No having to finish their job when you get to pizza home. We ordered the steak &amp; blue pizza. Omg! So good! I&#39;ve never had balsamic glaze on my pizza before and next time, I&#39;m getting extra, because it could have used a tad bit more! 

The Bad: Absolutely nothing, except our delivery driver came to my back door, lol, but that&#39;s not their fault, but that was all Grubhub. lol

The Ugly: Nothing, because it was gorgeous!

Thank you! I will be ordering again!"

I love the fact that you can build your own pizza and the toppings are fresh.  If I were basing my decision on the meal I had alone I would probably give 5 stars.  

Food- I had a build your own pizza with meatballs,  carmelized onions, and mushrooms. I also tried a cookie and a fountain drink.  The pizza was out of this world delicious.  The cookie was pretty tasty but not worth $2.50. The fountain drink was light on the syrup and I wasn&#39;t impressed that there were none of the options I wanted (Dr Pepper or Root Beer) available.  

Service- I told the young lady working that I had never been here before and she immediately explained how it works.  The lady that cashed me out was helpful and courteous.  

Cleanliness- this is my only complaint.  The fountain area was very dirty with rings and drips of sticky dried soda.  It looked like it hadn&#39;t been cleaned all day or maybe even several days. There was an employee that cleaned a table but left another right next to it with crumbs and a mostly empty drink cup alone so I thought that was odd. The restaurant itself was fairly tidy so I&#39;d def go back for more."

You go up to the counter and build your pizza &#34;Subway style&#34; by picking out the toppings you want on the line.  They&#39;ve got the best selection of meats, veggies, and sauces I&#39;ve seen anywhere, including vegan and GF options.  They don&#39;t skimp on the toppings either.  Then they throw your pizza in the oven and a few minutes, out pops YUM.  

I did a whole wheat crust with a mix of buffalo sauce and ranch, topped with mozzarella, marinated tofu, and portobello mushrooms.  It was FANTASTIC.  Having been on a diet for the past 7 months (and almost 70lbs down now), I&#39;ve learned to become much more discriminating about when to blow my diet - the calories have to be &#34;worth it&#34;.  Maddios qualifies.  

But they also have healthy options: salads and wraps.  And you can make a pretty healthy pizza if you want, too.  I will definitely be visiting this place whenever the pizza cravings strike."

Since I&#39;ve ordered my pizza, 4 customers have walked in, then walked out. There&#39;re only 2 people working  here right now which wouldn&#39;t be so bad, if the only 2 people working had a sense of urgency in what they are doing. I get my pizza missing a topping, my friends foldwhich sat on the pizza belt for 10 min before they added the final toppings, there was a pizza driver here picking up pizzas for someone and none of it was ready. I has to remind them twice about my breadstick order and my cookie I bought. Needless to say, they def need 3 people on shift when these 2 are on duty.

Cons: the employees couldn&#39;t have wanted to be there less, I watched a guy take 7 minutes to make a tiny salad.. it was like watching it in slow motion, it was nearly empty yet there were 3 dirty tables the whole time we were there, our made to order pizza was made incorrectly - the cold toppings were left off after it was cooked- went back to the counter twice to get the missing toppings/replace the pizza... instead got a flighty,  &#39;oh sorry!&#39;  Umm,  no.

I ordered the madidos meal aka lunch special with a traditional crust zesty tomato bbq sauce and mozzarella to start  first thing she asks what size? What crust? What what everything I said. I also asked for my pizza in a box because I get full off the salad so I save the pizza for snack/dinner.  I can honestly say my pizza was and is soggy right now. Usually service is amazing but today they didn&#39;t even want to help me with my salad which is hard to hold a tray in a wheelchair. And my pizza never came in a box.

I asked her to talk and she said word for word &#34;I don&#39;t have time to talk to you&#34; after I just spent 20$ at her establishment I didn&#39;t expect that response. So I sat in awe for a second and she then said &#34;can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy?&#34; So I just walked away a very upset customer after my meal.

I ordered a pizza with vegan cheese and when I arrived, they told me they were out of vegan cheese. In their defense, they did call me back about 2-3 min after I made the order to tell me they were out but because I didn&#39;t recognize the number, I did not answer. That being said, because I had a living social deal that expired the next day, they gave me a voucher to make up the difference so that I would not be out money as it was not my fault they were out of vegan cheese. The manager promised to order some and stated that it would be available the next day. 
I placed an order 3 days later and they did have the vegan cheese. Additionally, the same manager was there and came over to thank me for returning and apologized again for the mishap earlier in the week.
I was very impressed with the customer service I received. Obviously, things happen sometimes that are outside of our control but they did their best to make things right. 
Regarding the pizza itself, it was probably a little better than average. Definitely better than the mainstream pizza chains and I appreciate the fact that they have vegan cheese. However, I ordered a veggie pizza and the amount of veggies on it was definitely skimpy. Additionally, I noticed that one of the workers was making pizza and then handled money with his food gloves on, then went back to making pizza without changing his gloves. Definitely gross. 
You don&#39;t have to call orders in. They have a chipotle style line where you can go down and add toppings as you please.
I will likely return but probably would not call in an order. I would make sure that I could watch the pizza being made as I am grossed out by questionable hygiene displayed by the worker who handled food and money with the same gloves."

They freshly make the pizza according to your specifications and bring it to your table once it&#39;s cooked. 

They have the option of personal sized pizza, although I went even smaller and ordered a kid&#39;s combo pizza. Less than $5 for a pizza with one topping and a fountain drink included!

They prepare the dough and many of the toppings themselves (such as the grilled chicken, etc).  I&#39;m a huge fan of a simple pepperoni, meatball, and jalapeno pizza. Personal size is perfect.  The kids running the joint are polite and quick.  They feature one of those million flavor Coke machines, which is nice.  Honestly, I prefer this pizza over many other places when I need a quick fix. I even prefer it to delivery.  It is piping hot when it is brought out and it is made right in front of you. It isn&#39;t Paxti&#39;s or some other fancy joint, for sure, but it is a clean, nice, and good alternative for everyday fixes.

UPDATE 12/10/2015 - I&#39;ve added a star.  Why? Well, the owner reached out and asked what they could do to earn a fifth star.  I know these are just ranking and that they are subjective, but the overall experience really matters to me. And I want my feedback to be useful to others that may not be so trusting and adventurous. As a result of their inquiry and after rethinking what 5 stars means, I decided that I really do quite like Maddios and I really do love eating their pizza.  5 stars because the business cares about their customers - and I totally dig that."

My pizza has come out wrong 3 of 4 times. 

Sometimes it seems soggy, like it needs to roll through the oven again. 

Suggestions... Work on accuracy. Work on consistency. Make sure oven is at the proper speed and heat. Some pizzas are better than others.

Employees are very nice."

First off, they didn&#39;t honor the lunch special. Apparently they said it was on a Monday even though the person I talked to said it was Tuesday. So that happened.

The counter was nice, and the people behind it responded to my order in a convenient matter. They were very cheerful.

Once I was rung up (full price, but oh well), I went to get my stuff for the table. The dishware was rather dirty with spots on it. I notified one of the staff about this but they didn&#39;t really respond. Which is sort of odd.

I went to use the restroom and, for some reason, the men&#39;s room was locked tighter than a drum. Hesitated and used the women&#39;s restroom, which was a mess. You were warned.

After returning to my table, my order was waiting. The pizza had a decent quality to it, but it didn&#39;t seem to stick, as half of the cheese and pepperoni slid off my slice into my lap. I grabbed a bunch of napkins to clean it up and told the staffer, but only got a small apology.

As for the food itself, it&#39;s pretty good. Aside from the &#34;slide&#34; issue, it tastes great, and the soda machine poured a great flavor, despite missing cherry vanilla.

The atmosphere is fun, laid back with music from the old-school days, and plenty of TV&#39;s to watch.

Overall, I&#39;m mixed. There&#39;s some stuff that needs to be addressed in terms of cleanliness and customer service, but the food and atmosphere hit the spot. I just hope this spot grows into something reputable and fixes its problems. Oh, and honors its specials. Please."

When they bring your food they always say &#34;served with love&#34;

I love the variety of all the unique ingredients, and how you can always add/subtract items off the &#39;suggested&#39; pizzas.  I have always done some variation of the &#39;Greek&#39; pizza.  The wheat crust is sooo good and is different, it is NOT that doughy ugh I&#39;m stuffed fills like a brick is in my stomach feeling...which is usually why I stay away from pizza.  They are very generous with the toppings too, which is good because $9 for a personal pizza is a little on the high side.  

A huge bonus is their &#34;Love&#34; cookies -- chocolate chip is ammmmaaaaazing!!!!!  So &#39;homemade&#39; tasting.

Marcella the owner is a charm and you can tell she&#39;s putting a lot of heart into this place.  I hope that the quality of ingredients remains... sometimes I see &#39;non-chain&#39; places come in like this and start out wonderful and then go downhill because they keep getting cheaper and cheaper bulk ingredients.  

Clean, new atmosphere.  Do expect to wait 10 mins or so for your personal pie to bake."

We also got a side of garlic bread, and it was wonderful.
The ONLY thing that holds me back from an enthusiastic 5 star endorsement is the staff. While they weren&#39;t especially rude, they did have trouble with the register and the customer service was not outstanding by any means.
To top it off, the woman that was cleaning the floors as we ate, while friendly enough, continued to talk our ears off. This wouldn&#39;t be a huge problem, except that she mostly complained about her work and other aspects of her life. She cursed a few times, which I found pretty unprofessional, and interrupted me and my colegue on a number of occasions. At one point she even told us about how she had earlier hung up on a customer who was calling in. Just didn&#39;t seem like the kind of person I personally would hire.

We got there at about 2pm on a Monday, and there were a few other tables of people but, being an off time to eat, we had little company. The interior is very welcoming and rustic, lots of wood and Edison light bulbs and even a few seating options made out of ski lifts chairs and even a gondola booth! E was quick to notice the two-seater Pac-Man tables too, which looked like the game was operational if you had a few quarters! 

The place has a large beer selection, but I opted for a gin and tonic. And I&#39;m glad I did, because the first five beers that E ordered were kicked! Subsequently it took us about 3/4 of the meal before he had a beer in hand, which was due not only by the lack of options he wanted (i.e. not hoppy) but also by the complete lack of communication between the bartender and our server. If anything had happened like this while I was bartending, both the slowness of the drink order and the frustration of the customer over not getting what they wanted not once, not twice, but FIVE times, I would have promptly comped the beer. We barely even got an apology...

We ordered the Funguy pizza, which comes with mushrooms, arugula, prosciutto, and shaved parmesan. I was delicious! I highly recommend it. 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the pizza and would go back for that, but the lack of beer options really put a damper on our trip. I&#39;m hoping that because they&#39;re newly opened, and because it was a Monday, they might have had a higher turnout over the weekend than anticipated?

But it&#39;s definitely overpriced, especially for the 8-ounce beer pours. Some of the other burgers tend to get a bit too salty for my tastes.

The wait staff has been consistently friendly and attentive. I&#39;ll go back; just wish they&#39;d adjust the menu prices, especially beer prices. Don&#39;t get all Denver boutique-y on us."

WITH until light rail opens. We somehow missed the crowd on Friday night because there was a huge line. We could tell why..great bar and craft  beer. Good food. Both had minestrone. He had spaghetti and meatballs and I had a BBQ  hamburger. Attentive staff. Nice job Angie. A definite return in order.

The decor is gorgeous, I love the mountain theme with ski gondolas. They had a decent happy hour menu, great selection of beers. But the food was average at best. My husband and I each had a burger, he had one with bbq sauce and I had one with guac. They weren&#39;t &#34;bad&#34; per say, just incredibly average, and kind of disappointing. Certainly not worth $12 each. The truffle fries were great and the brownie for dessert was pretty good. 
Overall, I&#39;ll give it another shot and try the pizza next time. The service and ambiance is awesome, but the kitchen could really step it up when first impressions are on the line. 

Update: I bumped this place up to 4 stars from 3. My second visit I had pizza this time, The Ralston to be specific. Holy truffle oil! This pizza was delicious! I also want to give Tap and Dough credit for using Scrumptious ice cream for their desserts. I think it&#39;s legit that they&#39;re standing with other local businesses and it helps that scrumptious ice cream is bomb dot com. Keep in mind that if you get the brownie/ice cream dessert that you don&#39;t have to get plain vanilla, I got cookies and cream with my brownie and it was sent from the angels. This place will likely be my new go to, but I think I&#39;ll just stick with the pizza."

My husband said his meatball sliders and fries were great.
There was some miscommunication about his cousin&#39;s pizza order, but staff was sure to relay apologies and got it out to him fairly quickly.
I got the &#34;fusilli&#34; with mushroom and spicy Italian sausage. I ordered it because I LOVE fusilli. I rarely eat pasta and I was really psyched about this dish until...it turned out to be rotini. There&#39;s a big difference between the 2 pastas and as I specifically wanted the fusilli as it was advertised -- I wouldn&#39;t have ordered it otherwise. I was really disappointed, but since we had already had to wait for the pizza, I didn&#39;t say anything because I didn&#39;t want any further delays. That said, it was freaking delicious. The hubs seems happy with the beer list and our waiter is really attentive and fun."

My wife and I when in on Memorial Day for a late lunch and some beers. We asked the hostess for a booth. She said it was going to be &#34;a few minutes to get it cleaned off.&#34; Ten minutes later (after the hostess cleaned it off herself) we got seated.
The menu was confusing to read at first (I admit that I am dyslexic) but I got it (this is where the earned a star, never been to a place that has beer boots.) 

Now, this is Colorado. How do you run out of Coors Light? (Ok I see you beer snobs looking down at me like &#34;wtf bro?!&#34; Relax I was dehydrated and need a few waters.) How do you run out of Shiner Bock? Really common beers, or am I lost. This is after it took the waiter another..... I know I am being anal, ten minutes to get our drink orders. 

Food. I like food. It&#39;s fun. Appetizer was sausage stuffed mushrooms. They were dime sized, but came with I nice little salad. I will recommend that. 

We ordered a pizza for the full plate... Problem. The pizza that showed up was not the pizza we ordered. We ordered pizza margarita, what came out was completely opposite! 

The place was not a madhouse, normal traffic. We almost walked about after the first 15 minutes. Work on your traffic management or your staffing. I&#39;ll give you three months then I will try your place again and revise my review."

Unfortunately, upon eating there, I realized that not only is it a nicer atmosphere than any other place in the area, but the food is delicious.

The appetizers are all great. My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip!
Pizza- we had the home grown, it was great but the dough was on the soggy side of the spectrum, had to fold it so it wouldn&#39;t loose the toppings. Overall above average pizza, tasted fresh and certainly made to order! 
My favorite thing about this place is the happy hour, 5 dollar boots of shock top.. that&#39;s a liter of beer for five dollars! Otherwise the same boot is 5.50.. not much of a cost break but it&#39;s something! I think they even have dollar off select drafts as well?

If the service does not get better here it will be closing way too soon. We were seated in a booth that was dirty even though they had told us it was cleaned before we sat down. They weren&#39;t busy, we got waters and a menu. We were told by a passing waiter that he would be right back to get our order and we never saw him again. We did see him and other waitpersons meeting at the host/hostess counter talking about something that was very funny...to them. The hostess had an awful attitude and her face may have broken if she smiled. I would figure that if you were opening a new place with so much competition that you would want to give a good impression, especially when it is a first impression.

More by the bad service. The manager was informed of our meal being served pizza first and salad much later.  He walked by several times looking at the salad plates not touched because the dressing on the Ceaser was like sour fish. His arrogance turned me off as well as his lack of care. He lacked customer service and was more a busboy then anything else while we were their. Our waiter was struggling at his job but very nice. It seemed like the staff we spoke with were not happy with the manager either and made it obvious. Not a good sign. No owners in the brand new place to welcome the neighbors checking them out. 

So you already read about the salad. The pizza was nothing special. The dough was a little chewy  and lacked much flavor.  The beer choice was pretty good not amazing. 

The host was very apologetic as we left and he acted more like a manager then the manager. 

The atmosphere is why I have a second star. Open energetic and creative space. 

I went in so Wed and was told it was their 3rd night so I need to be fair and give them a second chance and try other foods  and also see if service improves.  I hope things get better this could be a good addition to Arvada.

Homegrown is my favorite spot for pizza, and I have to go at least once a month to the one in my wash park neighborhood. We visited the new old town arvada spot on their opening weekend and I was so impressed! Service was stellar, dare I say even slightly more approachable &amp; friendlier than the wash park crew. The decor and ambiance is warm, rustic and modern. Both restaurants have a decked out ski chalet and which gives the place a Colorado authentic feel. This location is quite large, and has lots of giant tv&#39;s making it a great place to watch a sporting event. They also have an awesome drink menu, with great wines by the glass, beers, and cocktails. 

So the food, where do I begin! My favorite pizza is The Ralston, and it&#39;s a crowd pleaser. It&#39;s a white pizza but full of flavor with their sun-dried tomatoes that they make, spicy giardiniera, pancetta, and truffle oil. Favorite app is the Italian style chicken wings, crispy, salty and tangy with parm, and pepperoni. I could eat these all day erryday. Coming in a close second would be the spinach artichoke dip served with grilled ciabatta. This is a lighter than the traditional recipe and although the description says it&#39;s made with fontina I wonder what their secret is. This time around I also tried something new which was their sausage &amp; mushroom fusilli in a truffle alfredo, ummm need I say more. It was SO good I had to pass it across the table to my other half about every three minutes so he could have another bite. Lastly, I should mention they also have a great kale salad with pistachios, sundried cherries, parmesan &amp; lemon. Sorry you made it last to the list kale but it&#39;s a good, refreshing addition to the meal."

Then the manager brought over our apps and acted as though that was normal. I&#39;m not sure if I missed the memo but I assumed appetizers were before entrees. I could be wrong. Then you could tell the apps had been sitting. They were dry and overcooked. The pizzas were undercooked. They were very soggy. It was overall very disappointing and I would not go again.

We came with two toddlers and the waiter - I believe his name is Dory? Or Tory? - was exceptionally patient and kind and gave wonderful recommendations for both food and beer.  The food was amazing with service to match.  I can&#39;t wait to go back!

Not only was i extremely AMAZED at the employees who greeted and served us but the food, experience and beautiful decor is one I want to repeat often and am confident they will deliver.  I believe that true integrity is measured by how a mistake (which we all make!) is corrected.  This is one of the best places in Arvada, so if you can just be a little patient with the wait time, you will be amazed as well!

Prior review: Extremely rude male host, 45 min to 1 hr wait which was fine but we watched from outside for ten minutes and 4 ready tables remained unseated in addition to the bar. Didnt expect to be seated right away but did NOT expect rude behavior for such a new place in arvada!! One star only because I couldn&#39;t leave none"

It&#39;s nice to have a place to relax with the kids (there&#39;s a free classic arcade to keep them busy!!), socialize with friends, and enjoy amazing food. 

Our server, Carl was amazing. Great recommendations. The host and manager were extremely tentative and welcoming. 

Definitely try the bruschetta, Old Towne, and arugula salad. You can&#39;t go wrong. And if you&#39;re in the mood, go for the custom cocktail, purgatory. You&#39;ll be in heaven at homegrown!"

The feel of the restaurant is very open and relaxed; it was great that we were able to sit in a booth, but still felt like we were out on the patio because of their large roll up windows - such a neat idea.  The decor is pretty modern and simple, but I think I like it that way!
Onto the food; we ordered the Roasted Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer and two beers.  It took a while to get both unfortunately.  The beers were very refreshing on a warm afternoon, but the Brussels Sprouts seemed overly salted in my opinion. 
For dinner I ordered the Quinoa Salad (because they do not have a veggie patty option for burgers) and asked for no nuts and dressing on the side and a side of fries, my boyfriend ordered the El Chilango burger.  We waited a good while before receiving our food (sans side of fries because it was &#34;on it&#39;s way&#34;) and unfortunately my Quinoa Salad came doused in what seemed to just be oil and it had hazelnuts in it, instead of the almonds.  My boyfriend said his burger was pretty darn good, but a little on the cold side.  
I was reminded that my fries were on their way, and about thirty minutes later I had to remind the waitress that I was still missing my fries.  
I don&#39;t blame the restaurant at all, because i&#39;m sure they still have some kinks to work out after opening about three weeks ago (i&#39;ll have to come back to try it a second time), but as far as this experience went; it&#39;s nothing to write home about."

The only issue would be the service. With a quality restaurant should come quality service and I have yet to have it there in 4 visits. Hopeful they can address the staffing issue.  If they do, they will out shine all the others in Old Town with no problem (excluding the Arvada Tavern which is a first class establishment all around)"

Had the absolute worst bruschetta in my life. I scraped off a soggy tomato and was left with concrete toast.  Waiter was very nice and comped but there was absolutely nothing else that appealed. Limited and not very creative  dessert menu. My dinner companions liked their pizza which was packed for lunch. Sylvi&#39;s across the street is much better. I&#39;ll never walk in there again.

We waited 15 mins on a Saturday night which is not unreasonable. Food and drink wait is ridiculous. The service was not great from a kind of surly server. Appetizer didn&#39;t come 35 mins after ordering it so we scrapped that. Pizza took at least 45 mins. Pizza was just okay. But get this--when I asked about the at least 20-25 min wait for my beer, the server said &#34;Well, we have 54 taps.&#34; What?

The open windows on the right are nice to sit by but the area on the left when you walk in feels like kid-central. It&#39;s noisy, too. 

Silvi&#39;s is good. I&#39;ll go there instead or to the new Kline&#39;s down the street.

Parking is not a big deal to me. When you go to Arvada, you know you&#39;ll have to walk a bit."

We ordered their Italian works  which are  truffle fries sitting in fondue and drizzled with some sauce. They were ok...fries needed to be cooked longer to give them some crunch instead of soggy fries. We also ordered their crispy Brussel sprouts. Again not cooked long enough to have any crisp on them or they sat for awhile before they were served to us. Lastly we ordered their pizza. The ralston and the homegrown. The toppings on the ralston were very skimpy that at one point I thought I ordered a cheese pizza. The homegrown was good but overloaded with roasted bell peppers and that was about it. The waitstaff needs a lot of work and needs to know what is on the menu. As I am  writing  this we are still waiting for my kids sundae that is suppose to come with the kids meal. 

We got here at happy hour and there were a ton of tables open and it was a 20 minute wait. Not enough staff to accommodate patrons on Memorial Day."

When I politely asked the bartender to fill my glass, he acted annoyed and informed me that it is standard to leave &#34;1 inch of head&#34;. Well, then advertise it as a 12/14oz pour, and I&#39;ll shut up. Just don&#39;t put 16oz on your menu, and serve me 20% less. Tacky! I doubt I&#39;ll be back."

I respect all servers, clerks etc., so I&#39;m going to write my description of what happened that night.  (From my side) 

We came from a convention that was happening in the city and I, me, myself and I happened to be thirsty and craving a quick drink. Not my friends. Everything was closed nearby and we were tired wanting to go home! It was late at night so no corner stores were open. 

This was literally the only thing open. Anyone else with a similar experience can relate that they are not trying to cause a havoc , but ANYONE who is THIRSTY, for SODA, because they acknowledged, like myself, that I&#39;m going to enter in anyways and buy a drink a get out.

&#34;You came and used the bathroom, only&#34; --

My intentions was to get a quick drink so I was allowed to use the restrooms. All places allowed me to do it. 

&#34;You passed 5 signs saying No change, $10 minimum cards, &amp; bathrooms are for paying customers only.&#34; 
-- we only saw signs for ID&#39;s and bathrooms. 

&#34;You chose to ignore the signs and come in anyways.&#34; 

-- we bought a drink and my friend happened to pay with a card, you told us the $10 minimum and my other friend paid you in cash. That&#39;s a transaction. 

&#34;You did not eat, you did not drink, so you are not allowed to use our facilities.&#34; 

-- We bought a $4 soda, so I got to use your restroom and you allowed me to stay even though you saw my ID that I was under 21. So that makes me a customer. And you allowed my transaction. 

Now as for my friends: I didn&#39;t say a bloody thing. But my friends are sometimes dysfunctional and that&#39;s why I love them. I&#39;ll never change them and while I was peeing my heart away, my friends were probably pissed your girls or you rolled your eyes. Whatever they said to you, I&#39;ll go ahead and apologize for them, but in the end, we felt un welcomed. We don&#39;t normally do this, but when we do, we still get treated fairly by other spots. If you didn&#39;t like our company, fine."

It is located just down the street from the Sheraton.   It is a small, hip restaurant/bar.  They were super busy and short staff.  Our waitress was also one of the bartenders.  She was friendly and helpful.  She helped me find a yummy beverage to try  as I wasn&#39;t sure what to order. I ordered a blue cheese burger with their homemade chips.  My co-worker had the greedy salad.   My burger was very good and the chips were amazing.  Highly recommend having them.  My co-worker said her salad was very good as well.  I would rate the food and drinks a 5 and the service  (solely because they were so short staffed and it took over 2 hours for 1 drink each and dinner to be served) a 3.  

I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a small, local restaurant with good food."

I say the food was 3 star because while everything was good, I know I can get it better elsewhere. It&#39;s not good when you share 6 plates, and the charcuterie and cheese plate was the biggest winner. Here&#39;s what we had, and the general consensus among my group of 5:

Black and Bleu Figs: they were kind of dry, the bleu cheese didn&#39;t pack much of a flavor punch, and the prosciutto was so thin you could hardly taste it.
Yardbird Dip: probably our most &#34;meh&#34; plate- the buffalo sauce tasted watered down and the chicken was a weird texture. We did not even finish this.
Charcuterie and Cheese plate: great accompaniments, cheese and meat were good.
Greedy Cheese: probably the table&#39;s favorite. Very cheesy.
Greedy Mac: somehow the noodles seemed dry even though the cheese sauce was watery. Overall lackluster flavors.
Greedy Greek: like lamb can be, the meatballs were dry but good once smothered in the delicious tzazitki sauce. Hummus was ok.

Their cocktail menu is pretty good, and their take on a Colorado Mule with local peach whiskey was a hit with the mule fans of our group. 

The service was phenomenal, but we were one of only a few tables on a Saturday night- not a good sign. The location is awful, so I hope they start getting some traffic in the door. The place is very cute and I would consider coming back for more of their small plates and charcuterie."

Popped in for an early cocktail and tapas tasting and was very impressed.  Had the opportunity to talk to the owner, Treven, for a while. Heard the back story on the GH&#39;s unique name and tried to steal some of her recipes to no avail.

Very tasty mule selections and their infused gin was dangerously good.  Black and blue figs and jalapeño poppers are must-orders. 

Pro tip: As soon as you sit down order a basket of their homemade chips. As soon as you get that order, order another.  If timed perfectly you&#39;ll have ordered two batches of their delicious, warm, homemade chips. You&#39;re welcome. Feel free to repeat steps one and two as needed."

I miss the old, but in with the new! Friendly service, interesting personality and great location. We stopped in just for drinks and had a blast. The spot is a good time with a small bar, area a lounge, and a bunch of tables. 

The bartender Renee was super cool and we had a good time. They have several local brewery options on tap as well as a full bar. We even got some complimentary lime tarts.

I had the yard bird sandwich and it was really good and a little different...the bread it was on was a nice surprise. My only personal thought was a bit lighter on the capers in the orzo...that could just be my preference.  Glass of Vouvray was great compliment on hot day.

Best thing we ordered was the greedy fanatic. The flatbread had a good chewy consistency and the filling was flavorful. 

The rest of the food seemed unimpressive for which the only reason I can come up with is the quality of ingredients. The prices weren&#39;t bad, but I would rather pay more rather than be reminded of a cheap diner when I see a menu like this.

Appetizers:
Black and blue figs were unimpressive, which made me sad since this was one of the reasons we sought this place out.
There were no delicate flavors in the greedy chives, and while the pepper Bon bons had a kick, they reminded me of stuffed jalapeños I&#39;ve had out of the freezer. We had an order of house made chips that were ok in comparison.

Main course:
The greedy mac tasted like it had baloney in it, and the ham in the greedy cheese tasted cheap despite the cool presentation in the skillet. The gf ordered the greedy Greek which disappeared so I didn&#39;t get to try it (maybe that was another food item and I missed out)

There are a few good items on the menu but not enough to bring me back. I applaud the unique menu, but not the execution."

The drinks were fabulous and would suggest anything with a boozed soaked cherry. Despite not liking figs I found them to be a well balanced sweet and savory morsels. The homemade chips were nothing more then potato chips but with really good dolled up condiments. What is really working of the Greedy Hamster is the simple foods on the menus. What is not quite working is how hard they are trying to make these simple foods overly complex and elaborate. They could benefit returning to the basics. I would probably not go out of my way to return unless if I found myself in the area needing a drink and snack."

I really, really liked it, with the bacon jam having a little kick to it. Others in my party had some mixed reviews, but overall it was a good meal. Homemade chips were also really good, have a good seasoning on them. For the place not being all that busy, it took quite a while for the food to come out, and there really wasn&#39;t much checking in from our server, however the bartender came up and asked how my friend liked her beer and talked about a few others.

We started with the pepper Bon Bons which were excellent, and the Greedy Greek happy hour appetizer, albeit small, was also very tasty. 

The highlight of the meal was the Crock of Chicken which was one of the best pot pies around however my girlfriends hamburger was really just mediocre which leads us to the four star review.

I ordered the crock o&#39; chicken - their take on chicken pot pie, which is hearty but somehow light at the same time...maybe because they eschew the normal full layer of pie crust in favor of a delicious, airy biscuit of puff pastry on top, and the filling has a great veg:meat:gravy ratio!  I also appreciated the bartender bringing me some terrific, simple house-made chips and pickle slices to sample on the house while I waited for my meal.

On top of that, I chatted with some fellow travelers , who definitely had some different political views, and got to chat with the manager/owner, a really nice, fun woman named Tay. We laughed about how unique the other travelers were, heh.

I was undecided on which wine I wanted so was presented with a couple different options to try. When my friends arrived, we had appetizers seated on a couch in the little alcove like we were in someone&#39;s living room, then moved to a more traditional table set up for dinner. We had the black and bleu figs to  share (omg, so good) and I got the lamb burger for dinner. They were very accommodating with requests for gluten free modifications. 

An easy walk from downtown hotels and plenty of street parking. This place would be great for dining alone, with a date, or hanging out with a group of friends.

Visiting Denver with friends (first time for me); got taken in by the name first, reviews second. Pretty pleased with our choice. Between the four of us we split:
Greedy Greek - lamb meatballs were a hit with all; delicious homemade hummus and tziki sauce
Quesadilla - waitress recommended the full portion to split instead of happy hour portion (four wedges vs two) which was the right call; yummy carnitas and cheese filling
Chopped small plate - tiny mozzarella balls, sundried and regular tomatoes, olives, garlic, served with two flatbread pieces. It was good (and nice to have one veggie-ish dish amongst all the meats/carbs) but not anything spectacular 
Cheese crisps - too salty for me; others enjoyed them
Pork crimple - flavor was pretty good, but a difficult item to eat/share. Also, was unaware that &#34;spicy mustard&#34; equals wasabi until we got it - mustard under the dish (which means the won tons get a decent soaking) is VERY spicy

A little more variety in dish options would be nice (a salad perhaps? Or some veggie small plates). Also, no dessert menu is a big bummer - made us go somewhere else (even though the waitress offered us some brownies they had in the back...which was nice, but awkward).

Cocktails made the friends happy. Our waitress was also the bartender and made me (preggo) a nice mocktail - their homemade ginger shrub and soda; tasted like a less sweet ginger ale."

Yelp was quite helpful in helping us choose where to go, so thank you fellow yelpers. The first thing we noticed was the ambiance and the style of the bar which definitely had a good vibe. Had good seating indoors and outdoors and had good music playing. We ordered a bit of food including the greedy salad and pork wontons. Both were very good. Along with our food we of course ordered some drinks. Everything at this place is 5/5 star except one thing, which is the reason I am giving it a 4/5, and that is the speed of service. The staff is very friendly and helpful, however, our food and drinks took almost 40 minutes to come out. And we were not the only people this happened to. So because of that reason I cannot give it a 5/5. But, if this was an off day, then this place is very solid. I will definitely be giving it another try."

Had the Chips &amp; Dips to start, based on other reviews and were impressed. YUM, YUM! (All three homemade dips were delicious &amp; the seasoned chips thin and crispy, and delicious without dip!) Shared the Shredded Hamster food salad, but wish we&#39;d each gotten our own, it was divine. My husband loved his warm &amp; toasty Greedy Veg sandwich and I loved my warm melty Greedy Cheese served in it&#39;s own skillet.

The place was hardly busy and the service was terrible with long wait times and a drink order that went I filled until I asked for it. They did take it off the check at the end. The carnitas quesadilla was odd - it tasted fine but was not what I would called carnitas. More like small bits of pork with what seemed like ground beef mixed in. After I finished eating I wanted to just sit and take care of some work for a few minutes and finish my drink but I was asked if I wanted the check and felt a little like they were trying to get people out. This is a cute place and seemed like it had promise but some training may be needed.

I ordered the club sandwich and it was outstanding while my friends ordered the bacon cheeseburger with green chili sauce and they were fantastic as well.

If you can tell me that the food here was not good, I will happily take a running start and punch myself in the junk. That&#39;s how serious I am about how awesome the food is here.

The service was friendly but slow at about 35 minutes to get the food. The portions are small and the food is not prepared how you ask.
The Greedy Italian is a few meatballs in sauce, ours came without the garlic bread. The Greedy Fanatic was a good combination of steak and cheese but a bit bland with only a few peppers and lacking a cohesive sauce. The Greedy Mac was an interesting blend of macaroni and cheese with green chilies but came cold and I don&#39;t think the peppers worked. A medium rare burger came out well done and unappetizing. 
I hope they figure things out soon because right now there&#39;s nothing worth experiencing here."

Only 4 beers on tap (one of which is Coors Light), so it would be nice to see a few more local crafts added to the rotation, but the wine and liquor selection seemed little more robust.  Housemade tonic added something special to the gin and tonic!  Prices are very reasonable - small plates from $3 - $6, entrees $7 - 11, drinks $3 - $5.

The vibe is mellow and comfortable. The owner and her mom greeted me and we shared a laugh (memorable way to start dinner). Although small it was busy and thus it took a bit to get food. However when it did arrive I was happy. I had the chips, as many people suggest, and the blue cheese stuffed figs wrapped in prosciutto draped in Tabasco honey. The honey is on the spicy side, but I enjoyed how it played off of the blue cheese. The chips were good and two of the sauces absolutely spicy--so if you are into that you will enjoy this dish. I decided on a CA rose (limited edition on their menu...Can&#39;t quite remember the name). I finished with the Greek plate and it was ok. After all the spicy excitement I was hoping for something daring but it left a bit to be desired.

This location has a bad rep for service. And, honestly, I can&#39;t rebut that. It is often slow and the folks behind the counter don&#39;t really exude &#34;customer service.&#34; It&#39;s more of a minimum wage, just holding out for quittin&#39; time kind of vibe.

But the food is so dang good, I&#39;m still giving them 4 stars."

Especially the chicken Philly. They are not cooking the chicken all the way. I bought 6 subs and all of them were undercooked. The black guy in charge had a little attitude, along with his buddies and said we can do it again. So I gave him the opportunity to do it again.. And again it was a disaster. I asked for my money back and told him if he wanted my subs back. He said no! So I threw away all the subs away (over $50 worth). By the way, he only reimbursed me for one sub. I don&#39;t know about you, but I would hate to see my kids get sick because they ate raw chicken! I will never again come to this place. Also while I was there, 1 other individuals (older black man) came in very upset because the sub he had was not done correctly. He said he drove home and when he and his wife opened the sub it was nasty! I don&#39;t know what it was, but he was fuming with profanities. Thank you Jersey Mikes.

A new girl was working the cash register-literally her first day. We all know this because the gentleman (working at 7:40pm on Friday, Sept 11, 2015), proceeded to announce to the long line of people who were patiently waiting in silence, that he &#34;Has to take a break. It&#39;s her first night here and I&#39;m doing everything and I can&#39;t handle this so you all will have to wait.&#34; Walks in the back for a few minutes. 

The poor new girl just stands at the register which is apparently the only thing she&#39;s been trained in. Then he comes back in and has an attitude during the rest of the lady&#39;s order he walked out on. 

He then kept saying out loud that it is going to be a longgggg time, almost discouraging us from ordering. A man left and the sour worker said even louder &#34;It&#39;s going to be a while, I told you so&#34; confirming his encouragement for us to not do business there that evening. I walk out not due to the &#34;time&#34; he claimed it would take, but for the sheer disgust in his unprofessional and immature attitude. I understand we all have bad days, but we don&#39;t discourage people from spending money at our place of employment as a result. 

This post was written only to bring attention to the manager of this store: I love your store, I love your food even more, but I want you to know about this situation so that someone can rightfully suggest other ways to handle a stressful day to this rude employee. If the employee was having an oddly bad day and is never like this, please disregard this review, but I&#39;ve seen him in there before and he&#39;s never been anything near nice or welcoming."

I made that very mistake and I was deathly ill because of it. Unfortunately I was stuck in Aurora for work ( sorry for all those who live there) and my co workers wanted to eat here, sure I said lets try it . I mean its a sub shop, how bad can it be. I ordered the Caesar salad wrap. Ok,I&#39;m into it. Tortilla with chicken and your basic caesar salad dressing right? Not exactly, the wrap was semi-warm (gross) seriously, either make it hot or make it cold. It was slimy, oily, and greasy...and not in the junk fast food satisfaction kinda way. I couldn&#39;t finish it and at the $9 dollar price tag I felt I should at least try to finish it. I regret the very thought. I finished my shift and I started getting a pounding headache. Could it have been from a lot of contributing factors? absolutely. However, I do know, when I was riding with my co-workers on the way back to our office, I was grateful I didn&#39;t have to drive. I literally said nothing the entire ride back. I checked in with my boss and took off. Approx driving two blocks from my office I experience a reversal of fortune. Literally in the middle of downtown, during all the holiday festivities ( parade of lights, christmas gatherings etc etc ) pulled over chucking up like a highschool prom queen. Seriously aggravating, it took me almost two hours to drive home (I&#39;m probably 15 mins from downtown) I had all I could do to get home and crawl into bed. My husband wasn&#39;t thrilled with me getting home so late, and I wasn&#39;t thrilled reliving my nightmare explaining to him how I got ill in the first place. I reiterate: DO NOT EAT HERE -unless you&#39;re going for the highschool prom queen type thing,"

Second thing: when somebody makes your order wrong, it&#39;s common courtesy to just let the customer keep the wrongly made order if they want, since presumably it will be tossed anyway. It&#39;s just a small &#34;give&#34; since they wasted your time. But here, no. Apparently that&#39;s not part of their policy (and I made a point of politely asking). Instead, they took it from me and put it on a counter behind them. And let it sit there the entire time I ate my (remade, 5 minutes later) sandwich.

pros: bread is better than subway, and meat is sliced when you order (those this increases the wait time)

Also the portion size seemed very un-massive for $12.

Same deal with the shrimp and grits... super tiny portion for $12.

The sweet potato and bacon hash? W&amp;C is doing something right there. Should have ordered a few of those instead.

The empanadas were just &#39;ok&#39;. We got two for $8. 

I had the ginger-orange clove house cocktail. If you like your drinks heavy on the mixer side and less on the booze side... order up one of these little Shirley Temples.

Everything was really good, and had a few beers there as well. We wanted to try more but we were going to multiple places that day. We sat in the outside patio which was nice for a sunny day. Our server was very helpful and quick."

We were STARVING and even though the place was packed there were 3 open seats at the chefs counter which we gladly took. The waiter that attended us was full of energy and was pretty nice but when we asked what was good he basically said everything. In my opinion, that;s a pretty lazy way to describe what&#39;s good on the menu. We decided to not order everything per his recommendation and made a few selections of our own. 

We got a 1/2 lb of each of the follow meats:

Cochinita Pibil (Red-Chile Braised Pork): I was expecting this one to be spicy but it wasn&#39;t. In fact, it was pretty bland.

Roasted Goat (Cabrito): A little on the dry/tough side but full of flavor. No gaminess which some of you might prefer but I prefer it gamy.

Whiskey &amp; Coke Beer Brisket: This was my favorite of the night. The brisket was soo fatty and tender the meat just melts in your mouth. That sauce one the side is BOMB.

Coriander Roasted Colorado Lamb: Cooked prefect medium rare but very sloppy cuts. It seemed like someone had a pretty dull knife and tried hacking it without success. It was tasty though.

Hand Cut French Fries: $5 for like 10 french fries?? Never again.

Overall, food was okay. Not the best meats that we&#39;ve had but pretty solid. We got 1/2 of 4 meats and we didn&#39;t get full (3 of us). Not sure if they even weigh the meats. I just saw the cooks toss them in the plate and probably just eyeballed them at best."

I like it a lot. Pretty unique menu, and setting. Delicious foods and flavors. - I think much of it is Latin American influenced. The goat is amazing. Friendly service.

We ordered quite a spread from all the areas of the menu to share which is always a great way to really try a menu:

-Shrimp and grits
-Cornbread
-Green Chile Biscuit
-Half a rotisserie chicken
-Taco special
-Salad
-Grilled veggies
-Empanadas
-Mac and Cheese

The dishes came out quickly, our server was friendly and had great suggestions and although the portions are not huge for comfort food they were very filling."

The food here is decent and flavorful. I think the menu changes regularly here. There are great items on the happy hour menu (drinks and food) that lasts until 6pm. 
- Ribs (4 to an order) were all right, the meat came off the bone. 
- Green Chile shredded chicken biscuit (1 to order) is worth getting during happy hour
- Green Chile cheese fries were ok, the fries were soggy 

The main dishes are just meat (pulled pork, fish, chicken, ribs, lamb, goat, etc) and you order it by 1/4 (single serving), 1/2, 1 lb. Being from Texas, these portions are very tiny but probably much more reasonable and healthier sizes... The trout is actually a whole fish too. My favorite was the pulled pork with coleslaw - nice tangy flavor and moist. 

There are no sides/breads included so you have to order it separately
- jalepeno corn bread is good (again.. very tiny single portion)
- griddled Masa with goat cheese - comes with 2. Are ok, not enough cheese and a little dry
- chickpea croquettes with dipping sauce - sounds and looks questionable ..  they look like blocky French fries on steroids but they were my favorite.

Pretty hip place and atmosphere. The service is good and quick. They filled our waters, made sure the table didn&#39;t get messy, very friendly and attentive. 

We came at a good time cuz there was a huge line after we left."

They can not take reservations so be ready to wait across the street at Los Chingones until they buzz you. 
This place is very cozy, loud, and trendy. Lots of opportunity to meet other people and they&#39;re mostly rather good looking. Our server was amazing and I wish I could remember his name now. 
We started with 
The massive attack salad and chickpea croquettes.
I&#39;m not much of a salad girl but it was an amazing melding of all of my most favorite veggies. (tempura broccoli WHAT, asparagus, spinach, cucumbers &amp; parmesan) This salad blew the chickpea croquettes out of the water.

For our main dish we split the roasted goat. The dipping sauce that accompanies this order will make you throw any reservations you had about eating a cute tender delicious baby goat out the window. Bring your vegan friends. 

Parking can be a total bitch on Friday and Saturday nights but don&#39;t fret Lyft will pick you up literally at the door."

I came here instead of going to a rooftop bar to see the sunset, and I&#39;m sooo glad I did. I was eating dinner by myself so I opted to sit in chef&#39;s corner (little area where you could see the chefs in action). Do this!

Their happy hour menu isn&#39;t too extensive, but each of their items were top notch. I ordered the Green Chile Cheese fries with rotisserie chicken. The fries were crispy, the green chile sauce wasn&#39;t saturated with spices, and the chicken was tender and juicy. I also ordered the 1/4 lb of brisket on the side. The brisket was a little pricey for it&#39;s size. Soft, but a tad on the dry side. They give the brisket with a cup of bbq sauce, but I like to taste the meat on it&#39;s own before dipping it in. 

This place gets 4 stars for its food and I&#39;d add .5 for the cool, cooking area."

If you&#39;re claustrophobic it might not be for you, because from what I understand it&#39;s always packed. Fortunately, two in our party waited while we made our way in the rain, and our table for six was waiting when we walked in. 

Our server was fast to approach for our drink orders. I ordered the Elk Grove Pinot Gris because, well, it&#39;s absolutely delicious, though the Pomegranate Cucumber Lime concoction did grab my attention. When our food orders were taken shortly after receiving our drinks, I decided on the ceviche and a side of jalapeno cornbread. Our table also ordered many other dishes, including the fried plantains, rice and beans, and brisket to share.

When the dishes were put down in front of us, I admit I laughed a little. In this age of huge portions, these were seriously small plates! The lamb tacos answered the question, &#34;Can tacos be cute?&#34;, and the answer is yes! In the tiniest tortillas I&#39;ve ever seen there was still plenty of lamb to satisfy when enjoyed with our collection of shared sides.

Everything I tried at the table was delicious. The ceviche was so tasty with lots of spice, but not too much. This was served with tortilla chips. And the side of jalapeno cornbread, shaped in a tiny little loaf, was crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.

Afterwards we ordered the butterscotch pudding, which comes in a small jar with whipped cream, and a slice of coconut key lime pie with blueberries and whipped cream. Thankfully no one at our table was a germophobe because both were passed around for all to devour! 

So, come here for the food, the noise, and the close quarters with an open mind and empty tummy and order several plates. I promise you&#39;ll have fun and you won&#39;t leave hungry!"

I rushed out with my Dad on a Saturday early evening to experience things for myself, and while it was good, we both left thinking that it was just that: good. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Both the service and atmosphere at Work &amp; Class are noteworthy, with a quick and attentive staff that manage the hybrid seating arrangement both indoors and outdoors well. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Work &amp; Class ain&#39;t cheap, but it also ain&#39;t unreasonable. My father and I ordered the following:

Peppers Five Ways: $14.00
Regular Mac n Cheese: $5.00
Short Ribs: $15.00
Quarter Pound of Braised Pork: $7.75
Quarter Pound of Brisket: $7.75

As you can see, it was a bit of a mixed bag price wise. $5.00 was an absolute bargain for Mac and Cheese, but $7.75 for a quarter pound of meat was absolutely absurd given you can get top grade brisket for $20.00 a pound these days elsewhere. I had mixed feelings about the pepper and short rib appetizers for $14.00 and $15.00 respectively, but none of this was enough to have me withholding stars though. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Our meal was, well, it was okay. The pepper appetizer was the highlight of the show without a doubt, with a nice blend of options for anyone who is pepper savvy. 

From there; however, things were less outstanding. The mac and cheese was a bit runny and weak in flavor, and both the short rib appetizer and the braised pork were surprisingly plain given their menu descriptions. The whiskey and coke beef brisket was good, although I&#39;m not sure I could really taste either the whiskey or the coke. All in all a good meal, but not a great one. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Work &amp; Class has a great vibe and a menu that&#39;s really out of this world - on paper. In practice, prices are on the high side for the portions you get and I wasn&#39;t really blown away by any of the dishes. No Star Granted."

I must say, the tapas style food and the ambiance makes it for a nice evening. Larimer St. has now changed quite a bit since I was a kid and it is a hopping place! 

Whiskey and Coke Beef Brisket - 1/4 lb of beef was great. The amount of fat and the meat was great, but I wish the meat was a little bit more tender and slow cooked even longer. I must say though, I am a sucker for the fatty parts of meat, so Work &amp; Class has won me over then. The meat overall was great and was flavored really well. I think that was my only critique of the night. 

Roasted Corn and Poblano Salad - Definitely a larger portion than I was expecting for a side salad. I must say, the corn was roasted to perfection and the poblano was a nice touch to the whole dish. 

Cobbler - Seasonal based on what is available. Famous Colorado Palisade peaches were the featured fruit and man was that mighty tasty. The crumble on top was not too sweet and then the peaches were of the right amount of sweetness.  

Parking is pretty easy in the neighborhood behind the place. This is definitely a place to be at night and enjoy the Colorado weather if permitting on the outside patio!"

The atmosphere is great. It is very energetic and fun, but super loud. Honestly though, the noise faded once we had been there about fifteen minutes and it wasn&#39;t as distracting as when we first walked in. Our server was super friendly, and the bussers were amazing at keeping the table clean and water full, which is huge in places like this where the beer is plentiful.

Speaking of beer, my aunt ordered a Coors Light and this is more of a craft beer place, but the server offered an amazing, comparable beer so the staff really knows their stuff with recommendations. This place offers some salads but mostly individual meat options, with choice of weight, with optional sides. I was interested in this concept, and not at all turned off by everything having to be purchased separately because mixing and matching is fun, and the way it was done was appropriate to the entrees. 

I ended up getting the lamb and macaroni and cheese, while my mother got the Massive Attack salad and my aunt got the trout and heirloom tomato and ricotta salad. My lamb was delicious and 1/4 pound was more than filling, For me personally, it was a bit bland to eat just straight meat. I wish it had some sort of marinade or sauce, but I wouldn&#39;t entirely rule out the idea that my pallet is not sophisticated enough to enjoy it. My mother&#39;s salad looked super boring and I was glad I decided to skip salad that night, but my aunt was RAVING over the trout. She demanded every restaurant we went to for the rest of the trip have fish on the menu, so perhaps this is the can&#39;t-miss menu item.

Overall, I would not be opposed to coming back here in the slightest, but it will not be my new go-to because of personal preference. If you are a meat lover this most certainly won&#39;t be the case for you."

Work and Class is more of a tapas style restaurant with small dishes to share. For drinks I started out with an Old Fashioned recommended by our server and it did not disappoint. For food we started out with the Peppers 5 Ways and the The Massive Attack Salad both were excellent. Then went on to have Chickpea Croquettes, Coriander Roasted Colorado Lamb, Jalapeño Cornbread and Girddled Goat Cheese Masa. We finished up with the Butterscotch Pudding. Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.

Great atmosphere, smaller space and kind of on the loud side but didn&#39;t bother me. The price wasn&#39;t to bad either we got out of there for under $100 after tip."

It&#39;s a family style place so be ready to share with your party.  The meats are portioned by weight (or # of fish if you get the trout).  We had a half-lb of lamb, 1 trout, and the fried chicken with a couple of sides and this was adequate for 3 people.  The food was all great, especially the fried chicken which was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The service was spot on and the vibe of the place is quite enjoyable.

It was so different than anything I have around me. We were told by our host that you should just order two or three things and then pass everything around. I think the six of us ordered 12-14 different things and everyone just tried every thing. It was outstanding! The brisket and mac and cheese were my favorites of the night. The drinks are very stout so be careful and have a ride home. 

However, if you are looking for a nice quite dinner, you should just turn around now. This place is LOUD! If you are hard of hearing and need people to repeat things often anyways, this is not the place for you.

The place is definitely popular and quite loud inside, so loud that I could barely hear the server!

Food came out fast &amp; service was pretty good.

Things we ordered:
-Empanadas ($8)-server told us it was super popular, and it was good, but not great. I felt the flavors were lacking a bit &amp; it was pretty pricey for two small empanadas 
-Side of mac &amp; cheese ($5) yum!!!! I love mac &amp; cheese &amp; this didn&#39;t disappoint ;)
-Small orders of the pork, the brisket, and the lamb ($7.75 each) Of all three I only liked the pork. It was super flavorful &amp; moist. the small portion comes with 1/4 lb and it was perfect enough for me, but my BF thought it was too small and left hungry. we also felt the other two were just okay. Nothing special.

This place is a little on the pricier side. It was great atmosphere with young people coming to hang out on a Friday night. Overall the food was decent.

We luckily got a table because the place was packed. We told our server that we needed the bill with our food because we were running a bit on
the late side. 

For drinks the hubs got an old fashioned and I opted for the pomegranate/cucumber with whisky. It was very good and perfectly refreshing. 

The food was incredible. The empanadas were so good we ordered another round of them. We also sampled the brisket, beans and rice and Mac and cheese. The beans and rice were so good that I would order just that and empanadas next time. Mmmmm.  The brisket was really tender but there was a pretty decent chunk of fat that was in the half pound of meat that we couldn&#39;t eat.

My favorite was the Apple, citrus , and rosemary with choice of spirit (I chose gin). Their selection for food is expansive. We tried the chile relleno which was an interesting take on the classic and the green chile biscuit with a chile and rotisserie chicken gravy which I thought was out of this world.

To start off, the &#34;make -your-own&#34; style cocktail idea is great. I went with hibiscus and gin, and it was seriously such an amazing drink. Sweet yet refreshing, and a great way to start my meal. 

For 3, we ordered the orange thyme chicken, whiskey and coke brisket, French fries, and chickpea croquettes. It was the amount our waiter recommended, and the perfect amount of food; my eyes tend to be bigger than my stomach (oops) and I left feeling full but not bloated. The chicken and whiskey were both extremely tender and well seasoned with lots of flavor. I&#39;m getting hungry just typing this and thinking about it honestly. It&#39;s 9:30 AM and I&#39;d totally be down for some of their brisket. 
The fries were good also, but like  your typical French fries. The chickpea croquettes weren&#39;t my favorite, but that could just be me; I know my friend really enjoyed them. Just very dense and not something for the casual chickpea lover. 

Our waiter was funny, friendly, and attentive. I could not have asked for a better dining experience and have zero hesitation when I saw that, at least so far, this is my favorite restaurant in Denver."

The menu goes like this: 
Apps 
Meat Choice of trout, brisket, chicken, goat, &amp; lamb: prices vary depending on portion sizes of 1/4 lb, 1/2 lb and 1 lb.
Sides

Three of us shared:

Massive Attack Salad (half) $6: the broccoli tempura was brilliant mixed with fresh greens, avocado, feta and lemon vinaigrette.
Meatballs $9: AMAZING! Served over a tomato parmesan grits seemed odd but such a remarkable and complimentary pairing. 
Brisket $14.75 (1/2 lb.): a tad dry but bbq sauce was good and tangy. (Being from Tx, I have high expectations about my brisket)
Mac n cheese $5: you don&#39;t find many places that serve shells so that was an interesting take. It was the perfect amount of cheesy but not overly thickly.
A couple whiskey craft cocktails

It was the ideal amount of food for 3 and all under $65. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the peppers, trout and brussels and hell maybe a couple more things..."

Service (Jordan?) was friendly and attentive, food arrived quickly, and the vibe was lively and loud (in a good way).

For food, the hungry three of us devoured almost everything on the menu. The best of the lot included the blue corn veggie empanadas, which were the most delicious, and the meatballs on poblano grits with a spicy tomato sauce, yum. The heirloom tomato and ricotta salad and Dungeness crab and potato cake were each tasty, although the latter wasn&#39;t quite Delmarva worthy. The pineapple and shrimp ceviche was underwhelming and overly watery. Overall, a great meal and even greater company.

We were seated and ordered an old-fashioned and a ginger orange clove cocktail. They were both delicious! We split 1/4lb brisket, whole trout, jalapeno cornbread, mac and cheese, potato salad and tomato/ricotta salad. It was more than enough food for the two of us to finish! We sat on the outside patio bar stools which gave us a great view of the city during the sunset. It was awesome. Prices were reasonable for the portion sizes although I wish the cocktails were a little less.

The Bad- I wasn&#39;t impressed with the fish or the mac and cheese. The fish was simply fried and I was hoping for some sort of seasoning. The mac and cheese seemed a bit watery and not cheesy enough.

Service:  We arrived (party of 10) around 8:15 on a Saturday evening and were quoted 60-90 minutes of a wait time (as expected).  We were offered a 20% off coupon to use at their sister bar Pon Pon while we waited...great deal!  After about an hour I called to check on our wait, they informed us they would be able to seat us all together, but the guests at the table were currently working on entrees and it would likely be another 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes we decided to head back to the restaurant.  The hostess and the owner each came out more than once to update us on the table and apologize for the wait, they even brought out an appetizer on the house to hold us over and advised they would still accommodate us.  Talk about great customer service!

Our server, Mario, was great!  He informed us of the menu and was able to keep all of our orders straight and even brought by a round of shots...which were fantastic!

Food:  we had the brisket, chicken, trout, and lamb.  Absolutely no complaints on any of them...I live in Texas and was even a fan of the brisket!  The lamb was my personal favorite.  We also shared the french fries, collards, mac and cheese, roasted vegetables and sweet plantains.  My only complaint was the mac and cheese was a bit dry, but all of the other side options were fantastic, so really do you need all of the sides like we had?!? The collards were done differently, almost like creamed spinach...I liked the change.  The plantains were amazing!

Don&#39;t leave without getting dessert, specifically the Chocolate PB Love sundae!  I&#39;m a HUGE fan of both peanut butter and banana, and if I can get them together in one plate/bowl, even better.  This dessert was absolutely perfect, just the right balance of chocolate, banana, peanut butter and caramel in an ice cream sundae...not much better than that!

Work &amp; Class will definitely be on my list the next time I make it back to Denver, I&#39;ll just plan ahead to avoid the wait (if possible, they probably always have a wait because it&#39;s just that good)."

We were lucky enough to sit down right when we got there- normally there&#39;s a very long wait. We started with cocktails- my boyfriend had a bourbon barrel aged cocktail and loved it. We had the crab potato cake to start (I wish there was a little more crab in it- but the sauce is amazing). We then had meat (chicken, pork and brisket) and sides: Mac n cheese, rice and beans, and jalapeño corn bread. I have to be honest- everything was excellent. There was nothing we didn&#39;t like.

Seriously - being able to get just a tin of perfectly cooked pork, or lamb, paired with one of the southern-leaning sides and a beer for ~$30 for two - there is a reason I&#39;ve been there 3 times this month.

Appetizers: 

- Peppers Five Ways ($14).  Yep. 5 different peppers served in a variety.  All very good, and the Jalapeño had great zest.  Not a large dish, so sharing is difficult.  I hoped for a little more for $14.  
- Shrimp &amp; Grits ($12).  A nice twist on a classic Southern dish.  Again, not much more than an App for 1 person.  
- New Jersey Ernie&#39;s Meatballs ($9).  Pork &amp; veal meatballs with Poblano grits.  Great taste, but there&#39;s only 3 meatballs (tough to share with 2 people) and the meatballs are about the size of a walnut.  

Entrees:
- Roasted Goat (1/2 lb for $14.75).  Shredded goat meat that has been seasoned like a Latin dish.  Non &#34;gamey&#34; taste that is similar to a brisket.  Good choice, but a full pound would be better at $28.75.
-  Coriander Roasted Colorado Lamb (1/2 lb for $16.75).  Another good dish.  The lamb was perfectly cooked and 1/2 lb is a good portion.
 
Sides:
-Fried Sweet Plantains ($5).  Includes 4 plantains with a dipping sauce.  If you&#39;ve never had fried plantains, these are some of the best!
-Garlic Tarragon Roasted Veggies ($5).  Nicely seasoned and brings out the fresh flavors of the veggies.  Next time, I will order the large side for $10.  

Service:  This place gets crazy busy after 6 PM, so come early or prepare to wait.  Still, the Wait Staff is prompt and very friendly.  We didn&#39;t mind waiting and having a few drinks at the bar. 

Ambiance: Like most places in RiNo District, it has a gritty, communal feel.  There were 4 of us seated a 6-person table, so they seated another couple next to us.  Great way to meet people and discuss the dinner choices!  

Overall: We enjoyed the food, drink, and atmosphere.   There are many places in the RiNo District, and Work &amp; Class should be one of your stops.  It&#39;s a little pricey, but we appreciate the new adaptation of flavors on some fairly common foods."

The place was packed, especially for a Wednesday, but we were promptly seated at a community table. The server was friendly, quick and told us about the specials, and brought me two wine tasters. Red wine list BTG is great, especially for big, juicy, fruit-dominant reds. 

The appetizer special was a spicy lamb (I think) sausage with caramelized onions, peppers and avocado mousse. The flavors really complemented each other and the portion was great for two. We shared 1/4 lb of buffalo chicken and goat--the chicken was tender, not too spicy and a great portion. Goat meat was pretty tough, but came with a nice sauce that softened it. The goat cheese masa breads were light and fluffy and went well with the goat meat. Heirloom tomato salad with ricotta and cucumbers was a fresh palate cleanser. 
The sweet plaintains were forgotten by the server, but once he was reminded, came out hot but a bit burned with a chipotle mayo cream. 

Food is AMAZING, great to share and comes out quickly. Drinks are great! Good place for a date, happy hour with friends or for when a craving for protein strikes. Cant wait to go back and save room for dessert. Gluten Free options GALORE!"

She was so happy that I was so impressed! The small space, nice decor, and friendly staff all added to the great food and drink.

I love the small plates trend because it allows friends to share and sample more. 

My best friend, being from FL, loves shrimp and grits. W&amp;C offered crawfish and grits. My bestie has only eaten crawfish once, and her experience wasn&#39;t good. These were pretty good though. And she said the grits were great, so I&#39;d take that as some sincere gospel.

We also had the blue corn empanadas. I&#39;ve only ever had blue corn chips, but this was so good -- as was the spicy dipping sauce.

For the main course, we had the braised short rib and the veg mix of Brussels sprouts and butternut squash -- both holy yum! We also had the mushroom risotto that was decent, but the risotto was a little too creamy, like they just used some cream of mushroom soup mixture. In retrospect, some potatoes would have gone great with the beef -- sort of like grandma&#39;s pot roast and potatoes.

Overall, I was impressed and would happily return."

We ordered a variety of meats.  The lamb was cooked perfectly.  The other meats (Goat, Brisket) were oily and bland.  The tortillas were homemade and they were also a bit bland.

The service was good for being super busy.

I feel that for Denver, this is probably the best Latin-inspired cuisine you can get, however, this is definitely not a measure of Latin cuisine in America.

Bottom Line:  Stop in for some lamb, but don&#39;t expect a miracle meal."

We now, no kidding, have a favorite restaurant.

We were surprised by being sat immediately.  The restaurant was crowded, but we got lucky.

The draft beers are reasonable and local ($5).  I went for one of their barrel age cocktails (which was a yummy old fashion).  The barrel age drinks were about $12

We were treated to a chefs taste of the chicpea croquette - delicious.

Work &amp; Class is very different than other restaurants.  Everything is alacarte and everything has multiple &#34;sizes&#34;.   For example we got the Colorado coriander lamb dish as our main.  We picked the 1/4lb size.  There are  also available 1lb and larger size. . with a helpful hint (1/4 is good for one. . and so on).  

For an appetizer we started with the empanadas. Blue corn with some smoky good sauce.

We got a side - a nice green helping of &#34;cider greens&#34;. For a bread we picked a chili biscuit.


For dessert we got the buterscotch pudding. I was a little surprised - it was delicious but it was definitely American pudding, not european 

The entire meal (2 drinks, 1 cocktail included) was about $54 bucks.  This is the best price - fanciest tasting - casual fun place i&#39;ve been to.  It is a new favorite and since its so reasonable we will be here often (no need to save for a special occasion)"

What I really enjoy about the meats (besides how they taste) is that you can choose the portion you would like. A big problem I (and many others) tend to have when eating out, is to over eat, and I like being able to try different aspects of the menu without going home and regretting it later.

The pork, the lamb, and the brisket are good. The chickpea croquetts and mac and cheese were good sides. 

My approach is to have 1/4 lb of a protein I feel like and then order a handful of starters or sides depending on how many are in my party."

We sat along the open window bar looking out over the  quite entertaining street scene. The happy hour offering list, though short, was adequate. I tried the spicey/sour basil infused cocktail with my choice of liquor being tequilla. It was too heavy on the sour but the flavor combo was amazing. Ask for it light on the sour. You can get several slow cooked meats in different sharable weight amounts such as brisket, goat, lamb, pork...and once you try one you&#39;ll feel driven to commit to come back and try them all. From the Happy Hour menu I tried the green chili cheese fries. They were awesome. Smokey green sauce had great flavor and not too greasy. Love this place!

To eat here you have to be a little adventurous. I mean, plantains? Why would I go to a sit-down restaurant and order bananas lol? But the food was all so unique and we finished every single dish. Definitely come here and eat &#34;tapa style&#34; so you can try a bunch of different things!

It is in a very hip part of RINO (down the street from Billy&#39;s Hot Dogs). 

There is street parking but no lot so Sunday evening was a great time to go. 

They don&#39;t seat incomplete parties and only only groups of up to 7. This is due to the smaller space of the restaurant. I like that idea as well as having community tables for people who don&#39;t mind sharing space. 
 
The waitress Jen was excellent. She gave us great suggestions for everything from drinks to appetizers and main courses.  She was attentive and the other staff made sure we had water (served in cool tin glasses) as well as checking on us throughout the meal. 

I tried the Tart Pomegranate-Cucumber cocktail with whiskey. It was very balanced with some sweetness, some tart and enough whiskey to round it out. I could have had several of these but limited myself to one. 

For appetizers we tried the green chili cheese fries. The green chili was fantastic. The fries were good but could have been more crispy. It was a smaller portion but priced at $5 so no complaints. We also tried the blue corn empanadas, which were cooked perfectly and filled with cheese, corn and other vegetables and a dipping sauce. Two come to an order and can be cut in half to share amongst 4 people. 

For entrees I tried the fried chicken special, which came with three pieces and a buffalo dipping sauce. I didn&#39;t love the sauce but the chicken was fried well and pieces included a tender, drumstick and thigh/wing. My wife had the 1/2 pound of orange thyme rotisserie chicken. We went with the larger amount thinking we&#39;d had leftovers. It was so good that we ate it all. Definitely a killer bird. 

For sides we had the chickpea croquettes, which were fried perfectly and some of the griddled goat cheese masa. This was good but I wouldn&#39;t order it again (my wife would though). 

We did try some of the Butterscotch pudding for dessert (served in a small mason jar) and it was BEYOND. Usually I have to eat chocolate to give a dessert the highest marks but that was just mouth smacking delicious. 

Definitely a must try and not overly expensive."

Mains were the trout (hubby&#39;s fave), the roasted goat (first timer),rice and beans, Mac and cheese and tortillas. I made goat tacos with the beans and rice and it was yummy. The Mac and cheese is ok, there were breadcrumbs on it and I&#39;m a purist about that lol. Then for dessert the coconut key lime pie, get it even if you are full like I was and split it.

Recently named a regional Beard Award Semi-finalist despite the sort of noisy wall-to-wall space that voters and folks born before 1990 seem to despise, Dana Rodriguez&#39;s Work &amp; Class seemed a perfect fit for early Sunday dinner, the RiNo hotspot absolutely packed with only one Chef&#39;s Counter spot open despite arriving  mere fifteen minutes after service began.

Opened early 2015, the Mexico native coming to Denver by way of Southern California nearly twenty years ago, Rodriguez&#39;s story is one of hard work yielding great rewards in a career that moved from dishes to short-order to a prominent place in the group behind Rioja, the jump to her own restaurant within a converted shipping container speaking to the sort of determinaion that now allows her creative control of a  menu that changes frequently, though comfort food with a Latin twist always remains the goal.

Buzzing from the hostess stand all the way to an enclosed patio, the kitchen one of the most rapid-fire I&#39;ve ever had the opportunity to watch as Dana herself works the line intermittently alongside two Hispanic men and one Caucasian lady, Work &amp; Class Sundays feature Fried Chicken in addition to the braised meats, sides, breads and salads but trying best to sample a wide variety without overloading a four-course progression was selected, three quarter-pounds of protein paired to housemade bread plus one side and a duo of desserts.

Obviously preparing some elements in advance, the convection oven used to heat breads and the chicken while a grill and stove were used for made-to-order or braised fare, a small amuse of panisse kissed by pepper jam proved an amicable greeting and soon served a bowl of goat stew with vinegary broth made for sipping suffice it to say that the housemade masa is an inspired pairing, each bite entirely appealing on its lonesome but all the moreso when folded into a toothsome taco as the lean meat found a new level of richness atop the lightly melted cheese.

Deferring to the server for round two, both the roasted chicken and pork considered but the Whiskey and Coke Brisket suggested instead, those fancying fattier cuts of beef would be well advised to consider this preparation even though the flavor of the meat gets a little lost in the marinade, each bite featuring melt-in-the-mouth texture while the accompanying cornbread is slightly dry yet toothsome and not particularly hot.

Served a creamy side of risotto that unfortunately fell a bit flat in terms of earthy tones and spooning it slowly as the final savory round was prepared, I knew from the start that Chef Rodriguez&#39;s signature lamb was a destination dish before even entering the restaurant and although expectations were high they were nonetheless exceeded each bite of pink flesh nicely accented by the coriander without ever compromising the animal&#39;s characteristic funk.

Underwhelmed by the biscuit, a decent showing but unfortunately masking the cheddar with too much a vegetal tone, it was after a somewhat lengthy delay that the server returned to drop the check off but suggesting to him that I&#39;d like to order dessert I was met with no resistance, a thimble of Butterscotch Pudding with whipped cream and almond brittle tasty but not showstopping with plenty of room leftover for steamy Bread Pudding speckled with pears and a scoop of Vanilla Bean ice cream slowly melting on top."

DUNGENESS CRAB &amp; POTATO CAKE - The potato overpowered the crab.  
COCHINITA PIBIL (RED-CHILE BRAISED PORK) - Extremely salty, almost inedible. We probably should have sent it back but I think were in denial. We wanted it to taste good. ;(  
FRIED SWEET PLANTAINS - We had these the first visit and loved them.  Last night they were not the same.  Incredibly spicy.
CHOCOLATE PB LOVE SUNDAE - Way too much going on.  Even the server agreed it is way to sweet.  We thought the it would have been tastier with just a vanilla ice cream.  That&#39;s the first time we didn&#39;t finish a sundae."

It was amazing and portions were perfect. Now, let&#39;s move on to why the review is 3 stars and not 5. IT&#39;s packed. Ok, fine, it was Saturday night- I get it. We had a short wait when we arrived at 6PM. Not bad about about 20 min. No big deal. The we get seated. It&#39;s at a family style table with a billion other people. Ok, I know I am weird. I get it. I have crazy social anxiety and I have a hard time dealing with crowds anyway, but I. CAN. NOT. DO. FAMILY. STYLE. SEATING. This being our first visit I did not know this was an option of I would have requested any other type of table when I  checked in with the hostess. I&#39;m literally shoulder to shoulder with the woman next to me. I am clutching my purse in my lap and hyperventilating. My husband knows how I am and says &#34;let&#39;s just leave, no big deal, let&#39;s go&#34;. But I have heard the food is soooo good. The waitress comes with water. I see a small table for two behind us open. I ask can we move. Her response &#34;Probably not, but I guess I&#39;ll ask.&#34; Snotty much? I wanted to stay, but at this point I&#39;m about to leave just based on her attitude. Then the hostess comes and is super sweet and immediately moves us. I apologize profusely for my anxiety, but I would guess it is better for them to move someone than lose a table. We (thankfully) have a new server and he is fabulous. Super helpful and nice. Again, the food is top notch. Another reason I can&#39;t fully give it 5 stars is that it is so small it gets really, really loud. Which again, I get, but they also blare music at a high volume so it basically makes speaking to your dining companion impossible unless you yell (which the table of goombas next to us was very comfortable doing... I now know alllll about their workouts,sex lives and their political beliefs, thankyouverymuch). I would definitely be open to getting takeout from here, but I con&#39;t know that I can do the actual dining experience again. This was our belated anniversary dinner and we basically spent the evening staring at one another and listening to other people&#39;s conversations over extremely loud music. I&#39;m glad we went because the food is 100%, but ambiance is lacking."

The whole time I kept on asking what&#39;s the name of the place? He kept texting me back Work &amp; Class. I assumed he&#39;s at a class for work. Yes this went on the whole morning :) 

W&amp;C is so alive. The tiny entrance reflects a tiny inside. Close quarters. Loud. It&#39;s a party! Have you seen a silent party? The age of the customers are so widely varied. But everyone was enjoying themselves. Love the atmosphere. We were told that Tuesday was a mellow night. I am scared of their widely crazy Friday nights! :)

The food: Amazing. I ordered Roasted Kabrito(Goat) 1/2 lb. $12.75. This dish has the right to be famous. It&#39;s really good. If you&#39;re worried it might be gamey-no need to. It&#39;s totally been civilized for you. With a side of some dipping sauce. DO NOT SKIP THE SAUCE. 

Then I tried Adam&#39;s Coriander Roasted Lamb. I died and went to heaven. Yes a quick dish switch and I&#39;m in business! No sauce needed here. It was seasoned well with the meat still reddish, trimmed and resembled a seared Ahi. So yes this is my favorite among the two entrees. Also 1/2 lb. a couple of dollars more at $14.75. 

Their portion counseling: 1/4 lb is decent for one person. 1/2 lb is for people who can eat. Guess what? Next time I will get the 1lb instead because I can more than eat! 

We also had the New Jersey Ernie&#39;s Meatballs. $9. Three meatballs served on a bed of poblano grits with spicy tomato sauce and Parmesan. I recommend this as well. It tastes as good as it looks! 

The chickpea croquettes I will get again. The Big Pig in a blanket was different. The blanket was crusty but tasty! We skipped dessert.

We both had beers. It&#39;s a must! The staff were amazingly well organized. Yet they keep their friendly and warm demeanor. No wonder Adam wanted me to try this place. 

They don&#39;t take reservations. But I hope you don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s worth it!"

I got the Peppers Five Ways appetizer and the Citrus-Mustard Braised Short Ribs.  Both were incredible!

The braised short ribs were cooked to perfection, falling apart with the slice of a fork.  The ambiance was lively and inciting, but quite loud!  We were surprised to be seated quickly, as the small dining area was quite packed.  The unfortunate part was that our table was sandwiched roughly 8&#34; away from the ones on either side.

I really liked &#39;The Massive Attack Salad&#39;. Good preserved lemon vinaigrette dressing, and the tempura broccoli adds a nice crunch.

They are known for their meats, and you can order by the 1/4, 1/2, and full pound. I enjoyed the coriander roasted Colorado lamb.  

Tasty grits + shrimp also! And the cream sauteed chard with cheese. YUM!

The cocktails are AMAZING and I love how they are ordered. They list the cocktails and you choose the spirit you want in the drink. Different than what I&#39;m used to.

Went to dinner for the first time here last night with a friend. We went around 6:30 and the wait for first available (which includes the community table and heated atrium) was only 20 minutes. Since there isn&#39;t a lot of space to wait, the hostess told us that we could go across the street and grab a drink and they would call us. (You get 10% off at DADA Art Bar if you mention you&#39;re waiting for a table here - to note, DADA is not open on Sundays). However, Los Chingones was open, so we went in there and grabbed a drink at the bar. Both are right across the street from W&amp;C.

Once we got called, we headed over and were seated at the community table. So like any community table, it was pretty cozy - you are elbow to elbow - but this does not bother me, just a note for those of you who may prefer your personal space. Also and literally my ONLY negative comment is that this place is LOUD. If you are a quiet talker or looking for a quiet dinner, probably not the place for you. 

So back to the food - to start we had the Blue Corn Empanadas (serves 2) and they were delicious! Perfectly fried - they came with a smoked tomato sauce but I actually preferred them plain.

For dinner, I ordered the 1/2 lb Whiskey and Coke Beef Brisket - my eyes were WAY bigger than my belly, I should have gotten the 1/4 lb but gave what I couldn&#39;t eat to my friend. More importantly - it was AMAZING! The meat just fell apart and was juicy and tender. It was served with a dipping sauce and honestly, I ate almost all of it - whatever it was, it was delicious and paired with the brisket perfectly. My friend had the 1/2 lb chicken - the server recommended the Orange Thyme - and he picked it clean lol. So if you are a person who likes to eat or just a bigger guy like my friend, the 1/2 lb would be the way to go. Or go with someone like me who orders too much and then feeds it to you :)

The sides are al a carte and we got the large orders of Mushroom Risotto and the Wisconsin Cheddar Mac &amp; Cheese. While they actually looked kind of small, we were not able to finish them. The risotto was our favorite so I highly recommend but the mac &amp; cheese was also very good.

Of course we had to have dessert - the Sweet Butternut Flan was just incredible (and I don&#39;t even like flan!) but the Hazelnut Chocolate Tart was my favorite - it was basically a very thick and creamy chocolate brownie that was just to die for.

Overall, an amazing night! Our server was amazing, despite being very busy - we never went without and he checked on us regularly. The restaurant is just a cool space and everyone was very nice. I HIGHLY recommend (and already have to several friends) and cannot wait to return!!"

They do a special &#39;waiting&#39; drink that&#39;s only a few dollars, I thought that was a nice touch. The rest of their drink menu is kind of a &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; style, you pick the liquor, and what kind of drink mix, it&#39;s a cool concept. 

We had the 3 pepper appetizer which was a good combo of a few different style of peppers each prepared in a different way. The food is set up to be sharing style, which was good because then we got to try a variety of their meats, etc. The brisket and buffalo chicken were superb.

I remember it being a fun spot for my friend&#39;s birthday dinner I attended. But I don&#39;t remember it being so loud. It&#39;s a tiny place, and boy do they pack it in. Similar restaurants in the neighborhood are small but not as noisy. 

We wanted to order our food tapas style to share. My friend ordered the brussel sprouts, which were by far, my favorite thing on the menu. She also ordered the large of the mac and cheese, and the chicken wing.

I ordered the vegetarian empenadas. We also ordered three of the four desserts. We had the Apple Crisp, the bourbon pudding thing, and I am sad to say I forgot the 3rd item.

For our meals, I was shocked that the portion size was so small. Thankfully we had gotten drinks and apps at a different place prior to eating here but I would&#39;ve been disappointed if I was really hungry.

The desserts were really good. The 2 afore mentioned desserts were phenomenal.

The food is delicous. It&#39;s mainly large tapas-style dishes to share. We enjoyed verything we ordered. There is a good drink list and wine list as well.

Very trendy place in Denver.  We decided to wait over an hour for a table and went to the bar across the street.  The restaurant is really small (like the portions), so be prepared to wait and to be very comfortable with your neighbors. We didn&#39;t mind though!

The food is very tasty, but I just wish the portions were slightly larger.  Not sure if that is the gluttonous Texan in me taking.  Their portion recommendations are &#34;1/4 pound is for 1 person and 1/2 pound is for someone who can eat&#34;.  There were 4 of us and we all ordered a different meat: lamb, goat, chicken, and brisket.  The chicken was pretty much one wing.  The other meats were really tasty and cooked well.

We ordered 2 appetizers and had to he an extra of each since the meatballs only came with 3.  They were about $9 which I thought was crazy.  But again, they were good.

The sizes are delicious and are good to order to share. We got about 4 regular sizes and shared.

Definitely give work and class a visit if you&#39;re looking for a trendy spot on a night out, but expect to wait and to be served very teeny tiny portions."

The fries with green sauce-awesome! The sauce is so good.  Tried to eat as much sauce as possible.

Empanadas- good flavor.

Corn bread with jalepeno- mmmm... Just the right amount of spice. Good moisture and texture to the bread.

Greens- so good. Love the flavor.

The pulled pork- delicious! Made little tacos with it!

The restaurant itself has a great vibe, and it&#39;s a perfect place to go with a group of friends. It&#39;s trendy, but in a very sustainable way if that makes any sense. 

Amongst all of these great things, the food is by far the best part to this restaurant. Out of everything I&#39;ve tried so far (which has been a lot), my favorite has to be the lamb, it&#39;s incredible. I usually order the 1/2 lb. and eat it in its entirety.  

I&#39;ve also had their empanadas, meatballs, sweet plantains, french fries, mac &amp; cheese, brussels sprouts, wild mushroom risotto (to die for) and their chickpea croquettes, all of which were great.

The rest of the restaurant, patio, and bar filled up fast. We were later told that we came in at the perfect time because the night before they had a 3 hour wait. We soon learned why...

First the drinks. They have four house cocktails with which you can mix your choice of spirit. We chose the hibiscus grapefruit lemonade with vodka and the tart pomegranate cucumber with tequila. Both delicious and because it was happy hour, only $6 each. 

Second the food. We ordered two items off the happy hour menu: the chile relleno and green chile cheese fries. Admittedly hard to mess up, but definitely delicious and only $5 each. We also order two additional sides to share: the jalapeño cornbread ($3) and roasted Brussels sprouts with winter squash ($5). The cornbread was light and fluffy and the sprouts were seasoned really well. Lastly we were given an off menu dessert on the house...a layered citrus cream cake. It was something I probably never would have ordered myself, but was soooo good!

Appetizers:  NEW JERSEY ERNIE&#39;S MEATBALLS and PEPPERS FIVE WAYS.  
We all really enjoyed the meatballs and some of us were not too thrilled with the peppers.  My husband and dad gobbled them up and said they were amazing, but I think my mom and I were just not overwhelmed because we aren&#39;t big pepper fans.  

Main course:  COCHINITA PIBIL and WHISKEY AND COKE BRISKET
I could eat the brisket everyday and the pork every other day (variety is key!).  Both meat choices were juicy and flavorful.

My mom and I were the only ones to eat the brussel sprouts and winter squash.  We loved it and it was a nice vegetable to add to the already heavy carb sides.  We all fought over the mac and cheese and french fries because they were great.

Desserts:  BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING, PEAR-VANILLA BREAD PUDDING, HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE TART 
The desserts were ok.  We all decided the desserts were not the focus of the  night but the meats and sides took the show."

We did have to wait about 10 minutes for a spot but we were quoted 20 so we were pleasantly surprised when they came and grabbed us. We opted not to get drinks prior to sitting down as we wanted to sit outside but the drink specials did look quite fabulous.

The food - so yummy. We ordered the Brussel Sprouts, meatballs, jalapeño corn bread, the pork and the short ribs. We would get them ALL again! They were so delish! The jalapeño corn bread was killer and the short ribs were so tender they were falling apart. In addition, we also ordered the peanut butter banana dessert and it was divine. Not sure we loved the chocolate ice cream (may have been a little too much) but the rest was yummy. It was the perfect blend of sweet and peanut butter! Can&#39;t go wrong with that! 

The service was great. Our server was super on top of our drinks and kept a full water jar on our table. He gave us a couple great recommendations and followed up to make sure we were okay.

This place is definitely worth it and we will definitely be back! Can&#39;t wait for our next dinner here!"
work-and-class-denver,Alley V.,0C1RpNFf8eXBMV2MP9llkw,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,0,7,Np-SoPRYMLkulTbuPeCoqA,4.0,2015-11-05,"Oh man, every single thing was delicious! Went in a group of four and sampled roughly half the menu! Here&#39;s the breakdown;

-Blue Corn Empanadas - The individual empanadas are larger than I expected, but there are only 2 in an order which I thought was a little silly. However they were delicious - the tomato sauce has a nice kick to it as well. 

-Cochinita Pibil (Pork) - This stuff packs a TON of flavor! Even without the sort of slaw that comes with it, the flavor was full and enough all on it&#39;s own. But adding the slaw doesn&#39;t deter from that at all, it&#39;s a perfect compliment to the meat. 

-Roasted Goat - Hands down the table favorite. I had never had goat done like this before and everyone was very pleased and pleasantly surprised. (We did order the tortillas to wrap this stuff up in, but honestly everything was so delicious I didn&#39;t use any tortillas!) I have no idea what the sauce on the side was, but it seemed completely unnecessary. I couldn&#39;t tell any difference when I included the sauce from the goat by itself. 

-Lamb - In general lamb is not my favorite thing, but I really WANT to love it so I keep trying it! It came out perfectly seared in nicely sliced bite-size portions. The slight char added a wonderful flavor - but overall I wasn&#39;t all that impressed. However my friends who are much bigger fans of lamb to begin with thought it was delicious. 

-Wild Mushroom Risotto - Not a mushroom fan, but still wanted to try everything we ordered. I was pleased with the texture - so many places overdo risotto and it ends up a gelatinous blob on your plate. Not the case here! I probably would not order this again, just because it&#39;s mushroom, but if they offered another risotto I&#39;d be all over it. 

-Wisconsin Mac &amp; Cheese - Totally worth it! The small order (single skillet) is a good tasting portion for two, so it&#39;s a good thing we ordered large! The creamy cheese sauce had an incredible flavor without being overly thick, like some cheesy pastas can be. 

-Fried Sweet Plantains- YES! I&#39;ve been waiting to find well done plantains in CO for YEARS. These are a little unusual in the fact that they&#39;re rolled in some kind of chili powder (ancho maybe?). Sad to say I am a baby about spicy food, but this was just the right amount of kick- especially with the aioli that comes with. I would come back here for the plantains alone!

-Green Chile Cheddar Biscuit - Not your average biscuit, that&#39;s for sure. It&#39;s not the light and fluffy thing we&#39;re all so familiar with, but I think that made it all the more appetizing. Slightly crunchy outside, but still soft and warm inside. Next time I will probably do without it just because it didn&#39;t necessarily enhance the dining experience in any way- but they are yummy. 

-Butterscotch Pudding - Surprising flavor from something you don&#39;t expect to be surprised by. The pudding has almost a tartness to it that non of us were expecting... some were more pleased than others. I guess I prefer the traditional, sweeter style. But a few at the table really loved it and cleaned the jars!

The cocktails seem intriguing and exciting, but we only tried a few. The Tart Pomegranate-Cucumber whiskey was something I was wary to try, but glad I did. Very light and refreshing, but not something I could drink more than one of in a sitting. The Old Fashioned was a little funny.... someone really took out their anger on the cherry in my glass! Also (and I feel snobby even saying it, but I think it needs to be pointed out) the Old Fashioned came with chipped ice cubes..... so I couldn&#39;t take a sip without getting a chunk of ice that I had to chew on. Not only do I not want to be chewing on ice, I feel like it really watered down the drink after a few minutes (this may, in part, be due to the fact that we were sitting under a GIANT heater and those ice cubes never stood a chance). Probably wont be ordering that again, which is unfortunate. 

The food was all fantastic - not a single bit went uneaten! The service was also wonderful, our server was very friendly and personable, gave recommendations that were well received, and we never sat without a drink or water refills the entire time. And it was really impressive how quickly the food came out when they were so busy. 

This is a new favorite and I cannot wait to go back and try the other half of the menu!"

1. Food is so so, everything was missing something. And the pig in a blanket dish thats all over there yelp account is something they dont do anymore. We had 1 of everything and nothing was great, the best thing was the jalapeno corn bread.
2. This reataurant is super freaking loud!!! If your looking to go for a date then this is not the place, nor is it somewhere to bring your family.
3. The service was mediocre. Sorry to my server whos name I will not say but you really need to be more involved with the customer. He would stop by once in a while to ask how the food was and He&#39;d say great and walk away. I just felt like another number and for me I like to feel that im eating at home and this was not the case here.
4. Do not reccomend this place and there are much better restaurants in denver. Such as Fruitition, Acorn, Rioja, even Jing or Rebel are better in my opinion. But to each is own. Hope this review helps you and good luck finding somewhere to eat in Denver!"

Adrift was one of the few places serving food at 10pm on our drive home, and a tiki drink sounded good, so we stopped in. 

The place had only a few other tables and two people at the bar, though it didn&#39;t deter us as I&#39;d been in before the management change. Our waiter was attentive and friendly, and gave us a moment to peruse the menu. 

The atmosphere and décor here is wonderful - it has the typical tiki elements that are vintage / kitsch (like the tiki statues and blowfish lanterns) but it also manages to feel luxe and inviting. The lighting and vintage booths are reminiscent of my favourite scenes in Wong Kar Wai&#39;s &#39;In the Mood for Love&#39;. This place makes me feel like I&#39;ve traveled in time to a stylish bar in the sixties. 

We ordered a Singapore Sling ($12), a Zombie ($12), and the pupu platter ($20). The drinks were strong but had good flavour and were enjoyable. I&#39;m not a big drinker these days, so one was enough to give me a pleasant buzz. 

The pupu platter was well-presented and each thing on it delicious - nothing tasted the same, which is good! My favourite was surprisingly the edamame (which were dusted with what I think was Chinese five spice, spicy mayonnaise, and crunchy tenkasu or something like it) - I wish they offered this as one of their small plates. I also thought the chicken wings were great (the sauce is excellent), and the ribs were flavourful. 

My only complaint about Adrift (and the reason for the missing star) is not the food, service, or atmosphere (which is lovely - dark and almost transporting, which is fantastic for a cold Denver day) but the music. 

The music was incredibly loud funk music, which is kind of cool - but didn&#39;t match the atmosphere, which was more intimate and date-sceney, for lack of a better description. I could barely hear my husband who was inches away from me in the booth. I don&#39;t mean to say that they should be playing ukelele music or Don Ho&#39;s &#39;Tiny Bubbles&#39; or anything suitably cheesy, but given the lounge feel of the place, having the music a touch quieter for conversation, and maybe a little more low-tempo, would make this a place I&#39;d want to return to again and again."

They&#39;ve removed the front patio, increased the prices of all their drinks, and knocked the menu down to a bunch of generic small plates that are overpriced, and a couple of burgers. They say they&#39;re going with a more &#34;authentic&#34; Trader Vic&#39;s type experience and have eliminated a bunch of their older cocktails. Our server kept telling us how much more booze there was in their new cocktails, but on a Tuesday evening, that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m there for. I&#39;d try it again as a stop on a happy hour on a Friday or Saturday evening, but it&#39;s not really a great place for dinner. 

On the plus side, the staff was definitely attentive and the revamped interior really looks top notch."

The place just re-opened a month ago with cleaner decor, wonderful &#34;true to time&#34; 50&#39;s drinks and a perfect menu to compliment the theme. If you love Poke - you MUST try Adrift&#39;s! It comes out in a beautiful dry ice steam bath display. When you get to the actual fish - it melts in your mouth! We just returned from L.A. and this was better than any Poke on the coast. 

Have you tried infused Rum? Their pineapple infused rum was so smooth and delicious. I don&#39;t even like rum and it was like dessert to me!

Atmosphere and staff - A+++

Recently refurbished and now I&#39;ve learnt that they have new owners, this place looks awesome. We got sat down at a very comfy booth in the back and our server was right up with water and taking our drinks order. Personally I am not into fancy foo foo drinks but they had a decent selection of beers on tap, bottles and cans. We never got around to ordering food but the menu looked decent enough with quite a few things I will have to go back and try. Oh and the glasses were very cool."

Came in around 8pm...would have been a little sooner but parking was a challenge.  It was a little slow when we first walked in so we were quickly greeted and seated.  Very friendly service from start to finish;  as the night progressed, they steadily got busier.  Our server was very attentive without being overbearing.

Ordered a couple of Mai Tai&#39;s and a Hurricane.  Nice blend of flavors and good amount of liquor in each.  Also ordered the Pu Pu platter which was very good;  the edamame and ribs were the highlight for me.  The wings were a little dry, and the pork slider was decent; bottom of the Hawaiian roll was a little soggy while the pork was tender but a little bland.

Overall, nice atmosphere / ambiance, music level just loud enough to keep the place upbeat but allow you to have a conversation without screaming. Looking forward to visiting again."

Adrift had JUST reopened from a remodel.  I&#39;m not hip to the reason(s) as to why they closed and remodeled, but they have obviously done so.  Came in, were seated promptly.

Server was nice.  He was upbeat, helpful, quick, and smiled the whole time.

We ordered the short ribs, which were a nice little snack.  Good flavor.

The drinks were so-so.  SUPER sugary, overly so.  Mine, my girlfriend&#39;s, my sister&#39;s, and my brother-in-law all had cloyingly sweet drinks.

Drinks were pretty weak too.  Yeah yeah yeah, I know it is only one drink, but I felt nothing.  No one else seemed to think there was much alcohol in them either.

Yes, I know the general ambiance of the place is to have tropical drinks.  They were just so-so.  I felt as if I had paid $70 for 4 juices and some ribs.  Not my jam.

In the end, It was okay.  We were only in for a half hour tops, and were all itching to leave and find the next spot.

I think they should have waited a day or two to reopen, as the lingering smell of paint and lacquer was overwhelming.

TL;DR: meh."

Food is amazing. The guava ribs are really delicious. My boyfriend got the Jaws burger, which is his favorite item on the menu now. I&#39;d tried the spam burger before and that was more my jam. This time however, I wanted something lighter and went for the green papaya salad, which was mainly jimaca. That&#39;s not a bad thing, though, it was really delicious with the herbs in it, and the chicken I got on top was AMAZING.

We also shared the small scorpion bowl, which was beautifully presented. It was tasty with the circus juices, but beware: all their drinks are STRONG. Like, I have no idea what other reviews are talking about with weak drinks at all. Every drink I&#39;ve gotten (about half the drink menu between my boyfriend and I) is very strong. If you want something a little more sweet and refreshing, DEFINITELY go for the macadamia chi chi. Super tasty. Everything was super tasty!! Good job with the revamp!"

My God kimchi on a cheeseburger was a good idea. I had the banzai pipeline and my buddy had the burger with spam (I forget what it&#39;s called) both were amazing (but definitely go banzai).

For the drink I went with a Singapore sling, it&#39;s like a cherry lime gin drink and despite not being able to taste it, it had a crazy amount of gin and definitely got me feeling a type of way.. 

On top of everything, for a Saturday night, service was excellent. I had Ophelia and she was extremely kind and helpful the whole night.

We were told the drinks were boozier but honestly, my friend got a Coconga and it was a rip off, maybe two ounces of a frozen coconut beverage with coconut shavings in it for $13. It was seriously so small. I used to get the Jet Pilot, I remembered having to drink it super slowly because of how strong it was. It was recommended that I get the Dr.Funk which was served in a cute pineapple, but it wasn&#39;t very strong. 

I miss the other drinks and the prices of the other drinks at $8, 10, 12... the strength of the drink seemed to go up with each $2. That helped you choose. Now the pricing is arbitrary, over-priced for whatever they assume is a new Denver filled with fools. My last birthday was celebrated here last March and it was the best. The food was great.

I&#39;ve experienced tiki bars all over the country from Honolulu (La Mariana) to NYC (Otto&#39;s Shrunken Head), from Los Angeles (Tiki Ti) to New Orleans (Beachbum Berry&#39;s Latitude 29 and Tiki Tolteca), from Chicago (Three Dots and a Dash) to San Francisco (Smuggler&#39;s Cove and The Tonga Room) and even to Great Falls, Montana (The Sip &#39;n Dip) and this Denver tiki joint just kinda missed the mark for me.

First of all, the drinks just weren&#39;t very enjoyable at all.  Tiki drinks are meant to taste good and be enjoyed, not to be mixed so unevenly (strong) that you can&#39;t even appreciate them.  The presentation was weak (see Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago if you want to experience how a tiki drink should be made), the bartender was boring, the drinks weren&#39;t served in tiki glasses (whatever, but if you&#39;re gonna go with the whole tiki schtick, why hold back on the glasses?) and, bottom line, the drinks just weren&#39;t very good.   

It seems like the owner enjoys tiki bars so decided to open one up, did his research (noted all of the origins in the menu dating back to Don&#39;s, Trader Vic&#39;s, etc), decorated it to pay homage to some of the better ones out there (the blowfish lighting a la La Mariana, tiki glasses on display from other locales, etc) but neglected to focus on the most important aspect:  the drinks.  

Maybe it stands out for Denver, but in comparison to what else is out there this place doesn&#39;t measure up."

How you continue to leave me confused about what to truly think of you.  I&#39;d like to  start off by saying, I&#39;m not entirely sure why the remodel took as long as it did.  Besides taking out the front patio and the flatscreen in the front of the bar that played Gilligan&#39;s Island reruns, I can&#39;t say I noticed any real decor changes.  The service was a bit shabby prior to the reopening(bartenders excluded....they were awesome), but there was a charm to the place that I truly enjoyed.  I also loved the Chi Chis.  Food wasn&#39;t that bad either.  

Post-reopening impressions:

Pros:

-the food is fantastic, especially the Jaws burger.  I love some Loco Moco.
-the Chi Chi is still very tasty
-the service overall seems to have improved

Cons:

-not much charm anymore, just another LoHi bar set on South Broadway
-drinks have seen a hefty price increase(especially the scorpion bowls), while decreasing in size
-they STILL have a serious issue with giving out pineapple for the drinks.  I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so difficult considering you can get a pineapple at King Soopers for $1.  No, I don&#39;t want any hibiscus flowers in my drinks!!!!

Overall,  I liked the old Adrift better, honestly.  I think the &#34;new&#34; Adrift will do well, but it&#39;s not as charming as it used to be and I feel you don&#39;t get much bang for your buck as you used to.

Go out drinking

Where do you go to feel like you&#39;re on a tropical vacation?

Adrift 

What do you order?

Planter&#39;s Punch for two with extra long straws

Is it the healthiest way to to deal with the wintertime blues? Probably not, but Adrift does make me feel like I&#39;ve been whisked away on vacay, even for an hour or two. The bathrooms have an extra vent in the bathroom that blasts hot air. It feels so good when you&#39;ve been chilled to the bone.

If you&#39;re going to have a rum drink (and yes, you should), get some ahi tuna poke or a pupu platter to line your belly with some sustenance. And if you arrive before 6 pm, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll score a booth in the main dining room. It&#39;s far away from the real Hawaiian islands or Tahiti, but it&#39;s a helluva lot better than sitting outside in the slushy snow."

We&#39;d visited Adrift before the management change and loved it. We were really disappointed that our favorite drinks and food was missing from the new menu. The new pupu platter replaced the satay skewers, calamari, plantains, and egg rolls with sliders, ribs, and onion rings. My partner ordered a Mai Tai and I ordered a hurricane. Despite it being clearly noted on the menu, I got a schooling on how strong the hurricane was. As a native to New Orleans and an avid reader since preschool, I was annoyed and declined. The waiter then decided to school me in all the other drinks on the menu, claiming they were the original recipes from the original Tiki Bars from the 50s. Unfortunately, Tiki Bars originated in the 30s, not the 50s. He then asked, what do you usually order at a bar? I replied, &#34;hurricanes.&#34; He started my schooling again. I stuck with water. 
My partner said the Mai Tai was good, and we did try the onion ring appetizer. Unless you wanted a burger, there was nothing else to eat. It was so awful, it was the first time in my 36 years on this earth that I ever spit food into my napkin. The onion was undercooked, the breading was thick and soggy. They layered the three slices of onion with cucumber and rancid strips of papaya. I had to wipe my tongue, and I couldn&#39;t wait to leave. The music was an odd mismatch of surf rock and we heard the same song twice in 30min.
The old adrift was fun. We&#39;re never going back to this nonsense."

It was hands-down the most customer centric restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to. They have a variety of interesting drinks on the menu, but three of us were not too interested in the choices. They made all 3 of us custom drinks, including a coconut margarita for my husband that was amazing. Then, after dessert, my friend asked for coffee, but they don&#39;t serve coffee. Our waitress actually went to a coffee shop nearby to get coffee!   

Oh, and the food was incredible too! We ordered the Pu Pu platter and the chicken and pork Hawaiian Mix plates. For dessert, we had both the pineapple upside down cake and the tapioca. All were delicious. We all preferred the tapioca over the cake. But both were creative and delicious."

A tiki bar 1500 miles from the ocean-- I mean, sure, why not? They stick to the theme pretty well and have a variety of tasty tropical drinks, including the macadamia nut chichi.

I am way more of a beer drinker than a cocktail person, but I occasionally make three exceptions: LITs, Moscow Mules, and the Macadamia Nut Chi Chi from Adrift. It&#39;s as frilly as you get, but fuck it: you ARE at a tiki bar, after all. The downside is the price- $10 (!) outside of happy hour. If you can make it here during HH, it&#39;s only $6 which significantly softens the blow. In fact, happy hour is really the only good time to come here, because all of the cocktails are pretty pricey outside of it. The draft beer selection, while limited, is $5 and probably one of the cheaper choices outside of Happy Hour. Also, it drops down to $3 during HH, so if tiki drinks aren&#39;t your thing, you&#39;ve still got options. 

The food is okay, but not anything I would travel out of my way for. The prices on the food side are also a bit steep-- $8 for 4 chicken wings, $4 for a slider, etc.  The sliders are actually quite tasty, but not a lot of food for the price. The most disappointing menu item I&#39;ve tried were the doughnuts, which they advertise as being filled with lavender cream cheese. I barely tasted cream cheese, certainly didn&#39;t taste lavender, and they were really doughy. I would avoid those, especially for $7. I believe they have a couple snacks on HH pricing, though I&#39;m not sure what. 

I have been here a handful of times and while service is always friendly, it&#39;s also slow. Sloooooow. 

Overall: fun theme, tasty tiki drinks, okay food, slow service. Come during happy hour!"

It&#39;s a little kitschy for my taste and I don&#39;t really want a piña colada unless I&#39;m on a beach. The shirts that the servers and bartenders have to wear are... a lot. In fact, the entire vibe that they&#39;re going for is cool, I guess, just... a lot. 

However, the ramen I ordered astounded and amazed me. They aren&#39;t even a ramen joint! But I loved it enough that it makes me think I&#39;m going to crave it randomly someday and I&#39;ll tolerate the barrage of tiki lights and Hawaiian shirts just so I can get me some more of THAT.

Our server, Nolan, was polite, attentive, and efficient. All in all, the only thing that blew me out of the water was the ramen, but the drinks were fine enough and the service was delightfully unobtrusive. I&#39;ll likely be back because my girlfriends need their regular dose of &#34;chi chi.&#34;"

I understand why. The place was filed with senior citizens and children. The 30 dollar drink I paid for had no alcohol in it and the server told me they are trying to get rid of the old image of Adrift. I loved Adrift and now it&#39;s ruined. You guys messed up. Actually you didn&#39;t mess up, you took your stupid model from your stupid ice cream shop and brought it to one of the best dives on south Broadway. I hope you fail.

I would say I would go there at least once a month for several years. I kept coming back because the quality of the drinks was usually so good, and the novelty of the tiki theme was a great escape. However, in the last year or two, I really saw a noticeable decline in the quality of the food/drinks, and especially in the quality of service. Every time I went the place was almost always empty, and I was scared it would inevitably close. That is why I was so optimistic when Adrift came under new ownership, because I hoped that it would reinvigorate the place. I&#39;m pleased to say that it truly has!

The quality of service in particular is leaps and bounds better- I&#39;m finally greeted with a hello when I walk in the door (an uncommon occurrence before)! The food is so much better- it&#39;s finally a place I want to go have dinner rather than just drinks. The tiki vibe is better too- the old Adrift didn&#39;t even serve any drinks in kitschy tiki glasses, but now they do!

Reading through recent reviews, it&#39;s clear that the &#34;old crowd&#34; of hipsters and deadbeats that only came to Adrift for their $2 PBRs are upset that this place has gotten an upgrade. Dive bars come and go, and there are plenty of other choices on South Broadway for that. It&#39;s nice that Adrift is bucking that mold and serving as a place to come as a destination- I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary!"

I figured the venue would feel plastic and cheap, not unlike the vibe you get when you&#39;re looking at a fake pink flamingo.  

My girlfriend suggested that we stop by Adrift for a fruity beverage.  And due to the enthusiasm in her voice, I nodded my head.  Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised to the see a well thought out venue...dark woods punctuated with pineapple whites, accented with tropical flowers.  It gives off a classy 60&#39;s vibe.   

Service was lacking.  It took a while to be noticed at the bar, and once we were noticed, the short-haired female behind the bar did not return our smile.  She said they had several new people, hence the wait. 

This review is teetering somewhere between a three and four star review.  Adrift, if you are not already, consider hiring staff whose personalities are consistent with your theme and venue.  Due to everything else that was fab, this review is holding four stars."

The large table near the bar is inexplicably in the middle of the walkway for servers,  which meant we were in their way or getting shoved over by them all evening. They also refuse to split checks,  so getting out of there as fast as they seemed to want to be rid of us was a huge hassle. Menu could use more detail so people can more easily tell what they&#39;re getting and don&#39;t have to ask a million questions.

I am honestly not down in the Alameda area of Denver often, but this place was charming enough to warrant the walk.  My partner and I were trying out a bar/restaurant hopping map that was planned along the light rail route to explore different parts of the city. Adrift was definitely a memorable stop and was perfect because their menu is mostly Tapas (which was actually quite filling.)

The Grand.
- The atmosphere is the highest selling point. You&#39;re transported back in time to the 50&#39;s when Elvis was in his prime. It&#39;s Hawaiian American themed with dead blowfish as lighting; so, odd &amp; cool at the same time.
- Even though it&#39;s themed, it&#39;s not pretentious. I also had a sort of neighborhood/divey feel.
- The staff was pretty friendly and accommodating for such a busy night too - so bonus kudos for the added positive energy. We went @ 8pm on a Saturday and squeezed in at the bar.
- I recommend the sliders with the tasty pineapple chutney-type sauce.
- The high-energy buzz, retro movie on the wall, and cozy (tight?) bar seating make for an interesting date night experience that I enjoyed.
- I honestly have what their description calls a &#34;rum-centric&#34; drinking preference, so I was pleased with their fruity, eclectic hawaiian alcohol selection.

The Critiques.
- It&#39;s not comfortable enough to be one of my regular &#34;go-to&#34; dinner spots, it&#39;s more of a themed/experiential dining atmosphere for chatting and drinking.

It is likely that I will recommend Adrift to friends and return with a fun group who wants to enjoy the cocktails. I look forward to trying their ahi or ramen! Although, I&#39;ll probably go somewhere quieter for date night in the future."

The decor is spot on-it&#39;s kitchy without being even the least bit tacky, which is a fine line to walk and especially in a Tiki Bar (or any themed bar, for that matter). One of the table lamps had a shade that said &#34;Walt Disney was here.&#34; and if he weren&#39;t long departed, rest his soul, I would believe he had a hand in the design. 

Of course I had to order a Macadamia Nut Chi Chi after finding out that all the juices are hand squeezed in house. Could taste both the love that went into the beverage as well as the fresh pineapple and more subtle macadamia nut flavor.

The real winner at Adrift is the food. There is literally something for everyone (even my more particular vegan counterpart) and the food was pleasantly healthful for a neighborhood watering hole. At the same time, it is also delicious. I had the steak (the side of Brussels sprouts was a highlight, and I&#39;m not usually a big fan) and nibbled on some edamame (wow-spicy but great) and some fries (they were a dream).

I&#39;d up the ante to 5 stars, but our service was so-so. To be fair, it was during a packed happy hour, but we did have to wave our server down several times and the to go order I&#39;d asked to be held came out right away.

The interior is pretty nice, but maybe because of all the bamboo on the walls it is LOUD! We were almost shouting at each other, and we were right next to each other! We went for the fixed price pig roast, so the included drinks MAY have been different. I sure hope so, cuz these were NOT great! Not even sure I&#39;d call them &#34;good&#34;. Weak, watery, flavor was zilch, FEW choices. The pig was FAIR, and the sides were nothing special, and they weren&#39;t really &#34;pig roast&#34; sides. No Mac Salad, just a cole slaw (probably the best thing all night), potato salad (eh, Costco) and a few weird quinoa salads. The pork was pretty good, but they kinda pushed the sides so you&#39;d fill up on them.

Bottom line, the 60 bucks was WAY too high for what ya got. Might go back, probably won&#39;t..."

Adrift definitely brought it with the interior tiki  theme decoration. The restaurant felt hidden because of the entrance within an entrance. It gave you the impression of escaping to a tropical hidden cave. 

Inside there&#39;s dried puffer fish hanging from the ceilings as lights. Sounds grotesque and maybe it was a little but it&#39;s pretty neat at the same time. There&#39;s a giant wall where the bar is at where the alcohol is nicely displayed up to the ceiling under a thatched bamboo overhang. The opposing wall has a tropical painting landscape. 

The special they had for the day I came was $2 tacos. They had carnitas, fish and spam tacos with a chipotle sauce. I tried the carnitas and the fish. The amount of fish was slim but it was very tasty. The tortilla itself was slightly dry. But given the price of the taco I thought it was a great value. 

Happy hour menu included edamame, wontons (which my friend tried and said the dipping sauce was too sweet) cocktails (I tried the macadamia nut cocktail which tasted too much of artificial coconut) among other things. 

I shared a $44 punch bowl with friends that had pineapple, lime, and lemon wedges aflamed with barcardi rum and sparkling wine. The entire fish bowl was filled almost to the brim with shaved ice and them the liquid was poured in. It is much less drink than it appears to be unless you count melted ice as part of the cocktail. The drink itself was pretty good and tasted mostly of the sparking wine. It&#39;s definitely a fun drink to share and take pictures of. 

I tried the mango sticky rice (it is 1 of my favorite desserts in the entire world) and enjoyed the mango but found the rice to be harder in some areas that the other. The coconut milk seemed to sit on the race rather than be soaked into it. It was still good but not the best that I&#39;ve had.

Our waitress was awesome and funny and even threw in April fools jokes on us (she told us she was charging us for water). The hostess was kind enough to take several photos for us and was quite polite throughout the night. The woman who took care of our bill was nice enough to accept 7 credit cards and 1 cash payment for the one bill. So customer service was definitely great.  

This was a great way to hold me over from my craving to go to a tiki bar in SF that has been on my long bookmarks list of to tries."

Their retro-tiki lounge decor is really well done and not half-assed in the slightest. The lighting is dim, the music is fitting, the walls are lined with bamboo chutes, and most cocktails has a flower or an umbrella in them. When you walk in you&#39;re transformed to the 1960s on an island in Polynesia.

I&#39;ve been a few times, once in a big group, another time in a smaller group. The place is fairly small and seems a bit crowded. They do have a lot to larger booths that are good for groups as well as smaller tables. I&#39;ve ordered small plates and shared them with the group. Everything I tried was great!

My favorite drink is a massive punch bowl that is delivered to you on fire. They bring you as many foot-long straws as you need (and you need a bunch, because this is a strong cocktail meant to share). Their cocktails are fancy, boozy, and tasty, and are priced to match.

It gets pretty crowded on weekend nights, so plan ahead."

Probably the only tiki bar in Denver. When we first stepped in the place, they were playing like Cuban/Hispanic music which was off putting and confusing--not the island feels of Common Kings, JBoog, or those sorts you&#39;d expect to hear in a tiki themed bar. (According to our waitress, the owner controls the music and plays whatever he/she feels like. Guess he/she not in the mood for the island feels. Weird since it&#39;s a tiki bar.)
Other than the music not matching the tiki theme, the service was good and the food. We both got the spam-mi, which is the Vietnamese banh mi, but with the Hawaiian twist of spam. A little salty, but I&#39;ll contribute it to the spam. It had the right amount of spice. 
Also, they were playing like rocky horror show type of movie. Again, not aligned with the tiki theme but the waiter changed it to some 70s surfer DVD, upon request, which was legit.
All in all, slightly disappointed since we wanted to hear somee reggae; hence, the 2 stars. It would be pretty awesome to have a bar that played island music. Maybe try this place again on a different day to see if the play the right music to go with the theme."

What a disappointment. The service was painfully slow. Do not come here if you are hungry or thirsty. Our group of 4 all ordered drinks with appetizers and entrees. Our food came out (about 25 minutes later) and we then inquired about our appetizers. Mind you, this was the first time we saw our waitress since we ordered. She said the usual &#34;Oh, I must have left it in the back, I ordered it at the same time&#34; spiel. Needless to say our apps took another 10 minutes because you know homegirl never ordered them to begin with because SHE DIDN&#39;T WRITE ANY OF IT DOWN.

Now I might be willing to forgive some of this if it were busy. It was not, there were only two other tables in the entire restaurant. When we first got there we asked the bartender if need to wait to be seated, he told us &#34;Just sit wherever, you&#39;re better off ordering food from the waitress because I&#39;m busy making drinks&#34; Dude, its a restaurant, you should be skilled in both making a damn drink and putting in a food order. Again, if it were busy....but it wasn&#39;t.

Oh, also they don&#39;t serve any of their drinks in actual tiki mugs (?). Wtf is that? Isn&#39;t the whole point of the tiki lounge to get a drink in a cool looking glass with plastic monkeys and umbrellas in it?

Feels like a bar straight out of the 50&#39;s. The most authentic tiki experience I&#39;ve ever tried out. Happy hour is definitely the time to step in as several of their cocktails are half off.  

The drinks were mixed well. I had the Mai thai and my friend had the macadamia nut chi chi. Both drinks weren&#39;t overly sugary which you would normally expect with these kinds of cocktail and my friend and I were both thankful for that. And at half off these drinks hit the spot.

We also had a few appetizers: first the tortilla chips and guac. Guac was delicious and clearly made fresh, the chips were like fried tortillas and they were great but there weren&#39;t enough of them, give us a few more chips guys! Next the edamame, they add a great spice to them and the waitress was kind enough to give us the name, of course as I&#39;m writing the review for it I don&#39;t remember. We also ordered the calamari, of everything I tried that was the one I would not recommend. The crispy outside was good but the calamari itself was a bit rubbery in texture.   

Lastly I tried their Jamaican jerk cheeseburger which has a special sauce, bacon and onion rings on top is on special on Thursday for $10 and includes a red stripe beer. This was so good and is probably the thing that I tried that makes me want to return again.  And it came with fries that had the same seasoning as on the edamame and was absolutely delicious. Also, the fries had a good aioli sauce on the side that made the fries even better. I left feeling stuffed. 

Service was also good, our server was friendly and accommodating."

The sliders were good; I think it&#39;s a little weird they come with tater tots...I would think breakfast potatoes would be more fitting at brunch. Also the tots were lukewarm when they arrived. During our meal someone came by and gave us one of their homemade pancakes, on the house. That was really tasty. The service (both our waitress and the kitchen) was fairly slow despite the fact there were only 2-3 tables the entire time. But I&#39;ve had worse.

It&#39;s pretty easy to be happy in this place as it&#39;s as if you have been transported to the set of Elvis&#39;s Blue Hawaii. In fact, they have an ongoing screening of the film that pairs perfectly with the over-the-top, cheeky Hawaiian decor and menu.

Though, I haven&#39;t tried the food, the service is so fun and flirty only to be coupled with the fun and flirty drinks and punch. Like, the Planter&#39;s Punch that easily gets 8 grown women tipsy for a cool $44. Don&#39;t be turned off by the price as it&#39;s incredibly economical considering the amount of booze you get when you still split the bill amongst your party. We all ended up paying $8 each for what felt like the equivalent for 2-3 strong cocktails each. Not that alcohol is the most important, because this drink is an experience in and of itself.

It has a good happy hour menu for food and drinks and also a few other items you can have for dinner.  I tried the poke tuna and the plantain chips were the perfect level of crispiness.

My altered state of inebriation didn&#39;t inhibit my abilities to take in the excellence of Adrift. The bar resembles the tackiest/coolest looking 50s/60s style Tikibar and they&#39;ve left no stone unturned to ensure it looks spot on. To match the wicked interior they also have rockstar staff that whose amazing pin-up model looks are only exceeded by their superior customer service friendliness.

The bar was a touch busy when we arrived but the staff made accomodations for us on the patio outside. Yes it was October in Denver and cold, but they sparked the gas fireplace to keep us warm while we partied all on our own!

If memory serves I ordered a potent punch bowl for my group (which was about $50 tax and tip in) to share and adding that devious concoction (albeit delicious) to the mix already in my system ensured I would pass the point of no return and rapidly fall asleep once I got home!

Great times and a great spot to hangout when in Denver!"

It wasn&#39;t too loud and you felt like you could have a conversation. Loved the Macadamia Nut Ch Chi drink!! Get there before 7pm on weekdays and get happy hour prices! We went at 6:30pm on a Thurs night .The guac and chips were awesome. I don&#39;t know what they put in the guac but it was one of the best I have ever had. I had the Angus beef sliders for dinner and got onion rings as a side...again...delicious. It is also located on a main strip where there are quite a few other bars in the area you can walk to so that makes it nice if you want to go out afterwards. I only wish that they would take reservations for smaller groups. They do if your party is 10+ but if you are a group of 6 then out of luck. Other than that...great place

My husband and I recently came here for a special dinner, not really knowing what to expect. What a pleasant surprise. The houses are adorable, with amazing tropical foliage lining the sidewalk. Inside, the ambiance is downright sultry, with a certain air of authenticity that&#39;s often attempted but rarely achieved. The bar and patio were lively and charming. Not a &#34;scene,&#34; just fun.
There was a little hiccup with the host service, but all was forgotten as soon as we took our seats and ordered our fantastic drinks--a coconut mojito and a caipirinha (truly one of the best ever). We split a bunch of appetizers and the Vaca Frita. Everything was excellent, but the star of the evening was definitely the Mariquitas Cubana. That garlic mojo is just so effing delicious. Oh, the empanadas (picadillo and hongo) were a great discovery, probably the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. 
We capped off the meal with cafecitos (yum), but I could have lingered there for hours, it was just so warm and homey. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try more."

But really.  After a bit of a nature walk at the reservoir, we headed back to Denver with our sites on cocktail hour.  Cue Cuba Cuba!  They were supposed to have some pretty amazing Mojitos and happy hour specials.  

The place is super cute, a set of two colorful houses on an otherwise dull street.  The atmosphere was cozy, casual, and had some great music (I was dancing in my seat toward the end of my drank).  My friend opted for a ...berry? Mojito (it&#39;s all a blur now) and I excitedly ordered a Caipirinha.  The drinks were on point, and poured well.  The bartender (I didn&#39;t get his name) was an absolute delight and made sure we were taken care of. After coercing my friend, we got an order of the Mojo and plantains.  Their Mojo sauce....mmmmm.  We reeked of garlic for a full two days - but it was SO worth it.  

When it was time for the check I wanted to tip the bartender an excessive amount.  Hands down the best place I&#39;ve been to in a while for cocktail hour.  Go here.  Dance in yo&#39; seat with a drank in yo&#39; hand."

We arrived half an hour before happy hour was over, and ordered the red sangria, pineapple mojito, ginger mojito and the tecate, all for half price! The mojito and the sangria were absolutely amazing.

We ordered the Shrimp Ceviche, Paella and the Pan con Bistec. Now, I make shrimp ceviche often at home, so I was a little skeptical at first (We originally wanted the Tuna Tiradito, but they stopped serving this). The ceviche was served on top of flattened crispy plantains, and absolutely wonderful. Definitely brought a twist to the ceviche I&#39;m used to making! (Side note: I abhor bananas, but these plantains were so good that I ate every last crumb!!). 

The Paella portions were massive (I still cleared every last grain of it, it was delicious!), and full of chicken, chorizo, calamari, shrimp and mussel. The Pan con Bistec was really really good too (my boyfriend and I don&#39;t actually like sandwiches, but we make exceptions if they&#39;re not american sandwiches/subs). In fact, the last time we were here we ordered the Sandwich Cubano, and it was such a tasty dish that we wanted to try another sandwich at Cuba Cuba! Mojo fries, like my last review, was amazing. They&#39;re so addictive!

I honestly wished this meal wouldn&#39;t end, and we finished every last bite of our dishes. I know that without a doubt, when I visit Denver again, this will be the first place I go!"

They had told us that the last time they came that it was a huge wait, but now there&#39;s more seating out the back. We could have sat on the grass out the front but we wanted a drink so we went through and found a spot in the corner out the back area.  

The ambiance is amazing. The back area is gorgeous with the high wood ceiling and all the cool drop down lights. We sat on little stools and drank Mojito&#39;s while we waited for our table. The service was great. Odd that we had to close out the bill from the bar before being seated but whatever.

I had the paella and it was delicious! Everyone else had stuff that looked and they all said tasted amazing. Can&#39;t tell you what it is but the guys had chicken and my friend had shrimp. Afterwards the men had coffee and I had a little key lime tart. It was a touch too sweet but didn&#39;t eat half of the meringue on top.

Delicious.  For apps we got fried plantains with sauces for dipping (garlic was my fav) and empanadas... So delicious!  

My dinner was great- I had the Cuban salad with tostones and a side of black beans... All delicious... But I was so full from apps I barely got to eat any!

Just as it is from the outside, the inside is very inviting and warm. We passed by the bar where the smell of mojitos nearly sucked us back in but we managed to follow the hostess to the dining room, which was mostly full of tables engaged in conversation.

Coming from the gym, we opted out of any drinks but water. It was the food we were curious about. We had the mushroom empanada, which is a bit different than the Argentina one I&#39;m used to but I will say with complete confidence that if this wasn&#39;t the best one I&#39;ve had in Colorado, it was right there among the very best. We actually went ahead and ordered a second. So worth it!

We also went with the traditional dish - ropa vieja - which was also pretty fantastic. I&#39;ve had my fair share throughout the years and this one also is up there with some of the best I&#39;ve had. The seasoning, texture, juiciness, preparation were all done perfectly. I would highly recommend both dishes.

Pretty sure they are affiliated with the other Cuba Cuba restaurants around town, but this place I think offers a more genuine and better prepared dining experience.  
The prices are significantly higher.  However, you get more food and it is fresh and pretty authentic for Cuban food.  Great wine list, although not crazy big.  Good enough though to compliment your meal, and that&#39;s what matters.  
Place was packed when we went in.  Was able to grab a drink at the bar but not a seat.  They said 10-15 minutes before our reserved table would be ready... It wasn&#39;t even 5 before we were sat.

First the restaurant is a little adorable house. The inside also has fun cute decor and is always busy. We got seated right away. Our waitress wasn&#39;t too helpful in helping us decide between different choice that we had but simply said everything was good. Meh 

Grapefruit mojito pitcher-make the splurge and get the pitcher! Tangy and not sweet. Perfection 

Camarones al coco-damnnn shrimp with a sauce that reminds me slightly of Thai curry served over a potato mash. SO. GOOD. shrimp was perfection, mash was how every mash should be and we ended up licking every last bit of that sauce off the plate. 

Side of maduros-sweet plantains. So so soooo good. 

VACA FRITA-WOW this dish is one of the best things ive ever had. The flank steak melts in your mouth. The rice is so flavorful and the beans are amazing as well. Comes with more Maduros-always a plus. 

We ate our meal and as we were eating I kept repeating that I wanted to re order the VACA FRITA. We left, walked around the city....and came back! 

Ordered: 
VACA FRITA to go (seriously I looooooooved this dish) 
Side of mash 
Mojo fries-WOW all fries should be cut this thin and the garlic sauce they come with is out of this world. 

Want to come back and try churrasco con papitas and obviously re order the VACA FRITA"

I got what should have been tuna tartare, but they didn&#39;t have any tuna and subbed shrimp.  It was basically ceviche camarones.  Absolutely delicious mojitos, and the meat empanada is not to be missed.

It has so much charm (love that it was converted from a house).  A gate was converted into a decorative piece and hangs above the bar.  Check it out.  During the warmer months, there is outdoor seating.

It is packed and always a wait unless you get there at opening, but I guarantee it is worth the wait.  The service is always superb...courteous and quick!  Even though there were a ton of people waiting, the hostess managed to remember each party by only taking their names...No pagers, no phone numbers taken, etc.  Pretty impressive.

The maduros (sweet plantains) are a must order!!!  My favorite dish is the Tuna Con Sandilla.  My bf loves the habanero vegetarian dish."

It&#39;s so unassuming from the outside but when you walk in, it&#39;s just so charming. It&#39;s a big space and the enclosed porch is breezy and comforting. 
The mojito - really perfect. So minty and refreshing. I can&#39;t imagine them being much better. I loved the red sangria as well. Fruity but really strong. Don&#39;t drink too many ;) 
I ordered the tuna which was good but maybe a little too rare for my taste. I know I know, you certainly don&#39;t want to destroy a beautiful fish but I would have appreciated a slightly longer cook. It came with a watermelon salsa which was really nice to cut through the richness of the fish. I did appreciate that. The mashed potatoes that the fish sat on we&#39;re awesome but they seemed a little random with this fish. Maybe it&#39;s a Cuban style of plating which I may not understand. Individually, everything on the plate was good even if I didn&#39;t get it together. 
My husband ordered the skirt steak and it was beautifully cooked and perfectly tender. It came with the mojo fries which are just garlicky deliciousness. I could eat those forever. 
Overall, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back, though I may order something different."

First and foremost, the vibe is awesome. We didn&#39;t get to sit on the patio but that will definitely have to happen in the future. The place is an old house (or two) converted into a restaurant. It&#39;s super bright and cozy which makes for a very fun environment. They have a big back patio that is covered and looks like it could be a ton of fun.

Second, the wait. We went here on a Friday night and it was going to be over an hour. We got super lucky and swooped a bar table. We started on drinks and appetizers and literally less than 20 minutes into our hour wait the hostess took us to a table. I know this probably isn&#39;t the usual but it was rad!

The food - we ordered one of every appetizer. We weren&#39;t sure what we wanted and everything looked really good! The favorites were definitely the empanadas (both types) and the ceviche! So yummy. The empanadas were stuffed with goodness and the crust was delicious. The ceviche is one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! Our server recommended the ropa vieja and it was amazing. The beef was super tender and the mix of rice and beans was ideal. The only issue was we were so full from the apps that we weren&#39;t hungry for dinner - oops!

This place was great and I can see why there was such long wait! Can&#39;t wait to come back here again."

There are not a whole lot of Cuban/Latin type restaurants in Denver that don&#39;t serve re-fried beans. 

Sometimes unique can be troublesome, but not here. The food and drinks are great. Being in an old home, you feel like you are having a home cooked meal. Overall, atmosphere is strong.

My only complaint is the wait, and the space to make that wait. The bar fills up with hungry, and sometimes angry people. The bar then becomes overwhelmed with thirsty folks. My advice? Don&#39;t go on a busy Friday or Saturday, but do go any other time to try this great place."

My wife had visited once before and raved about the drinks and food, so we came in with a group of 3 on a Tuesday night. We arrived around 6:30 and there were plenty of tables available. By the time we left at 8, there was definitely a wait to be seated.

We started with mojitos: Blood Orange, Coconut, and Ginger. The Blood Orange definitely stood out over the others. Later, I had a Grapefruit Caipirinha, which was also very good.

For an appetizer, we shared the Marquitas Cubana. The chips were very good and the avocado mash was especially tasty. One of the other sauces was a little heavy on the garlic for our tastes, but we just avoided that one.

For dinner, we had the Churrasco con Chimichurri and Camarones al coco. Both were delicious and the portions were perfect. The slaw that came with the Churrasco was very different from anything I&#39;ve had before. Lots of fresh veggies and not too much liquid.

Unfortunately, we were all unable to try dessert, but we&#39;ll definitely be back in the future!"

Get a mojito pitcher or some sangria. Both are delicious and very well-made here -- and exactly how you&#39;d get them in Miami.

2) ORDER THE PORK SHOULDER
Slow-roasted, tender, delicious pork -- oh how I still dream about you at night. Trust me, if it&#39;s your first time here, it&#39;s a must.

3) ENJOY THE ATMOSPHERE
This place looks like two cute residential houses connected by a little corridor. The inside is filled with small wooden tables, tropical ceiling fans, and smiling people. Cozy, cute, and lovely.


The only down side to this place is that I have to wait for my annual trip to Miami to get the best Cuban dish there is: oxtail stew. Definitely something they need to add to their menu (at least for the winter)."

However, the hostess was extremely courteous about it, and got us back on the list as walk-in once our entire party arrived, and we were actually seated almost immediately!

While we were waiting for our group to arrive, a few of us sidled up to the bar and started ordered mojitos and sangria.  I started with the ginger mojito (on happy hour for $5!) and enjoyed it more than any mojito I&#39;ve had in my life!  The bartender was quick, friendly, and efficient, and never seemed overwhelmed by the mass of people collecting by the bar.

I always get their plantain chips and their garlic dipping sauce is to die for (no i mean really, after eating it you could kill a vampire but in the best way).
I also always get the vaca frita - marinated flank steak with onions, and rice and beans. I can&#39;t say I have tried any other main dish because I am literally in love with that one. 
The drinks are also just as delicious as the food. They have a variety of flavored mojitos, my personal favorites are the coconut and blackberry, and I would recommend ordering a pitcher because you&#39;re going to want one, trust me. The caipirinha is also just as delicious (unfortunately doesn&#39;t come in a pitcher size). 
But I have to say that one of my favorite things about this location of Cuba, Cuba is the restaurant itself. Tucked in Capitol Hill in what looks to be a small house, is a wonderfully delicious and vibrant restaurant. They recently updated their back patio which is also a great summer spot to dine at.

I was initially dubious about its seemingly unique placement in Denver and green house exterior - walk inside and enter another world of tasteful and charming decor.

I tried it last night for Denver Restaurant week 2014 because the menu appealed and I read a rave review for the ginger mojito. Absolutely deserved.

Despite mojito popularity in Denver they are definitely not all created equal - this place produced my best mojito experience! I ordered the ginger mojito and my mom ordered the coconut and I sampled hers. For my second mojito I ordered an original (no flavoring). Consistently impressive!

We ordered apps in addition to the Denver restaurant week choices - great guacamole  (it&#39;s small), the fish croquettes tasted fresh and very light (nice considering croquettes are a fried food), the shrimp ceviche on tostones (savory fried plantains) were most memorable - so fresh and so much flavor.

I also ordered the tostones and the sweet plantains as a side to compare, the sweet plantains were as expected. The only &#34;meh&#34; experience was the cafe tres leches dessert, not bad but not extraordinary like the savory food had been.

Impeccable service, even when it was packed. My server even lent us a bag of little puppet toys for my toddler to play with during our meal.

Was visiting Denver and was there with a party of 23 and the staff made us feel like we were there for an intimate party in their home.

Luckily my friends have excellent taste and instantly suggested going to Cuba Cuba. 

I was in love the moment I walked in.  The ambiance was perfect; the lights low (but not too low) and the vibe intimate without feeling like you were sitting too close to table next to you. 

While deciding on the main course, we ordered empanadas de picadillo and a pitcher of mojitos. Both were fantastic and kept us plenty happy until our food arrived. Everyone ordered something different, and although I can&#39;t remember what each person got, it was AMAZING. I loved it all. I especially loved my meal: vegetariano habanero that I requested by served spicy. It had avocado and hearts of palm in a wonderful tomato creole sauce &amp; rice. 

It was a great place for wonderful food, catching up with friends and enjoying a pitcher...or two of mojitos."

It tasted like a Thai Curry.. perhaps the abundance of the coconut milk? The La Frita burger was pretty packed and quite yum, and the Spicy Mango Sangria is different - I didn&#39;t love it but didn&#39;t hate it either. Awesome outside patio. Cool vibe. 

Of everything, I think it was the service that lacked the most. Hear me out. 

Sure, the server could have been warmer and a little more amiable, but she certainly wasn&#39;t rude. 

Near the end of the dinner, I mentioned that it was my friend&#39;s birthday. Did Cuba Cuba do anything for birthdays? She said something to the effect of, maybe - but there were so many birthdays that it may not be possible for there to be a birthday treat. 

Sure, would she please let me know definitively? If Cuba Cuba did offer something, we would like the Creme Brulee. (Underlying implication that it would have been totally fine if Cuba Cuba were to not offer anything; we just wanted to know to figure out if we wanted dessert at the restaurant or elsewhere.)

The Creme Brulee came out. I assumed Cuba Cuba was offering a birthday special. We ate happily. It wasn&#39;t until the bill came out that I saw we were charged for the dessert. 

I tried to clear it up with the server but she was a little unresponsive. My problem wasn&#39;t with paying the extra six or seven dollars; I felt it was inconsiderate that the server hadn&#39;t come over prior to ordering the dessert. A quick, &#34;Sorry, there are no birthday specials tonight. Do you still want the Creme Brulee?&#34; is something that I feel is standard protocol. 

Eventually, another staff member (the manager, I presume) came over and she ended up taking it off the tab saying, &#34;Look, I took it off for you because this seems to be a big deal to you, and in the end, your happiness is what matters.&#34; 

Mmm.. I wonder if Cuba Cuba really understood why I was going through the hassle of trying to &#34;dispute&#34; the Creme Brulee. The way in which I was spoken to made me feel like I was in the wrong but that they went along with what I was saying just to appease me despite the fact that I had made it clear I was willing to pay for the dessert. However, having once worked in the restaurant industry as a server, I felt it was in poor taste to leave your customers thinking one thing and not having the good grace to clarify the situation. 

So, yes, in the end, the customer &#34;won.&#34; I just walked out feeling a little...ruffled around the edges. A simple &#34;sorry about the confusion&#34; would have gone a long way."

The very first thing with which we were confronted was just how CROWDED it was! The bar area was standing room only, and there was not much even of that. We were very cramped, sipping and spilling mojitos while we waited for our table. Once we were seated in the dining room, things were better, but still felt a little tight.

The service was excellent. The wait staff did a great job of keeping our glasses full and sending food out to us right away. My hubby and I shared some appetizers: the plantain chips and the garlic fries. Both were super delicious! I love how the plantain chips came with guac and two other dipping sauces, but the fries were my favorite.

The only other noteworthy part of the experience was just that the whole place was SO LOUD. We had to shout to hear each other, both in the bar and in the dining room. As the evening wore on and other patrons started to leave, the sound level got better, but it was very uncomfortable at the beginning. Not sure what the restaurant could do to make it better, other than minimizing the number of tables and having people wait outside (which they definitely won&#39;t do).

If you can look past the crowding and the noise, the overall experience of the service, the beverages, and the food is spot-on. I would definitely come back!"

First, I called in my order and gave my name and number, so I was surprised when I came to pick it up that they were out of my order, yet failed to call and tell me. Plus, how a restaurant is out of chicken at 6pm on a Friday I&#39;m not sure. So I placed my backup order and there still seemed to be a lot of confusion. When my order was ready they brought it out and checked to make sure it had all the included items... Sure enough, stuff was missing. Throughout all of this, the manager was indifferent.

Once I got the food home, my steak was over cooked, and my citrus slaw was all black pepper. For a place that usually has great food, this was a bad experience all around. I&#39;ll give them another chance, but hopefully this isn&#39;t the new normal for Cuba Cuba."

Luckily, we showed up early, so were seated right away. Loved the mojitos and caipirinhas. We shared the mushroom and ropa vieja empanadas, which were great, and came with an awesome sauce (some sort of avocado sauce). We ordered the vaca frita, ropa vieja, and the vegetarian entree, and all were delicious. Dessert was the tres leches and a coconut creme brulee, again, it was delicious. The only thing that keeps Cuba Cuba from being five stars is 1) the lack of vegetarian options, I know Cuban food is big on meat, but it would be nice for vegetarian diners to have more than one entree option. 2) While our waitress was nice, she didn&#39;t seem very friendly, somewhat aloof and not interested in whether or not we were enjoying our meal. Cuba Cuba is definitely worth checking out."

An adorable house in the middle of a block of small businesses, on a small side street.  Strange, no.  Strange if you don&#39;t come here, yes.  Cute on the outside, transport into Cuba inside.

Rustic wood floors, aged picture frames with Cuban artwork, a small bar is the center of the first room, darker in decor, a handful of dining tables, Cuban salsa music (background, not live).  The second room, is a larger, brightly painted dining area with a billowy ceiling.  It&#39;s so cute that you want to squeeze its cheeks, not necessarily a place where you would prefer to pinch its sexy little butt.  Still, it&#39;s light and cheery, well-priced, and a perfect little date place.

1.  As a starter, my dining partner (a latina superstar) and I shared the empanadas,  Two larger-than-normal pieces filled with pork (lechado) topped with red pepper and jalapeno, and served with a fantastic spicy and very fresh salsa.

2.  The menu features about a dozen choices, so for the entree:  I choose the lechado with black beans, rice, and fried yucca.  Super tender pork, and a large portion at that (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cuba-caf%C3%A9-and-bar-denver-2?select=KMJrqqK6RWh3JvIuAXzAiA#KMJrqqK6RWh3JvIuAXzAiA) -- yay for leftovers!  I totally would get this over and over again (aka &#34;repeato&#34;).  Reference the Ranglish dictionary.

3.  Cafe le crema - absolutely to-die-for: caramelized sugar top, a slight coconut and flavor, a perfect creamy texture and very rich.  Question: body massage cream?  Answer: yes.

4.  Cafe con Leche -- served sweetened, and absolutely delicioso.

The service was wonderful.  Although, non-Cuban (needed to for full transport experience), super attentive, sweet, efficient, responsive...all what you want when dining.  Can&#39;t wait to go back and try a few more items, and I will the next time in Denver.  Cuba Cuba - may I couchsurf at your place?   I&#39;d like to stay awhile.

The ambiance is great, two little houses connected to form the bar and restaurant. The waitstaff is always really genuine, thoughtful and helpful.

But let me start from the beginning. We came to Cuba Cuba on a whim and had no idea how cute it was or how popular it is! We got lucky and our party of 2 was seated immediately at 6:30 on a Friday - I think we were the last two who didn&#39;t have to wait. Tiffany N nailed it - it feels tropical somehow in the middle of Colorado. We even went on a rainy evening, so the slight humidity added to the experience. 

We ordered fried plantains and empanadas to start. The garlic sauce served with the plantains is potent...and magical. Mark S. got the pan con lechon, which was also muy tasty!

I remember when I first went to Cuba Cuba and ordered a plate of food, well what came out was a whole plate of food. The last few times I&#39;ve been to this place, I have noticed that the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have increased. I also don&#39;t think they&#39;ve changed their menu much in the last few years, which is great if you keep rolling out quality food, but not so great if you don&#39;t. I used to go to this place more times in the year that I could count, and this past year I only went once.

I also don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t consistently have their vanilla tres leches cake. I mean I understand trying to be creative and all, but a chocolate cake taste like shit when you want vanilla, and I don&#39;t think that asking for a staple of a Cuban dessert is asking too much.

You wouldn&#39;t know it was a restaurant when driving up because it looks like a house that is having a large party with tons of cars parked outside. I parked on the street and didn&#39;t have a problem at all with parking. When you arrive the hostess was so friendly and sat us in the bar room which is the first room you come into as you walk in. Started out with a traditional mojito which was so tasty- not too strong but not weak at all. It was so refreshing and was the perfect start to dinner. As far as appetizers, my friend and I ordered the fried as well as the empanadas de picadillo which comes with two empanadas filled with beef and comes with some sort of dipping sauce which added some extra flavor to the already delicious plate. The fries were fun to munch on while we waited for our food. The bar area got pretty busy around 630 as people started coming in for drinks and dinner. 

For our main entree we ordered the paella which we shared and it was more than enough for two people! It was full of seafood including mussels, shrimp, clams and calamari as well as chicken and I think some chorizo. This plate was sooooo good and left me so full but somehow wanting more! If you&#39;re a seafood lover this is the plate for you! As I looked around the room to see what everyone ordered, all of the dishes looked exquisite and very good portion sizes. The atmosphere was loud but fun to be around very upbeat! The service was awesome as our bartender was also the server for that entire room but never left anyone without drinks or food.

Once I walked in I was greeted by Emily, she was very polite and found a table for in a packed house in no time at all. As soon as we sat Yari made her way over to make sure we had our drinks taken care of. When our waitress Karissa came over she was very helpful with recommendations on drinks and food. I decided to go with the Old Fashioned Cuban, a whisky and espresso concoction that was absolutely delicious. For my meal I went with the Bistec Emapnizado and requested it Al Caballo which they happily were able to do. My food was great, the empanizado was cooked perfectly and the moros and platanitos were amazing! The food was very authentic and true to traditional cuban while at the same time bieng creative.

We ordered the signature cornbread as promised last time and it didn&#39;t disappoint - it was twice the amount we needed for two people though. We had a couple of cocktails, taking it slow and then had a bottle of wine with dinner. The Oreo dessert is something I always remember because it has this coffee sauce that is yummy.

The thing is the food is great and the overall service is 5 stars but we must just get the wrong waiter every time. Other staff refilled our wine glasses (we ordered an expensive bottle of Malbec), took our plates, and brought dessert and silverware. Seriously, the waiter asked if I ever got my cocktail and I had already gotten it and finished it from other servers- obviously she hadn&#39;t stopped by in over 10 minutes? We also wanted to share the Cesar salad we had last time and the waiter said we&#39;ve never had that. Funny.... (see previous review).

The dip duo is good, the cream cheese jalapeño concoction is really tasty. 

I wish the wine glasses were more reasonable and there were better cocktail offerings. I ordered an off the menu French martini and it was very strong.

The service here is very genuine and swift! They are on top of it when it comes to getting refills as well as getting the food out. This is incredible because the place is packed around lunchtime! The atmosphere is very unique and they always have some great music playing. Unfortunately I&#39;ve ordered the same thing twice and haven&#39;t tried other things, not because it doesn&#39;t look good but because what I order is soooooo dang good! The chip duo on the appetizer list is a must order. It consists of chips guacamole and a cold chunky Queso that can cause semi serious skirmishes for who gets the final bite. Fortunately the main dishes are equally delicious so conceding the last bite of the Queso is not too much of a heartbreaker. I order the Macho Salad. The salad consists of their amazing roasted chicken, kale, dates, avocado, almonds, and goat cheese. Every bite of this salad is like taste bud pinball. The flavors are bouncing all over the place yet they are as harmonious as a cuisine symphony orchestrated by Beethoven and Bobby Flay.  One Dish I&#39;m Interested in trying is the short ribs. Every time they come out I always have doubt in my decision, but am pulled back up to the heavens with every bite I take of the Macho Salad.  Overall a great dining experience whether it&#39;s for a date, work lunch or meeting up with friends. Haven&#39;t had a bad experience and the consistency thus far is impressive!"

The last time I went, which was yesterday, it was horrible. Of course, the food is always good but the service, cleanliness, and attentiveness was a joke.

First, we had barely sat down when our table was rushed by someone asking us what we wanted to drink. My friend ordered a coffee and a lemonade and requested that the lemonade be bought with his lunch, and I ordered a coffee. The server told us that they were out of the drip coffee - which is been the case for quite some time - so they asked us if an Americano would be fine. 

The next thing you know, we are brought our coffees - both cups were dirty as if the coffee head over spilled and no one cleaned it up, my cup was only two thirds full and my friends was filled to the top. Also, my friend was given an iced tea.

The waiter was very pushy and continually asked us if we are ready to order after repeatedly telling her no. She eventually apologize for asking so many times, but if she was sorry she shouldn&#39;t have done it. My friend finally got his lemonade but when he drank it all, another waiter came by and filled his cup with water.

With prices like these and a location like cherry creek, I would expect a hell of a lot more.

Oh and a final thought, when it came time to pay the bill I didn&#39;t notice that my friend had put down  his credit card, and it was my turn to pay. So when the woman came by to take the bill and I stopped her and said here take this one instead, she spoke to me in a baby-toned voice and said &#34;I don&#39;t know he put it down first&#34; 
I understand that in an establishment that caters to white male privilege, it is customary to ignore the words of the silly woman. Cherry Creek Grill, you fucking suck."

I could even recommend sister-chain Hillstone over CCG any day. Yes I realize they are owned by the same corp. but the vibe here is so stale and the food was at an all time low for flavor and all time high for price. With tax and tip we paid $58.00 for 2 very mediocre, and relatively flavorless &#34;Macho&#34; salads! One did have extra chicken at $8.00, but even that resembled what I would imagine a boiled shoe to taste like. Seriously, if you have the nerve to charge $19.00 for a salad, it had better be delicious, as this salad was for many, many years. Fini! Even the once-delicious corn bread croutons were oily and near flavorless-how is it even possible to destroy cornbread?! Oh and the salad size is much smaller than it used to be also, another fail. Don&#39;t be fooled, the nice looking photo of said Macho salad is professionally shot and styled, ours had no resemblance to that pic whatsoever! 
Too many other new and promising choices in the area now to waste time and money on this one."

There is a free parking area in the back (pro tip) so you don&#39;t have to meter park. The inside of the restaurant always smells good, it&#39;s dark, and cozily lit and you can spend all afternoon there in the Winter drinking Manhattans - just saying. About the food, the menu is honed tightly - which I prefer. 5 apps, 5 sandwiches, 5 salads, 8 entrees.  
To start it&#39;s always the homemade guac and spicy cheesdip. Sometimes joined by the artichoke if I have certain friends with me. 
If it&#39;s cold out then I prefer the rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes with a side of sweet, salty, warm, and soft cornbread!! This perfectly simple meal is so good. And I NEVER order chicken out.  The chicken is moist, plentiful and flavorful.  The cornbread is toe curling.

If it&#39;s warm out or I am pretending to be on a diet then I go for the Macho Salad.  Again chicken - only here! The macho salad has the best corn bread croutons and super tasty dates and goat cheese - a perfect combination.

Service is always spot-on although you do have to ask for your own jug of water - the water glasses are so narrow that I drain the glass to quickly.

Solid wine list - I am a fan of the Duckhorn Chardonnay - it&#39;s Californian but tastes infinitely better than your traditional oak barrel aged Chardonnay."

It was crowded, we had a short wait but the lively and friendly (to my surprise, given the locale) bar was a fun place to wait. We had a terrific young lady server who was on top of her game, friendly, helpful, attentive but not in our face.  And the other wait staff the same way, empty dishes flew away, water and drinks came as needed.

The food - she had their roasted chicken which was delicious though to me, for that size serving of chicken for around $16 - really? Very tasty though as was their sort of spicey cornbread.

But the trout I had - red trout I think she said? Amazing .A huge portion, like a salmon filet thickness and just terrific. That will bring me there again on its own. One of the best fish dishes I&#39;ve ever had and I lived and ate in San Francisco area for 30 years. Same price as the chicken so, that&#39;s an easy decision."

The salmon app is really good. But don&#39;t I HATE it when a place discontinues a wine but doesn&#39;t remove it from he list nor offer a replacement at the same cost? Yes I do!  In major markets, they offer an equal varietal at the same cost. Very appropriate.  Here they offered a $20 more expensive varietal. Really annoying!! I will ding management for that. 

Too much dressing on the delicious kale salad. Main courses very nice"

She was particularly excited to talk to us about the artichokes because she said that they&#39;re starting to not carry them as much due to them going out of season. Oh my god are we happy we did.

More than anything, I know that when I visit this restaurant I will have a consistently terrific experience. From the food...to the wine...to the ambience...to the service, this restaurant knows its identity and comes through every time. 

My husband and I lived in Denver for nearly two years and hailing from New York City and Atlanta, we were on a quest to find the best restaurants in town. As a rule, we found that the fairly nice restaurants tend to be expensive in Denver, which probably would not cut it on the East Coast (no shade). However, Cherry Creek Grill mixes great food with good prices, which equates to a wonderful value in my book!

Our absolute Faves:
*Grilled Artichokes--just view some of the pics and you&#39;ll see why. 
*Prime Rib French Dip--my favorite sandwich for 2 years
*Peanut Slaw--we did our best to copy this one at home...delish
*Rotisserie Chicken and BBQ Ribs--my hubby&#39;s favorite
*Prime Rib--my &#34;go to&#34; meal every time 

Definitely 5 stars for Denver, but solid 4.5 stars overall. Happy Eating!"

There&#39;s not a whole lot of choices at 9pm.  Thus, based on yelp ratings, my boyfriend and I ended up here.  Now I been around the Cherry Creek area many times and have never notice Cherry Creek Grill.  It is an upscale restaurant with comparably priced food.  

Despite appearing under the search of steak houses, Cherry Creek Grill does not specialize in steak and there were very few selection.  I ended up ordering steak &amp; enchilada platter and my boyfriend ordered the blackened rib-eye.  We both enjoyed our meal very much.  My steak was cooked medium rare which I preferred and the butternut squash &amp; cheese enchilada was delicious.  For a very simple ingredient enchilada, it was pretty flavorful.  However, I did not enjoy the cucumber salad that accompany it; taste-wise, the pairing was off.  My boyfriend&#39;s ribeye looked and tasted amazing with the vine-ripe tomatoes.  We are not big fans of blue cheese.  However, the way it was prepared with the tomatoes made it so mouth-watering delicious.

Besides the food, the scenery was quite amazing as well.  We chose to dine outside.  Cherry Creek Grill has a nice balcony dining area and that night&#39;s weather was wonderful.  I did enjoy my experience and our server was pleasant, but to honest, I probably will not go back.  Cherry Creek Grill does not attract a diverse crowd.  It mostly older white folks, whose sophistication made me a bit uncomfortable.  I love lively crowds; this place was too structured."

I believe our server was Diane/Diana (sorry!) and she was friendly, always smiling, and attentive without being annoying and checking in too often. 

I got the gin, elderflower, and grapefruit cocktail and found it very light and refreshing. My husband got the Old Fashioned and was very impressed. That&#39;s saying something considering he has his own version of the masterpiece at home. 

The real winner was the dip duo. It comes with chips and two dips: a guacamole and a jalapeño cheese dip. Whoa. The guac seemed to have sweet onions, which gave it a slightly different flavor than I&#39;m used to. Delicious. The cheesy jalapeño was to die for. We almost ordered a second one because we liked it so much. 

Yes, it&#39;s pricy. But it&#39;s a special splurge that&#39;s worth it for those occasions. Keep it on your list. 

I also highly recommend the macho salad and the cornbread appetizer. All. Day. Long."

Cedar plank salmon had a crispy, savory crust and moist, tender fish with every bite.  It was a beautiful thing.  

I&#39;ve been a staunch vegetarian for 25 years, but in recent months I&#39;ve been in business environments where I don&#39;t want anyone to feel awkward about choosing restaurants to meet my personal choices.  So I eat a lot of salmon.  And thanks to CCG, I kind of love it.

The cornbread came in less than 5 minutes of ordering it. We figured they already had it pre-made in the back, but it tasted good and wasn&#39;t cold enough to send back, so we enjoyed. They brought out everything else at the same time. Our order was correct and we ate EVERYTHING. The Ahi Tuna was amazing. There were actually pieces of mango and avocado in it!

Firstly, I&#39;d like to say that you have vastly improved since my last review. It seems like you&#39;re finally living up to the standards of your big brother down the street (Hillstone). Your food was awesome tonight. 

Rarely do I come and update a review so many times, but our server was so over the top amazing that I just have to. Natalia was so attentive and nice I couldn&#39;t NOT get on here and rave about her. 

If you&#39;re going to Cherry Creek Grill, ask to sit in her section. Period. Hands down. She&#39;s the best.

Why does Cherry Creek Grill not get 5 stars you may ask? Well due to some horribly bad experiences with myself and people in my circle being treated so poorly, I feel like they still have quite a bit of making up to do. However, Natalia and the menu changes are definitely helping this place climb my Yelp hierarchy. They should also consider getting rid of a few of their pretentious/rude servers and hostesses.

Tasty food, but wwwaaaayyyy overpriced for the portion size and quality of service. 

My trout was very delicious. The brussel sprouts were fresh and tasty, but for $24??
Wife&#39;s salmon was perfectly cooked and she loved the kale salad, but the portion was a bit shy for $26. 
The dip duo appetizer was less than a cup of bland guacamole and less than a cup of tasty queso mix with about 10 chips on a plate for  $10!!?!! WHAT?

Service was mediocre at best. 
Hot tea was refilled with hot water promptly, yet our water glasses sat empty from when we first got there until the waitress picked up our plates. Coincidentally, our dirty plates sat in front of us for a good 7-10 minutes after we finished.

You know those little yellow and white horrors on every holiday table and at every potluck.  I haven&#39;t touch one in years.  But, our friends insisted the ones here were not to be missed.  So I gave it a little thought... I have learned to like brussel sprouts after all...

Guess what??? The deviled eggs at Cherry Creek Grill are AMAZING!!!

You know what else is amazing?

Kale salad, Macho salad, seared tuna salad, burgers and the Old Fashioned!  I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here and say you probably can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.

It is owned by a large restaurant group, which always made me think of it as sort of a chain, even though there is only one Cherry Creek Grill.  But, in the end, it still won me over with great food, great atmosphere and top notch service.

Make a reso this place gets packed."

Just ordered drinks as there is a 40 minute wait at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night.  The ambiance is very inviting, somewhat rustic but Cherry Creek chic.  Noise level is acceptable with nice jazz playing in the background. An inviting crowd of good looking 30 to 50 year olds having a good time.  We had to wait so they offered to buy us an appetizer.  We only waited 15 minutes. Taylor is our waitress and has a great demeanor. Food: Deviled Eggs good, beef ribs, fillet, rotisserie chicken and prime rib all got 10 stars from my friends!  
Highly recommended.   I will come back again."

But the food was just bad! Me and my spouse ordered the vegetable burger! The bun was soaked in oil! The burger too although it was grilled! And the burger tasted so heavy just like meat! If we are ordering vegetable anything we are trying to stay away from the meat taste not because we can&#39;t eat meat and you feel bad about it and try to make something to make up for the taste!!!!

We were sitting at the prior outside and they turned the lights off at out table right before 10 so we could barely see the check to sign!

Don&#39;t recommend them specially with their very expensive menu!!!"

This is the one we chose and I can say hands down this is the BEST steakhouse I have ever eaten at. I had the chicken and bbq beef ribs which were AMAZING! It included slaw which I substituted for their kale salad. We had a reservation and waited about 10 minutes. The staff was very courteous and asked if we wanted to order a drink while we waited. As we were seated they gave us a complimentary corn bread. This steakhouse has the best food and staff ever. Will definitely go back every time I&#39;m in Denver. You definitely get what you pay for.

Not only was she professional, she was eager to find out what we wanted for dinner, she offered the nightly special (cajun ribeye) which was probably one of the best I have ever had in my life. As well we had the queso and guacamole appetizer... MY GOODNESS! I don&#39;t know what or how they made that queso, however; I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Wait... did I mention the green chili cornbread? It was OUTSTANDING. 

To sum all of this up, they good ol saying &#34;you pay for what you get&#34; definitely sums up this experience. Is it a cheap meal? No. However, when you have a five star experience with your bartender and five star quality food. It makes it that much easier to pay more for a five star meal. 

We will definitely be back and I will definitely be in Vanessa&#39;s section, or if she is bartending, I will definitely sit at the bar."

I had the French dip sandwich which was like no other one I&#39;ve ever had. But it was the best I&#39;ve ever had too.  But the real surprise of the night was the cornbread.  It has this incredible top portion that is hard to describe, but you must try it.  I&#39;ve traveled a bunch of years and this is the best cornbread I&#39;ve had in my life.

The overall ambiance is nice with a bit of a Chilis feel to the layout but far more upscale. While parking might prove tricky as with most businesses in this area, we lucked out with a metered spot right across the street. Service was great enough that I regret I am unable to remember our server&#39;s name to give her credit here. As for food, I will lay the groundwork by stating that this is one of the better steakhouse menus I have perused I some time. I settled on the ribeye, as I often do when one is available, equally excited and concerned by its &#34;blackened&#34; descriptor. My adventurous mood was well rewarded. The steak was phenomenal; cooked to perfection and of uniquely exquisite flavor. Table guests raved about the filets as well.

Only one has been worth coming back for. I keep giving it another try because I live close by but again today the place leaves me disappointed

I always sit at the bar and the bartenders are just rude and don&#39;t understand hospitality. 

I continually have to ask for refills 

I have to ask to take entree orders

I have to ask to clear plates

BTW Hillstone down the street is always great and I don&#39;t understand why the grill is so bad

There were not that many things on the menu the really jumped out at me.  Upon the recommendation of a friend and fellow Yelper, I went with the Prime Rib French Dip.  This is described as thinly sliced and piled high, and served with au jus.  I also had them provide the suggested horseradish cream on the side.  Side dish choices include mashed potatoes, coleslaw, kale salad, or potato chips.  None of these really excited me, so I opted for the potato chips.  These are Boulder brand kettle chips, of which I am fond.  However, I was a bit disappointed they did not make their own chips.  

This sandwich was fine.  The flavors were decent.  It was of medium size.  Had it been a $10 sandwich, I would have been perfectly happy.  At nearly twice that price, it was significantly less satisfying.  I tried a bit of the roast chicken off the plate of another friend.  It was also nice, but not especially more tasty than a rotisserie chicken from Costco.  The beer I had with dinner was nicely cold and served in a frosty glass.  The service was very good.

The cornbread and artichoke are two of the best appetizers you will ever eat.  

The ribs are amazing and in my opinion they used to be the best beef ribs in town.  Still great but not so sure about the new sauce they are using. 

The macho salad uses the same cornbread but as croutons. It&#39;s a very nice twist!"

I was not a big fan of Kale and I think Kale has the weirdest taste ever! However, I fall in love with Kale since I had tried the Kale Salad in there. We only stayed in Denver for 5 days.

I had the USDA filet mignon medium rare. It was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I had the mashed potatoes and spinach. A delight as well. Had to try the famous cornbread. It was orgasmic to the palette. A side of corn on the cob was an added bonus. And the sauce compliments the already good taste.

We found ourselves looking for a date night spot, and already having been to Hillstone&#39;s and Earl&#39;s - we wanted something similar, but wanted to try something new. After Yelping, we settled on Cherry Creek Grill and only as we were walking in the door did we see the &#34;Hillstone Restaurant Group&#34; sign on the door. Le sigh, we were in for another fabulous dinner.

As with Hillstone&#39;s - this place is packed. We were thankful we were able to grab two seats at the bar, and hung out for a while and ended up sharing some artichokes and an entree. I really like the bartender they have here. I think her name is Jill, but she&#39;s incredibly attentive and on top of things for such a busy place.

I find their wines to be pretty reasonably priced - both by the bottle and by the glass. They also have one of my favorite wines here available by the glass. Major bonus.

I doubt I&#39;ll ever have a negative experience at any of these restaurants and I&#39;m stoked to learn there are two so close together."

First off the ambiance is great, very cozy feeling and roomy. I always feel like I&#39;m dining in a fancy steakhouse which is awesome. 

The food? Well that&#39;s pretty great as well. The menu is limited but everything is great. I&#39;ve had the chicken, which was moist and tender and a generous portion at that. I&#39;ve also had the veggie burger which was huge and just as delicious. Finally the french dip, probably the best that I&#39;ve had."

It&#39;s in a newer strip close to the mall, cherry creek mall? Place was pretty busy for a Sunday afternoon, mostly older clientele (but this could have been easily due to the time a lot that I happened to be there) but it was a full house, there was a 25 min wait so we sat at the bar and rubbed elbows with locals (even the bar seating was full) staff is friendly and overall the food is quite good.

Pricing is adequate for the portion as and quality of food served.

Veg options are limited but they are available.

$29 steak (which was a quality beef and cooked properly, tender, juicy and flavorful I prefer a bit more marbling in my steak and it was shy of this to be truly excellent) I digress the chef prepared it properly by searing both sides nicely and then glazing it in butter/fat render. center was a correctly colored. Served with a fresh mixed greens salad with a dollop of cream? Or fresh mozzarella? Didn&#39;t get to taste that part actually but the dressing was house made . 



$24? For split rotisserie chicken (not exactly sure on pricing on this one. When a place has a rotisserie chicken it&#39;s hard for me to resist this and rightfully so, tender and juicy goodness it was delightful. Garlic mash that accompanied was great! Good texture and not overly garlicky. 

Overall the impressions are that they use quality ingredients and know how to prepare them well. 

Pros: clean, new, has outdoor seating for the nicer days Denver had to offer, food is good and reasonably priced.

Cons: very few beers on tap, may require reservations? (Altho it&#39;s not really a reservation kinda place) 

And $13 for a grilled artichoke? Seems excessive for an app, especially since mussels were $9ish .. but then again I don&#39;t track the market prices of whole artichokes on the regular :/ 

Don&#39;t miss: chicken!! Yum also the corn bread looked tantalizing but I did not try this. 

Interesting side note: apparently phones are NOT allowed in the dining area, as in you cannot use them. Which is cool, makes people interact with one another rather than posting yelp reviews or selfies or whatever ...."

We went here with my daughter and her boyfriend. Between us we had 2 rib eyes, filet and trout. My rib eye came out cold and the filet was overcooked. The waitress took care of it immediately and the manager, Ben, picked up the cost of the two meals. It was all very good in the end. The rib eye had a rub on it that was very tasty, the filet perfect and the trout incredible. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time, but it&#39;s how they correct it that matters in the end.

I came with a party of six and everybody tried something different.  Everything tasted great.  A couple of downsides though, we had to wait an hour to be seated for a party of six because they don&#39;t have enough tables that large.  Secondly, everything here seems to be a bit overpriced, maybe its because of the area it is located in.  The ambiance and service were great.  My favorites from this place was definitely the rotisserie chicken and the cornbread.  Its a huge chunk of break that the table can share and it comes in a skillet."

I ordered at the bar and the bartender was really nice and friendly and was told 10-15 minutes.  I went back outside and took a short walk and came back 15 minutes and the food was ready.

I got the mucho salad.  So many things: romaine lettuce, corn, avocado, almonds, rotisserie chicken, cherry tomatoes, scallions, chevre, and cornbread croutons served with a vinaigrette.  Mostly everything was chopped up.  And I love salads that don&#39;t need a knife.

I ordered him a french dip.  I took a bite and it was really good.  The quality of beef that they used was on the higher end and really tender.  It came with a side and I picked the chips for him.  The chips were mediocre.  It came with a large cup of au jus and a creamy horseradish sauce.  He prefers horseradish over horseradish sauce.  

Both of are entrees we would order again.  And get a reservation if you don&#39;t want to wait.  Of course parking can be a pain in Cherry Creek, but this was a great find!"

FOOD / DRINK:
* Arnold Palmer - classic.
* Skillet Cornbread - larger than expected, served on a cast iron skillet, crunchy muffin-like top, moist, dense bread on the inside, and a zing of jalapeno spice.  Yummy.
* French Dip Sandwich - the bun was too buttery, but they use good quality meat that&#39;s not overcooked, and au jus that&#39;s not crazy salty.
* Corn on the Cob side - not really a fan; it&#39;s heavily seasoned with spices like cumin (or something similar), which I don&#39;t care for on corn.
* Kale Salad with Roasted Chicken - I highly recommend this.  The chicken was cooked just enough to stay juicy and tender, the greens were fresh and crunchy, and the dressing was light but flavorful.  I felt healthy and happy afterwards.  I&#39;m really not a salad person, but I definitely would order this again... it&#39;s that good.

SERVICE:
Good for the most part.  I asked the server about the dressing in the kale salad since I liked it so much, but she kept forgetting, then I gave up.

AMBIANCE / LOCATION:
Upscale restaurant/bar located in the Cherry Creek neighborhood.  They have some booths, tables, and bar seating, as well as a handful of tables outside.  Bugs and moths are attracted to the individual table lights outside, which can be a nuisance. 

PARKING:
I think they only have street parking.

Based on the Kale Salad with Roasted Chicken, I would return."

I got the BBQ beef back ribs and the meet fell off the bone like the menu said. Dunking them in BBQ sauce was necessary. My sister ordered her staple: rotisserie chicken. She was slightly disappointed in the sauce it sat in; it was almost like an enchilada sauce, kinda grainy and lacking flavor. My mom got the macho salad, and it was definitely macho with lots of ingredients. I stole a bunch of her cornbread croutons because they were so tasty. Made me wish I&#39;d ordered the side of cornbread. 

Despite the fact that I&#39;m not in the area much, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back anyway. I prefer something a little less stuffy and way more affordable."

We then told her extra sauce on the side for the ribs but then she brought ribs with no sauce at all, only on the side?  At this point we are thinking this gal is not doing such a great job.  Then we add an order of fries and she literally throws them on the table and says &#34;these are on the house&#34;.  Um, thanks?  But why?  That was never explained.  Then near the end Two of us were done but our third diner was not - she starts clearing plates around him, takes his extra rib sauce that she screwed up in the first place as if he&#39;s done with it and then brings us the check while he&#39;s still visibly eating with half a beer left!  What is this, Denny&#39;s???  Terrible terrible service CCG.  And not a manager to be found even if you wanted to complain.  For $81 for lunch this waitress was the worst.

I have never seen Doug&#39;s Day Diner pop up on Yelp in all my local searches, so lesson learned to check else where too! 

Located in a strip mall in Parker, Doug&#39;s Day Diner is quaint and delicious, offering a large menu and large portions.

First off, I would like to mention that this was one of the best customer service experiences we have had in a long time. I wish I had caught her name, but our server was amazing. She was polite and informative, offering suggestions and answering questions about the menu. Once she knew it was our first time, she brought out samples of the gravy and both chilis for us to try. She then brought out homemade ranch and 1000 island for us to try with our food. She rocked and she deserves to know it!

My mom ordered the pancakes, my brother ordered the frontier burger, and I ordered the healthy sandwich. Portions were HUGE on both the pancakes and burger. Especially the burger. Legit 6 inches tall with the insanely thick bread. The burger and the sandwich came with a side, we both opted for fries. They are natural cut and without salt - great for us! The homemade ranch and 1000 island were both outstanding, great for dipping, and made my sandwich better, adding them as a spread on the bread. 

We loved the food and very much appreciated the amazing service! We can&#39;t wait to come back!

Good tips:
You can order an individual pancake for $3 instead of 2 for $6 
Almost everything is homemade

Day 119 &#34;DUSA Tour 2016&#34;

Not a fan of strip-mall type eateries, &#34;Doug&#39;s Day Diner&#34; was another &#34;make-me-do-something-I don&#39;t wanna-do-n-like it!&#34; success story 

Counter-seating (a &#34;Run-A-Way Bill&#34; Favorite) for @ 14, plus booth seating, and table seating give the customer several options 

The &#34;Local Artist Book&#34; is pretty cool featuring kid crayon-artist drawings   

&#34;Made-from-Scratch&#34; biscuits, soups, syrup, jams, fries, browns, dressings, meats, sausages &amp; potato chip make this a unique eatery with quality food choices  

Cooking with real butter &amp; canola oil impresses me too 

Unique menu items make food selecting more difficult than most eateries 

Their biscuits are not only unique &amp; tasty-riffic, they are enormous  

Last and &#34;bestly&#34; was my server &#34;Skylar&#34; ... efficient, courteous, professional AND she smiled!  GREAT job Skylar!

It is absolutely fantastic! I ordered the breakfast burrito with carne asada and by the waiters recommendation he told me to get my burrito with red and green sauce. It was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend ordering it with red and green sauce. The carne asada took me off guard- as it is more similar to marinated beef than traditional carne asada you would get at a Mexican restaurant or at a taco stand. Still very delicious! The second time I went I ordered it with their pork and it was fantastic. My brother ordered the omelet and once again the waiter recommended a biscuit and it was honestly the best damn biscuit I&#39;ve ever had. It came with 3 home made jellies that were delicious.

One of the best things about this place that it&#39;s affordable, home made cooking, and a good environment. Big fan!"

It&#39;s a super tiny hole in the wall kinda place in a strip mall so we had a wait quite awhile to be seated for our party of 8. After a 30 minute wait we finally go seated. The decor has your usual American diner feel with wood paneling and wooden tables/chairs everywhere. The menu has your usual american favs ranging from classic pancakes, omelettes, burritos and a sweets section for the breakfast menu. 

The top 3 fav items that we ordered:
Huevos Rancheros: Two Eggs atop Corn Tortillas with browns, beans, choice of Red Chile and/or Green Chile, Cheeses, Garnish &amp; Tortilla. This was amazingly good although it didn&#39;t look too visually appealing. It&#39;s like a mexican deconstructed burrito with an egg. I had the green chile that gave it a mild spice kick with each bite. The portion is VERY filling so come hungry! The flavor profiles were on point with just the right amount of refried beans/cheese ratio. Overall flavor 4.5/5 overall value 5/5

Ranchers: Doug&#39;s Breaded Steak, Browns, Country Gravy, Three Eggs &amp; Griddle Biscuit. This was quite literally larger then life size like most of the items on the menu. The huge fried steak had a good crunch with the creamy salty gravy. The griddle biscuit was literally the size of a whole burger bun and you get two of them!  Yes another gut busting entree if you can even finish this plate in one sitting. Overall flavor 4/5 overall value 5/5

Sweet Combo: One Hot Cake or Sweet Toast plus One Egg, plus One Thick Cut Bacon Breakfast. OMG when they say one hot cake this is more like 3 BIG HOT cakes! These hot cakes are literally the circumference of your face if not bigger! Yes we measured it! haha What made this item a total winner was how perfectly fully moist yet crispy these hot cakes were. You can&#39;t stop eating these hot cakes until you&#39;re brain tells you&#39;re too full that you&#39;re about to explode! The homemade maple syrup served with these delicious hot cakes was also a winner with the perfect amount of sweetness and maple. Overall flavor 5/5 overall value 5/5

The service here was great too as our waitress was very friendly and refilled our coffee&#39;s, water a good half dozen times as we all went into food comas after attempting to devour our plates. You for sure will be taking most of your plate home if you&#39;re not sharing unless you have a monster appetite! Definitely a great place for brunch!

I tried the Huevos Socorro w asada 1/2 red 1/2 green... Delish. I do have to say that I prefer the green chili over the red but I&#39;m glad they do the Christmas option so I could compare. It was good but I&#39;d pick the asada papas over this because I get more hash browns. We of course ordered a biscuit on the side to share with the homemade raspberry jam! I could eat those all day long.... Mmm biscuits and jam! We were really excited that we only had to wait like 10 minutes for a table as that&#39;s sometimes a deterrent for why we don&#39;t come as often.

We were seated right away and our server was amiable and clearly knew her stuff.  The dining area is light and open with a view into the kitchen.  I ordered carne asada papas (basically, hash browns, cheese, and marinated steak) &#34;christmas tree style&#34;, meaning half red chili and half green.  The Boy ordered pork adovada papas with red chili only, then we also ordered a plate of sweet toast to split.

My overall impression of the food was that it was good, but didn&#39;t live up to the mouth-watering descriptions on the menu.  The carne asada wasn&#39;t dry but it was well done and not very remarkable and I didn&#39;t like that the has was chipped rather than shredded.  I commented to Boy that I felt more like I was having chili cheese fries for breakfast than having a hash skillet.  The sweet toast was also kind of meh.  Not bad, but just plain old french toast that didn&#39;t have any discernible orange flavor as the menu promised.  The green chili was also kind of weird.  The flavor was good, though mild, but it was thick like country gravy, which was a little off-putting.  I will say however that the red chili was delicious and had a really nice unexpected kick to it that I really enjoyed.

Given that I&#39;m still on a diet, I really liked the fact that so many items on Doug&#39;s menu are available in half portions.  However, those half portions only save you a couple bucks compared to the full sized dish, and $8 seemed like a lot to pay for a small bowl of hash. 

Overall I&#39;d say we weren&#39;t super impressed by our first visit to Doug&#39;s diner, but there was enough good there that we&#39;ll give it another couple tries to see if we can find something on the menu that better suits us."

Every menu item is awesome, it is always clean and reliable, the staff is consistently friendly and helpful, and it is reasonably priced.  My only complaint... the coffee - they need to serve better coffee.  The fact that they do so many other things well only makes their coffee taste even worse.  In short, I&#39;m a huge fan - and maybe they&#39;ll understand if I start sneaking in my own thermos of joe."

Went on a Saturday morning and had about a 15 min wait, that doesn&#39;t bother me because I know at 9:00am any place worth it is going to have a wait for breakfast. By 9:30 I&#39;m sure there was a 30-45 minute wait so get there earlier than 9:30. 

Ordered the Rancher which is a breaded steak (chicken fried steak) with three eggs, biscuit and hash browns. Too much to eat...the plate was huge!  Peeps I was with ordered the Hillbilly and pancakes. All of it was great and he homemade sausage was legit!!  Can&#39;t wait to go back and try it again!  

The menu isn&#39;t huge but there is enough to make anyone happy. The was good, as the hostess was more than accommodating and the waiter was never behind on refills or anything we needed. Great place that I highly recommend!!!"

We sat at the bar. 

I had the asada skillet with green chili, and the meat was really tender and flavorful but more like pot roast then asada. I still found it very delicious but my significant other is picky about his asada so I figured it&#39;s worth a mention. 

He had the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was flavorful and he he ate it all, which he normally never does with that dish.

Then, since it was our first time there, they gave us a blueberry pancake for free! Can&#39;t go wrong with pancakes, I am normally neutral to them but that one was good enough that is be tempted to order it again.

Definitely will be back. They say the best time to go is weekday mornings as they get slammed busy on the weekends. Makes sense. They&#39;ve got a cool place."

The food is really good and they give you plenty of it. I guess the only downside is on the weekends this restaurant is extremely busy. There is always a wait and once you are seated...it will be awhile before your food gets to you. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not the service. The service is good and prompt, think the problem is in the kitchen, gets backed up. Guess the price you pay for good food. They have a lot of menu options, if you like chile they do a really good job, I always order Christmas(red and green combined). Has really good flavor with just the right amount of heat. They do a good job with the kids menu as well, lots of options. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, which is a bummer. Never had anything I didn&#39;t like, def bring your appetite."

The portions are ginormous and a great price, however the food was really bland - Meh.  IHOP and Village Inn have more flavor in their smaller portions of food. 

The part that was unacceptable - FLIES FLIES FLIES, Heat, and dirty.   There&#39;s no fans or anything to deter the flies and when I say flies I mean they were everywhere and landing on our food and my eyes and my husbands hair (and he&#39;s OCD about showers).  My kids were freaking out not wanting to eat because of &#34;Fly poop mommy&#34;.   There were used toothpicks and other trash under our table.  The floor was so sticky my shoes were making sticky sounds after I got home.   

Eggs - If you don&#39;t want your eggs milked/watered down I suggest you not get them scrambled.  

Bacon - Order well done or you will get a massive piece of super gelatinous chewy fat.  

Biscuits - Giinormous but not much in flavor.

Awesome Coffee!
Awesome preserves!


There&#39;s potential and this area really could use a mom and pop shop but this place has a way to go.  Clean up!"

I got the Ranchers (Doug&#39;s Breaded Steak, Browns, Country Gravy, Three Eggs &amp; Griddle Biscuit) and my boyfriend got the Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito. The country gravy on my dish was incredible and the biscuits were perfectly crispy, flakey, and fluffy. Our plates were also so big we had to save half of it for take out.

His reviews were raving and we couldn&#39;t wait to give it a shot. But man were we disappointed. My wife and I had Biscuits and Gravy for breakfast and to be honest they didn&#39;t even resemble Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuit had been warmed up and I&#39;m not even sure it was a biscuit. It was more of some hardened dough. The gravy was okay but really not great. To be fair, we are from the south and are used to really great biscuits and gravy and have traveled a lot around the country trying breakfasts from a lot of areas. This breakfast just didn&#39;t cut it. However, the staff was attentive and friendly. If hard pressed we might give them a second chance but not likely. It&#39;s too bad.

The potatoes buried underneath the Taos &#39;skillet&#39; were burned and the chorizo had an odd grainy texture.

It took about 10 minutes to seat us, but it went by quickly.  

The service here is very friendly and accommodating.  Doug had me at &#34;homemade New Mexican food.&#34;  I consider New Mexican food to be some of my very favorite in all the land, and Doug&#39;s staff exceeded all expectations.  I ordered the Cowboy Papas (potatoes), no cheese or eggs, with Christmas sauce - red and green chili mix.  I was able to sub the best biscuit ever for the eggs - light, fluffy, flaky, and chock full of flavor.  The potatoes were delicious, speckled with sausage, bacon, and ham, and smothered in the most delicious sauces ever.  

My husband had the chicken fried steak, and I took a few bites, almost wishing I&#39;d ordered that because it was the best CFS I believe I&#39;ve ever tasted.  I would go back tomorrow if I could!"

Al of the egg dishes I&#39;ve had have been excellent, even the omelette drizzled with balsamic vinegar. I seem to get the same waitress who is knowledgable about the menu (I usually ask for recommendations).

A side note, their biscuits are baked on the griddle, so more like a buttery, dense pancake. They are very good, but unlike any biscuit I&#39;ve ever had. I want to lick the bowl of the homemade jam that comes with the biscuits."

Despite the extremely cramped and awkward waiting area when they are busy, and the less than desirable cafe style seating area, the food always made it worth it. However!!! As of lately the service and quality has been a huge disappointment! Before the food presentation and flavor was incredible and well prepared, like who ever was cooking really cared about how they presented it. These days it would be hard to tell the difference between this food and a truck stop Sunday brunch special, except that you might find more flavor elsewhere. 
This morning my wife ordered the huevos rancheros with carne asada. What came out was actually dried out slices of pork roast that had absolutely no flavor, a folded tortilla with and egg and green chile on top, and a side of French toast that was wheat bread with powdered sugar on top. The only ones that will enjoy this meal is our dogs who we took the meat home for. 
My order was the Same thing I order every time I visit this restaurant, and while it was not terrible, it was very apparent that the quality and time they take to prepaid the food has suffered drastically. 
I leave here today very disappointed and not sure I have any intention on returning"

We go on the weekends and it&#39;s one of few places I&#39;ll wait for breakfast.  By 9a, it&#39;s usually a 15-20 minute wait, after that, come at your own risk.  

One issue is the entryway, people tend to crowd and if it&#39;s cold outside, the door is constantly opening and closing.  If you&#39;re sitting at the bar, keep your coat on!

This place is worth a stop, plan on eating a lot and leaving full, probably won&#39;t need lunch if you eat breakfast here."

The food was very good, and all components (including hash browns) seemed to be made totally from scratch. Prices were standard for a good breakfast - not excessive, but not quite &#34;diner&#34; level pricing either ($10ish per plate). The place was very well staffed, I counted at least 5-6 employees, but the service at my table was somewhat inattentive. My coffee ran dry on a couple of occasions and I had to have someone down for assistance.  There were lots of servers, but many of them appeared to be chatting with other servers rather than attending to their tables. 

All told, I&#39;ll be back for the food, but the spotty service is standing in the way of a 5 star. I&#39;ll update this if I have a different experience next time."

Most breakfast entrees come with one of their unique griddle biscuits which are MASSIVE.   You can get it either with a side of homemade apple butter or strawberry jam.   I suggest the apple butter and i suggest asking for extra.   It comes in one of those small tartar sauce cups you typically see on a buffet line--not quite enough for that massive biscuit.   

The only deduction is for the hashbrowns.   I&#39;m not a huge fan.   They remind me of those sketch browns for The Waffle House--except I&#39;m pretty sure these are made of real potatoes.   But still, they don&#39;t have the type of crisp factor that I enjoy in a hashbrown."

I remembered seeing some Yelp friends check in here so decided to give it a whirl. We got there at the perfect time as a 20 minute wait on a Saturday is more than reasonable. The hostess was really flustered and told us they could not seat anyone at the 4 empty tables. The standing room only diners were quickly getting restless and kept going up to her so we were lucky enough to soon be seated. Once seated service was super fast and our server was super friendly and efficient. She was very attentive when we explained my husband&#39;s food allergies - always a concern when trying a new place. 

The place was packed and there were a good 20 people standing and waiting for tables by the time we were seated. We settled in for a bit of a wait when suddenly our food appeared - fast! We were impressed at the speed. The bacon- oh the bacon - thick cut, pan baked goodness. I drooled a little thinking about it. This is not a light breakfast (of course a light breakfast was an option I did not choose) and definitely more of a nice weekend treat. A large biscuit with homemade strawberry jam - delish. Tons of hash browns and eggs cooked perfectly over medium. Pricing was pretty reasonable for the amount of food received."

When to get out of bed, what to do when I got out of bed, what to eat.  I noticed a friend online and shortly afterwards we decided to meet for some breakfast.  Any excuse to get out of house work right?  

We decided to meet at a place he had been many times, but would be a first for me.   I had driven past this spot several times in the last few years but never stopped.  It was bustling on a Sunday morning.  A waiting line out the door, which I have been told is normal most any time.  We didn&#39;t have to wait long for a seat at the counter.  Everyone was buzzing around, and plates were hurried out of the kitchen piled with food.  

The menu is small compared to most diners I have been to which is nice because you don&#39;t have to peruse it forever to find something you think you might want.  My eyes were wide from all the things I saw going in and out of the kitchen.  So much looked so good, it was going to be hard to decide for sure. 

Our waitress Linda was really nice, very personable.  I ordered a cup of tea and the B&amp;G.  B&amp;G???  Biscuits and Gravy, this is normally served with 2 eggs.  As I can&#39;t eat eggs and ordered it - the eggs, Linda quickly asked if I would like to substitute hash browns for the eggs.  Yes Please.  I thought that was great, as must places you go will not offer up something to replace eggs.  
 
As we sat and chit chatted waiting for our orders I started to notice things.  Purple things,  Purple Mugs, Purple napkins and little pops of Purple in different places.  I thought it was neat that instead of the standard restaurant supply white or beige they went with a color.  To me it was a nice touch.  

What we found really funny, but in an odd way kinda nice.  Linda brought our check WAY before we were even served.  Now this in no way took away from her attention to us.  She was right there to refill my hot water, and even came back to have a little personable chat.  

Breakfast was served.  It&#39;s been a long time since I have had B&amp;G and it was oh so good.  The biscuits were enormous and great quality.  They were grilled before had to give them a nice crisp top and a little extra flavor.  The gravy was not overly salted as you find in a lot of places.  It was a great consistency, not to thin and not to thick..  For me it was just right.  The hash browns were awesome as well, not overly cooked but crisp and ample in portion size.  

There was so much I had to take half of it home to be enjoyed  later.  

It was a great experience over all, I can&#39;t wait to get back there for lunch."

Even more people swarmed in to the point that they were right up against us at our table.  That part was a little annoying.  People bumping your table and head.  If we were at another table, this wouldn&#39;t have been a problem. The menu isn&#39;t very large, but still looked like it had some great options. The service by Tonya was extremely quick, even though the place was was overwhelmingly busy. She handled it well. The food was good, but I feel like it was a bit overpriced for basic breakfast choices. We will be back again, but hopefully on a day that isn&#39;t busy."

- 1/2 size options on pretty much all entrees.
- can get blueberry or other varied &#34;cakes&#34; at same price as regular.
- speaking of cakes, you only need one. platter size ridiculousness,  trust me on this one.
-fries and hashbrowns real deal, fresh, not fake, battered, none of that.
- green chili does not have pork for all you &#34;kosher style&#34; eaters such as myself

Con:
- coffee is weak as hell. been here twice now and sorely disappointed each time. food will keep me coming back, its that good!"

Doug I believe is the chef and came out to ask how we liked our food.  They have really good breakfast burritos.  I got the &#39;lil billy which was way good.

I had the &#34;Taos&#34; plate which was delicious. I&#39;m a green chile snob who buys it by the bushel (always hold the tomatoes mine please!) and this was excellent. 

Taos plate is a mound of hash brown style potatoes loaded with ground turkey and very tasty chorIzo.  I asked for basted eggs and the waitress wasn&#39;t rattled at all (sometimes this happens when you ordered basted eggs).

Give this place a try!

I met a friend for brunch and our server was very patient and accommodating, recognizing that he wasn&#39;t going to be able to turn our table over quickly. So he mostly let us be. Instead of breakfast, I opted for the spicy Reuben. It came piled with corned beef and I loved the spicy slaw that was on it. It was a really nice combination and, like all of the food here at Doug&#39;s, very filling. Definitely try their homemade chips - they are terrific! The warnings are true: weekends will have you waiting for a seat. Mid-week, though, the place is a bit more laid back so you can enjoy a big, satisfying and leisurely breakfast or lunch.

We are from Albuquerque, and I guess this is the new concept by a guy that started Weck&#39;s down there. Maybe I am holding &#34;Doug&#34; to too high of a standard.  It was not so bad, I am not saying that I would never come back, but it will not be my first choice.

For starters, the service was very bleh.  I accidentally walked down a hallway looking for the bathroom (I had not idea where I was going, so I was kind of gently poking around - not acting like I owned the place).  In return, some server bit my head off.  Our server was not near as rude, but she was not a ray of bright sunshine either.

The food was a huge disappointment.  I had the bowl of Papas.  I liked the way the potatoes are irregularly cut and grated kind of thick.  But, there were some mixed in that were just raw.  The carne asada was huge chunk of meat that was very tough.  I loved their green chile, however, it was fantastic.

This place is situated right in my neighborhood and it&#39;s a mom and pop establishment; right down my alley.

It was a Wednesday morning and there were plenty of tables available. I&#39;ve heard the wait can be long if you go during the weekend. Parking is ample and the restaurant itself was really cute. They had children&#39;s artwork all along the back wall near the kitchen and military signs up along the other walls.

I&#39;ve heard their burgers are great, but I was there pretty early in the day, so I opted for breakfast instead. I order the Pavo omelette (ground turkey sausage, bell peppers, pesto and cheese) and subbed for egg whites with a side of browns extra crispy and the griddle biscuit with strawberry jam. One of my friends told me that the grandma of the owner comes in once a year and makes all the jam for the restaurant for the entire year. I can&#39;t confirm or deny that. BUT, I will say that my jam was DELICIOUS.

The omelette was fluffy and full of delicious fillings and the browns were great (but who can mess up hash browns?). The star of my plate however was the griddle biscuit. It was huge, buttery and soft. I would highly recommend adding this to your plate if you go.

One of my friends ordered the biscuits and gravy. I have to say, the gravy is very robust and flavorful. Another friend bought a side of regular pancakes. The pancake was enormous for a single serving. With the butter and syrup, I kid you not, it tasted like a Krispy Kreme doughnut.

My only gripe about this place was our waitress. It was hard to read her. While she was attentive and very helpful, she didn&#39;t really seem like she wanted to be there and was a little short with us (or that&#39;s what it seemed like) at times. 

Overall, this place is definitely a hidden gem. I plan on going back for more."

The service was excellent, and the coffee kept coming! Here is why you should go:
* Locally sourced ingredients. This makes a world of difference to the quality.
* Handmade, from scratch...everything! The biscuits are made, then put on the griddle to crust up...mix that with gravy, eggs, bacon and hash browns, and it&#39;s heaven on a plate! Don&#39;t like gravy on your biscuits? Try the jam...it is made by the owners mom! Yea...you gotta try that, right!
This location is in Aurora, but he is opening like 3 more all around. If you see one, go in...Don&#39;t think, just go in. Even if you are not hungry, go in...Get something, eat what you can, and take the rest home. It is your moral imperative!

I&#39;d been to the FoCo location a number of times so I my expectations were high.  After a very short wait for our counter table for two (Hey, I&#39;m hungry - the counter holds a plate just as well as a table) was ready and our waitress made us feel welcome right away.  Yes she came with a side of sass as Doug&#39;s promises.

I went for the big dish - the Hill Billy.  It comes with three eggs or bacon or sausage and I wish I had chosen the bacon.  Three eggs cooked anyway you want is a lot of egg.  The bacon is so thick and apple-woody and savory it&#39;s kind of like having a small religious experience. 

My friend had the simple biscuits and gravy dish (which along with most of their dishes is really large enough for two breakfasts) and she enjoyed it.  Everything was fresh and the service was great - never had an empty glass and there was no waiting on ceremony for our check - it came before our food did!  Hey, they have to turn tables pretty quickly during their rushes, it&#39;s how they stay in business and let us order more B&amp;G.  Like tomorrow."

The staff was nice, unfortunately the food was not good at all.  I ordered an omelette with bacon and spinach.  It was the worst omelette I have ever had.  The eggs were cooked and literally folded over raw fresh spinach and very overcooked bacon.  The spinach was not cooked one bit and the bacon was so hard it literally felt like it was going to break my teeth. I ate the spinach and left the rest.  The biscuit had an unusual greasy taste.  The pinto beans were delicious.  My husband and 14 year old both left a lot of of their breakfast on their plates (very unusual for two foodies).  We agreed that we would never return.  Too bad because the staff was great (and the reason for the two stars).  Definitely not worth a 20 minute wait."

Doug must be from New Mexico cause that is exactly why my hubby brought me here. He is from NM and this place is just like home to him. They proudly sport the &#34;Christmas tree&#34; that is 1/2 green chili and 1/2 red chili atop a pile of potatoes or papas.

If it is your first time you gotta try the papas but be warned it is a big portion. The chili either one (red or green) are hot. Meaning Doug is from NM and New Mexico Mexicans don&#39;t eat their chili like us Denver Mexicans (we like it really hot). But don&#39;t let that stop you from eating here their chili tastes darn good unlike most of these restaurants (i.e. The Rock) who have no business selling chili. 

We are so happy Doug opened up in our neck of the woods, now we just need some place to start selling really good HOT chili and Centennial will be a fun place to live. 

You gotta try Doug&#39;s it is really good. But I do have one serious complaint. His password to the wifi is the GBPackers??? WHAT??? This is a reminder to you Doug -- THIS IS BRONCO COUNTRY (I won&#39;t tell my hubby what you have done). Just change it.... Name your password something like, &#34;Radierhater&#34; that is pretty neutral. 

Thanks for all the good eat&#39;s Doug&#39;s!"

Came in on a Friday night and had to wait about 30 mins for a table which wasn&#39;t bad, we just ordered some drinks and took a seat in the waiting area.

Since crawfish isn&#39;t in season right now, We ordered 4 snow crab clusters, a dozen oysters, wings, Cajun fries and a lb of shrimp. For the crab I had one cluster steamed, and the other 3 we went with their garlic butter flavor- level of spice was hot. We also did the same flavor for the shrimp. The oysters were delicious, fresh and big. Fries were perfectly fried and crispy, as well as the wings. The crab legs were okay, I felt like they may have been a little overlooked as the lags were super soft when broken in half, making it a little difficult to get some meat out. The flavoring was great though.

Service is phenomenal. Everyone is super nice and attentive."

A conference had just ended and we were hungry for some good food.  Several locals pointed us to the Yabby Hut, so 20+ of us headed over around 1PM on a Sunday.  The staff was very accommodating with our large party that seemed to grow with every minute, but we were all finally seated after 20 minutes.  4 of us had a flight to catch in a few hours, so we informed the waiter taking our orders that we would like our checks to arrive with the food.  

I got an order Cajun Fries to share with some friends and we quickly inhaled that basket! Great flavors and fried to a perfect crisp.  My friend ordered the Fried Calamari to share, which was actually really tasty and cooked well.  We also ordered the wings to share and they were pretty good, but nothing special.  

I got a pound of snow crab legs with the Garlic Butter seasoning at mild spice level with corn and potato.  The food all arrived quickly in giant pots and the server distributed the bags accordingly.  We all shook up our bags, flipped them over, and tore them open to maximize flavors.  I asked for some lemon wedges, which arrived quickly and plentiful.  Our side of the restaurant fell into silence, as we focused on eating the delicious foods.  My friends ordered a pound of the baby clams, a pound of the fresh crayfish, and a pound of shrimp.  All were ordered with the Garlic Butter seasoning due to raving reviews from friends and we were all glad we listened to them.  Everything was cooked to perfect tenderness and the mild level was just perfect for me.  We ran off to attempt to catch our flights, but sadly just couldn&#39;t make it.  Our bellies weren&#39;t sad though.  

Although it was the first flight I have ever missed, I had no regrets for eating at The Yabby Hut.  I salivate remembering how good the food was and can&#39;t wait to return."

Ordered the sampler app with calamari, shrimp and fish basket. Calamari was a bit overdone but the fish and shrimp were amazing. 

Do NOT order the clam chowder. It&#39;s greasy slop. Worst I&#39;ve ever had. 

We also ordered the lobster boil, novice heat, yabby Cajun spice and added sausage. The spice was good, the sausage was ok, the lobster was not cooked well. It was mealy and stringy. Curious about the crab but not sure that we will be back.

Service was rather lacking, which didn&#39;t help. Neither of us ate the clam chowder which went unnoticed by staff the two times he stopped by. Even when we mentioned it wasn&#39;t good. He did ask how the lobster was but didn&#39;t question our &#34;ok&#34; response and just said good and walked away."

I really love cajun food and crawfish boils, but Yabby Hut just didn&#39;t live up to the expectation I had of it based on all of these other great reviews. 

After living a while in South Texas, I&#39;ve become really accustomed to awesome seafood boils with bomb seasoning. But, the seasoning definitely didn&#39;t compare to anything I&#39;ve had in Texas. I had garlic butter clams and Yabby cajun crawfish. The garlic butter was really salty. After one bite, I had to take a big swig of water. I was not prepared for that. The cajun seasoning didn&#39;t really have that wow factor you get when eating cajun food. I was thoroughly disappointed. In terms of seafood quality, the clams were alright. I know it was a little earlier in the season to get huge crawfish, so the size of our crawfish varied from small to medium. 

Along with the clams and crawfish, I also ordered a large gumbo. I was kind of sad that the gumbo wasn&#39;t very hearty. In fact, it was very liquidy. Also, there wasn&#39;t a lot of ingredient within the gumbo itself. Just sparse amounts of rice, sausage, and veggie. 

Like I said, I am a little but disappointed with Yabby Hut. Maybe I wil try it again one day in the future."

I enjoyed the ordering experience where I got to pick the seafood I wanted, the spice profile, and the level of heat. I chose the shrimp and snow crab legs with Cajun spice at a medium heat and added 3 corn on the cob and one potato to my boil. It came out in a bag where I then spilled it out onto the table and dug in. There are no plates but they do provide shell cracking instruments, plenty of napkins, and the shrimp has the head and shell in place, as it should be in this type of restaurant.  I really liked this experience and I will return.
  I recommend making a reservation if you can. They will allow a reservation for 6 persons or more and I&#39;m glad we did as it became packed pretty quickly."

Come here for an experience! It&#39;s so much fun to dig in and get soooo messy all over your hands!

One tip: order a couple things at a time so you keep having really hot food as you go. However, even though we didn&#39;t think of this, we still loved every bite. 

Only very small complaint was the coleslaw. It&#39;s really not good. No vinegar in the sauce-tasted like straight mayo.

I didn&#39;t see it, so I tipped twice for really,  REALLY shitty service.  My fault for not checking my bill I guess,  but it annoyed me to the point I will probably not return.

Buffalo cajun wings were addictive and tender with just the right amount of kick. I took a pass on the crawfish but they looked and smelled good (for crawfish)! Fried calamari was decent, albeit a bit chewy.

I wish I&#39;d researched this a little better before I went. I saw that it was listed as a Cajun/Creole restaurant with several stars, and forge ahead.

First, a few of the other reviews here talk about the crawfish boil as being pretty unique, like &#34;where else in Denver can you get this?&#34; Well, it turns out there are several other places that do the same thing. So it&#39;s not really unique. Second, it&#39;s not really very good Cajun or Creole food.

Not being in the mood to get messy, I started with a cup of gumbo. I&#39;d been in the mood for some good gumbo for a while. I&#39;m still in the mood for some good gumbo. The Yabby Hut has it on the menu, but theirs didn&#39;t have a very good roux, was missing rice, and had so few crawfish I felt maybe it was just a big mistake. I ended up going with the shrimp and chips basket after that. It was decent, but nothing to write home about.

Lastly, the decor is pretty low brow. Drinks from soda fountains, plastic forks and spoons, disposable everything. On the plus side, my Abita beer was cold.

My advice: If you&#39;re really in the mood for good Cajun/Creole food, take the extra time to drive downtown to Bayou Bob&#39;s."

The food is great. We are a land locked state and the seafood here tastes fresh and clean. I&#39;d put the quality of shellfish here up against any place in CO unless you&#39;re eating at a prime five star restaurant that is serving a lobster tail bigger than a porterhouse. 

I&#39;ve lived on the east and west coast and I can tell you this place is as good as it gets in CO. I&#39;ve had worse shellfish eating on a pier in CA. 

If you like shellfish and as much as you are willing to pay for it, this is the place for you.  Good quality food at a decent price. 

It is a messy dinner. Just look at the photos and you&#39;ll get an idea. It&#39;s also fun. Shell fish is never a clean experience.

I can only personally speak for the Cajon seasoning. I haven&#39;t tried any other. I think it is great though. My only complaint is the oil. I use about 10 paper towels to suck it all up before I dig in. Aside from that. This place is great."

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect after some of the reviews said its a creole place. While they definitely have some Cajun and crawfish, not sure I&#39;d label it as creole. I will however label as I am coming back very soon!! 

I love places like this and they do what they do well. I went alone to eat as I do a lot for work and there are some places I usually don&#39;t go to just because eating alone can sometimes be awkward for some atmospheres. I thought this was going to be one as places like this are usually a novelty for get togethers and its more of an experience. 

I was seated and got my snazzy little plastic bib!! I ordered the lobster with medium heat for the Cajun, I also had a few blue crabs same seasoning and heat level. It was just the right amount of heat, I may kick it up a notch and go a little hotter next time. I will say for the price you get a decent amount of food. 

I love a place that hands you a bag with your food in it, and you are encouraged to make a mess and use your hands. The one thing that for me was a little disappointing ( and this is just me being a chef) they cut my tail and claws on the lobster, I&#39;d rather just give me the cracker and go away so I can have some fun. I&#39;m sure most appreciate it, and it is a nice jesters but next time I will ask for them to not put the cut marks.

A mallet would also be nice for the crabs!! 

The menu looks like it has some other decent stuff for those that cant handle making a mess and using hands but where&#39;s the fun!!

See you soon Yabby Hut!!"

So my girlfriend and I thought we would it The Yappy Hut up after she heard about it from a co-worker. I had been to a crawfish boil back home however had never experienced it in a dining situation. 
We started off with some oysters on the half shell... They were surprisingly delicious. I saw that one day they have a pretty big discount on them so I will be taking full advantage.
I got a pound of crawfish as she got 2 pounds of soft grab. Both in the hot Yappy sauce because we&#39;re both fans of spicy food.
The sauce was definitely hotter than expected. Fingers were burning, nose was running etc. It was tasty though. And pretty fun getting to go eat and be a filthy mess and nobody can judge you. However I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend for a first date.. Or even a second. Wait until your married and can have no shame for eating like an animal. Haha
The experience all around was great.. Minus one though. THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL. Our waiter just hung out over by the bar area talking sports. The only times he would come over to our table is when we had to go out of our way to find an employee that could go get him. It happened more than once and was pretty annoying. Had he been more attentive I probably would have been able to give them 5 stars. 
We will be back, however don&#39;t expect good service."

No &#34;Tony Chacheres&#34;, no &#34;Slap Ya Mama&#34; very little spice - resembled a Northern Chinese version of a Cajun restaurant without ever having been to an actual place and it was something pulled out of a comic book.

But management and operations in general are horrible. Specifically they hold large groups of tables for reservations many hours later on he evening. The waiting room spills over looking forlornly at the unused tables. Waits get absurd for the few remaining tables. Horrible operations. 

I&#39;ve seen 12 and 18 tops prepared and held MANY hours in advance of their parties. They could sit half of the table and merge it later.

Went in on a week night so it was pretty slow. Server was quick with drinks and taking our order. the food is served on paper trays or plastics bags but don&#39;t let the informal &#34;plating&#34; fool you, the food is great! Great texture and consistency of the shrimp and crab, firm and plump and not over cooked, thank god. They offer a variety of sauces that they should package to take home and so you can bath with them.

Our second visit was on a Saturday right at the dinner time, 6pm and the place was packed, we left only because we had somewhere to be later that night. I hope they can continue the good service and food through the rushes, we&#39;ll be back again on a weekday evening for sure."

I&#39;ve been to boiling crab in California and I have to say... Yabby hut has definitely got them on flavor. I could eat here everyday! They have a very select menu which is so smart because they mastered and perfected every single dish.

Their signature sauce is to die for! Shrimp
Cooked well-- not over cooked but succulent and juicy and it goes so well with their fried rice. If you need a seafood fix, this is definitely the place to go. I lived in jersey and Massachusetts by the ocean and man, this place is at par with any seaside resto. Definitely a place to visit!!!"

We remember visiting the restaurant when it just opened and was still finding it&#39;s stride.  Restaurant was empty but the food was awesome.  Compare that to today when the place is packed wall to wall and wait time is 30 minutes or longer.  Glad to see business is good.

My primary complaint is their crawfish are really small, regardless if it is available fresh or not.  My son took us to the Asian Cajun, and their crawfish are significantly larger and quite sweet.  Yabby&#39;s are so small, the tail meat is nearly destroyed by the time you peel the shell off.  We also had the baby clams in Yabby Cajun...so good but their were a lot of closed shells. Oysters on the half shell....awesome!

Finally, perhaps an off night...we ordered Snow Crab clusters and apparently not one cracker was available in the entire restaurant.  Makes eating crab a little more challenging.  Better go in with a good dental plan.  3 stars for my review this evening but would normally give them a 4."

All of it was excellent. Our server was prompt and she did a very good job.

Eating here is messy. Don&#39;t be fooled! You cannot leave without our something dripping on you even if you wear the bib and are very careful.  

The prices were very reasonable and for a very casual dining experience this place is a lot of fun! 

I wish management didn&#39;t add an automatic 18% gratuity and not leave a space to include more on the receipt. We felt our server deserved more but unless we left cash, we couldn&#39;t include more in the bill. Please make room for additional tips if deserved."

To start with the service was deplorable. There was a group that walked in at the same time as us &amp; nothing was said to us as they were seated. 5 mins later still nothing. Then they sit us right next to said group by the window. Immediately a server came rushing over (clearly flustered) &amp; asked us to move. To the VERY back of the restaurant. Next to the restroom, kitchen traffic, &amp; screaming infant. Then she argued with my request to sit at a different table. 3 times.

Upon looking at the menu we realize they have no Andouille. Kielbasa?! And you have the audacity to call yourself cajun!

Orders:
Appetizer: half a dozen oysters
Him: 2 lbs. Crawfish &amp; dungeness crab (they were out of blue crab on Sunday) which came with corn &amp; potato 
Her: large gumbo &amp; 1 lb crawfish

Oysters- we didn&#39;t  have any napkins or saltines when they sat them on the table. Had to ask for Tobasco, crackers, salt. The sauce didn&#39;t even have horseradish. Was very surprised by the spice level for this area. And they serve the sh!tty Zesta crackers. 

The gumbo was more of a vegetable soup with a spoonfull of seafood. Presented in a stryrofoam cup. No file. Not even saltines.

Meals- We both ordered the Pro spicy. It wasn&#39;t even mild! Upon asking our server she offered to take it back into the kitchen to add the XXX sauce. She actually wanted us to pick up the oily crawfish &amp; place it back in the bag &amp; couldn&#39;t offer any explanation as to what they would do to it once it got back there...

Huge Red Flag: Our server was extremely apologetic &amp; exclaimed &#34;I don&#39;t know what they do to it/what&#39;s in the seasoning. I&#39;ve worked here 4 years &amp; we aren&#39;t  allowed in the kitchen.&#34; 

BRAKES! I stopped eating right then &amp; there. Clearly asian crawfish with inauthentic seasoning. We deduced that they preboiled the seafood in plain water (rendering if dry &amp; tasteless) then reheat as ordered in a coating of oil. 

She offered to bring out the XXX sauce. It&#39;s Chipotle. There&#39;s nothing Cajun about it!

The corn &amp; potato were merely steamed or boiled. No seasoning what so ever. I got an extra order &amp; after tasting my beau&#39;s I sent it back. 

Wanted to be a regular since we just moved nearby but I will NEVER eat here again. This establishment is a disgrace to true Louisiana cusine."

Although they are known for their crawfish, I tend to go for their shrimp, clams, and crabs most of the time as they are just easier to eat and tasty as well. Love the Yabby Hut cajun seasoning as well as the garlic butter seasoning, although I really can&#39;t tell the difference between the two. 

The reason I&#39;m giving it 3 stars, however, is the service. We arrived on a Friday night, which was extremely packed, but upon entering the door, weren&#39;t able to put our name on the wait list until 20 min later. They were so understaffed that the hostess at the front was seating people and putting people&#39;s names down. When she finally had time to attend to us, who were first in line, she completely looked over us and addressed the people behind us, thinking that we were already on the list. This just shows the lack of attention and detail due to the busyness of the restaurant. After our name was on the list, we had to wait another 45 min for a table of 3. There are a couple things they do well...the waiter we had was nice and many of their staff volunteer to tie the bibs around you. However, again, because of their volume, we were never asked whether or not we wanted refills for our drinks, which is disappointing. 

I will probably still come back to Yabby Hut from time to time because of their unique cuisine and dining style, but don&#39;t expect great service."

1lb Snow Crab - Garlic Butter 
1lb Clams - Yabby Cajun
1lb Shrimp - Yabby Cajun
Spicy Cajun Fries
We went with HOT on all of the items, PERFECT.  It wasn&#39;t lacking in spice, nor was it overpowering. I enjoyed both of the seasonings but I LOVED the garlic butter. Great service. I like lemon, pepper and salt on the side and they bring a generous amount!  Fries were also delicious since they were actually spicy, as stated. They have a board of the prices since they&#39;re not listed in the menu because of market price.  I guess you would have to call ahead to be sure you&#39;re not going over your budget!

My first time at a seafood place that dumps the food on the table. We had crawfish, shrimp (which we got seconds on), blue crab (hard to eat but tasty none the less), potatoes, corn, sausage, fried rice and steamed rice (which comes with the shrimp). 

It was all amazing! And enough to fill three people. The shrimp was the easiest tonnage, and had the most meat (so sweet). I recommend ordering this if you order nothing else. The blue crab was lovely, but like I said a little hard to get to the meat. The crayfish was fun to crack and even better to eat. We got everything doused in Cajun spices at medium heat. A perfect spice level to enjoy the taste of the food and still have a kick.

If you like football or any sport i guess they have TVs all over the place.

Our waiter was a really nice guy too. So friendly and helpful with advice.

When we find ourselves back in the area we&#39;ll be hitting this place up again. Hope that&#39;s soon. :-)"

A little skiddish of the reviews on the staff, but hey....they were busy taking care of everyone!  jeez give em a break already...for the amount of work they were doing.

With repeat visits,  soon learned that there are well prepared hard core patrons armed with disposable gloves ready to devour.  Its necessity when you are handling all these spicy sea foods steaming hot served in clear bags.   

Most of the seafood is market price. There isn&#39;t much in pound of blue crabs so order alot. My favorites are the addition of the potatoes and corn to my meal.
Fried calamari needs lot of improvement. 

Im finding out that recent wave of immigrants to the south is incorporating there spice into local dishes making hot waves everywhere.   Its finger linking good.

Chicken wings are good.. they&#39;re flavorful but could be a bit more crispy. Fried rice was nothing special. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish in the Cajun sauce.

If it wasn&#39;t for the poor service, I would have given The Yabby Hut a higher rating.

I looked around and soon realized most of the wait staff had the same attitude. 

The food itself was delicious! It was my first time to dine at a place like this, and I rather enjoyed the experience of eating out of bags on top of butcher paper. We ordered the oysters and crawfish. Everything tasted great and the prices were affordable. Unfortunately, the poor customer service will probably turn me off from going there again, especially since I just tried the Crawling Crab today, and it was basically the same place, except actual, friendly staff."

My friend &amp; I drove out here from downtown Denver b/c the place had crawfish &amp; seemed like a good place to get cajun seafood. It&#39;s a small spot in a strip mall just off Wads &amp; Hampden. 

The trip here didn&#39;t start off so great.  We walked in &amp; it was pretty busy, and saw two servers just standing in the back at what appeared to be a drink/work station.  It didn&#39;t seem like there was anyone actually in charge working. 

We were seated relatively quickly, but then no one acknowledged us for well over 5 minutes. The two servers that appeared to be working didn&#39;t come by; one was not moving around much, and if at all, moved about at a turtles pace, and seemed to be able to handle one small task at a time. As I mentioned, the place was pretty much full, and yet a server found time to stand around (even if it isn&#39;t your section, you shouldn&#39;t let customers sit unattended!!). I tried to make eye contact but it was like the two servers were deliberately only focused on standing or taking care of their specific tables. 

I finally had to literally wave someone down to come to our table and the response wasn&#39;t very friendly or warm and it seemed more like I was being a bother. Trust me, I didn&#39;t want to have to be waving from the lonely table island to get service either. The initial attitude of this person was almost enough to make us leave after having sat there for so long without service. 

It was acknowledged quite indifferently that this person wasn&#39;t our server but would get them.  This person meandered away, but did actually come back to get our order started &amp; to answer questions about the menu which was surprising from the lack of concern presented at first. 

Once our actual server came out, he was very nice and attentive. Shame it took so long for him to finally wait on us. He came out several times along our dinner to check on our food and drinks and was very attentive...complete opposite of our experience to start. So from the time we sat down, it was about 10 minutes before we had drinks and our order in. 

We had the crawfish cajun medium &amp; added in the sausage &amp; potato, shrimp by itself, some oysters and gumbo. My friend said the gumbo was really good &amp; she is used to legit southern style gumbo. The crawfish were a little on the smaller side with a few decent sized ones in the mix. The season was good, and the sausage was spicy and great.  The shrimp was pretty good, but with the cajun seasoning it was really oily (?). I probably would have preferred the shrimp not to have come with the heads on.  The oysters were great. The prices were pretty decent too. 

So overall the food was decent. The inside has a nice atmosphere, &amp; people ring a bell on the way out &amp; shout &#34;Yabby!&#34; (just so you are prepared to participate with what the locals do!). It&#39;s pretty no frills in that you don&#39;t get plates or napkins.  You belly up to the table with butcher&#39;s paper on it for your &#34;plate&#34;, along with a roll of paper towels, paper cups for drinks, and plastic ware. You can get a bib if you&#39;d like. 

Overall, I can&#39;t say I will go out of my way to come up to this place often."

Before driving to Lakewood, we called them to see if they were busy. They told us if we come now, it will be a 30 minute wait. So we rushed to our cars and drove to the restaurant that was fully packed with way more than 30 minutes wait worth. We told the host that we wanted out name on the list and he told us it would be a 25-30 minutes wait. We patiently waited and 45 minute passed by. We asked the host how much longer we have to wait and he said 20-25 minutes. Boy, was he wrong. We waited additional 60 minutes with the total of 1.45 hours. 

Now the question becomes, was it worth the wait?
While we were waiting, they ran out of &#34;fresh crawfish&#34; and we had to settle for the &#34;frozen crawfish.&#34; I don&#39;t know how big the difference there is in taste since I haven&#39;t had their fresh ones but all in all, the taste was good. We had the Crawfish, Fresh Dungeness Crab, Baby Clams, Shrimp, Corn Cob, and Cajun Fried Rice (with Yabby Cajun Sauce). Everything was good but the Baby Clams were a bit salty and everything seemed to get salty once it got cold. However, it was very flavorful and yummy when it was hot, especially the corn cob! A tip I would give is getting a neutral sides like fried rice to help neutralize your palate.

Ambiance: very casual; Staff: friendly but the host seems to be a young boy who is lost (low in staff perhaps?); Decor: very shack-like; Taste: a little salty when it got cold but yummy when it was hot :)"

The restaurant is a hidden gem in an otherwise typical strip mall style area. However, it&#39;s no longer a secret. The restaurant gets VERY busy on weekends during the evenings. If you don&#39;t want to wait 1 hour+ for a table, call ahead before you leave to let them know you&#39;re coming. You&#39;ll be able to get your name on the list before you even step foot in the restaurant.

The service here is excellent; everyone on the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. But really, it&#39;s the food that keeps everyone coming back and bringing their friends. The spice level here is also not shy. I love my spicy foods and the XXX really packs a punch.

What do I order when I come here you ask?
I always start my meal with either the cajun fries, sweet potato fries, or both! They come out piping hot and super crunchy. If you like sweet and spicy, mix a little Tabasco in with your ketchup and get your tastebuds ready for the entree round.

Crawfish with the Yabby Cajun seasoning is a must when I order. It&#39;s wise to call ahead and ask if the crawfish is fresh or frozen. This all depends on the season. I always ask for some lemon and pepper to make a little extra dipping sauce on the side. The shrimp is also very good. With less shell and more meat, you&#39;re definitely getting more for your money. Just be aware that the shrimps come with the heads and shells on. I prefer the shrimp in the garlic butter seasoning. A great bonus with the shrimp is that it comes with a small serving of rice. *Just a little tip: flavor your rice with a few scoops of the sauce from your crawfish or shrimp bag and add a little of the lemon pepper sauce.

For the novice crawfish eater, the head has the most flavor! It&#39;s a little intimidating, but if you can get over your initial fears, your life will be changed. Just bite and suck on the crawfish head, sounds gross, but trust me.

If you&#39;re not in the mood to peel crawfish or shrimp, order the clams!

The only reason why I dock this place a star is because I&#39;ve noticed it takes them a little longer to bus and turnover tables, which is especially frustrating during busy times. I get hangry (yes, I meant hANGRY) and my patience runs thin. Other than that, once I&#39;m seated, everything is EXCELLENT."

I asked him if he could bring me out any other sort of Cajun dipping seasoning or sauce and again he looked at me like I wanted to take over the place and start my own crawfish place...

We recently went back with a party of four and had a very different experience. The place itself is still cute, especially if you don&#39;t mind communal tables. They also still had the patio going, even though it was mid-November, with some gigantic heat radiators under a giant canopy.

Service was poor. Drinks arrived after the first course. I wanted a gin fizz, and the server suggesting something &#34;very similar&#34; that was off-menu but offered during happy hour. It was nothing remotely like a gin fizz. I haven&#39;t sent a drink back in years, but I did--and they still put it on the check. A few of the cocktails were good, but even the quality control seemed poor; the second round was not on par with the first.

Food was small-plate style; 50% hits and 50% misses. Both meat dishes, a short rib and mussels, were misses. The mussels were tiny and dry (if it isn&#39;t the right time of year, don&#39;t put them on the menu). The short rib was too fatty, served in a soupy sauce that I don&#39;t think was supposed to be soupy.

Vegetarian dishes were better. The ricotta/stone-fruit concoction was excellent -- except that it was supposed to come with pancetta, which was left off from BOTH orders. We mentioned it the second time, and they brought us the meat in a little side dish.

Smores desert was fun. The apple cobbler was average at best. 

Try it out, but maybe on a weekday. The place was packed to the gills (including the patio), and my sense is that the kitchen and wait staff just couldn&#39;t keep up."

She tried hard to find a good beer for one of us, kept the rest of us filled with the bottomless mimosas we came here for.  These are offered in two varieties, OJ and grapefruit juice.  She allowed us to switch it up and the grapefruit is worth trying, I stuck with that for the rest of the morning.

I was very excited about the waffle sandwich.  House made sausage between a rosemary waffle, and for a side I was very happy to have the choice of a kale salad since the main dish was pretty heavy.  Had I not been craving waffles for some time I would have gone with the ramen, which a couple others ordered and liked very much.  

Overall this is great spot, good neighborhood, cozy and excellent food and service based on our first excursion.  I will certainly come back."

We ordered bottomless mimosas (of course) and set in to studying the menu. Once the mimosas were delivered these crazy little gnats arrived. They dive bombed our drinks and died swimming happily in the loving embrace of champagne and orange juice. Our server saw what was happening and quickly brought all of us coasters to cover our drinks with. I&#39;m not good at sharing my mimosas especially with a little critter so I was very thankful.
I had the omelet of the day which was filled with goat cheese, parmesean cheese and scallions. I had a kale salad on the side. Both were pretty darn good. The omelet was a smudge smaller than what I would make at home. Not a bad thing but would have been better paired with potatoes rather than a salad for the filling of the belly.
Jeff had the waffle sandwich. Not gonna lie, I had food envy (yep, stile a couple bites). He seemed pretty darn pleased with it. 
A couple of the folks ordered ramen. This looked delicious and a great idea for Sunday brunch. Since I was not married to said ramen people I didn&#39;t feel like I could steal bites. But they seemed to like it alot. 
I plan to go back sometime so I can try the ramen!"

The place is teensy and during the day, sundrenched.  We came to an empty restaurant at 11:30 and were offered hightop bar seating, repeatedly and then seating in direct sunlight at teeny two tops.  We finally, after much negotiation, got a &#34;regular table&#34;, a 4-top, that clearly stressed out the hostess.  It is obvious from this experience and reading other reviews, that seating is VERY VERY VERY limited, and even at lunch the space still felt tight.  This is good news though- the food is yummy and they can expand into a bigger space some day, right?

On to the food.  My buddy ordered the mixed greens salad with chicken, and they were out so offered to substitute it for DUCK.  WOW!!  Lunch just got fancy!  I ordered the chicken and waffles- the chicken was served crispy confit style and the waffle had been cooked with peppers and cheese and was yummy.

This was a very nice dining experience.  We would love to come back and try a &#34;PUNCH BOWL&#34; drink, about a gallon of rum concoction lit on fire that is to be shared.  A little hipster couple in the back was sharing that for lunch...at 11...on Tuesday.  Maybe one day!  I have a feeling that dinner time will be too much for me here- too small, too tight, but maybe one day I will get that punch bowl!"

My fiance and I went there for my birthday dinner back in May; we made reservations but were running a bit late (definitely birthday girl&#39;s fault--whoops!) so I called to see if they could hold our table. Not knowing if they would  or not, I casually mentioned that I hoped so because it was my bday dinner and we were looking forward to having it there. They said it wasn&#39;t a problem. 

Fast forward to our arrival--friendly service, cozy ambiance, entertaining view of the open kitchen, and an all around genuine vibe. Then, THE FOOD. So. Much. Yum.  We had oysters, meatballs, the bass, hangar steak and more. The menu&#39;s changed since, but there was a seasonal salad, a morel dish, and a few others that I can&#39;t recall. Literally every single thing was amazing. And, to top it off, they brought over two glasses of champagne, on the house, as a &#34;happy birthday&#34;. My fiance hadn&#39;t even mentioned it when he originally made the reservation, but they remembered from my call! Classy touch and much appreciated. 

They also have a cute looking patio and bottomless brunch that I can&#39;t wait to try next! Keep doing you, Telegraph."

Started with their &#34;make a reservation&#34; application on their website not working - good thing I called to make sure they had our reservation - they didn&#39;t.  But, they took it over the phone.  

Show up on time (parked in a loading zone but generally parking in the area is a problem - not even a handicapped space for my friend who has mobility issues) and we&#39;re offered the chef&#39;s counter sitting on high top bar stools (no way she could that) or a tiny table in the empty bar.  Ummm - no.  If that&#39;s the best you can do - don&#39;t take the  reservation.  To me a reservation means a real table in the dining room.  Hostess says, &#34;Well that&#39;s what&#39;s available&#34;.  Zero stars.  We turn around and walk out and head towards Bittersweet but she chases us down and guess what?  There is a table after all.  We should have kept walking because things didn&#39;t improve.  

Finally settled into a tiny deuce (the tables are way too small considering the sharing nature of the menu).  Try and get three &#34;small plates&#34; on the table at once - and those itty bitty water glasses are ridiculous.  Waiter was totally unkempt - what&#39;s with wait staff (and management for that matter) these days looking like they just rolled out of bed?

Drinks:  We both had the Squirrel Fight - Gin, Aperol, St. Germain, Lemon Juice - delish - their beverage program gets a star.

So the food:  Ceviche - meh.  Raw halibut in mayo with some crispy tortilla rounds.  Edible but not really what I&#39;d consider ceviche and not something I&#39;d order again.  Charcuterie board - best thing of the night - good prosciutto and salami, candied pecans, very good liver mousse.  Asparagus salad - yawn - nothing special going on here.  We should have called it a night but the waiter did an enthusiastic description of a very expensive rib eye special - ordered the 20 oz. med. rare to share.  Arrived very well done.  Boo.  The manager (owner?) knew it was wrong and comped dessert.  Skip the s&#39;mores - it&#39;s a &#34;do it yourself project&#34; which sounds like more fun than it is.  One star for trying to make things right.

The payment process with the handheld card reader and the waiter standing there explaining how to leave him his tip is beyond awkward.  I&#39;d be much more forgiving if the check hadn&#39;t been over $150.  My gracious hostess summed the evening up with a departing comment - &#34;Well, we can cross this place off the list&#34;.  Agreed.

Edit to say:  They changed chefs shortly after this visit (smart) and the owner said in a Westword article that he was listening and was working with the new chef on a more neighborhood friendly menu so I&#39;ve been checking the website for a menu update regularly.  Reviewed it recently and still find it pretentious for the neighborhood.  Here are a few menu excerpts:  fried egg emulsion, jewel tomato, cumin-lime vin, ramp cream, nasturtium, tobiko vin, black garlic vin.  I consider myself to be a pretty well informed diner and I find these types of menu descriptions to be not very helpful in a &#34;neighborhood&#34; restaurant and pretentiousness epitomized. Tone it down and call it what it is - not trendy food-speak.  Oh, and the new menu lists a chicken at - wait for it - $55.  For a chicken?  Hardly what I&#39;d call neighborhood friendly unless you live in Hollywood - lol."

The hostess was extremely rude from the moment we walked into the restaurant.   We did not care for their limited menu and the seating by the open kitchen was hot and uncomfortable.   

We were so taken back by the rude treatment by the hostess, that we excused ourselves before ordering and left.  We will not be going back.  

We went up a block instead to Pete&#39;s Central and the service was outstanding.  We were greeted at the door and wait staff was attentive.   Our dinner was amazing."

We had something come up so we had to rush a bit but we ordered the pork ragu, it was pretty good and the portion will definitely only feed one person and will leave room for dessert. 

The place is a bit confusing because it seems and looks like you should be wearing business casual but the staff are all casual, but the art and tables and settings seem a little more fancy, I don&#39;t know but it worked. 

If you can find parking, come try this out. We need to come back and order more food from this place."

We were there on a weeknight and had no problems getting in. We could have sat outside under the heaters, but we chose to be inside. Noise level was a little higher than expected, but that also meant we were able to converse at a normal volume without being self-conscious about disturbing our fellow patrons.

The hostess and bar staff were so nice about this though and explained this info to us.  We decided to have some cocktails at the bar.

The cocktails were awesome!  I had the ruby slipper which was delicious.  The bar staff was so nice and helpful.  The menu was a little limited for my personal tastes, so we decided to just order an appetizer and then head to another place for full dinner.  We ordered the pork belly which was beautiful in presentation and taste.

Open for just over four months, the corner spot at East Alameda Avenue and South Pennsylvania Street recently taken over by Chris Sargent of Brazen Restaurant in Berkeley, Telegraph Neighborhood Bistro &amp; Bar had been generating a lot of buzz amongst locals and selected for brunch with two Vegetarian friends the meal could not have been better executed, the upscale American cuisine every bit as delicious as it was creative and well priced.

Featuring a talented kitchen with staff having honed their skills at local legends like Linger and Rioja, Telegraph offers several menus that vary from brunch to lunch to dinner and arriving just after 11am to find the two-room space largely empty it was with questions answered and accommodations made that  five items were coursed out casually, coffee refills continuous while share plates were refreshed frequently.

Happy to see old friends, the waiter never once interrupting conversation despite the fact that ordering took time with the meal eventually stretching nearly two-hours, round one featured a daily special of two lightly fried donuts that avoided the trappings of overwhelming sweetness through a combination of peanut butter and cocoa  nibs, the follow-up plate of waffles an absolute steal at just $6 with the candied butternut squash and seeds offering a pleasant back-and-forth with the semi-savory waffle and other toppings that trended expectedly sweet.

Next putting all the crisp and juicy chicken on one side of an elongated pizza topped in pickled onions, chopped fruit, and chervil with a smear of apple butter juxtaposing sharp cheddar beneath a crowning egg, suffice it to say that the omnivorous are benefited greatly in the case of a dish where the balance of sweet and savory is assuredly part of the equation and although my friends not quite as impressed by the flatbread as I was the both beamed about the accommodations made as the kitchen worked feverishly to keep up with a now-packed room.

Going to notable lengths to offer even the housemade marshmallow on only half of the waffle, the vegetarian-friendly mixed greens arrived after a short wait and with conversation still flowing the subtle Asian notes imparted were a fascinating use of Green Goddess with pickled berries and crumbled cornbread, the golden loaves finding even more utility when featured as the custard infused base to Telegraph&#39;s French Toast, the modified plating seeing three slices topped individually with mixed berry jam, sugar crusted pralines and vanilla ice cream with candied bacon on the side.

Truly a memorable brunch, our middle-aged male server clever and quick to make jokes while food runners were equally amusing even as we poked fun at a small misquote when delivering the donuts, Telegraph stands out as a true &#34;Neighborhood&#34; spot with high aspirations and serious kitchen credentials, a rarity in the day of dogmatic menus where Chefs dictate &#34;no modifications or substitutions&#34; as though ego, rather than customer satisfaction, is the name of the game."

The menu was progressive, the plating was eloquent, the food was all flavorful, and the service was appreciated. The interior is a bit dull and the layout a bit choppy, but that didn&#39;t retract from the overall experience.

We had the king trumpet mushrooms, roasted carrot and beet salad, duck two ways, and the tempura bass. All were replete with complimentary ingredients and had a ton of flavor. Our only qualm was that there may have been a bit too much salt on the dishes. The tempura bass was the highlight for sure. A whole bass tempura battered and lightly fried. The accompanying slaw and tobiko vin made this undoubtedly the dish of the night. You have to order this if you go. 

I am glad that service measured up and easily complimented the food. The drinks were quite nice as well. All the pieces added up and made for a great dining experience."

Luckily, Mr. P just so happened to make a reservation in advance.  Here&#39;s the run-down:

Greeting and seating - 2 stars
We had to cram ourselves into the waiting area, which is the first three feet of space inside the front door, with two other parties already waiting.  Once we were finally acknowledged, we waited a couple of minutes more while our table was set up.  We were then walked to one end of a community table.  Mr. P was immediately unhappy but there weren&#39;t any other tables available.  Luckily, the trio at the other end of the table stayed a long time and the four chairs in between our parties remained vacant throughout our meal.

Ambiance - 4 stars
This restaurant is a strange, long and narrow space split in half by he bathrooms and a staircase to the basement level.  Kudos to Telegraph for closing up the staircase and including it with the bathroom hallway (something the previous owner didn&#39;t do).  The bar is at the front and the open kitchen is in the back.  I think the bar itself is too large and takes up too much space in the front area.  Overall, the space is very simply and nicely decorated.  Kudos again for the very best use I&#39;ve seen of those old glass telephone pole insulators as pendant lights above the bar.  Super cute!

Service - 5 stars
Eric was awesome.  He is genuinely friendly, not overbearing, and gave us plenty of time to make our decisions.  We never felt rushed and it seemed like he truly wanted us to be relaxed and happy.

Food - 3 stars
It took us a while to decide whether or not to go with the Restaurant Week deal since Mr. P didn&#39;t want dessert and we thought we might want to share some apps.  I applaud Telegraph&#39;s decision to include almost the entire menu in the RW menu.  Lots of people use the week to try out new places and I don&#39;t think you can really get the feel of a restaurant&#39;s true identity when they offer only a couple of options on the RW menu.  On the other hand, I can see why a restaurant would limit its RW offerings because otherwise the kitchen can get pretty slammed.  Which is what happened this night.

Portions are pretty small so it was a good thing we decided not to share our apps.  I got the Ceviche, which included more aioli than I preferred.  In addition to the hatch aioli (OMG, so good!) and avocado dip on the side, the seafood was tossed in more trumped up mayo sauce.  It was quite flavorful but I would have preferred the traditional seafood in lime juice with the housemade chips and that hatch aioli on the side.  Mr. P got the King Trumpet Mushroom and he was impressed, though it was lacking in mushroom pieces.  Mom got the Roasted Carrot and Beet Salad and she thought it was great.

Entrees were a mixed bag and we were very disappointed that Mom&#39;s salmon came out a good 10 minutes after our plates.  Since I had a clear view of the kitchen, I know it wasn&#39;t left sitting in the window.  Our theory is that it was forgotten until the other two plates were ready.

Mr. P was excited to try the Pork Cheek Ragot but was ultimately underwhelmed.  The fettuccine noodles were wound together so tightly that they were basically just one big fat noodle, and undercooked at that.  He did enjoy the pork portion.  I had the Squid Ink Vermicelli, which mostly just tasted like pasta.  Every once in a while I would get a scallop flavor but the scallops were chopped up so small that I never got that meaty scallop bite.  After it arrived, Mom was very happy with her salmon dish.  Dessert was most definitely the biggest bang for our buck, even though they ran out of the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart that I really wanted.  Instead, we shared the S&#39;mores (portioned for two people on the RW menu) and it was plenty for the three of us (Mr. P changed his mind about dessert, of course).  It was served in a tray with a flame in the center so you could roast your marshmallows and came with delicious housemade graham crackers (the pastry chef&#39;s grandmother&#39;s recipe, how cool is that?), strawberry slices and blueberries, and Hershey bars.  I also got a scoop of refreshing lemon sorbet since our deal included an additional dessert.

Checkout - 1 star
Our server brought over a hand-held credit card machine that was supposed to streamline the payment process but after the lesson in how to use it, it wasn&#39;t working...oh, wait, there it goes.  And then the waiter stood there while we figured in the tip so he could print out a paper receipt to be signed with an ink pen.  What a stupid idea.

Misc. -
-The room is super loud.  I had to yell across the table so my mom could hear me.  Not very fun.
-The child-sized water glasses are just annoying.
-Wine by the glass at $11-$12 is too expensive.
-In general, a bit overpriced for a neighborhood bistro.

Telegraph is a nice concept that I hope will succeed in a location where others have failed.  That patio is simply too beautiful to go to waste."

Telegraph comes in as what Cafe Bar used to be, amazingly prepared, fresh plates. Cocktails are pretty on point, I wish mine was a little boozier. We started off with the  Pâté (liver) spread, and holy shit! They make it in house and it&#39;s ridiculous. Silky, creamy sweet sweet liver, highly recommend. Then we had the ceviche, King trumpet mushroom as our second course, both were very good and well played. For our third course, I did the duck two ways and my lady had the meatballs.  The duck breast was prepared perfectly, the temperature just as I like it, the duck rillette was a little dry but once mixed with this cherry ju it worked. Meatballs were hardy, polenta creamy, preparation was on point. 

We sat in the bar and it was loud as fuck, next time I will definitely make a reso to sit in the main dining room. Service was all in all very good, and will definitely return. I hope telegraph can stick around a lot longer than its predecessors."

That&#39;s kind of how I felt about this place the entire night we were there.  It&#39;s on the same caliber as Old Major, Acorn, and Colt and Grey.  They&#39;re all fine establishments but sometimes they&#39;re hit or miss but one thing is for certain they&#39;re almost always over priced. 

We went there for my fiances birthday last night, which I informed them via our reservation.  The service was pretty awful, not attentive enough, had us waiting way to long to ask for our drink orders.  Once we did order the plates came out fast and pretty regularly. However, they (either the waiter, he claims it was the pantry chef) forgot our oysters and weren&#39;t given to us UNTIL AFTER WE HAD FINISHED EVERYTHING ELSE.  As if to rub salt into the wound, the oysters were $3 and $3.5 each for the smallest dirt filled oysters I&#39;ve ever had.  They were in fact the size of nickles.  

The plates themselves were okay overall.  The meatballs and asparagus salad were great, those were hits.  The squid ink pasta was okay, I&#39;ve definitely had much better and the duck 2-ways was a HUGE MISS.  For a $24 plate the execution should have been exceptional and it just was lacking.  

The waiter and staff should have comped us our oysters for bringing them out so late and having forgotten about them.  If they had done that I probably would have given this place a second chance and held off on this review but since they hardly even apologized nor do anything even remotely special for my partners birthday (a simple Happy Birthday would have been nice when we entered) I&#39;m not going back and I will discourage my friends and business partners from going as well."

My wife and I had been excited to try this place, and after several false-starts (too crowded to grab a cocktail on multiple occasions), we finally snagged a table on a weeknight for dinner. 

We started with the cheese plate, which was good, although overpriced. Then we waited 45 minutes with no update from our server as to the status of the rest of our food. Finally our waitress stopped by our table to tell us that the food had mistakenly been delivered to another table, but not to worry, they were rushing our order. I grew paranoid that our food would be impacted - servers should never say food is being &#34;rushed.&#34; Ten minutes later, my fears were confirmed. 

Main issue was the pork ragu, which I had been psyched to try. Pasta is a main component, and it was undercooked - to the point where I needed a knife. It practically made the dish inedible. So yeah, they definitely &#34;rushed&#34; our meals. I get that mistakes happen, but for a simple miscommunication to cascade into our meals being impacted is hard to overlook. On top of that, it was apparent our server was basically hiding after the mistakes started to pile up. Frustrating experience, and it&#39;s doubtful we&#39;ll ever make a return trip."

This funky space doesn&#39;t lend to many decent tables (not a fan of community tables) but the chef&#39;s table can&#39;t be beat and it&#39;s huge.

We arrived at about 6:30 and the bar area was packed. Because the restaurant is pretty small to begin with, they have a very small host area, which is understandable, however, it was very cramped as the bar was packed and multiple parties arrived at the same time. We were seated at a high top in the back room next to the open kitchen. I love the way that they have used the space, but it is crowded for sure. The whole time people who were sitting at the kitchen bar were bumping in to our window table. Space issues aside, the food was delicious. I started with a soup and my husband a salad. Both were very fresh and beautifully presented. For dinner I had a fish dish and my husband had steak. Again, both were tasty, however, I was definitely jealous of my husband&#39;s steak. Not that the fish was bad, the steak was just amazing. The service was a little slow, we waited often for drinks which was disappointing and messed up the flow of the meal. 
Overall the food here is tasty but the space and service leave something to be desired."

A friend recommended we hit up Telegraph since it&#39;s a couple blocks from his house. Neighborhood feel, comfortable decor. We got there and at sat at the Chefs table. The service was spot on, they do a shared waiting tables so it felt like we had five servers to ourselves. Started with happy hour oysters which, as someone who doesn&#39;t like eating seafood in a landlocked state, I was very impressed. And only a dollar an oyster! Then moved onto the meatballs with cheesy polenta- a must try!! The special was a pork cheek with homemade pasta and had like a bolognese type sauce and out of this world!! Then, we saw a couple having the smores - there was a little fire, homemade graham crackers....dear god it was amazing!!! 

The foods are shared with a few set entrees but after our courses we were stuffed. Good portions and we said we wanted to take our time with the apps and food and they were cool with that. 
One of my favorite parts was that they had a nice wet cloth to wipe your hands after a couple of the courses - as a total germaphobe, I was LOVING IT! All the waitstaff was great, especially Steven, who was cool and chill and we all talked like we&#39;d been friends forever. 

Also the chefs wore plaid shirts so duh, I was in heaven. One of the chefs said &#34;it&#39;s about the senses, you see it, hear the crackle (smores Fire), smell it, then taste it&#34; 

Impressed isn&#39;t even the right word - I was blown away. I hope for the same ambiance and service the next time I come...and it will be soon. 

Kudos Telegraph crew!"

Unfortunately, it just didn&#39;t measure up.  The service was attentive but very slow. Granted, we were a party of 8 (that started as a party of 6), so I&#39;ll give them some slack on that, but I&#39;ve done many brunches with 8 in the party at many other smallish restaurants in Denver and we&#39;ve never had to wait as long as we did for our orders to be taken or our food to arrive (nearly 45 minutes after ordering). And while some of my party was enthusiastic about their food, I was disappointed with the bland eggs benedict I had.  First off, the menu indicates the bennies come with salmon, but they didn&#39;t have any apparently so mine came with prosciutto.  Normally not a problem but they cooked it to the texture of leather.  The english muffins they served them on were extremely dry and completely fell apart when I tried to take a bite.  They served them with a &#34;salad&#34; which turned out to be leafy greens with a raspberry vinaigrette.  That&#39;s it.  Just lettuce with a vinaigrette. One of my party ordered the chilaquiles and didn&#39;t realize they came with pork and cheese because the menu didn&#39;t describe them as such.  She had to send it back - she doesn&#39;t eat either.  They replaced it with just scrambled eggs with a healthy side of strawberries.  The berries looked good. I wish it had been better because I love the location and the patio is cool and lovely, and I want them to succeed, but the food is just barely average."

I have yet to have a bad experience, and in fact, i would argue that Telegraph has way better service than some of the more trendy places in Denver.  Last night our server was very personable and checked in with us appropriately.  Our water glasses were always being filled, and even the owner came over to learn about our experiences with the ambiance, food, &amp; service.

The owner has a clear passion for what he does, and you can tell that he wants every customer to have a great experience. If you&#39;re not completely happy, I guarantee that if make mention of it, the staff will try to correct anything to make it a better experience for you.  So for all you negative reviewers out there, I challenge you to ask your server to improve your experience first before writing negative comments about it.  
  
Telegraph&#39;s interior redesign has been a remarkable improvement from previous restaurants in this location; the noise level has improved, and the inside bar has a better layout.  If you&#39;re looking for a quaint neighborhood spot for happy hour and a nice meal, this is the perfect place.  Great for a date night or a small group gathering on the patio.  Leave the kids at home.  Also, the happy hour deals are good.  The meatballs are excellent, and we enjoyed the spicy brussel sprouts.  They swipe your credit card right at the table so your card doesn&#39;t need to leave your site--and you&#39;ll get to leave in a timely manner."

What really bothered me was the layout of the restaurant.  We were at a two-top table in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen.  The table was wedged next to the wall with only a small amount of space from the bar seats.  Literally every guest/server/manager that passed our table bumped into it.  It was so irritating."

First things first, there was none else in the entire restaurant and they refused to put two tables together to accommodate a large party of 15 which we had reservations for. They said it would block a walkway, 5 people sitting on the end of a table eating of their laps did so just as much. They brought the food out as it was ready, but forgot many side/salads and didn&#39;t bring the salads first or even offer to flight the meal appropriately. The salad was INCREDIBLY salty, and inedible. The pasta dish I ordered was a stingy portion and overall I was not too impressed with the dish as it was cold. (A friend did get the hot chicken which i found tasty). Then the bill was a cluster. They didn&#39;t offer to split the check and when we had to do the math ourselves acted annoyed that 15 people were paying separately- which was obvious. The table side credit thing was annoying, as they essentially stood over your shoulder while tipping them (can you say awkward), and it took forever and a day. Add to that the fact the server was slow and inattentive when there was again, NOBODY in the restaurant apart from our large group, and I just found the place to be overpriced, pretentious and frankly, I now understand why it was so empty in there to begin with."

Not many restaurants would bother to do that.  The people were trained well.  All in all a nice package.  Missed the Ragu.  Was told they were out so couldn&#39;t put on the menu last night, but the tempura bass was great.  My wife is still talking about how great the salmon was.  The downers:  Pretty noisy, but it seems like most successful restaurants have a pretty high noise level.  The other was the drink and wine prices.  Have cocktails at home or prepare to pay $2 to $3 more per cocktail or glass of wine than most places in town."

I&#39;ve already lost more time in my life to Telegraph than i&#39;m happy with and I don&#39;t intend to devote any more than I have to to get my point across.

There are certain things i&#39;ve come to accept when dining or drinking out, especially on a Friday night. I get it. But what I do not get, and what I find to be UNacceptable is waiting upwards of 10 minutes for unremarkable cocktails while your bartenders entertain the visibly over-served (again, bravo) woman sitting RIGHT NEXT TO ME, and having to wait another 5-10 minutes for additional service from the TWO people tending a half-full, 10 stool bar - all while preparing cocktails and shots for THEMSELVES, mind you. (Literally prepped and took shots in the corner of the bar. I hope whatever they served themselves was better than what I was served) The cherry on top of it all - like a splash of grenadine on your bottom-shelf fueled mixed drink - having to watch these masterful tenders of the bar trade stories and what I can only imagine was mustache grooming tips while you wait another 10 minutes just to pay your tab and regardless of your experience add tip because you are a decent person. 

These are all things that I find less than acceptable. These are also the things that made up my first - and last - trip to Telegraph Bistro and Bar."

Once for Breakfast...amazing + bottomless mimsosas, yum.  Once for dinner last night...amazing.  I don&#39;t know what they do to the bacon....but it makes even someone like me who doesn&#39;t really like pork products sing.   Amazing.  

We sat at the bar around the chefs last night and to watch them was like watching an artist at work, so if you are a foodie, this place is for you.

We had the baked potato soup which had this perfect piece of bacon laying across the bowl that was carefully garnished by one of the chefs as we watched.  I had the steak, it was great. But my husband&#39;s half chicken was AMAZING.  If I go back I will definitely get that. OMG.  so good.  And the chef that was near us was super friendly and we were able to ask him questions.  Great service, good selection of wine, beer and cocktails.  Just a little pricey, but what isn&#39;t in Denver?  We have only lived in Wash Park about 7 months, and have seen 2 places go out of business in the same location.

Oysters were great... very fresh and were served with fresh grated horseradish and mignonette. We also ordered the cheese board, beef tartare, king trumpet mushrooms, meatballs with creamy polenta and the baked potato soup. Everything was delicious. However, their HH is a little confusing. It runs from 3:30p-6:00p. But oysters are only available from 4:30p-6:00p, and you can&#39;t order off of the actual dinner menu until 5:00p. I would have liked to order additional items off of the dinner menu, but once 5pm came around we were almost full. I took a couple stars off because service was slow to start (10 minutes for the server to get to our table), most of their drafts were not in working order, and even with happy hour prices, our tab was $156 for 4 people. Their normal cocktail prices are $11. Which may work downtown, but not at a small, neighborhood restaurant. Will be back, but only for HH."

Everything, from the atmosphere (laid back, cool, but very professional), people (waitstaff and chefs went out of their way to make it great, everyone even wished MJ a happy birthday, including some chefs on a smoke break outside as we left), and price (expensive but reasonable...it&#39;s not a cheap place but if you&#39;re going for that you&#39;d probably not be going here) was great. But the star of the evening, as it should be, was the food. They make their food in a shareable way, and we had several plates, each better than the last. Seriously...morels and pork belly was ridiculous, as were the king trumpets. The steak was amazing, but the brussel sprouts that came with it may have been my favorite part (first time brussels out-shined a steak for me, and it was by no fault at all of the steak). Desert was amazing as well! Seriously one of the best higher end dining experience I&#39;ve had in Denver and elsewhere, could not recommend enough!

We had a fabulous experience here last night, everything from the cocktails to the food &amp; service was spot on.  We started at the bar with a few complementary glasses of sparkling rose (it was our anniversary), and then two of the specialty cocktails.  The cocktails were awesome, I think just as good as anything you can get at Williams &amp; Graham, but for a much more reasonable price ($11 each).  Moving on to dinner, we split four small plates and I was so so happy with everything.  We started with an Asparagus Salad which was my favorite dish of the evening.  A mix of tempora fried asparagus, steamed asparagus, pea tendrils, whipped herb goat cheese and an egg yolk.  It was the perfect balance of fresh and decadent.  Moving on, we ordered the meatballs and a pasta dish with a prosciutto-like ham, mustard greens and lemon.  Both were outstanding.  I thought the meatballs were good, though maybe not as great as others have raved, the pasta was definitely a home run.  The last thing we got was the trumpet mushroom and shishito pepper salad with avocado.  Fabulous.  Finally, they have a great wine/beer menu to round out the meal.  Honestly, I cannot say enough great things about our dinning experience here. On par with Plimoth, Work &amp; Class, Potager and Root Down.  Can&#39;t wait to go back and try out more of the menu."

We ordered bottomless mimosas, but the staff were unwilling to provide us with the agreed service. Our server, Steve , verbally refused to provide us with more mimosas prior to the 2 PM endless mimosa end time. It makes sense that when a business makes an offer, they follow up and provide the service. It took longer and longer to request service as the day progressed. We could tell the servers were unwilling to provide the service after serving the main course as the drink volume diminished. After we finished our main course, the servers ignored us unless we aggressively flagged them down for a request. If ordering something &#34;bottomless,&#34; it means &#34;a couple of refills until until staff deems it enough,&#34; at this location. Our server, Steve B, told us LITERALLY, &#34;you guys have had, like, 8 bottles of champagne.&#34; And this includes rarely a refill of tap water. Clearly, if we had 8 bottles of champagne, we would&#39;ve had 25 glasses each, but we only had 7. I doubt he understands the volume of 8 bottles of champagne...we still tipped 20%: that&#39;s $15 in an hour JUST IN TIPS, which is MARKEDLY higher than minimum wage for providing waiter services every 20 once every  minutes.

I would recommend going elsewhere."

A beautiful restaurant sans the typical buffet. I started with a tomato/ coconut soup that quite possibly was the best soup I have ever eaten. Every dish after that was exquisite. They also ask you just how spicy you like it and accommodate accordingly. 

The service was great. One of the managers came over and took the time to ask us how our meal was. And even brought us out a dessert plate.  A true gem of a place."

They offer great tasting Indian food however there is still much room for improvement. I usually fall head over heals for their curry, sadly I was disappointed this time around.

When asking for recommendations for something spicy the waiter didn&#39;t hesitate before saying the &#34;lamb vindaloo&#34; was what I wanted. Based on his confidence I was truly excited to try it. You can only imagine my disappointment when the dish came out to be mild if that. While the dish wasn&#39;t what I was looking for I have to admit the food was still well made and flavorful. 

When comparing this place to other Indian restaurants, there simply is no comparison. The food can still use improvement while the staff could definitely take another lesson or two on their menu.

Overall this place is decent and if you&#39;re craving Indian food this place might do the trick however there are better choices out there."

Dishes came with ample amount of white rice and plain naan that was warm and soft, served quartered. Ordered a chai as well, and the total bill came to about $35 including tax and tip.

I love that they are modern looking and made me feel fancy even though we just stopped by for a Tuesday evening dinner.  I am glad this is not a stereotypical hole-in-a-wall Indian location so they really done up their restaurant with hints of Indian decor. 

We had the kebob trio appetizer and it was delicious.  I don&#39;t like lamb because no matter what the people would tell me how &#34;not gamey&#34; their lamb tastes, I can stillt taste it.  The lamb on this trio with the sauce it came with did not taste at all, which I was extremely impressed.  The chicken was tender and surprisingly the shrimp was not as impressive as the lamb and the chicken. 

We ordered chicken tikka masala and also an eggplant dish that we both really enjoyed.  We typically like medium spicy at more Americanized locations but out of 1 - 5 we opted for 2 and it was a good spicy for us.

Of course you have to get naan bread.  I thought $4 for garlic naan was a little pricy for 4 pieces but it was super delicious and tasted fresh.  

This place is definitely a little bit pricier for dinner than other local Indian food locations but for the overall package I think it was well worth it.  

Oh and the fat tire I had was super cold and refreshing.  Better than what I&#39;ve had at some of the bars sometimes just because how cold they served it. The service was super amazing and friendly as well.  I will definitely be back!"

My only reason for leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service was not so great. They seemed way too busy for the number of wait staff they have. We waited over 15 minutes just to place or order and even longer for our drinks to be delivered.  I was very disappointed but at the end of the meal the manager came over and apologized for the wait explaining that there was a large party to be served just before we sat down.

We have been here multiple times, the food is always well prepared and delicious. Must order naan to go with your meal. We also enjoy the mango lassi drink. Thick, creamy and delicious!

Not the best place for non-Indian kids though. The flavors might be too strong for young kids. Our kids (Chinese palette) do tolerate the kabobs and love the naan.

One time the server spilled my wine and I had to request a replacement. Another time the menu of a nearby table fell on the ground and the server picked it up and placed it back on the table directly on the plate. Watch your plate, because they will take it even if you are not done."

It was super busy both days but the food came out really fast.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get.  The curry dishes were just the right heat as they ask you when you order.  The naan bread is so light and delicious you want to dip it in everything.  I tried 3 different dishes while I was there, the curry, korma and tikka masala.  The korma was probably my favorite.  The tikka masala was not the best I&#39;ve had.  The curry was also really good."

Walked in and stood there for a good 5 minutes until someone came to seat us.  The staff all seemed to hate their jobs.  A girl came and filled our water, but never said a word to us and gave us the impression she didn&#39;t want to be there and didn&#39;t want us to be there either.  Gave it ample time, but our waiter never showed to take our drink/appetizer order.  Maybe we were disrespected because we had just finished a hike in boulder and weren&#39;t dressed extravagantly, or maybe they are just understaffed, but whatever it is I&#39;m not coming back.  This used to be my favorite Indian food in Denver.  I don&#39;t know what happened, but those days are over.  I don&#39;t expect to be catered to, and my expectations are definitely not overly high, I just don&#39;t want to be disrespected and treated as though I don&#39;t belong in your business.  The management has definitely changed, because this is the exact opposite of the treatment I received going there prior.  Too bad Azitra, you sure had a great thing going for awhile.  Nothing good lasts forever I guess..."

My hubby said it was busy when he picked up our food and the place looked nice and clean. I will say that we were told it would be ready in 20 minutes, but that kept being extended after arriving. They did give a glass of wine while he waited for it to finally be ready witch was another 20 minutes.  The naan was yummy and flavorful. Hubs ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh, which we thought was nothing special, but not bad. I ordered something not on the menu. Chicken with a coconut curry sauce. Let me just tell you how amazing it was!!! The smell, flavor, tenderness of the breast meat chicken...all so yummy. That alone is 5 stars. I will order that again!!! I thank them for putting it together for me. So I would suggest giving this place a shot. I don&#39;t know if you will be wow&#39;d but you should not be disappointed."

Definitely in the top 2-3% of Indian restaurants in North America. Flavor, spiciness, portion size, price, you name it. We went there for a business dinner (party of 12) and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food, from appetizer to main course (alas! we didn&#39;t save room for dessert -- couldn&#39;t, because the food was so good, we filled ourselves up on it).

We had Gobi manchurian, hariyali shrimp, and Azitra&#39;s mixed grill for appetizers (we ordered two each of the first two and one of the third on the waitress&#39; reco, and they were the perfect quantity). For the main course we got two each of 5 dishes -- goat curry, lamb patia, chicken tikka masala, seafood Kerala curry, palak paneer -- and two of the Assorted Breads. Everything came with a generous serving of rice. The food came warm and on time, the servers delivered the food without interrupting our conversation, keeping an eye on our water glasses all the time. Stellar service, epic food!

If there was any part of our dinner that was not outstanding, it was the drinks. They were all very very good, but you can get such drinks elsewhere too -- meaning, they didn&#39;t hit it out of the park. But this review is for the overall dining experience, drinks plus starters plus main course, and from that perspective they deserve a triple-A rating."

It has been great seeing the restaurant get more and more popular.  In the past on a Friday or Saturday night it was not very busy. Going in the last couple of times the restaurant has been full, a testament to the quality of the food and great service.

The service is just a tad hit-or-miss, though. We have, at times, waited an unusually long time for our check. Never make people wait to give you their money, a mentor of mine once sagely advised. The food is outstanding, however. My favorites include the Chicken Korma, and the sweet corn soup is an excellent starter. Ideal for a business lunch, I highly recommend giving Azitra a try."

Awesome food, best Indian food we&#39;ve had in the area (boulder included). Amazing service considering my wife is currently unable to eat a ton of ingredients: we gave our waiter the list of ingredients (resembling a Paleo and AIP diet, though she can do tomatoes) and he worked hard with the kitchen to give her delicious options. They can sub in coconut milk for cream or dairy on anything not pre-marinated BTW. He even brought a complimentary fresh baked lentil flat bread and chutneys that we loved.  And a complimentary dessert she could eat (tasty fruit pieces in what seemed to be a marmalade or similar base). He later marked up a takeout menu with noted in what she can eat, and reminded us they are happy to try and accommodate and figure out substitutions.  I can eat anything and had a fantastic meal too. Tip quality tandoori chicken tikka cooked perfectly with the best garlic naan I&#39;ve had in a long time. Little things could too: water filled often, waiter, hostess and bus girl all asked if everything was satisfactory. Just a really great dining experience we highly recommend."

I felt like I was walking into a 4 star restaurant. The mood and music and decor was really nice. We were seated right away, as it wasn&#39;t very busy. 
The service was horrible. After 10 minutes, we finally had someone come by to give us some water. However, it wasn&#39;t our server. After another 10 minutes, the man seated at the front desk came by to take our order. We received our appetizer and food from people who came from the back. We never had anyone Coke to ask how our food was. I tried staring down several people before I finally got a nicely dressed woman who was not dressed in the servers clothing to ask if I needed anything to ask for some salt on the table. The rice was unremarkable and I have made better at home. My husband got the Goat Curry, which didn&#39;t have any curry flavor at all. The meat was tender, but the sauce just tasted like bland tomato sauce and wasn&#39;t spicy at all for ordering medium spice. I ordered the Palak Paneer which was pretty good. Our naan bread came out long enough after our meal that we had actually forgotten that we ordered it. We got the garlic naan and boy was it garlicky. But, it was good. Our daughter started getting getting fussy and the nice woman who brought us the salt brought her some mango ice cream, which was pretty good. And I don&#39;t even like mangoes. 
Overall, the food was mediocre. The service was horrible. The only thing that kept this from being 1 star, was the nice lady and my dish wasn&#39;t bad. 
I won&#39;t be returning, but maybe you will have better luck."

I have had good Indian food all over the country and in India. I have also learned to throw down a pretty good curry even from my Indian friends. So for an American guy I like to think I know good Indian food. 

Oh my gosh is this good Indian food! The Cauliflower app (gobhi manchurian) is simply one of the best apps I have had.. anywhere. The Chiken Tikka Massala is smooth and creamy and each of the other curries I have tried have all been superb. Their lamb and goat is done so well it almost seems to melt in your mouth. 

They have a great lunch deal which comes with a soup, naan, rice  and whichever curry and protein you want for around 10 bucks.

The service is always top notch and the wait staff works hard to ensure your happy.

I rarely give 5 stars but I have been to Azitra around 10 times so far and every time this restaurant delivers a consistent, beautiful, correctly spiced (to your taste) meal.

Kaali Mirch Ka Murg - Delicious!
Chicken Hariyali Lazzatdar - Fantasitc! The cashew sauce was out of this world!
Peppercorn-Curryleaf Chicken - Amazing! The sauce combined with the tender chicken was Wonderful!
Naan - We tried both the regular and one that came stuffed with the most amazing combination of cheese, onions and who know what other magical spices. Awesome!

We were one of two tables and the service was confusing. The gal who sat us was the one to take our order and bring the check at the end. Between those two landmarks was a mix of 3 different faces taking care of various things. The service wasn&#39;t lacking, it just lacked focus and I fear it would be worse if they were busier. 

We started with a couple of the desi fattoush salads which were delicious! My wife ordered the chicken tikka masala which she enjoyed. My lamb vindaloo was supposed to be a 3 out of 5 on their spicy scale and had barely any spice at all. The lamb was no doubt tender and well-marinated but the sauce was generally flavorless with too much tomato and it contained nothing else beside the lamb (whether or not it&#39;s traditional I&#39;m used to potatoes in vindaloo). 

My wife and I both agree that this is pretty average (Ameri)Indian food. Where this place misses entirely is the cost per plate. It&#39;s almost double what you&#39;d pay at a better restaurant. We won&#39;t be back, because there are plenty of more affordable Indian joints with better service and better food."

It was a bustling weeknight and we ordered our usual meal: chili chicken (extra hot), palak paneer (hot), chicken tikka masala (extra hot). We were lucky to have our food come out okay, but the service was shockingly disappointing, especially after the number able lovely meals we&#39;ve had here! (My sister, a regular and a major foodie, had to send back her cauliflower and salmon for both being undercooked. Whaaaaattttt????) Still, I&#39;m giving two stars because the food was pretty good. 

Our server was completely condescending:
Husband: &#34;Chicken tikka masala, extra hot.&#34;
Server: &#34;Okay, hot.&#34;
Me: &#34;No, he means EXTRA hot.&#34;
Server, with a suspiciously sweet smile: &#34;Okay.&#34;
Food: &#34;I&#39;m as spicy as a Ginger in a band named after me.&#34; In human terms, not. 

I don&#39;t usually complain--and I didn&#39;t this time either--but I did tell her that the food was not spicy enough. She asked if I wanted some hot sauce. I&#39;m still trying to decide if that counts for effort...

She also berated another server in front of his table--for all to hear. Pretty sure she&#39;s management, as she wore street clothes and the servers and (new) bussers wore their usual all black uniform. 

The other manager, a man of large presence and literally NO words, roams the aisles like a bouncer. I&#39;m going to go ahead and bust him out: he left the kitchen picking his nose. I probably wouldn&#39;t think much of this in a hole in the wall in London, but for the price and with the reputation this place has...Gahhhhh!!!!

No wonder the whole staff (the old manager, especially!) has left since the last time we were there. I&#39;m going to go find them, if it&#39;s the last thing I do. I will program my number into their phones myself so that they can never leave us like this again. I&#39;m scarred!"

I got a veggie cheese dish with Chai and a salad. What a VALUE! The food was mild, but full of flavor, the chai was to die for. When we got the bill, she brought us Chai to go in to go cups. This place was AMAZING. I&#39;m coming back for sure!

We were in town for our anniversary and had planned on spending our big anniversary dinner at a fancy restaurant in Denver. But after a day of roaming the city, followed by hours of driving into the Rockies, we had zero desire to drive into the city, find parking, and pay for an expensive meal. So we decided to stick close to our hotel in Broomfield, and that&#39;s what brought us to Azitra.

I won&#39;t lie, I was pretty disappointed that our anniversary dinner was going to be spent at some Indian restaurant in a suburb mall parking lot. We use our anniversary as one of the few days of the year to justify eating at expensive restaurants. However, that disappointment changed the second we got our food.

We ordered in typical white people fashion and got the chicken tikka masala and the chicken tikka with naan and rice. The flavors of these dishes are generally fairly similar from restaurant to restaurant. What makes Azitra stand out is that the chicken itself was by far the most moist, well cooked chicken I&#39;ve ever had at a Indian restaurant. A nice change from the often overcooked meat usually encountered with Tikka Masala. 

Even beyond the very tasty food, this place is worth taking the time to review because they truly made you feel at home. The woman who waited on us must have been the owner, or at least related to the owner, because you could see the pride she took in the food. She was welcoming, grateful, and very sweet. She is a shining example how good service makes the experience all the better.

I may live in the Silicon Valley and be surrounded by Indian restaurants, but Azitra has something I haven&#39;t been able to find there. Love for their customers."

The total for dinner for two including appetizer, drinks, naans and 3 entrees came to nearly $90 before tips. For a weekday evening dinner, it was pretty expensive. They had a very upscale ambience and service to match. I did not write a review at that time because I had very mixed feeling about the entire experience.

Fast forward to the present: went there for weekday lunch with a friend of mine. We got there around noon and were the 3rd group in line waiting to be checked in. The managers ( a large guy and a woman) walked by several times without even acknowledging the presence of everyone who was waiting. It looked like they put in extra effort to avoid eye contact with the people patiently waiting to be seated. No smiles and no greetings at all. 

We finally got seated about 20 minutes after arriving. The manager seated us, handed us the lunch menus and then disappeared. We already knew what we wanted to order, so we tried to flag down a couple of servers that were roaming the large dining area. Every one of them refused to take our order, simply pointing to the lady manager. She finally stopped by after another 15 minutes and took our orders. When we mentioned the lack of service, she stated &#34; You can see how busy we are&#34;. That was a weak excuse since almost all the tables were being ignored at that point.

The food arrived another 20 minutes later. My friend and I both got the Veggie Korma with spice level 3/5. The Korma was delicious. It came with complimentary Naan, white Rice and salad/soup. The total cost per person was under $10.

No complaints about the food at all. We both enjoyed the food. I must say that you can get equivalent quality/quantity of food for the same price (or even cheaper) at a lot of other Indian restaurants in the area.

The poor service is going to keep me away from this restaurant. The sad looking people that work here never smile or greet customers with any enthusiasm. Can&#39;t imagine going back to this restaurant."

At first I was apprehensive to suggest this establishment to my friends since for one, they have not been to this establishment and another note, they live like as far as Castle Rock, Parker and Aurora to begin with.  But Boy am I glad I did introduced Azitra to them for a recent BIRTHDAY PARTY for one my Singaporean friends&#39; Birthday Celebration.

Saturday May 25th 2013.  Time : 18:00hrs ish.

I came early as usual so as to make sure, all things are prepared for us.  This time around, we booked the PRIVATE Room to have this BIRTHDAY PARTY for a Party of 7 Lovely Ladies.

From the Extensive Menu, we decide to order these following items FAMILY STYLE :

*  Gobhi Manchurian : Cauliflower Florets In A Zesty Soy Tomato Glaze With Garlic
*  Azitra&#39;s Kabab Sampler : Trio Of Tandoori Kababs; Shrimp, Chicken, And Lamb Served With Housemade Chutneys
*  Chef&#39;s Chaat Of The Day (Samosas For That Evening)
*  Palak Paneer : Creamed Style Spinach With Homemade Indian Cheese
*  Chana Masala : Chickpeas And Diced Potatoes Cooked In The Popular Punjabi Style Sauce
*  Salmon Makhni : Chunks of Salmon Roasted In Tandoor And Simmered In Creamed Tomato, Fenugreek Sauce
*  Chicken Tikka Masala : Chunks of Chicken Pieces Simmered In Spiced Creamed Tomato Sauce
*  Lamb Vindaloo : Lamb In A Garlic And Vinegar Marinade Cooked In A Tangy And Very Spicy Sauce
*  Goat Curry : Goat Meat On The Bone In A Traditional Punjabi Style Curry
*  Biryani
*  Several orders of Papadum
*  Several orders of Naan
*  Several orders of Mango Lassi
*  Several orders of Chai
*  Several orders of Coffee

That evening one particular dish that intrigued my taste bud.  It was a SPICY Naan, that I forgot to ask our lovely MAIN server the actual name of that SPICY Naan.  The food came out on a timely manner.  All the food came out piping hot and DELICOUS!  Our glasses of water are always filled.  The servers make sure we had everything we need and ask us how are things, periodically that evening.

All in all, my Girlfriends APPROVED of this establishment.  What a relief!  They like all the food we ordered, especially the Birthday Girl!  It was full of flavor, delicious, scrumptious and they like it ALOT!!!  Reminds them of the INDIAN Cuisine they had in Singapore or even Better!  Hence the Birthday Party was a MAJOR SUCCESS!

Azitra, also allowed us to refrigerate the Birthday Cake in their Kitchen that evening so as not to make the Birthday Cake melt.  Furthermore, that evening, it was a little too hot for the weather outside.  The service was stellar throughout the evening.  Like about 20:10hrs, we were seated at the Bar Lounge since another Party needed to be at this Private Room.  We then proceed at the Bar Lounge, finishing our Desserts, Beverages, Coffee and Tea that evening.  Thank you Azitra for making this lovely evening for my friends.

Before I left Azitra,  I managed to purchase TO GO items for Hubs.  If I am not mistaken these were what I purchase :

*  Naan ($7.00)
*  Goat Curry ($17.00)

Good Food, Awesome Company, what can I ask for more.  *Smiling Ear To Ear*

We decided to pre-game here before heading off to the symphony.  The space is upscale farmhouse and had the warm comfort of eating farm to table food.  Service was friendly throughout the night with the whole staff helping when needed.

The menu is small which I like because then the food has an attention to detail than huge menu items tend to do.  The small plates were more intriguing to me than the large plates.  But first we started with the pear-sonal Jesus cocktail and a Rye manhattan.  Both drinks were well done and didn&#39;t come with fluffy garnishes which I appreciate.

My husband was all in for the lamb preparation last night which was a rib eye with pickled eggplant and pierogi.  For the small plates, I opted for the salmon crudo, pumpkin agnolotti, salt crusted turnips and we shared the bread and butter.

The bread and butter was the first to arrive and the butter was divine.  The bread is from Babette&#39;s and while I like a crispy, on the edge of burnt crust, my husband does not.  The salmon crudo had very good flavors but there were moments when the salmon flavor got a little masked.  The star of my meal was by far and away the pumpkin agnolotti.  Oh my goodness.  I could have done three more bowls of this delightful dish.  There was just the slightest hit of spice from the kimchi, a perfectly smooth pumpkin puree and little slices of lard to lend that extra layer of fat and flavor.  

My husband&#39;s lamb dish was exquisite as well.  The whole dish was perfectly executed with the exception that the serrated knife he was given couldn&#39;t cut through his greens.  A minor moment in an otherwise flawless dish.

Dessert was also exceptional.  I love that they offer a quick bites dessert option.  When you need just a touch of sweet but are at the brink of stuffed.  My choice was the candied apples and my husband chose the apple pie ice cream.  I. loved. my. tiny. candied apples!!  There were three on little toothpicks essentially.  A perfectly ripe, full of flavor apple ball covered in caramel, a sprinkling of candied apple sugar and hazelnuts.  I reluctantly gave my husband one and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about those little apples all night."

There was 7 of us and they got us in immediately (which was super surprising). We then each ordered a mimosa and coffee. The mimosa was pretty good but wasn&#39;t good enough to order a second. I ended up getting the breakfast sandwich and was VERY pleased! The flavors mixed together so well. The service was also very good. 

I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking to try new food and are up to finding a unique item on the menu to test out."

The restaurant had a stellar vibe. The service was great and they had a decent option for wines.  

I find myself at a lot of farm to table restaurants, they&#39;re kind of a staple in my life. The Beast + Bottle was right up my ally. Unfortunately it seemed they were trying to be more fancy than was needed for a restaurant of this type. In my opinion the menu is overpriced and although the menu is in English, at some points it does not feel like it.

F O O D
My fiancé and I had the meat platter for a starter. The flavors were a little too unique for me. The fish starter we had, on the other hand, was delicious and not overdone flavor wise.

For dinner I had the lamb and my fiancé had steak. Once again, I felt the cuts were amazing but the flavor was a little overdone.

A L C O H O L 
The wine selection was decent. I enjoyed the red blend that we had but not the best ever.

S E R V I C E
The service was outstanding. We loved our server and he was extremely attentive to us all night. We did not have a reservation (I recommend making one if you don&#39;t want to sit at the bar or on the patio) and they accomodated us right away.

Overall I think this restaurant really has something...I think they just have to stop trying too hard on the flavors."

I have never been welcomed and treated so warmly at a restaurant more than I have here. Near the end of our dinner, the server gave my boyfriend a surprise birthday dessert and champagne toast for both of us. The service and food was exceptional, and even after all the hype, the restaurant exceeded my expectation. 

Also, I had a drink called &#34;your own pear-sonal Jesus&#34; that blew me away and I know pear and vodka is not for everyone, but if that&#39;s your cup of tea I highly recommend giving it a try."
beast-bottle-denver,Niki S.,eUZdcUusmBAMf3kIMzbEIA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,22,176,cnCopmQ2WU9ArcWWH7FwIw,4.0,2016-10-13,"This review is probably more of a 3.8 but I&#39;ll round up. 

As a preview, we had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, 2 cocktails, and 1 coffee. This was $130 + tip. I find that this is always nice to know. 

To start, we had the octopus crostini. This was 4 sizable pieces of octopus, each topped with a seared leek, thin crostini, slice of iberico ham and a sherry vinaigrette. It was very simple, but fresh and flavorful. The portion was perfect. We asked the waiter if we should get 2 appetizers and he told us to hold off as we would be teetering on too much food. That was much appreciated advice. I highly recommend this appetizer. 

For the main dish, I got the flounder which was served pan seared, on top of a cauliflower puree, along with garlic brown butter green beans and carrots, 2 slices of fried green tomato and a green tomato relish. This dish went a little south for me. The fish, while cooked flawlessly, was SO SALTYYYYY. The first bite was delicious but every bite thereafter became harder to eat. The waiter was probably wondering why he had to keep refilling my water glass. On top of that, between the brown butter on the green beans, the oil from the fish, and then the oil from the fried green tomatoes, the dish was just overly oily. 

My husband ordered the lamb special which was a coulotte cut - something new to us. It was explained as the top round of the leg bone. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked. If they have a lamb special, my husband would highly recommend it. 

For dessert, we ordered the lemon blackberry cake. This was a small sponge cake atop a blackberry butter, served with blackberry sorbet, a vanilla vacherin (a meringue type of biscuit), and a black pepper creme anglaise. Overall, it was... fine. My husband particularly loved the vacherin, mostly because it&#39;s a fun texture. It didn&#39;t have much flavor but I could sit there and eat it all day. The sorbet was extra frozen - it didn&#39;t melt at all. Not sure how they did they but I appreciated it. The cake was a little hard, as though it had sat in a refrigerator for a few days. It was a nice way to end a meal but I don&#39;t feel compelled to order it again. 

Cocktails are all lovely. I doubt you could go wrong. I ordered the &#34;pear-sonal jesus&#34; cocktail which was beautifully balanced. Not at all sweet and went down perfectly smooth. 

Service is friendly but the time between the courses was excessive. 15 minutes after we finished our appetizer, we started staring at every plate, hoping it was our order. We waited about 30 minutes. The waiter was sure to apologize for the delay so maybe it&#39;s not a usual thing. 

The good thing about this meal was the portions were really well sized. It was the perfect amount of food. I hate leaving anything on my plate but I hate even more to leave a restaurant hungry. That didn&#39;t happen here.

Overall, we may or may not come back. According to 5280, there are still 24 other amazing restaurants in the area."

More misses that hits here. Starting at The end of my last meal with the deconstructed brownie with marshmallows and nuts. All you wanted to do was to put it back together to have a good bite. One of my biggest pet peeve is a chef that thinks he or she needs to deconstruct a dish to make it fancy. When it takes zero skill to deconstruct a plate. 

Some dishes were good but just that, good. I felt like every dish was lacking something or really was just a hodgepodge like the octopus crustini. The flavors didn&#39;t really build on each other and was rather dry. This was due to dry cured meat, a crisp and an octopus that was a little on the chewy side, for octopus. 

Service was abysmal, to the point where it appears the manager had to fill the void.  We tried to talk to the manager about the smell that was wafting from the bathroom and invading our senses. The entire party walked away with the feeling of discontent for the second time."

The octopus small plate was just ok. Not enough flavor to bring out the octopus goodness. The chanterelles dish with pasta and liver bits was salty (and although the server said it was &#34;flying off the shelf&#34;, was simply not very impressive).
The protein was mediocre as well. Frankly the first &#34;fancy&#34; restaurant where I was not asked on temperature of the meat. Lamb was good but chewy, pork was very chewy and luke warm. 
Service on the slow side - not a huge fan. Expected so much more flavor based on reviews."

I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant and I would give that aspect 5-stars over and over again. However, I think the staff is a little bit odd (I may have just caught some Sunday morning strugglers, not a huge deal), and the food is a little overpriced. If you&#39;re looking for a big ol&#39; Sunday brunch, this is not the place for you. For $12ish dollars, you will get a respectable portion that will keep you full for approximately 2 hours. You can add a single mimsoa to that for an additional $8. Again, it&#39;s a lovely place, and if you&#39;re looking for a friendly/fancy/light brunch in the neighborhood, this is probably perfect for you. If you want a smothered breakfast burrito and bottomless beverages, try the Tavern instead."

We started with the poutine and what a great life decision. The fries were a perfect then add a sunny side egg, gravy, cheese curds then bacon and it will change your life. 

For the main meal I got eh lamb pastrami sandwich. Instead of fries I got the chicharrones at no extra cost. It was everything I wanted plus more. It had a great saltiness plus some grain mustard. All goodness. 

Overall this was a great experience with outstanding service. 

As a tip, make a reservation. We went at 1145 on a Saturday and there was never an empty table."

We did not have a reservation, but scored a spot at the bar. Sam and John took great care of us. Said my favorite thing-- let me take care of you, and bring you our specialties. We put the menus away, and put ourselves in their hands. (This explains why I don&#39;t know the name of anything we enjoyed) After asking about allergies, the fun began! Our first cocktails were mind blowing! It was as much fun to watch Sam prepare the cocktail as it was to drink it!(well, almost!)
The pleasure in a glass had a slight green tint to it, it was a vodka based drink with a pear flavor. It really was the most balanced and wonderful cocktails I&#39;ve ever had. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on any particular flavor, except YUM! The other drink was good too. It definitely had tequila going on! Our first dish was a puréed sweet potato and Apple kimchi. It was delicious. We sampled the drink that Beast and Bottle is known for. A wink to the mai tai in my opinion. If sweet drinks are your thing, this is the cocktail for you! We traded back to the first drink! Our next dish was a pulled lamb shank and big noodles. I enjoyed it, although it was quite heavy. We had great fun and loved every bite. Big thanks to Sam and John!"

Got the lamb ribeye, which was cooked nicely but really salty. Other things on the plate were perogis (not great), kielbasa (why this when the lamb ribeye is there?) and some super dark pickle slices. For $34 it was honestly disappointing. Service was excellent, I love the space, and the beer was good. But I paid a lot for the food and it just wasn&#39;t that good. Would return some day to try again though."

Denver is such a great spot for getting your romance on. Or if you want you can hang out with friends. A booth though  definitely should be your choice if you have that certain sparkle in your eye for someone. 

Definitely a very provincial French design decor wise. Elegant but laid back. Love the reclaimed door that served as a room divider. 

Awesome service. Always attentive but never annoying. 

Pan Seared Lamb. Peruvian Hamachi. Pork plate. Roasted Beets. Farfalle. We shared our dishes and ended up loving them all.

Pear-Sonal Jesus and Dark and Stormy. For our libation. Get them!

White brick on the outside, simple and classy.  Totally judging a book by it&#39;s cover but I could not help it.  It reminded me of a cute little restaurant front similar to what is in my hometown.  

And it just so happened that I was meeting one of my hometown friends (Ohio hometown then Chicago hometown who has now taken off to Denver) and her husband at Beast + Bottle.  Admittedly, I wasn&#39;t overly thrilled with the menu at first glance, considering the other menus from several options we had prior to meeting, but I was pleasantly surprised when all was said and done.

To start, the drink list was small yet covered a wide range of tastes.  I went with the &#34;your own pear-sonal Jesus&#34;, solely because of the name, and, for someone who is not really a vodka drinker, it was the perfect amount of bitter and fruity.  Can&#39;t go wrong with JHC I suppose!

The group started with one of their special flatbreads which was great, but I think the star of my show as certainly the pappardelle.  Never one to pass up on a pasta dish, especially pappardelle, I thought this was certainly a hit.  The lamb ragu was excellent and the ricotta was great (although I would have liked a little bit more of a serving!).  I was able to finish the whole plate, which is generally impossible with most pasta dishes, however, it was so good I couldn&#39;t stop eating it... and I was not looking into taking home leftovers.

The price point is moderately high for a random weeknight out but was completely within expectations, and I think the product they serve is totally worth the tag.  Beast + Bottle has a story to tell and I recommend you be a part of it."

We went for Father&#39;s Day brunch.  For starters, they were totally understanding that we were running late because of traffic and road blocks from the Pride parade.  The atmosphere was beautiful.  Rustic and chic.  The brunch menu all looked delicious.  We ended up with to-go boxes because we couldn&#39;t decide from the many exciting options.  The farms where they get their ingredients listed on the back mirror only added to the charm.

The fresh eggs and meat are reason enough to go.  So delicious!  Even the house-made soda was the best thing I&#39;ve ever sipped.  And the service was just above and beyond.  Our waitress was patient with our infant who kept tossing her toys on the floor.  

We will certainly be back."

The next sentence will surely strike a chord with most Yelpers.

You&#39;re starving, the first thing you spot you order, and three bites into this orgasmic food experience you realize... &#34;Sh*t, I didn&#39;t take any photos and really don&#39;t want to stop eating.&#34; This happened to me at Beast + Bottle, my food was amazing, the sun was shining on the patio, and the service was on point. Like seriously, the service I received from the staff here was above and beyond, five-stars for this alone. 

I went with the chicken + mushroom sausage breakfast plate with a crostini, mustard hollandaise, and two eggs. This was not only delicious, but a beautiful plate of food. Two perfectly poached eggs with the yolk running all over the crunchy crostini along with the juicy flavorful chicken sausage, oh yeah. This sausage had that perfect pop when you bite into the casing, pure meat magic. 

I highly recommend sitting outside when dining here, if the weather permits, the buzzing vibe of the street and the people dining around you really help to make this a foodie destination for out-of-towners and the locals alike.

The one thing that had put this visit off until recently was that I could not find any definitive information on a patio. The reviews and photos put the focus solidly on the food, which is where it should be. In case this lacking piece of information has you looking for a sure bet, I&#39;m happy to tell you there is one. It isn&#39;t the best patio I&#39;ve ever been to, but the food makes it worth the compromise.

We were a group of 4 and split four small plates and two entrees. The portions were on the small side and the flavors were nothing exciting. The fish was extremely fishy to the part of inedible.

Overall not that impressed."

Who knew I would like lamb organ meat? For the adventurous hoof to snout diner, I would recommend sticking with the more unique dishes. They were prepared quite well during our visit.   

The lamb itself was quite grisly and hard to eat. The food was very salty during our visit. Even the desserts. 

More formal service than most Denver restaurants which was nice. The restaurant was very small. I think this was the reason it was tough to get a reservation. The single stall restroom walls were lined with menus, old and new, from great NYC restaurants like Le Bernardin. Made me pine for NYC."

We had a wonderful waiter from Charleston, and we started with a wonderful conversation about how Charleston is one of my favorite cities in the US.  A few minutes later, and our awesome waiter brought us two complimentary refreshing tequila cocktails that he had made at his old restaurant!  Now that&#39;s quality customer service.  

We started with a yellowfish poke appetizer, which was light and had a wonderful umami flavor.  I was very pleased with my pappardelle with lamb ragu (we had just returned from Italy and I was craving some great pasta and this dish hit the spot), and my husband loved his pork dish.  The rest of our cocktails were well done and refreshing.  We can&#39;t wait to return!"

The staff was great at helping us since I didn&#39;t make a reservation (oops). I didn&#39;t realize how popping this place was. I&#39;ve only heard a little about it.

We got there and were ordering food and the waitress was a little less than helpful since we didn&#39;t really know what to expect as far as portions and whatnot. We ordered some appetizers and some meat. We got some beet thing that was pretty salty. I don&#39;t even know what anything was called because it was that fancy. Obviously I need to learn how to yelp better...sorry!

We also got a duck dish, a fish something and then lamb. Everything came out super salty. I usually don&#39;t drink much when I eat but I think I had about 5 cups of water to help wash everything down. I had to drink water after every bite. I&#39;m pretty sure my tongue was raw the next day from how salty the food was.

We don&#39;t like to be rude so we finished all of our food and then left but we had to go to another restaurant to get food because we were still hungry. I won&#39;t be going back."

We had made reservations but it was possible to get a table without a wait. With a warm sunny day we decided to sit on their patio, which accommodates some two tops and several four tops. 

A nice busgirl offered us a choice of still or sparkling water (no extra cost for sparking) and coffee. The coffee was very strong (my preference). They normally have Kaladi brothers coffee but were serving DazBog that day because of an order mix up.  They serve the coffee with cream and white and brown sugar cubes (splenda and other sweeteners probably available). 

The waiter Tony was very helpful as they have many good choices for brunch. I went with the pizza carbonara which was delicious and had a fried egg (yolk oozed perfectly onto the pieces) which made me feel like it was a breakfast dish.

My sister ordered the pork which was tender and with delicious peppers.

It did get very hot outside but that&#39;s Colorado for you.

I definitely want to come back to Beast &amp; Bottle to try more of their delicious menu."

Everyone had a great time.  The restaurant is small, and quaint.  It&#39;s the type of place that if you lived in the neighborhood, you&#39;d go there all the time.  There&#39;s a small bar to the side of the restaurant, that well stocked and the rest of the place is cozy and welcoming.

The food was pretty good.  The concept of the restaurant is interesting.  So, it&#39;s farm to table, and the entrees are grouped into categories of proteins like heritage pork, bison, halibut, lamb, and a veggie dish.  The proteins have a specific cut for a given day, and then it also comes with sausage from the animal.  Very interesting, and done very well.

The menu is nothing fancy, but well thought out, with some interesting offerings.

The service is really good.  They seemed to have a team based approach and bat worked really well.

Definitely a place worth checking out."

The decor is cute and charming. 

The pastry of the day is always delicious. I try not to order it, but I can&#39;t after hearing the description. 

They have a variety of dishes - from fancy to plain - in case you have a picky eater in your party. 

The menu is fairly small and not completely overwhelming. 

The service and food have been consistently on point. Love this place."

It&#39;s the &#34;normcore&#34; of dining - cool but not too cool, trendy but in that blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss kind of way. Farm-to-table - check. Organic and local and fair-trade and fair-everything - check.

I&#39;m still a large advocate of portion size v price. It&#39;s great that everything is local and organic, but it does make for a pricey brunch when all one wants is a scramble and to get tipsy off fancy alcoholic juices. Case in point: delicious pumpkin croissant bread things. $4 for something that I swallowed in 1.5 bites. Tasty, but not that tasty. 

If anything, I did feel a wee bit cooler dining here than I do in real life... surely that counts for something."

We were first timers -- loved it -- started with reservations (recommended) then truly kind and attentive staff.... Love the European-country / comfortable decor.... Went for brunch, and lots of tasty and unique offerings.... 

Enjoyed the special of the day -- not on the menu: duck confit terrine on top of crustini, complemented with arugula, pickled mustard seed and soft boiled egg. It was delicious, but my crustini was too hard &amp; charred on the &#39;crust&#39; side of the &#39;ini&#39;. They replaced it rather quickly. Great experience overall!"

Plus the lines aren&#39;t nearly as long as literally every brunch restaurant ever.

Finding a proper eggs benedict usually turns out to be a chore. This was the best prepared I&#39;ve found in years. Gravlax was a bit heavy but the eggs were perfectly poached, bernaise perfectly seasoned, muffin toasted properly, and capers really balanced the richness.

Hash is another brunch essential and they do their Corned Lamb Shank Hash justice.  It&#39;s more of a rustic hash, but you&#39;ll walk away quite satisfied.

Also. That poutine. Even if you&#39;re stuffed and couldn&#39;t possibly eat anything else. Just get that. You&#39;ll thank me."

It was definitely well executed and was the best item we had.  We also had the ham sandwich on a biscuit.  The ham was great, but the saltiness was supposed to be cut by the sweet sauce on the biscuit.  Needless to say it was not, and the whole dish ended up being on the salty side.  The biscuit itself was a little on the hard side.  It wasn&#39;t a bad dish but not really that creative and for being $15 per plate for brunch I would definitely expect more.   One big annoyance was that I asked for jam to go with the toast that came with my omelet, and the waitress explained that it was a $2 up-charge due to the fact that they make their own jam in house.  Well, there are myriad breakfast joints around town that make their own jam and don&#39;t charge for it.  That was definitely not cool.

The thing that really got me was the price of the beverages, and I&#39;m not even talking about alcohol.  We ordered up some espresso drinks, and they ended up being $6 a pop.  That is outrageously expensive for coffee.  I&#39;ve been to fancy places in Chicago and NYC where coffee was not that expensive.  Granted I don&#39;t usually get coffee at a restaurant considering the usual markup and the lack of quality.  But still, they shouldn&#39;t charge $6 for it.  And $2 for jam.  But wait, the butter is free!

On the plus side, the bartender (we were seated at the bar) was super friendly, incredibly attentive, and eventually took care of our coffee drinks, due to having broken a glass in front of us at the start of the meal.  We appreciated the gesture."

You will take a hit to the wallet but the quality is worth it... I took the plunge and ordered the set priced menu -- which has items that are NOT on the regular menu... Why??? No idea-- it was definitely good enough to be on the regular menu...

The assortment of meats as the appetizer was amazing. Make sure they explain it all to you. So yummy. The pork sausage which is not on the menu was to die for. The flavors and the texture... Loved it. By the time the lamb came out, I was teetering on full, but the lamb leg was cooked perfectly and the sauces complimented it perfectly. The carrots looked like they were just pulled out of the ground... The dessert - omg.  I want that again. The chocolate dacquois It&#39;s like meringue and mousse and chocolate... Um, yes!! Delicious. Check out the pix.

But last night, we FINALLY made it in and celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary. 

Upon sitting down, we noticed that our menus read &#34;Happy 2nd Anniversary!&#34; We thought this was an amazing and thoughtful gesture, and we knew right away that we had chosen the right restaurant to celebrate our anniversary! Not only were the menus an amazing touch, they even sent us over some champagne before we ordered. Again, a very thoughtful touch. 

The service was prompt and friendly, and we both really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. It is small, but that gives the staff an opportunity to better focus on their guests instead of trying to cater to a huge dining room. The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere. 

My wife ordered the Line Caught Yellowfin Tuna and I had the Pan Roasted Lamb. When the plates arrived, the presentation was beautiful and the food was delicious. We both really enjoyed our meals and ate every last bite!

For desert, we had the Dhocolate Dacquoise. Peanut butter + caramel served on a wafer...  Yes, please!

The menus was creative and everything looked so good it made it difficult to settle on one thing. 

We started with two of Andreas Daily Pastry, fresh fried doughnuts with jam filling, mimosas and coffee. The daily pastry was delicious, I know I know &#39;what fried dough with sugar was delicious?!&#39;, plus I love the idea of a daily pastry. Coffee was great and local. And mimosas were mimosas, awesome! They offer slight variations that sounds fun but we opted for the traditional.

We took our time and never felt rushed as we needed a little rest after all that food. The waitress was patient and helpful with our menu indecision.

Per her recommendation I had a breakfast sandwich made with croissants from a local baker. However breakfast sandwich does not do justice to how eloquent and perfectly balanced this dish was. The smoked ham and Brie were so flavorful and worked together wonderfully. The croissant was just perfectly flakey and light yet held together enough to not make a mess.

My girlfriend had the corned lambshank hash. I tried a bite and loved it. It was a smaller dish, beautifully plated, and was rich so she found the serving size perfect. I really appreciated the subtle yet unique move of using corned lambshank instead of the same old corned beef you see everywhere else. 

We also shared the poutine with a poached egg. Which was delicious and not too salty, as I find poutine often is.

Please please give this place a try. It is locally owned and perfectly executed and deserves good patronage. We need to keep gems like this one around!"

Starting with the cocktails. I like them dry and not very sweet, so the waiter recommended a very unique one! Forgot the name now but it has that liquor from Norway called linie aquavit and notes of pistachio? It was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. And you make the bartender work for it. :D 

We need them brussel sprouts.... Their take on a caesar salad uses brussel sprouts and was again unique and amazing with the cured egg shavings. 

I like that their menu changes depending on what meat and ingredients are available. The meat was excellent and the flatbread, too."

We ordered:

Octopus Crostini small plate
Peruvian Hamachi small plate 

Duck plate
Baked Lamb plate

Gingerbread and molasses gelato

The bartender was incredibly friendly and his service was great- it was a rather busy night and service was on the slow side- however he was quick on his feet and did the best he could! 

Food was mediocre- which was a let down considering all the things I&#39;ve read about this place. I did see that most of the reviews were raving about brunch and cocktails, both we did not have.

The octopus crostini was bland and uninspiring. The hamachi small plate was pretty okay. Our mains were mediocre to bad- duck was tough and chewy and lamb was so-so. The dessert was our favorite part of the meal and saved the day- the flavors went great together and baked ginger strips were great!

We arrived a little late for our 6:45 reservation (we called to let them know) and were warmly greeted and showed to our table at about five minutes to seven.

Our waitress was super nice, informative and helpful - she let us know about the chef&#39;s tasting menu and the wine paring menu - both were an awesome value ($44 for the tasting menu + $20 if you wanted the wine). We all did the tasting menu, and two of us paired it with wine. The way the menu is broken down apps and small plates are on top and entrees are on the bottom. You pick one from the top, one from the bottom and then a dessert. Easy peasy. And super yummy.

I started with the Bangs Island mussels - they were large, plump and wonderfully cooked. Then there&#39;s like a little &#34;intermission&#34; where they bring you some wonderful gnocchi (also paired with wine). After that, it was time for entrees. The pappardelle  (braised shoulder + belly ragú, ricotta, meyer lemon oil, arugula) was AMAZING. Rich and filling - I could barely finish half. And just when I thought it was impossible to eat more or have a happier tummy, dessert came! I went with the black walnut turnover with goat cheese mousse, rooftop honey and carrot-orange sorbet. It was one of the best desserts I&#39;ve ever had. All of the ingredients just &#34;fit&#34; and it was that perfect combination of warm, sweet, but not too sweet.

Service was spot on - we never waited or wanted for anything. And the food - ALL the food - was spectacular. I don&#39;t dole out the 5-star reviews all that often, but with a meal and service like we experienced at B+B, they deserve it."

We have been here twice and both were 5 star experiences. Everything on the menu was excellent. The service is out of this world. The wine list is great. In my opinion this is up there in the top 5 for best restaurants in Denver. It&#39;s not stuffy or snobby. They just care about making good food and providing diners with an excellent time."

The place is tiny and had a cozy atmosphere. Service was excellent and our server let me sample several wines before making my selection. The menu changes regularly as the produce is all locally sourced. I started with the Brussels sprout Caesar, which was a creative interpretation and preparation of a classic dish. The chef succeeded as it was delicious and artfully prepared on the plate. For my main course, I opted for the Cape Cod Fluke which was delicious and flavorful. The restaurant has a nice selection of lesser-known wines and a stellar cocktail menu. I loved the food and the atmosphere and would definitely go back!"

We would have paid 5 star prices for the food the first time and today we are paying 5 star prices for 3 star food... Every dish was slightly under-seasoned....

We were here for our anniversary because our first experience over a few years ago was so memorable...And we miss the old bartender, Dean... 

We enjoyed all of our starters after we seasoned them with salt: beets, and squid ink gemelli and squid + merguez sausage...

Entrees: the duck was pretty good but the lamb was a little underwhelming...

Everything felt complicated for the sake of being complicated..."

Good food and drinks, though certainly not a lot of light options. The menu is heavy on the pork (the &#34;Beast&#34; part of the name), so there were not a lot of options for my father who is a carnivore but not too crazy into swine.

My big complaint is they were too pretentious to have ketchup for their delicious homemade shoestring fries. If the sauce on offer were not overly mustardy, this would not be a huge deal, but they need to offer an alternative here. Just bite the bullet and keep a few bottles of Heinz around; it won&#39;t kill you. I am not the kind of guy who asks for ketchup with a steak or in most situations for that matter, but boy would it have perfectly complimented those fries (better than their &#34;chinese mustard&#34;)."

Wait staff and knowledgable and attentive, handled somewhat extensive food allergies well. 

Pork was a good balance of freshness and savory tastes. Vegetarian options while limited were quite good, the tart was perfectly balanced, everything on the plate was delicious. The morels, to die for.

In our case it didn&#39;t help because the people at our table sat around 45 minutes after paying out. Rude. The staff was so great though, very apologetic and we got a free scone (which was delish!) In lieu of a regular mimosa, I would try one with the other juice they have on the menu (I can&#39;t remember the name.) 

The chive biscuit and bacon sides are a must order, seriously, you need it!

My sister in law ordered the Banana foster French toast. It was a huge portion and incredibly tasty, although more like a desert! 

The Lamb and pastrami sandwich was recommended and I can taste why, it was very good and my husband enjoyed every bite of it! The French fries were also good. 

I had the Carrot cake waffle and it was (my vocabulary is very limited today) very good! The waffle was made of carrot cake batter with, wait for it... Maple mascarpone. AMAZING!

My friends and I have tried a lot of breakfast places nearby and this one has yet to be dethroned. The main menu is great but I&#39;m even more impressed by their weekly specials, always keeping it fresh and interesting! Someone in their kitchen is just killing it on planning new meals :)

I&#39;ve never had anything but amazing service here. Their servers and bartenders are dedicated, friendly and upbeat! It just puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day. The dining area packs a lot of personality and while it&#39;s a small space we&#39;ve never had more than a half an hour of wait. Even without reservations!

This rustic American restaurant defines the farm to table concept. The atmosphere is laid back and also has outside dining, perfect for summer. 
We decided to try three different dishes: b+b poutine and egg, arctic char eggs benedict, and the corned lamb shank hash, with a pomegranate mimosa to accompany our meal. The poutine was tasty -- I can&#39;t say that I eat very many poutines on a daily, but this one was packed with flavor with a good amount of melted cheese and gravy. It was topped off with a sunny egg and was a great start to our meal. 
We shared the arctic char eggs benedict and the corned lamb shank hash. Let&#39;s start with the eggs benedict -- the eggs were perfectly poached with a beautiful runny yolk on top of a beautifully smoked salmon. The bearnaise sauce was light and delicate with the perfect amount of red onion and capers to cut the richness of the sauce and yolk. 
The corned lamb shank hash was accompanied with turnips, peas, and chilis. The lamb was not too gamey and there were a few pieces that were more cooked than others and provided a great textural variance. The turnips and peas added a nice twist to a hash rather than coming out with potatoes. It was topped with a sunny egg which added a nice creaminess to the dish. Both dishes were accompanied with a salad that contained in-season greens, radishes, and a red wine vinaigrette -- delicious as well. 
The restaurant is in a cute neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants surrounding the area. My next venture will be to try the dinner menu."

We made it to our 8:30pm dinner reservation after a long day of skiing, driving and a 10min (cold) walk from our hotel, so perhaps we weren&#39;t quite physically and mentally ready to enjoy what could have been lol.   The only downside I see to Beast + Bottle is the seating - we were a little cramped and very close to the table next to us.  Actually we probably ruined what appeared to be a very romantic evening for them. 

We started off with wine, I was pleasantly surprised to see a Gruner Veltliner offered by the glass - score!!

The menu here is rather small, don&#39;t let that put you off as it&#39;s clear they do everything right.  Small plates are at the top, and larger entrees are at the bottom.  Entrees are chosen by the protein and they&#39;ll let you know what cut of that particular meat they have available that day.  They butcher everything on site and the meat is extremely fresh and well done. 

Out of sheer exhaustion I opted to do a small veggie plate (the kohlrabi salad) and the mussels.  The kohlrabi salad was different, I hadn&#39;t had kohlrabi before, and although I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again I&#39;m glad I tried it.   The mussels on the other hand were so flavorful and big - highly suggest.   The bf ordered the truffle donut, I had a bite but really wasn&#39;t in the mood for carbs.  My mother had the meat charcuterie plate and swore by it, I didn&#39;t even get a bite.  

Three of us at the table ordered the lamb.  Beautifully presented and cooked perfectly.  I managed a bite and was very impressed.  I wish I could remember the other small plate my mom had, but I was probably half asleep by then lol. 

For dessert I tried the almond cake bite - a great size for a small bite, and well-priced in my opinion.  The cake was moist and tasty.   The bf ordered the grapefruit custard tart, not in his usual dessert comfort zone but we were intrigued by the &#34;hand of Buddha&#34;.  When the plate came out we were all expecting to see some candied piece resembling a hand, but not so.  We questioned what on earth a hand of Buddha might be and the hostess (who happened to be checking on us that moment) brought out the hand of Buddha fruit from the back.   Google it if you&#39;ve never heard of it either, it&#39;s quite remarkable. 

I&#39;d happily jump at the chance to come back here, hopefully in more lively spirits.  The food is fresh and I can tell it&#39;s consistently good.  There is a chef tasting menu option for an affordable $61 if that&#39;s your thing (it&#39;s usually mine, just not on this occasion lol).   The service was friendly and able to answer all of our questions."

Everyone was very friendly from the get go and it only continued. I sat at the bar and had the chai French toast with a side of bacon.

The pastry of the day was also delicious as well as the mimosas. I would definitely come back here."

Everything was not just good, but excellent! My six top all decided on the prix fixe menu of sorts where you pick any item from the top (apps/flatbreads/salads etc) an entree from the bottom, a chef selection in between, and a desert to top it off. You can also pair wine which is selected by the sommelier (seems like but isn&#39;t- I asked him that&#39;s how knowledgable he was) which he brings over and explains thoroughly. 

For my app I got the dungeness crab gnocchi. It was amazing, perfectly done and tons of flavor. Another hit was the pig and fog flatbread as well as the mussels which I&#39;m pretty sure would be indicted by MLB because they were on freakin steroids. Huge! Very tasty too. 

I chose the pork market priced cut for my entree which was a tenderloin with mustard spaetzel. Amazing dish!!! So tender was the pork I figured it must&#39;ve been a very caring pig to give its life for so much enjoyment. I love him.

When making my reservation I let B+B know that this was to celebrate a dear friend&#39;s pending nuptials. As we looked over the menu, we were brought over complimentary champagne for a celebratory toast! Such a nice touch! In addition, I was not drinking because I was our group&#39;s driver, I was given a small mocktail (so thoughtful!) while everyone received their champagne.

As noted above, service went above and beyond; a friend did not like her wine and our server quickly removed and proceeded to help find a more appropriate drink to fit her tastes.

Overall, the food was good. Small portions, but certainly a nice treat!"

Brunch was an absolute delight. Well priced menu for the quality of the food. Innovative selection of fresh ingredients. I think what impresses me the most is the Euro touch of this place.

The place is easy to miss if you are not looking for it and it isn&#39;t very big inside, which I personally like. We had a party of six but they managed to squeeze us in a bit later on a Friday night. Personally, I felt we had the best seats in the house- the back of the restaurant where we could see everything.

We did wait at the bar for a while and it was great to hang out with the classy dressed bartender who provided good conversation and recommendations. I got a sneak peak at some of the dishes coming out so without looking at the menu I knew that I wanted the squab and no one was going to talk me out of it! 

I did, however, opt for the corn soup to begin my meal. I thought it was good but a bit too salty (I expect a restaurant like this wouldn&#39;t over salt a dish or soup) so for the $10 it was definitely not worth it. As I stated, I went with the squab and it may fall in the top 5 dishes I&#39;ve had of all time and the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. I know it&#39;s not an easy dish to make and if you ever wanted to see absolute perfection this was it. I just wish I could have had more. Instead, I had to try the dessert that I saw other people ordering so I went with my gut and had the chocolate dacquoise, which looked like a giant s&#39;more  but tasted nothing like it. It&#39;s basically peanut butter and chocolate that you mix around and eat together with the salted caramel. No matter which combination you happened upon it was light&#39;s out.

I want to be clear that the one one star I knocked off wasn&#39;t just for the soup. I did try some other dishes that I felt were good but nothing great. I also thought that, as good as the service was, that our waiter did come off as pretentious and made some people in our party uncomfortable. I think he needs to realize that for some people this isn&#39;t normal dining but a special night out so he needs to respect that not everyone is going to know everything on the menu (and I&#39;m not referring to myself). 

I loved the atmosphere, and clearly my dinner and dessert were both outstanding."

Just a fried egg on top with some gravy-the flavor of the gravy was kind of bland. 

Now for the entrees. They were also pretty decent. They were really colorful, and the purple cauliflower had a great color to it. Sadly, there wasnt much else that made me remember this place. The flavors were okay, but nothing stood out for me. Sorry to say, I wasnt impressed."

My friend had heard wonderful things about this place leading her to make this reservation.  We both felt this place was a bit overhyped after our visit.  I got the kale quiche which came with french fries.  I asked for ketchup to go with my fries and the server just looked at me blankly and said &#34;we don&#39;t carry stuff like that.&#34;  I then proceeded to ask for something like honey mustard or anything.  He just kept saying no before I even could say anything.  Was very unimpressed with the service here and the food was just mediocre.  

I did also get the daily pastry, which was the best part of the meal.  It was an almond pastry served with a raspberry sauce.  Fluffy and delicious.  Between the five of us, we got an order of the brioche french toast for dessert.  Personally, I did not like it at all.

I chose the espresso encrusted lamb for my main entree, and was super impressed with the amazing flavors! Tip: if you don&#39;t like shiitake mushrooms, you can ask them to leave the mushrooms off of the entree (which I did), and because the lamb is not cooked with the shiitakes, there is no strong shiitake smell to contend with. Aside from the amazing food and professional staff, sit outside on their patio on a warm summer night. You will leave Beast + Bottle with a smile on your lips."

The food was delicious, the service perfect, the wine excellent. It was spendy but worth every dime. Back then it would have been a solid five stars...
But things seem to have changed since then. We had no fewer than 6 servers at our table last night, occasionally forgetting things like menus and our drinks (it seemed). The sausage flatbread was awesome, and the salmon crudo was meh, but the frois gras was what what really got me. It was like a thimbleful of pate atop a plateful of grape jelly with candy and peeled grapes, not enough starch to accompany the fatty liver. It was gimmicky and frankly a bit gross and way too much money for what one receives.

Now, I understand frois gras should be served with something sweet and I know that in springtime there is a service changeover and that there were a few folks training last night, but I dropped $100 for a few snacks and a couple drinks and was pretty disappointed, made all the worse because I think of B&amp;B, and recommend it to my friends, like it was the best place in Denver.

I must have walked past this place a million times but I am so glad I found this cozy, intimate, locally sourced restaurant. We made a reservation at 730pm. Our table wasn&#39;t ready until 745ish but we were happy just to chill at the bar for a bit. 

After we were seated we were greeted by our friendly waitress. She briefly explained the menu ( it was short and sweet but had some interesting combos) and we decided to order the fig and pig flatbread, a small plate of rabbit and a pappardelle entree to share. While we were waiting for the food we received 2 glasses of sparkling wine and a bite sized sashimi app because of the extra waiting time. They didn&#39;t have to do it but it was definitely a nice touch! The food from presentation to taste was IMPECCABLE! The rabbit was moist and very well seasoned; the flatbread was just the right size and finger licking good.

The restaurant was small but really cozy and relaxed. I love the minimal yet tasteful decor inside. This may be a 4-5 stars restaurant but I felt like I was at my friend&#39;s kitchen having a great time :)

Balance. That&#39;s what you need. You have to be really good, not just good. You are currently just good, and missing the impressive mark.

1) For such a small place, I counted nine staff in constant eyesight during dinner, not including the kitchen staff (1 was in kitchen at the pass through prep window to be fair.) That&#39;s preposterous and makes guests uncomfortable. Thanks for thinking I would be well taken care of, but it&#39;s WEIRD when they all congregate by the kitchen window or behind the bar. I can&#39;t stand when staff congregate behind the bar to chat. But they really don&#39;t have anywhere else to go to avoid hovering.

2) The food needs to step up. The ingredients sound trendy, but the execution of textures is off. Looks good though. I had the lobster corn soup and the pig Brie pizza flatbread. Pardon my memory, as it was a few weeks ago. The soup was one step too thin to support a corn puck that was two steps too firm. My spoon pinged my dish far too loudly when I forcefully went through it. Tasted good, but not really good. The pizza was also just good... Textures off. Squishy, messy... Tasted &#34;good&#34;.

3) The drinks. Ahh. Should be a shining moment... My tip is to go to Argyll down the street with some well trained mixologists and figure out what the heck is making the drinks there GREAT every time. Every time! Such good balance and has the element of surprise and excitement toward a beverage. You can try as hard as you want but until you understand the &#34;it&#34;, and trust me, I only know it when I taste it, you won&#39;t be above average.

It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m too picky... So with so many other options, I prob won&#39;t be back. Thanks for the one night, though."

I highly recommend making reservations if you want to try it out. We sat at the small bar for our meal since there was a substantial wait for a table, and because I like sitting at the bar when there are only two of us. The service is fantastic, the menu is small, and the vibe is intimate. All good things.

Nick and I ordered a variety of things to share including  the fig and pig flatbread (something we had eaten previously at Encore and still loved), the king trumpet mushrooms (veloute, caramelized beechwood, black truffle, upland cress), lola rossa
(a salad with dried cherries, candied pepitas, cabra blanca, and white balsamic), the Fluke (with lemongrass lobster nage, fingerling potatoes, fava beans, and tarragon), and the belly confit and country rib (with escarole kim chee, lard boiled peanuts, and yams.) 

The Fluke was hands down the best thing we ate that night. In fact, it might be the best piece of fish I&#39;ve eaten in years. I highly, highly recommend ordering this. Sadly, the only thing that wasn&#39;t fantastic was the country rib. It was really, really tough, almost as though it had been pretty seriously overcooked. The belly confit, on the other hand, was perfect.

Also worth a mention is the drink menu here. The cocktails are creatively named and creatively created with great ingredients and flavors. And beyond the cocktails they have a lovely wine list (including Lambrusco!) and good selection of beer. 

All in all Beast + Bottle is a welcome addition to the Denver dining scene and I look forward to sampling more of the menu in the future!"

Four of us went on a Friday night. Parking in this neighborhood can be a challenge so I dropped my partner and out friends off so they could be seated and I went and parked the car. My partner tried to order me a drink before I got there and was told very rudely by the waitress that that wasn&#39;t possible. It took the waitress forever to come back to the table once I got there and when she did finally arrive we attempted to order some appetizers whereupon she rudely informed us that we had to order our entire meal at the same time to &#34;help them with timing&#34;. When I go out to dinner I don&#39;t typically think about what I can do to help the restaurant. I am paying my good money to be served. It might have gone over better had the waitress not been such an arrogant snit about it. Further, I&#39;m not sure how ordering everything together helped with their timing - it took 20 minutes to get our small plates and another 30 minutes to get our main courses.

The food runners and the wine consigliere were excellent and the service provided by them was great. The server was awful.

The for is very good but not sure i&#39;d go back because of the attitude of the server and I&#39;m still a little bruised by having to confirm to the way they want me to order my food. Especially at those prices."

It&#39;s around the corner from my house, so husband and I are here enough to be &#34;regulars&#34; and it is excellent every single time we&#39;ve gone. The food is fresh and delicious, butchered right in their kitchen (which is why they don&#39;t serve beef - they don&#39;t have room), the cocktails are inventive and unique, the wine list is comprehensive and not outrageously priced (and the owner is always ready with a pairing recommendation), and never least the service is exceptional without being too pander-y, which I find happens in a lot of the higher end places here. I think I&#39;m just not used to Denver friendliness.

My recommendations: the lamb, either the ragu or the market price roast, never disappoints. Grab a Your Own Pearsonal Jesus cocktail as an aperitif, and then give the Vranec a try if you&#39;re into red wine. Finish it off with any of the desserts (the pastry chef here is amazing) and a Vin Santo, especially if the dessert you chose is fruity.

You also can&#39;t go wrong with brunch here on the weekend, especially if you&#39;re trying to impress overnight guests."

But, Terry B. got an ROTD for the place yesterday and It&#39;s restaurant week.  (B+B is not participating so snagging a reservation was easy which I&#39;m guessing isn&#39;t normally the case on a Friday night.)  So, off we went despite my misgivings to give the place a shot.

I can admit when I&#39;m wrong.  I thought there was nothing that could be done with that space that would make me like it - too small, too loud, too cramped but they managed to address all those issues and it&#39;s quite comfortable now.  It&#39;s still small, of course, but it doesn&#39;t feel overly tight.  On a blustery night I found it quite warm and cozy.  Parking was a nightmare though.  With restaurant week on 17th Ave. in full swing that was to be expected.

Very gracious welcome to just me by the lovely hostess while my dining partner searched for parking - no &#34;we only seat complete parties&#34; crap.  Server was very friendly and helpful throughout and everyone on staff pitched in to make sure water and iced teas were full and we were happy.  So far, so good right?

It&#39;s really about the menu and food that I have issues.  The menu was brief and many of the items just didn&#39;t sound that appealing.  Some off-the-wall ingredients combined in ways that sometimes worked and sometimes not so much.  We decided to just jump in though and we sampled the following:

Shared three items from the top half of the menu (Small Plates, Flatbreads and Eat Your Vegetables) to start (Bang Island Mussels $14, Pig + Fig Flatbread $12 and Cauliflower Souffle $10).  Be aware, if sharing, that portions sizes vary widely from quite ample (mussels and flatbread) to miniscule (cauliflower souffle).  

- The mussels were a very ample serving of largish but pretty tasteless bivalves.  The sauce of celery root milk (wasn&#39;t aware that celery roots had udders), celery leaf,  shallots, and walnut oil wasn&#39;t much help - overall blandness prevailed.  The accompanying &#34;grilled&#34; bread was past grilled to burnt in many places.

- The flatbread, which I&#39;d had before at Encore and was neutral about previously, was very good and certainly large enough to share but the crust was seriously scorched complete with ash residue on the serving board.  My dining companion, and many other diners I&#39;m guessing, don&#39;t mind a charred flatbread crust.  I do.

- The cauliflower souffle was the best of the lot.  Just a small cloud of essence of cauliflower - absolutely divine on every level but itzy bitzy so you&#39;ll be fighting over the last bite.

Entrees sampled were the Lamb Ragú with Pappardelle ($25) and the Tile Fish ($35).    

The lamb was a braised shoulder ragú with ricotta, Meyer lemon oil, and arugula served over fresh pappardelle.  My dining companion loved it.  It was a huge portion though - perhaps a little too huge.  Looked like dog&#39;s breakfast in the serving bowl.  I thought that, again, flavors were pretty muted (needed salt for sure) and the pappardelle were a bit too al dente.  The large strips of pasta needed just another moment of cooking to pair well with the unctuousness of the ragú.  $25 for a bowl of pasta with a ragú made from an inexpensive cut of lamb seems a bit high but not egregious.

Egregious perfectly describes the maybe 4 ounces of very fishy tile fish ($35) that I was served however.  It was not good.  The accompaniments of salsify (the waiter felt the need to explain what it was - must have had my country bumpkin hat on), black garlic aïoli, julienne apple and mushroom &#34;confit&#34; were good but not enough to hide the overwhelming fishiness of the dish.  This is just a side note.  I find the use of terms like milk (from a vegetable), ragú, aïoli and confit somewhat pretentious in a restaurant like this when simpler, more accurate terms could be used.

Skipped dessert and booze.  Tally - just over $100 plus tip.

Overall.  Nice place, friendly and professional staff, but unimpressive slightly over-priced food IMO.  No rush to return.  I fully admit that this is a very personal review.  Others seem to think this place is the cat&#39;s pajamas.  I&#39;m just not one of them.  I&#39;ll take the Plimoth over this place any day and twice on Sunday."

There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this more restaurant/ bar spin off of the deli.  The atmosphere is good (minus some pesky flies indoors because of the whole indoor/ outdoor open air thing going on).  The service is good and friendly.  The menu is fine and American, with the usual burgers, onion rings, fried chicken kinda food.  It&#39;s something that will greatly appeal to the Stapleton and Lowry crowd for sure, but it just wasn&#39;t anything super interesting.  The food wasn&#39;t super amazing.  The atmosphere wasn&#39;t super drawing.  It was just kind of a blend-into-the-bistro-and-bar woodwork, if you will, with the many, many similar places around in Denver.

  Sadly, we left disappointed. Maybe they just need a little more organization. 

  We arrived at 7pm- and were promptly seated by the hostess with our pick of a seat. They weren&#39;t overly busy, but not empty at all. For a Sunday night on a holiday weekend it was as busy as we expected it to be. At 704 someone came over and brought us water, and told us Zack would be with us shortly. The next party that comes in is seated, brought water, and the same guy that brought us water took their drink order. Zack still has not arrived .... 720 we still have not had anyone take our drink order, or our good order. Then Zack appears, and takes the food order of the party that arrived after us- without us having even ordered drinks! 

  So, with that at almost 730 now, we left, and went next door. No one even was around to see us walk out.. No one up front, and no waiters around to tell we were leaving. They were awesome and prompt next door. 

  This was a disappointing experience, and I do sincerely hope no one else has the same experience!! Hopefully it was just a one off situation."

PROS:
* Truffle egg salad sandwich. It&#39;s a unique sandwich, which was pretty tasty. 
* Good wine selection (but I say that as long as a place has riesling, lol).
* Fries were good, not great.

CONS:
* Although the egg salad was tasty, it was over-salted. And I&#39;m not a big fan of how ground up the eggs were--it was almost like pate. Kind of weird.
* The service was just ok. Our server sort of acted like he couldn&#39;t really care less that we were there.
* My husband had the Iowa pork tenderloin. He was not really a fan. Said it was WAY overly salted and a bit bland. And he is from Iowa, so ostensibly, he knows a good Iowa pork tenderloin.

DK if we&#39;ll be back, but I&#39;m glad we tried it anyway."

Thankfully we managed to get seats near the Bar.  The seats were the HIGH Chairs etc.  From their Menu, I wanted to order the Mussels but unfortunately they RAN OUT aka SOLD OUT for that evening.

Oh well...

Then we opt to order the following items :

*  Green Chile Cheesy Fries WITHOUT BACON ($8.00)
*  Chipotle Chicken Wings ($10.50)
*  2 patty of Beef Burger aka Double Double ($13.00)
*  Beef Burger with Mushroom and Swiss Cheese ($13.00)
*  Rootbeer ($4.00)
*  Coffee ($3.00)

Our lovely server, if I am NOT mistaken, her name is Lindy was indeed accommodating.  She answers all our questions about the Menu and make sure things run smoothly for our Dinner that evening.

This establishment is indeed packed to the Brim!  Perhaps this establishment reflects the &#34;idea&#34; to be seen and &#34;people watching&#34;.  There are PATIO seating when weather permits.  Frankly the &#34;HIGH&#34; Stools/Chairs we are assigned to was a little uncomfortable to our liking.  The table was slightly too small for all our food orders.  Even though we mentioned, to our server, what ever is ready from the Kitchen and comes first we don&#39;t mind having.

All in all, it was ok in terms of the Food they provide in this establishment.  Nothing fancy no frills about what we ordered and ate.  Maybe we ordered the wrong items in their menu.  Hence this 3 STARS Generous Review.

The coleslaw that comes with my Main Entrée of the Beef Burger was NOT to my liking.  Hubs is partial about the order of the Green Chile Cheesy Fries WITHOUT BACON, and his order of Double Double Beef Burger.  I am OK with the Chicken Wings.

May return but NOT in a hurry..  Provided I can get hold of those Mussels..  *SIGH*  MAYBE I should call them in advance and &#34;reserved&#34; those Mussels order etc..

This visit was on Friday April 15th 2016.  Time was about 20:00hrs ish.  We left the establishment at about 21:10hrs ish.

Sincerely hope I can change my review at some point because I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll end up back here at least for a beer.

My wife had the pastrami, which she described as greasy and light on the meat, which was $13. I had the western burger, $10. Neither of these came with a side, which seemed absurd to me - $24 for two sandwiches at lunch and i don&#39;t even get fries? So we got fries for an extra $2.50.

The burger was shockingly small. Like, barely bigger than WhiteCastle. It was tasty but I&#39;ve never seen a burger that small for $10. It was served unadorned on a small plate too, it was just kind of odd. You&#39;d think if it was going to be that small there would be a pickle or something to gussy up the presentation.

The burger did have a good flavor so I tried them again without the egg I wanted to use my gift card and got the burger and it was over taken by grease! I think I will let them figure things out and revisit them in a few months.

My nephew&#39;s burrito actually had some pieces of old, hard-as-a-rock French fry pieces in it which must&#39;ve fallen into his burrito by mistake. Both our burritos and the sauce they were sitting in were at or below room temperature. There are a lot of pesky flies that get in the restaurant as the bar is totally open to the outside seating. I saw a bartender use a fly swatter on the bar counter and never saw him wipe down the counter. Ick!! There is an air of snootiness in this restaurant as well."

Small interior, glad we arrived early. Could see they had a great and large patio, but day after blizzard it was closed.
Started with crispy Brussels - overall pretty good, a tad salty.
Pleased they had station 26 on tap - $7 a little steep.
Went with the pastrami sandwich as they cure in house. For $13 I expected a lot more meat. It was tasty, but not $13 a la carte tasty. 
Fries didn&#39;t look good (very light in color) but were surprisingly solid and super crispy. 
Overall I enjoyed it, but for the same price on this side of town id rather go to chop shop. I&#39;ll come back during patio weather and hopefully some drink specials."

We sat at the outdoor patio which was entirely in the shade. Misters were humidifying the patio which is great for your skin but the mister blew on to the umbrella and the large droplets hit me and plopped into my drink. I just moved to a seat closer to my husband, asked for a new glass and decided it was a small nuisance. But the evening got worse.
We ordered the spicy vegetable dip which came with large pieces of eggplant. It had a nice flavor, albeit not really spicy for Coloradoans, but wouldn&#39;t really stay on the soft warm flat bread.  It was too chunky without enough tahini to hold well to the bread.
I ordered the Rocky Mountain trout and my husband ordered the steak and frites.  The waiter told us right away that the trout was farm raised but when we questioned where in Colorado he said the mountains, which was acceptable to us. We fish in Colorado and So we know how trout should look and taste. 
When our entrees arrived, I was surprised by the color of the trout which resembled salmon. I also questioned the taste as it had no flavor, in direct contrast to the trout I have enjoyed throughout my life. The tomatoes served with it were succulent and tasty. I sampled the trout both with lemon and without. Nothing helped. My husband and I both expressed concern that something was wrong with it. Wrong color, wrong texture, wrong flavor. This was not Colorado trout. My husband&#39;s dish was acceptable, the sauce on his hanger steak was supposed to be Hatch chile but there was no heat to it at all. My husband was raised around authentic Mexican cooks and knows good chile sauce. 
After the waiter realized we did not believe the trout was from the Colorado mountains as we were told, the manager came to our table. She scowled at us and asked if there was any thing wrong. We again reiterated the problem with the fish and Surprise! She admitted it was raised in Idaho!!!  We also found out online that the salmon color is caused by a synthetic caratinoid, not even something natural. She said she would take care of it, take it off the check, but on the way back in she spoke to our waiter about it and he let out a loud guffaw. Apparently, we were not only deceived as to the source of our trout but were laughed at as well. What an unappetizing experience."

When I mentioned this to the waiter, he asked if I would like him to throw them out or take them home!  How about offering to take them off the bill?  The rest were disappointed as well.

They need to go next door and experience North County.  When I go to a restaurant it is not just about getting fed.  I blame the management for not doing a better job of training their waitstaff.  People want cheerful waitstaff that try to make their dining experience pleasurable.  

Don&#39;t bother with MPK unless you are looking for a sports bar atmosphere with mediocre food."

It was identical to the childs cheesburger at 1/3 the cost.  Meat crispy dark on outside and pink in middle (ordered medium), very thin and the buns were what you expect from a bag of $1.49 grocery store buns.  The lettuce was just nasty and browned all along edges, no way anyone should put that on a burger and serve it.  A very small squirt right in the middle of sauce and two  non organic slices of tomato and that was it.  Like the burger you&#39;d expect from a &#34;neighborhood cookout&#34;.  Very very cheap to feed the masses type burger.   $13 for this was about $10 overpriced.  Very disappointed based on the ratings here."

We went to masterpiece kitchen yesterday because we were in the neighborhood, and we are rarely in Lowry.  Since the crispy wings are listed as &#34;award-winning,&#34; we decided to give them a shot.  They were tasty, indeed!  But, as I bit into the last wing on the plate, I noticed a long, light-colored hair, embedded in the batter of the wing.  Clearly it was cooked into this wing, and when our server came by, I pointed it out to him, even going the extra step to pick the entire wing up by this hair, and dangle it to demonstrate how clearly it was a hair, and how it was cooked into the food.  He took it away, and said nothing more about it.  About twenty minutes later he came back by and asked if his manager had been by.  We told him no, and he then told us, &#34;oh, he said he was going to come talk to you.  I told him about the hair, and he told me there is no way that hair could withstand a deep fryer, and that what you got was a chicken fiber.&#34;  What the crap is a chicken fiber???  It does not exist.  And also, I know what a hair looks like; in fact, I&#39;ve had hair all my life, so I&#39;ve come to master the oh-so challenging task of identifying hair when I see it.  So, despite the fact that our other food was good, and the atmosphere was cool, I will never go back.  It&#39;s one thing to have something gross happen, and have the staff apologize and take it off the bill.  It is quite another for them to make up a ludicrous lie about it, not apologize, and still charge us.  Ridiculous.  Chicken fiber.  Pffft."

We live just down the street to the Lowry location. I wanted to give them a minute to get their kitchen in order and work out the kinks. Well we went last night and I must say it was Horrible. We started with the Proseco the glasses were delivered as flat as I have ever had not even one bubble in the glass- when we told our waitress she was pretty annoyed to be bothering her.
Next was the cheese plate oh my a teaspoon of low grade Blue Cheese and a hard quarter size nugget of flavorless Gouda- with some Overdosed slightly burnt pita with six raw almonds and 3 dried cherry specks- the plate with chicken wings were a joke hard and non juicy and almost no meat on the bone- my wife wanted to take a photo- our child ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes- comes with apple juice- when we ordered I asked if we could have the apple juice now the waitress said NO we would have to wait until the child&#39;s meal was served. WHAT! Now to the fried chicken that came on the plate, it was very salty and greasy- needless to say my wife and I decided not to order our entrees and got out of there- sorry for the review feel free to contact me for verification"

The food is good-ish but not even close to great.  Cooking at home is better.  The burger/fries sort of reminded me of a school lunch burger.  Also the plates look so sparce when they come out. I absolutely love deli food and was sad when the Reuben was taken off the menu (which was my favorite sandwich at their other location).  I am guessing this is going to be more of a bar place (where food comes second).  What a bummer because it would have filled a perfect need in Lowry.  But as things stand, the Beer Garden &amp; Tavern&#39;s food are way better overall."

Yay for awesome food! Our first visit was opening week during lunch.  I had the ahi tuna sandwich and my friend had the burger, we split onion rings.  Holy hell those are some good onion rings.  I felt like the ahi tuna could have used more seasoning like what I had at their Deli location. Burger was amazing. Also, BEST ONION RINGS I&#39;ve ever had.
Our last visit we took the kids for an early dinner with some friends. Beer was icy cold.  Chipotle wings were cooked perfectly. Pork sandwich was a bit thin but super flavorful. Onion Rings were awesome. My husband loved his turkey sandwich. Again, I felt the ahi sandwich could have had more flavor the tuna and in the slaw.  
We got it for takeout on Friday, two ahi sandwiches, still missing something.  I&#39;ll start branching out from the Ahi (maybe) moving forward. Looking forward to some patio hang time too...extra Onion Rings."

First time my husband, myself, and MIL were enjoying a beer at the garden near by, I walked over to put in a reservation for when we were done. The two girls at the stand said they did not take reservations, handed me the restaurants card and said if we called before we walked the parking lot distance between the beer garden to their door step, they would put us on the wait list. Great! As we are finishing our beers (less than an hour later) I rang to do what they instructed and was told I was lying they never would offer that and would not put us on the list. We went next door for dinner that night. (Very tasty thanks North County!)

This past weekend we had family in again and thought we would give MP another try. We were seated right away for a Friday night, unfortunately service was lacking along with the quality of our drinks and food. I ordered a mule, however I ended up leaving 3/4ths of it due to how poorly it was made/tasted. (Bartender please stop using fake lime juice, it tastes horrible and ruins everything it goes in) My husbands old fashion was also barely drinkable. For the prices and simplicity of the drinks we ordered; there is no excuse for not using fresh ingredients and serving said drinks with the proper garnishes.

I ordered the Steak frites medium rare. The fries were tasty, but the cut of meat was so well done/overcooked I left half of it on my plate. The steak was pre sliced when served. There was not one hint of pink anywhere, how did that pass as a medium cook to their chef?? Being with a group I did not ask for a refire as my husband and myself at that point just wanted the dinning experience to over as quickly as possible. The other people in the dining party were all underwhelmed with their meals as well. The only thing everyone agreed was good was their truffle fries and beer! Learned my lesson, we won&#39;t be back a third time."

The short rib entree and fried chicken are fantastic.  We tried two of the desserts and thought they were very good as well.  I am not a big cheesecake fan but their blueberry &#34;cheesecake&#34; was delicious as it is a nice twist on a traditional cheesecake since it is bruleed on top and it&#39;s quite a bit lighter than a standard cheesecake.  The key lime &#34;pie&#34; dessert was also quite tasty - perfectly tart, not too sweet, and also more of a deconstructed pie, rather than a traditional key lime pie.   Our server was also very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt.   

I went in over the weekend to try out their brunch too and was not disappointed.  Both the bartender (Kendall I think) and manager Hannah were super friendly and helpful.  I had the french toast, which is quite decadent, and my friend had the harvest breakfast or something like that.  It had a bunch of veggies and a nice romesco sauce that worked well with the dish.

I am 65 and in over 10 years visiting Denver I have never had this happen. Our server said it was the law. Although my husband offered to vouch for me he was refused. We checked the law and actually a family member can vouch for you in Colorado! Get the law straight!

Good fried chicken, burger O.K., caesar salad overdressed.  The worst part is they give very limited pita bread on the cheese plate and have the audacity to charge $2.00 additional for more bread, sorry, but tacky and not a great business move for a new restaurant that is still not up to the standard of other restaurants."

We got seated quickly and our server was very nice and attentive.  Our food was served promptly and was hot. They even split the shared Caesar salad in the kitchen!  The mussels were very good and came with a lot of bread for sopping the sauce. The only complaint I had was that the Fried Chicken I ordered to go on the Cobb Salad (which was delicious) is really fried dark chicken tenders.  Order the grilled chicken if you want chicken not fried batter on your salad or sandwich.  I would have given them 5 stars if they wrote on the menu that the Fried Chicken is boneless dark chicken tenders.

The restaurant was very busy when we arrived. The hostess informed us that the full drink &amp; dinner menu were available out on the patio furniture near the gas fire pit. So we opted to sit on the patio. The patio is a beautiful place to sit with all its outdoor lighting. However, aside from the fire pit, only the high-top tables have heating elements and consequently nobody was seated at the regular tables because it was too chilly. We received no service while seated near the fire pit and after 10 minutes moved to the outside bar countertop. It still took a while to get served there even after several bartenders looked directly at us. There are also no heating elements along the ceiling at the outside bar countertop. I ordered the Cubano. The pork was very juicy and tender but the sandwich as a whole was not tasty. The mustard on the sandwich tasted like a generic grocery store mustard and was quite gross. My boyfriend ordered the pastrami burger and it was phenomenal. The atmosphere and pastrami burger warrant a return to Masterpiece Kitchen but I&#39;ll wait a couple months so the restaurant can get into full swing."

All three were delicious, and I would probably go back just for that. For my entree, I enjoyed the stuffed lobster with crab, but the star of the dish was the risotto (yum). For dessert, I had the bread pudding, which was also pretty good.

The items I really enjoyed was : the bacon Mac &amp; Cheese, chocolate cake, the simple salad (was a good amount for being on the happy hour menu) and the bacon wrapped dates. We also got some other items as well.

It&#39;s a little pricey, and seems a little pretentious but I go for one reason only---the desserts! Don&#39;t go too hungry because you will order with your eyes and end up with waaay too much (or maybe that&#39;s just me). But seriously, go with a group so you can order &amp; try multiple things.

The BYOS (build-your-own-sundae) can easily feed 2-3; you get three scoops of ice-creams and lots of toppings including a caramelized banana, salted raspberries, brownie bites &amp; more. Solid choice. 

The BEST thing on the menu is the &#34;cake &amp; shake&#34; (trust me), and if I were you I&#39;d get the chocolate cake with either the cookies &amp; cream or raspberry shake. Be warned, the chocolate cake is VERY rich but the milkshake will definitely offset it.

With my bags from the airport, and without even checking in yet, I made it here and plopped down at the bar counter, having made it before happy hour concluded. I love HH, allowing one to try a few things out.

Dessert HH items! 3 of them, to be exact. So awesome, it fueled me for all the miles of Denver walking and exploring I did that afternoon and into the evening. Great way to get energy  to explore the city.

Customer service was really good, and were I not so hot from waking, I probably would have elected to sit in the outside patio.

Only thing: flies kept on flying in to hover just about where I was seated. The door from the patio was practically behind me. It ruined the whole thing from being absolutely wonderful."

I hadn&#39;t been to the new location yet and had the pleasure of sampling lunch there this past week.  My friend and I started with the bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with manchego cheese and a marcona almond.  Bacon on just about anything is sublime but throw in the sweetness of the date with the crunch of the almond finished with the creamy tang of the cheese and now we are talking.  I could have eaten just a plate of those for lunch and been just fine.

As it was though, I love the avocado salad they have on the menu.  Again, the perfect balance is struck with the crunchy, flaky Maldon sea salt and the creamy ripeness of a perfect avocado.  The salad is just as I remembered it.

No trip to DBar is complete without dessert.  I opted for their take on a key lime tart with mango mousse and pineapple sorbet.  I like really tart key lime and there were little dollops of sauce on the plate that offered just that combined with the creaminess of the pie.  The pineapple sorbet tasted like the essence of pineapple without being overly sweet.  My friend ordered the molten chocolate cake that everybody has as the tag line of the dessert states.  Everybody does seem to have this dessert but without the execution you find at DBar.  It offers an intense chocolate experience with a play on creamy and crunchy chocolate.  DBar has mastered the art of contrasting but complimentary flavors and textures that offer a full culinary sensory experience."

I traveled up to Denver with a handful of buddies to drink some craft beer. Our Airbnb happened to be across the street from D Bar. After one of our beer events, one of my buddies and I decided to take a beer break and stop in for some milkshakes and an appetizer. One of the things I like most about D Bar is not only do you have a huge selection of desserts to choose from, they also have a food menu. We ordered a couple of milkshakes and some cheeseburger sliders. They were just what we needed to continue on our beer journey. The next night, after convincing the rest of the crew to check out D Bar, we stopped by for some more dessert. We each ordered something different and shared. I ordered a PB &amp; J milkshake and Nutella beignets. The PB &amp; J milkshake is a must order! The beignets were fresh and so delicious! We also ordered a build your own banana split, which HUGE, and a cake and shake combo.

The atmosphere of D Bar is very casual and a great date night spot. They also have a to go bar where you can order items to go instead of waiting in the restaurant area which is nice."

My dentist loved me, I&#39;m pretty sure my visits, due to cavities, paid for his home.  Now imagine me now, adulting.  This place is like candy land, but for adults.  The deserts are amazing, which I recently found, was the reason they call it &#34;D Bar&#34;.  All kinds of deserts, but I only had room for so much.

You walk in to a tastefully decorated interior, easy on the eyes, and a kind lady up front that shows you to your seat.  Everyone is professional, the service is prompt, and they are attentive.  My water was filled 3-4 times, without me having to ask.  A+ Servers.

Let us get to the food.  Happy hour was going on, so I decided to try a few things.  My expectation was that of other happy hours, which was happy hour portions.  I was mistaken, the portions for the happy hour orders were really good, very generous.  I ordered the bacon mac and cheese.  It had panko bread crumbs, crushed up cheese its, a creamy cheese sauce, and bacon.  Wow it was good.  The macaroni was a perfect tenderness, cheese was so creamy, and the panko/cheezeits added a nice extra cheesy bonus.  The next order was churros.  It was generously coated with the sugar and cinamon.  The center was so soft and chewy, which I love in churros.  They give a caramel dipping sauce, which compliments it well.  I found myself using my fork to pick up pieces of sugar/cinamon.  It came with 3 pretty sizable churros, even though the happy hour special says &#34;mini-churros&#34;.  Now i&#39;m curious to what the regular order looks like.  Lastly, I ordered the chocolate cake, with Madagascar frosting.  It  The frosting was delicious, smooth, and chocalatey.  The cake was very moist and rich.  I&#39;m definitely coming here more often, but need to limit myself... or I&#39;ll end up turning into a churro chocolate cake mac and cheese bacon person.

Pros
* Amazing happy hour.  Mon-Sun.  The server mentioned happy hour is ALL DAY Monday.
* The food was fantastic, like a candy store for adults (in regards to the deserts)
* Bacon Mac and Cheese was redonk good.
* Excellent service, very attentive, without being annoying.

Cons
* None (Disclaimer - I came at 4ish, so it was slower.  Not sure how it is when it&#39;s busy)."

I was in town for a conference and after eating a heavy barbecue lunch, was feeling a lighter dinner.  I wanted a small salad and a little something sweet.  D Bar was the perfect place to satisfy that craving.

We didn&#39;t have a reservation, but arriving around 7:45 on a Friday, my co-worker and I had no problem getting seated even though the place was busy.  I imagine reservations would be a good idea if you have a bigger party.

I opted for the dressed avocado salad and the creme brulee.  They also had a sour beer on on their seasonal specials list with raspberry, so I ordered that as well.  My co-worker just wanted something sweet and got the dessert tasting.

The beer was good, but I was disappointed that I was in a bottle and not on draft.  I wish the menu had made that more clear, but it&#39;s partially my fault for not asking.  It was nice and tart though like I was hoping for.  The salad was simple with avocado, lime, sea salt, olive oil, and lightly dressed mixed greens.  However, the quality of the ingredients was excellent and it was fresh, light, and creamy and satisfied my salad craving.  The creme brulee was served in a long rectangular dish.  It was hard to get all the custard out of the corners due to the shape of the dish.  There were visible specks of vanilla in there and a solid sugar crust on the top, but I would have preferred the custard to be a little less sweet.  

My friend also had the creme brulee in her dessert tasting along with the beignets with hazelnut chocolate filling. I tasted one of her beignets, and while the dough had a nice texture and came out piping hot, the there was too much filling that was cloying sweet which wrecked the dish. Neither one of us was a fan.

The bathroom has an interesting feature where the hand dryer is built into the sink.  It is activated depending on how you hold your hands under the faucet. While I was in one of the bathroom stalls, I heard another diner scream when it activated while she was trying to wash her hands because it scared her.  Don&#39;t worry, there are instructions to the right of the sink.  Just make sure you look at those first!

Service was prompt and friendly. I would come back here to enjoy the salad again, a drink, and perhaps share a dessert. There are a lot of interesting things to try here!"

My boyfriend and I decided to share the Prix Fixe, which is a three course dessert- one choose your own dessert off the &#34;Things You Know&#34; menu and two more surprise desserts of the kitchen&#39;s choosing.

We chose the Cake and Shake with chocolate cake and vanilla shake. If I had to choose a last meal on earth, I seriously might choose this. Extremely rich, fudgy frosting on top of melt-in-your-mouth cake. The vanilla shake was also thick and had the cutest chocolate balls on top. This was to die for, but I highly recommend sharing. I never could have finished it on my own.... And you still get two more courses.

One of our additional desserts was blood peach sorbet with blackberry compote and candied almonds. The sorbet was sour, the compote was sweet and the almonds were crunchy. PERFECTION. 

Our last additional plate was a trio: a homemade strawberry gum drop, a strawberry and cream macaroon and a caramel truffle chocolate. Delicious, delicious and delicious. At this point we were both so stuffed, but the food was too great to leave even a single bite. 

I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t live in Denver or I would be tempted to eat here every single day."

I was there visiting Denver this last week and was in the mood for something sweet! Decided to order the Nutella Beignets since Nutella is a favorite of mine! THEY WERE DELICIOUS!

There is a side entrance where you can get their desserts to go. Or the main entrance where you can be seated and order their food. 

When first walking in, I can see that this place was my kinda place! A gelato station of mouthwatering flavors right when you walk in. I&#39;ve gotta try them next time, because they looked great with the right type of good gelato consistency. What stood out to me were the gelato flavors pineapple jalapeño, lemon thyme, and mango. That will be my order next time! When it&#39;s not snowing and cold outside. Brrrr. 

Also right as you walk in, there is a dessert case filled with French macarons, sugar cookies, brownies, hand painted chocolate bon bons, cookies bigger than my hand, and much more. 

We decided to eat our dessert there and so we got seated. But after five mins, I politely excused myself for a brief moment from my group, and found my way back at the dessert case to get a chocolate chunk cookie for later. Yum! I could not resist!! 

So here&#39;s what we had for our dine in dessert. 

5 stars - Faux Foster Banana Imposter. A bananas foster dessert sandwiched in between liege type waffles. Oh yeah!!! To be technical, here is how it&#39;s described on the menu: Rock sugar waffle, chocolate cremeux, caramelized bananas, banana tuile, praline grains, vanilla bean ice cream.  JUST WOW! That&#39;s all the menu description should have said. This was one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had in awhile. The waffle was light, with the soft caramelized banana, and the vanilla bean ice cream was perfect with it! The combination was so good, not too sweet, the perfect balance. Wow, our table finished this one off in an instant!

4 stars - The Mexican. Three mini churros with a chocolate soufflé and horchata ice cream. The menu described this one as: Mexican chocolate soufflé, vanilla anglaise, churros, chocolate sauce, horchata ice cream, and a chocolate crumble. The chocolate soufflé was not too sweet, which contrasted the sugar dusted churros nicely. The horchata ice cream was spot on! I wanted an extra scoop of this one. The churros were oily and soggy. Exterior had a little crunch, but the inside felt a little mushy. Like it had been soaking in oil for too long. But the flavor was still good.

5 stars - Ambience and service. I&#39;m not one to rate on ambience, because it&#39;s really food first and service second that makes me a return customer. But in this case, I was impressed with the inside decor and feel. I can see D Bar being a place I would definitely enjoy for another night out with friends. 

Overall, I like a place that can offer a wide variety of desserts. Everything I got here felt like I got two desserts in one. High quality here, not overly sweet, and enough dessert options where I can eat there everyday for two weeks and not have to repeat. Yeah, right. That&#39;s a dream, eat here everyday for two weeks, and not gain a pound in the process. Although... D Bar just might be worth it, hmmm, maybe if I build in a mile run to go with it!

I would classify the restaurant as fun, playful, flirty american food. I enjoy playing with food in my kitchen at home, and I equally enjoy sampling someone else&#39;s culinary adventures. 

Let&#39;s begin by saying that this is by far the best desert place in Denver. I&#39;ve tried many, but they all fail in comparison to D Bar. The menu changes frequently, and I often find myself thinking of ordering one of each off the menu. If I had any type of self control when it comes to sugary treats I would probably do just that. But given my record of eating the entire cake in one sitting and stuff like that, I just stick with ordering something small and maybe share it with someone. 

Cake And Shake - absolutely delicious, although a bit too rich. My fiancé and I both wished for a glass of milk instead of the shake. But still, quite a treat

Molten Cake Thingy That Everyone Has...  to die for if you a chocolate fan

Creme Brûlée dessertini - sweet, fun, and playful. 

I also enjoy the little desert sampler. It&#39;s a great way to try a few things without over stuffing yourself on sugar

Overall, it&#39;s a cute, fun restaurant. It&#39;s a great place to impress your date, especially if she is a girly girl."

I love their cocktails, appetizers, entrees and always save room for their large dessert menu! Absolute favorite is the pizza-salad-sandwich - unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had - a warm toasty wrap with fresh salad, cheese and pine nuts inside of it. The perfect mix of crunchy, warm, and fresh.

Love the avo appetizer, the crue fries and the bacon wrapped dates.

Always save room for dessert - the classic cake and shake, the lemon souffle, the fresh baked cookies!!"

Made reservations for brunch and got seated on time. Started with the sliders which were juicy and awesome.  For my main entree I got their blt like panini. Delicious. My husband got their grilled cheese and swears it&#39;s the best grilled cheese sandwich in town.  

Of course we ended with their cake and shake; which now comes in a vanilla choice!  

So happy we came here. They even offer an afternoon tea service if you make reservations the day before."

It&#39;s hard to accommodate a large group but the food was great but leave room for the dessert. That&#39;s the real course. We got the dessert flight and it was amazing! Will be coming back here when we are in Denver again. The staff was so nice and even though we had to wait they tried really hard to accommodate our large group of 5 adults and 2 children.

It&#39;s SO worth it !!! We only went for a dessert because we had already eaten, but next time I for sure would love to eat because all the food looked so amazing ! 

It was very packed that night and I didn&#39;t know we would need reservations ( I would recommend making reservations of planning To go) but with our luck we got 5 seats at the &#34;Dessert Bar&#34; !!! This is the COOLEST bar ever!!! You watch one of the very talented pastry chefs whip up amazing desserts. There is also a beautiful dessert case on the way to the bathroom !!!

The ambiance is beautiful, elegant, modern and fun, the staff is so amazing and friendly, the dessert is spectacular. 

One friend got the chocolate soufflé with 2 Nutella stuffed beiges and mint ice cream, another friend the cake and shake, another pumpkin ice cream and another the molten chocolate cake thingy and I got the &#34;Oh So Sweet&#34; which is the chefs signature sampler plate that hanged seasonally ! 

If you want a fun modern trendy place with great dessert you must try D Bar !"

This was my first visit to the new location which is beautiful. Their menu has also expanded since I&#39;d last been there - but we just came for dessert.

My guy and I shared the Prix Fixe - it&#39;s a three-course dessert (OMG IS THIS REAL LIFE?!) wherein you choose one option which is the &#34;main course&#34; and the chef chooses the other two. Perfectly shareable. We chose &#34;The Mexican&#34; which was a mexican chocolate souffle which came with churros and horchata ice cream. The chefs creation for first course was a chocolate cream, cake crumbles and mint chocolate ice cream. Last course was a 3 piece &#34;bites&#34; plate with in-house made truffle, chocolate wafer crumble, and gumdrop - we actually agreed that the first and last courses should have been switched. It was all amazing! I almost ordered a shake, too...which would have been amazing I&#39;m sure, but simply too much to eat/drink.

The service was good, ambiance was nice. I wish we lived closer because this would be a weekly visit...so maybe it&#39;s a good thing that we don&#39;t."

Our food was great.  We tried the seasoned Avocado, the gigantic and tasty Brussels Sprouts, the chicken and waffles and the Kobe sliders.  Of course, this was washed down with Cake and shake.  Most decadent!

I can only go as high as a four.  Service was slow on a slow day, the place reeked of very cruciferous Brussels Sprouts (sorta foul when you are eating sweets), and the chicken was dry.
Still, DBAR remains a Denver gem, and has seriously upgraded!  Way to go!"

I had a reservation at 2130. We got there around 2120 and were told that our table wasn&#39;t ready. Okay, fine. We&#39;re early so that&#39;s perfectly alright. Our reservation time comes around and neither host had said another word to us. I&#39;ve been a hostess and if the table isn&#39;t ready at the reservation time, you find the party and apologize. Keep in mind, we were right outside the door in sight so they wouldn&#39;t have had to gone far. 
Eventually my SO decides to go inside and ask about our table. He&#39;s told it&#39;s still not ready. Later after we&#39;ve been standing for a good 15 minutes waiting, the male host comes out and tells us that they&#39;ve just paid and it should be ready soon. UM WHAT? If the table you&#39;re waiting for HASNT EVEN PAID yet when the next reservation time comes around you NEED to start looking for other options and/or switch things around so we aren&#39;t kept standing around...you know, the point of making a reservation in the first place?! 
Anyways we waited for probably 25-30 minutes before being seated. The hostess tells us they are buying the people a round of drinks and then having them move tables. You&#39;re kidding right? We are the ones inconvenienced and you&#39;re buying them drinks?????? K. 

So after that debacle, we get to our table and it turns out they pushed to tables together...we had only 5 people we didn&#39;t need enough room for 8 or 9. Poor planning. It&#39;s not that hard to rework seating arrangements, believe me I did it for years. 

Anyways, the food and the waiter were good. The cake I had was delicious, not mind blowing but good. If this review were based solely on the waiter service and the desserts we ordered it would probably be 4 stars. 

The bill comes and there&#39;s nothing comped for us at all. Now I don&#39;t expect to get things comped, but if you&#39;re going to tell me you comped a round of drinks for a table that forced us to wait for over 20 minutes, you&#39;d better try to make it up to me too. There they are getting free drinks and we were charged for ICE!!! Is a rocks pour larger than a neat pour? I hope so, because we were charged $13 for on the rocks and $11 for neat. 

Needless to say management needs some help and some sound absorbing materials somewhere in the restaurant is much needed."

On restaurant week, it was the best deal in terms of courses and they gave you full portions of their famous desserts!

I like the short rib and I also loved their breakfast burger too.... But lets be real: you have to get the cake and shake if you have never been. You will get a piece of chocolate cake the size of your head and a shake to wash it down.

It used to be only a dessert place at their original location and I was skeptical of their normal food but they pull it off well. If you do eat a normal meal, do yourself a favor and get a dessert as that is really what they do best."

We were 0 for 2 after a disappointing HH at Jax and pretty meh dinner at Acorn.  Thought we&#39;d see if we could end the evening on a high note at D Bar.  Man did we ever.

New space is just gorgeous.  Sat at the dessert bar and watched the lovely young woman pastry chef create magic.  Amazing watching her create these very complicated desserts for the whole restaurant all by herself.  I don&#39;t know what they pay her but it&#39;s not enough - lol.

I had the Faux Foster Banana Imposter 2.0 - rock sugar waffles, chocolate cremeaux, caramelized bananas, banana tuile, praline grains, and vanilla bean ice cream.  Stunning and a bargain at $10 but richer than rat poison - one waffle would have been plenty but no they give you two - sadly I had to admit defeat.

He had &#34;The Mexican&#34; - Mexican chocolate soufflé, vanilla creme anglaise, churros, chocolate sauce, horchata ice cream, chocolate crumble.  I was getting tired just watching her put it together - a lot of labor and quality elements for $13.  I got to a bite of the soufflé and it was divine - he demolished it.

Really looking forward to coming back and trying some of their savory options based on these flawless desserts.  Great way to end the evening."

I know some will gasp at this comment, which is why D Bar is losing one star, but I feel like the menu is a little... flat. I was here a year ago and had the same problem then as I had tonight. I just couldn&#39;t decide what to order- not bc there are so many options but because it feeeels like there are not. Nothing rings that &#34;OMG I HAVE to have that!&#34; bell or &#34;Oooo so innovative!&#34; 

Although I still enjoyed my experience and food is quite yummy, it is not spectacular IMO and the menu could use a bit of a new zesting with unique flavor combos. 

Always impeccably clean dining room and bathrooms, with a neat Dyson Airblade integrated into the faucet. 

P.s. Churros were Fall &#39;15 seasonal and are now gone, and it is $5 for a mocktail that tasted just like OJ and soda. Hmm"

This is definitely one of our favorites in the Uptown Square area, for cocktails, dinner, or dessert!  I haven&#39;t been for brunch yet, just mimosas, which are also amazing.  

The service has always been decent in my experience.  The first time we visited, before we even moved here, a staff member led us around to the accessible entrance and actually APOLOGIZED because the building was built wrong, and we had to even use a different entrance.  My jaw dropped.  Add that to the list of things that never happened in Boston. The space is a little cramped, and they always ask if you have reservations.  We never have, and have always been able to be seated!

As for the menu, make sure you save room for dessert, as that is their specialty.  The crue fries and brussels sprouts are definitely worth mentioning, but I have not tried many entrees as I usually fill up on those! Also, the mini donuts (appropriately called D&#39;oh!) are to die for.   

The cocktails are also fantastic.  They go above and beyond for presentation, and even a normal cup of hot chocolate as a night cap, makes you feel like you&#39;re having a fancy night out, even though it&#39;s right next door to your mediocre apartment.


Yay DBar, you rock, can&#39;t wait for our next indulgent night out!  :)"

Let me first admit that I am a Keegan Gerhard fanboy from his days as host on the Food Network Challenge series; kind of a man crush even!  I moved to Colorado a couple years ago and have been wanting to try this place since then, but with my travel schedule, I just got around to it; it was worth the wait.

I had the Southern Fried Belgian, basically a spin on Chicken and Waffles...in the form of a sandwich.  It pairs a savory cheesy-chive Belgian waffle with fried chicken breast and honey mustard accompanied with some awesome sweet potato fries!  It was a great execution (if I dare say presentation) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  

The reason for coming to D Bar is dessert, and I was not disappointed.  I chose to &#34;Put a Pepp In Your Strawberry Step...&#34;.  This consisted of a black pepper panna cotta w/strawberry micro sponge, sable Breton crumble, roasted strawberries, and a sour cream sorbet.  It was heavenly.  

The table service was great although I was, frankly, put off by the host&#39;s refusal to seat us until everyone (a party of 10) arrived (the restaurant has a $10/person penalty for no-shows on the reservations so we were paying anyway if someone didn&#39;t show up; everyone made it).  Quite frankly, he seemed to be a bit--how do I say?--*proud* of his position as host and our interactions with him evoked memories of the Maitre D&#39; from the 80&#39;s hit &#34;Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off&#34; calling Abe Frohmann, the Sausage King of Chicago, for his table.  Aside for the host&#39;s haughtiness, D Bar deserves its reputation as an exemplary place to enjoy refined food in a casual setting.

Oh, I caught a glimpse of Keegan as he was leaving the restaurant!"

You walk in and you&#39;re greeted by the wonderful sweet smell of baked desserts. The dessert menu was filled with options that looked delicious and were super affordable. I love that they had a lot of options for boozy coffee drinks and dessert cocktails, even some dessert wines. We tried a lot of different items on the menu and they were all amazing. The peanut butter banana shake is to die for though (but I&#39;m a huge peanut butter fan so maybe I&#39;m biased.

My only problem with this place (knocked down one start for it) is that the service took forever! It took over 20 minutes just to get the drinks we ordered. That was strange, but I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was just an off night. 

Parking isn&#39;t as bad as I thought it would be. There is parking in the structure right next door that is available for people eating at the restaurant.

The Mac and cheese was fantastic. The sandwich was divine. With the double down I also had a choice of a cookie for dessert. The cookie was great but to be honest I was disappointed it wasn&#39;t warm. For some reason I had hoped for a nice, warm out of the oven cookie.

It was MLK day and my husband and I were excited to be in the city on such an important day of service. We were able to catch the crowd as the MLK parade was wrapping up. We were excited to dine at d Bar for the first time and even more excited to see that Chef Keegan of a Food Network fame was back in the kitchen expediting food. He was also bringing out food to the tables. 

I honestly was just star-struck and giddy to be dining there. I didn&#39;t realize it took more than 30 minutes to get our food and Chef Keegan stopped by and apologized for such a long wait. If he hadn&#39;t stopped by we wouldn&#39;t have even noticed. He even offered us free desserts for the inconvenience. After the star-struck awe faded away, I realized it was a long wait as we finished both of our beverages. And I think my 8+ month pregnant belly might have alarmed him as well, as both mom and baby have to eat. We weren&#39;t bothered by the wait knowing that people were likely filing in from after the parade.

Our food was delicious when it did arrive. The short rib sandwich I had was tasty with the short rib melting in my mouth. My husband ordered the Kobe sliders which were also flavorful. We ordered the creme brûlée as our free dessert. We were also surprised to receive a couple of macaroons.

Our receipt where the dessert was listed it had said &#34;On Keegan.&#34;

We had already made plans to be back especially because of the amazing desserts but this experience seals the deal."

My fiancee and I had been to the previous location of D bar once and had a wonderful dessert experience. After seeing the dinner menu I was intrigued to come back. Fast forward over a year and I needed a restaurant to take my fiancée for her 30th birthday. I chose D bar because it would allow us to have dinner and guaranteed delicious desserts under one roof.

The new location off 19th &amp; Pennsylvania has parkijg in the adjacent One City Block garage. Much easier than the old location. 

Initially I requested the D bar for seating but my fiancée preferred a booth. The booths are comfortable and trimmed in a sea foam green with pattern.

A really nice touch by D Bar was a signed birthday card for my fiancée when we were seated. 
 
Our waiter Steven was helpful from start to finish. He would give recommendations and didn&#39;t rush us to make any decisions.

For drinks I tried two over the course of the meal. The pollination station is a vodka drink that is light, a little fizzy and quite sweet. The uptown funk you up is a bourbon drink that is strong, smooth and very refined.  It can funk you up!

To the food- for appetizers we ordered the mussels and nachos. The mussels were divine in a beer broth and grilled bread. The only bummer was that we had asked it to be gluten free &amp; my fiancée couldn&#39;t eat it. The manager did notice this and told us right away. Again, way to take care of your patrons.

The nachos had delicious meat, incredible sweet pickled onions, cheese and a few other things. While very tasty they were a little bland (I chose not to put the jalapeños and siracha sauce on as it may have been too spicy)

For entrees we tried the Serrano ham chicken and steak frittes. The chicken was a full breast wrapped in Serrano ham stuffed with cheese and topped with cooked pepper. There was a corn Mach shoux  (spelling?) under the chicken that was light, delicious and helped with the richness of the chicken.

Steak frittes. How can you go wrong with steak and fries? You can&#39;t and the chef cooked the steak rare to perfection. The portion looks small at first but only because the steak is cut into several slices. Each piece melted in our mouth and the fries were salted and crispy. 

Now you think with all that food we couldn&#39;t order dessert. We DID!

We tried the seasonal passion fruit option and gluten free chocolate lava cake. D Bar served the brownie pieces on the side to avoid the gluten aspect of the seasonal dessert. Both desserts were rich, full of flavor and executed well. A small french press was a good accompaniment to the desserts.

D Bar earned five stars for doing dinner, desserts and drinks superbly. Yum."

We decided to check out the new location to see what they had to offer. Oh boy! First of all, the restaurant is probably twice the size of the old one with garage-size windows, outdoor seating and a designated take-out section. The decor is also eclectic and super interesting.

I was with three other people. We all ordered some variation of the fries -- they were SUPER cool about fulfilling our dietary restrictions. We also had dessert. The dessert changed my life. I&#39;m not even kidding. I have been working on cutting out dairy intake, so we ordered the strawberry sorbet to go along with the beignets. That sorbet was so good, it made me forget how much I&#39;ve been missing ice cream. Good gracious! It also came with a berry soufflé. The soufflé was equally delicious. The beignets were okay, but I&#39;m a little spoiled from spending so much time in New Orleans, home of the beignets, so while they weren&#39;t bad, they weren&#39;t my favorites either."

The best place to sit is right infront of the dessert bar where you can see the chefs making every single dessert for the restaurant, calorie free ;)
But I highly recommend trying they&#39;re trio of desserts. It features one of their larger deserts plus a sample of some of the chocolates as well as one of their home made Popsicles. 

they&#39;re menu is always changing. Some of the customers favorites will stay on but they will do small tweaks just to keep it fresh. 
In the spring they&#39;ll feature more fruits and during the winter time I&#39;ve seen some of the holiday classics like gingerbread and peppermint."

Patrons around us were enjoying paninis and savory food that looked delicious, but we were there for the sweet stuff.

The vibe is cool; it&#39;s a bright space, with several tables &amp; booths as well as a desert bar and a regular bar.

(Can&#39;t vouch for their dinner menu, though they do have one.) Stopped in with husband and two friends for a treat. My husband and I split the s&#39;mores dessert - chocolate soufflé with marshmallow piped on top (then toasted), 2 beignets filled with chocolate ganache, small scoop of graham cracker ice cream. So. So. Good! I was worried the soufflé would be too rich - not at all the case; it was light and perfectly chocolate (not too sweet/overpowering in flavor). Perhaps a bit too much mallow for my liking, but my husband had no complaints. Beignets were delicious. And the ice cream made it perfect - really good on its own, even better with bites of soufflé. Our friends split the &#34;milk and cookies&#34;, and they were also very happy. Cookies were delivered straight from the oven. They had previously offered to share, but didn&#39;t offer again once the cookies showed up so they must have been good! Husband had a glass of port, friends both had a cocktail from the creative menu - everyone really happy all around! We were sat at the dessert bar, which was fun - got to watch the dessert chefs do their thing (and they were busting their butts!).

A little more variety in flavors/menu would be nice (a lot of either super fruity or super chocolatey items). Also, when I asked the waiter for a recommendation (because nothing on the menu screamed &#34;I want that!!&#34; to me), he basically just gave me a (very nice) rundown of the entire menu - I can read; I was looking for an opinion / some insight. Otherwise, can&#39;t complain!"

Ordered a plate to share (for 3 people) and dessert. 
The plate to share was delicious, it had dates, fries and Brussels spouts (I am simplifying it, but in reality they were accompanied by delicious sauces and toppings)
The dessert menu is amazing!! So many choices! They have seasonal desserts. We got molten lava cake, peaches and cream, and a chefs special &#34;sumpin sweet&#34;, which is just an array of random sweets.

I visited D Bar when they were at their old location (around 5 years ago), and remember it being a bit on the pricier end, but being oh-so-delicious. Not much has changed!

I actually only went for a quick dessert this time (not sit-down), and went to the little cafe section that&#39;s off to the side near the bar!

I shared a small cup ($3.50) of Pink Grapefruit Sorbet and Strawberry Sorbet to share with my sister. The Pink Grapefruit was incredibly refreshing and complemented the Strawberry Sorbet very well! The scoops were large and there was definitely enough for three smaller stomachs! For the price, I think it was well worth it. I was actually tempted to buy my own cup, which I never do because I never finish my food! But that&#39;s how much my taste buds were lovin&#39; the Pink Grapefruit and Strawberry sorbets. Yum.

I sampled the Coconut Sorbet, then took a few huge samples of the Vanilla and Salted Butter Caramel-something-rather from my brother&#39;s cup, and found them all to be very tasty! If only humans could indulge in so much sugar without any consequences, I would have gotten a scoop of each flavor and enjoyed every bite. I thought about it long and hard, and almost did it. Almost.

The interior was very clean and the atmosphere seemed very warm and inviting. The service was additionally friendly! Awesome people behind counters are 80% of the reason why I go back to restaurants. So, I&#39;ll be back for the other treats and awesome service soon!"

Luckily, we were able to get seated right away. Our server was a very nice gentleman. I didn&#39;t get his name but he did have amazing hair. 

We decided to go for dessert. We ordered the Prixe Fixe which is a 3 Course Dessert Tasting and you get the choice of choosing from &#34;Thing You Know&#34; or &#34;Seasonal Sweets&#34;. We decided to go with &#34;The Mexican&#34; and also placed another order for the &#34;D&#39;oh!&#34;. OMG. They were all amazing!

Plus, who can resist beautifully made desserts. The new location is very chic and there are plenty of seating inside. We parked next door inside the garage that has designated space for retail parking. We came on a Wednesday afternoon so parking wasn&#39;t an issue but I can imagine that it could get problematic on other days. 

Let me just comment on the bathroom first because I&#39;ve never seen a bathroom so cool before. The faucet where you wash your hands doubles as a dryer after the water stops running. What?! mindblown invention. Otherwise, bathroom is clean and that makes me happy.

For drinks I tried the pollination station (thumbs up for all the cute cocktail names like #selfie which I am gonna try next time for sure) and it was delicious! It&#39;s a sweet and refreshing concoction of ginger vodka and lemons etc. I highly recommend it on a hot summer day. It&#39;s decently strong too!

We came right before happy hour ended so it was $3 off drinks and cheaper prices on the happy hour nibbles. My friends and I shared the crispy Brussels which are fried brussels sprouts lightly glazed with honey sriracha and tossed with toasted hazel nuts. It was absolutely delicious! It was the perfect level of crisp and the taste was phenomenonal. We also tried the D Bar dates which are giant dates wrapped with apple wood smoked bacon. Yum!!!!!! 

For the main course, I decided to go with the Kobe Sliders which came with 3 american style wagu with onion, white cheddar cheese, garlic aioli packed in between two small brioche buns. It also came with parmesan fries which were so-so but the burgers were pretty bomb and quite filling. I could barely finish 2 of them. 

And of course, we had to save room for dessert because we&#39;re at DBar. Duh! My friend and I shared the chocolate souffle which comes with a baked souffle filled with chocolate sauce, two nutella filled beignets, and hazelnut ice cream. Omg talk about being in heaven! The ice cream was perfect because the nutella in the beignet became a little too overwhelming and kinda stuck my mouth together after a while but thank god for the ice cream because that just balanced everything out. My friend loved the souffle but maybe I&#39;m just not a souffle person because I thought it was a bit weird and soft and eggy.....i liked everything else though!

Will definitely be back for more DBar!"

First, I will start with the good. I had the crispy brussel sprouts which were divine and perfect. Think sweet and salty with a kick. I really enjoyed them.

Crue Fries, very cheese loaded. I could not eat too many of them as I am lactose intolerance. I ate around the bacon as I also do not eat pork. They were on the house so I did not complain. 

Secondly, and the main reason for this review. The bad and ugly. Now you know that I loathe to write poor reviews however I must share the truth.

I came with a friend as it was my first time at D Bar. When we arrived there was plenty of seating available. The receptionist, informed me an my friend to wait for 5 minutes which we were okay with. About 5 ladies came right in behind us, then a party of two, and another party of two (one was a pregnant lady). We waited over 7 minutes as everyone was seated before us. A bartender came forward and assisted with seating however we were on the sidelines. My friend was quite shocked and I suggested maybe the people who came in before us had reservations. UNTIL, a pregnant lady who was in line asked us if we had been waited on and stated she hoped they could eat as they had no reservation. We responded that we were waiting and they could go ahead. To our shock they went forward and were seated before us. At this point, I came forward and addressed the receptionist who was a thin, 5&#34;8, female with a nose ring through her septum. I shared that we had been waiting and she cut me off and said,&#34;you want to be seated now?&#34; 

Thanks to my graduate education, I was able to maintain tact and share that her lack of concern, validation and condescending attitude was unacceptable. I think that went over her head as she did not apologize, repeated if we wanted to be seated now and then hurriedly seated me and my friend. I can understand someone being overwhelmed however basic customer service and hospitality skills is a MUST as a receptionist. Not only did she not apologize she was totally rude. It takes nothing to be kind unless, a person has deeper underlining bias or is unable to accept responsibility. Then again some people just lack emotional intelligence. Due to her actions, I chose to address the manager to express my concerns. 

Calmly, I requested for the manager and I was met by a warm man who reported that he actually witnessed some of what occurred and apologized. He also reported to have already prepared something just for us. What made me spot and listen was his willingness to validate my feelings. As an avid yelper, I really support and care about local eateries. I also take yelping to heart. 

The food was good and the customer service other than our seating was great. Suggestions, I would recommend making a reservation and check in the receptionist frequently so that you are not passed over or forgotten. As always be kind and tactful as being an ass will cause you to lose future business or your dignity."

Thus, I have been meaning to check out it&#39;s new location and WOW, I was impressed.  

The new location is definitely large enough to accommodate all the customers who are in love with Chef Keegan Gerhard&#39;s sweet treat.  In fact, there is two entrances to the place; one for the full dine-in experience of D bar and another for express take out.  This makes it so convenient because at the previous location, diners were bumping elbows with those standing in line for bakery take-out.  I also love how the place continued with their clean, chic, minimalistic decor.  I was always fond of their Tiffany&#39;s blue decor.

As for service, I never had issues with the old location.  However, we had a pretty inattentive server for the night.  It was as if he had already checked out for the night.  Nonetheless, the gentlemen who brought out our dessert was upbeat and throughly explained how to pour the dark chocolate into our chocolate soufflé.  The chocolate soufflé was not the best, however, the accompanying beignets filled Nutella and Nutella ice cream were amazing.  But what was even more amazing was the molten cake thingy that everyone has.  It was beautifully presented and tasted heavenly!!

D Bar is a definitely must to fulfill your sweet tooth."

The bar/restaurant/coffee shop was running like a well oiled machine.  

I had the bacon and cheese fries and they were phenomenal.  The Mac and cheese left a bit to be desired, and was a bit bland (especially compared to the fries).  The shrimp and grits were perfect and I would recommend any southerners give them a shot.  

The draw for this place is the desserts (the D in D bar).  The creme brulé, was fantastic and prepared exquisitely right in front of me at the dessert bar.  The service wasn&#39;t fantastic, but they were busy.  I will return for the brulé."

My girlfriend and I were checking out apartments by D Bar and decided to talk it over at the bar... x number of drinks later, dinner, and dessert, the lease was signed and I was drunk. 

Now, a local resident to D Bar and 15 lbs over weight, I cannot say enough great things about the place. We consistently order the brisket nachos, brussel sprouts, and sliders and they are out of this world.  Honestly some of the best nachos I&#39;ve ever had. The desserts are on a different level, cheesecake, tarts, macaroons, cookies... Did I mention I put on weight? We literally just ordered food from here and it prompted me to write this review. 

Joking aside, the staff is fantastic, the food is dynamite, and if you have a pup they always hook it up with an organic treat.

Creme Brulee - By far the best creme brulee I&#39;ve had in a long long time! I love my creme brulee with a slight eggy taste to it. MMMMMMMM!!!!! it was SO GOOOOOD! I just wished that there was a more fruit on top of it.

I had the beignets and souffle and ice cream dessert. Ice cream was very good. The souffle was ok and I would have liked a better flavor. Texture was ok. The beignets were not the best I&#39;ve ever had. Now to be fair, I am VERY picky about my beignets. New Orleans at Cafe du mode is the best.

So with ten minutes to spare we literally sprinted the ten minute walk. And to our surprise these people were still friendly even for us being &#34;that guy&#34; who comes in at closing. 

The atmosphere is great. It&#39;s literally a bar/restaurant designed for dessert. The concept is wonderful and beautifully laid out with the most modern feel. 

I ordered a milkshake and my husband got the cake and shake. I thought the milkshake was on point, but my husband was disappointed.

The food is outstanding and great quality. Besides a few menu staples (like the southern fried Belgian, pizza salad sandwich, crue fries, etc), they like to switch it up and add new things to the menu. Everything is great! One of my favorites is the sliders. The Kobe beef they use is so juicy and full of flavor... I don&#39;t know many places that serve that quality of beef.

Drinks are great and pretty boozy. Especially the espresso martini! Holy crap! I walked out almost buzzed from just one of those! 

Desserts are seasonal and mostly changing. Keegan really aims to impress with these! I highly recommend this place for dinner or brunch AND dessert!"

DBar is hip, inviting, and boasts a brilliantly-devised menu. Comfort food is intertwined with gourmet touches here, and obviously, you better try all of the desserts (especially the lava cake--duh). I&#39;ve delved into the pizza salad sandwich, the Kobe sliders, and the chicken waffle sandwich--all are phenomenal, but the latter two really won my heart. The waffle used to craft the chicken sandwich is balanced in cheddar and cornmeal flavors, and is salty but not overpowering. If the chicken hadn&#39;t been fried to PERFECTION, the waffle would have been my favorite part of the meal. The Kobe sliders are buttery in texture, rich in flavor. Stop in for happy hour and order yourself a couple, you won&#39;t regret it. 

And of course, the desserts. I won&#39;t even try to describe them. Just try them all. 

Can&#39;t speak highly enough of the quality of the restaurant/bakery and how great the owners are. Chefs Keegan and Lisa deserve a key to the city."

The warm atmosphere, the friendly waitstaff, the chatter of customers enjoying themselves...it all merges into a dining experience that is truly one of a kind. 
I knew for my birthday dinner that D Bar was going to be my first choice, rain or shine. Unluckily for me, it was snowing and my hair was completely wet, but the hostess did not judge and happily sat us. 

I fell in love with the veggie-licious plate the last time I was in and wanted to try the kobe beef sliders this time around. The sliders were exactly how I imagined them: juicy, tender, and packed full of flavor. The fries that accompanied them were a perfect touch to the heartiness of the meat. 

Dessert was the best part especially because I ordered the chocolate souffle. The chocolate melted in my mouth and was pure heaven. The hazelnut ice cream and Nutella beignets were very complimentary to the richness of the souffle itself. The best dessert that I&#39;ve had. Our waiter even put a birthday candle for me on the plate! 

Once again, D Bar continues to be my favorite. I had a very memorable evening and would recommend a trip there anytime!"

I have been coming here during my bad days, my happy days, and my late night sweets cravings, and D bar has never disappointed. The other dessert restaurants in town have not been able comparable in terms of selection and quality. Delicious desserts (anything on the menu), beautiful presentation, and the staff who know their menu really well. Some may think the price is a little expensive. However, I am biased as I think desserts are important meal of day. The space is spacious and classy, but cozy enough for date night, or girls&#39; night."

My friend was visiting for the weekend, and I wanted to do something interesting, special and memorable, so I made a reservation for afternoon tea. 

We were starving, so we split a chicken and waffle sandwich to start, which was totally unnecessary, because we had no idea how much food we were about to consume. Well worth it on the deliciousness scale though! The chicken breast was perfectly cooked and the sweet potato waffle fries were soooooo good! Crispy, flavorful and yum. 

The tea cake spread was adorable. Everybody around us kept asking what we ordered...they were jealous. :) I think my favorite things were the baby grilled cheese and tomato soups, the bacon wrapped dates, the cranberry scones with lemon curd and the little cherry thingies. So...most of it. 

We also really enjoyed sitting at the bar and chit chatting with the staff. It was so much fun to watch them work their magic! Such a great afternoon!"

I definitely miss the old location.  This new location is extremely loud and they were understaffed for a Friday lunch rush. The staff were very nice though.
Gone is the original tasty mac and cheese that was baked with 4 cheeses, panko bread crumbs, and came with a spring salad.  Bacon mac and cheese is what they serve now (and if it&#39;s the same cheese recipe, it certainly tasted different).  While it was a large portion, it  lacked flavor, which was disappointing.  I would go back to pick up desserts here, but I don&#39;t think the dine-in experience here is for me."

If I had rated this review solely on the food and presentation - 5 Stars!

Here&#39;s why I decided on 4. We had a large party of 11 folks.  We made our reservations about 2 weeks out.  This was our first time at the new location and decided to celebrate my nieces 18th Birthday. 

We called a week earlier to add 2 more people.  We were told if they did not show up, we would be charged for those who didn&#39;t arrive.  I expect this type of policy in NYC, but not in Denver.  Needless to say, we cancelled those additional 2, as they were new parents and couldn&#39;t confirm far enough in advance. 

When we arrived, I notified the hostess of the special celebration and asked if Chef Keegan could stop by to say Happy Birthday. I was told she would relay the request.  They were very kind to provide a birthday card to my niece and did some banging of pans when they brought out her dessert.  Sweet. 

Everyone but 2 people in our party received their desserts.   It was awesome. Two people, who happened to be my children ordered a shake and cake/shake.  Everyone at the table finished, then I called over our waiter to inquire.  I was told the baristas make the shakes and were backed up. When they did arrive, they were great. 

When we were packing up and walking out the door, I saw our waiter talking with Chef Keegan who had been eating his dinner at the bar during our visit.  It appeared he attempted to congratulate my niece as she was walking outside but missed the opportunity.  It appeared the hostess did not relay our request.  Missed opportunity???

Overall, the food was great.  The personalized feel seems to have been lost since moving to the new and bigger location.  

We will be back in the future, but probably not with such a large group."

My boyfriend and I had the &#34;Grand Prix&#34; which was a selection of three separate dessert courses, where you pick one dessert item and the chef surprises you with two others. He ordered the Lemon Souffle (it was delicious!) that came with two cream puffs and then we were surprised with a raspberry sorbet with some sort of crumble on the bottom (I found quite a liking to it) and then the last part was a macaroon.  

The ambience is very settling because it has a very modern touch to it and sitting at the bar is even better!

Started out by making a lunch reservation (easy, recommended) --followed by free street parking; very nice. Place is of modern decor with community tables, booths, regular tables -- looks like it may also have a fun evening bar scene -- all set in the all-new uptown area of Denver.

Normally skittish about ordering all-veggie dishes, but decided to take a chance with the &#34;Veggie-licious&#34; -- absolutely the BEST vegetarian meal i&#39;ve had -- EVER: grilled asparagus, zucchini, portobello, red quinoa, black bean hummus -- all on naan... sprinkled with awesome crispy faro and goat cheese -- all complemented by an awesome sun dried tomato pesto...

Fifteen minutes later my order was taken. 30 minutes later my waitress tells me that the last piece of cake has been taken for my order and I have to choose something else. She leaves before I can give her my order. I fucking left! I work at the hotel front desk around the corner. I know that towards the end of a shift you really don&#39;t want to deal with people but thats no excuse. A huge portion of our clientele goes there on recommendation.

The good was the Brussel sprouts! amazing ..  and you can tell the pastries chef(day and night) put in the effort and it shows... The staff was very friendly and attentive. but didn&#39;t seem to know how to take the disappointment of a dish very well. Especially since it was recommended. 
My disappointment was with the steak and frits.... wow... I could not believe the $22 ticket for a plate full of dry Cisco frozen fries with two slivers of cheese and the steak took several back and forths with a steak knife to cut through. The steak was tasteless and dry and at the most maybe 1/4&#34; thick steak... I think D bar has it dialed in for the deserts but please stop with the dishes that are just sub par...

The move was a positive for them, as the new place is huge and you no longer feel awkwardly cramped.  

Good:
- Enticing menu options, everything tasted pretty good
- So many fun dessert options
- Really cute decor (90% women guests when we were there)
- Convenient and fun separate dessert area that you can just drop in and order gelato, pastries, special treats, classic desserts
- All the staff were so friendly, including Keegan, who was hanging around doing a little of everything
- Nice patio
- The desserts we had were great, not too sweet

Bad:
- Our server for an early Friday lunch with less than 1/3 full restaurant was really inefficient.  It was just a slow process with a wait in between every step. The whole place seemed to be set up a little inefficiently
- Portions were strangely small for some of the double down (their version of pick 2 lunch combo) options, like the grilled cheese, quinoa salad.  They said it was 1/2 size, but it seemed to be less than that

Overall, I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more, but I&#39;m going to be cautious about what I order."

He suggested the chicken fried steak for my son, and I had the turkey avocado sandwich. Let me just say that when he brought out our food, impressed was an understatement. The portions were huge, my sons chicken fried steak was tender and the gravy was homemade, as were the mashed potatoes.

I saw him pass a couple of times while I was waiting to be seated. I ordered my fries and when I got them they were undercooked and a very small portion. Look at the photo you can literally count them. Anyway, the very nice server was overwhelmed with around 10 tables she couldn&#39;t keep up. We never really seen her and waited forever for refills and a to go box. The food was Village Inn. Good, when that&#39;s what you feel like.

We have backed off our visits to this V.I. from every other week, to about once in a three month period, to never again.
The last few times we&#39;ve been there we&#39;re sending something back for being under cooked.
Today I had to send back the chicken fried steak because it was room temperature and the French toast because the middle was soaked with raw egg. When the waitress brought me a fresh steak the temperature was much better but the quality wasn&#39;t good. The fresh French toast was now burnt on the outside but still raw in the middle. They are obviously running their grills too hot so they can get the food out quickly but with the results of serving poor quality food.

We went there today about noon and were seated quickly.. Our waitress, Khloe, came to the table to take our order and when my wife ordered her food she made a request of the kitchen which we&#39;d made for 2 - 3 years. After Khloe went to place the order, she returned to tell us that the special request could not be  completed as it was a health department regulation violation, to which I asked about the previous 2 - 3 years. At that, she disappeared and was back right away with the General Manager. After discussing why they couldn&#39;t satisfy that request, during which I again reminded them of the previous 2 - 3 years, I was told that the old manager had sidestepped regulation and there had been a change made. So my wife wasn&#39;t going to get her request.. Not a big thing and it surely wasn&#39;t going to keep us from eating there. The General Manager and the waitress drifted off. The waitress began caring for other customers. We waited, thinking our order would out soon. After an extensive wait my wife went to use the restroom and on the way back asked to speak with the General Manager. We subsequently were taken care of your waiter, Mitch, who&#39;d been asked to stay late for it. After taking our order again (this indicates to me that Khloe had never placed the order and seeing us sitting at table was choosing to not follow-up on us , her customers.) the meal happened as wonderfully as we were accustomed to.. We noticed that Mitch was very concerned about our welfare and that of the customers around us.. Very proficient at his job, caring and witty to keep customers joyful of the surroundings and the restaurant they will undoubtedly return to.. Village Inn.. All because Mitch made them feel welcome.. When I began writing this, I was going to give you a 1 star rating because of our treatment by Khloe.  Our rating of 4 stars on this is truly a reflection of our treatment by Mitch.

My last experience was horrible.  We had a new waiter who forgot several things on our order, rarely came to the table to check on us, and took over 3 hours to complete our dinner service.  This was completely unacceptable.  There were at least two other tables around us who were vocal about how dissatisfied they were.  
A few of examples of the bad service we got .....
1.  We ordered our pie and ten minutes later he came back to our table to ask us if we wanted the pie to go.
2.  We asked for the pie to be heated up and he forgot.
3.  I was parched because he rarely came back to refill our drinks.

I could have overlooked the bad service if the food was decent.  It was not.  I ordered the pretzel burger with fries.  My fries were extremely over-salted.  My husband agreed when he tried one.  My friend said that her dish was too salty, as well.  The waiter said that VI pretzel burger was better than Wendy&#39;s.  This one was not.  It was overcooked and dry.  Not even pie rush Wednesday will entice me to have dinner here again."

They open at 5:30am yet today I tried several times to call as I drove in and even let the phone ring from I-70 and Peoria all the way to Smith and Chambers...over 8 minutes from 5:52am to 6am and no one bothered to answer the phone.  Guess will just start calling orders to the Denny&#39;s on Peoria since the Village Inn on Colfax doesn&#39;t want the business...

Still not better and horribly watered down. Actually I&#39;ve never had a more watered down margarita in a bar! If you prefer juice with a lime wedge this is the margarita for you. My biggest issue today was not the margarita but the sign by the door about their horrible margaritas. Please add my name to the sign! What a rude business. How about instead of disrespecting your customers you fix the damn margarita and take the advise your customers are giving you to improve your business. Food still bar food, service still poor bathroom still gross. Patio and music outside fantastic!

The issue as far as I can tell is the outdoor space is completely wasted. Sure, there are some dated speakers bringing some tunes to some sunshine and there are a few mechanic shops you can oversee from the deck but who would care if you had access to the bar from outside. The bar is at the front and there is a seating space for food indoors that backs onto the bar, this space is almost always empty which creates a massive separation from the awesome deck space and sunshine. Is this place a dive bar or is it a rooftop type day bar with huge potential. Can&#39;t answer that... beer is reasonably priced but food is  slow par and seriously expensive for what you get. I really like this place, just wish someone would buy it and max the potential for expanding the crowd and making it more appealing for more than just the small bar space at the front. They are missing the awesomeness of this location for sure. I&#39;ll still be back, just hope someone invests a little"

Great views from the back deck. Nice funky bar feel inside. Wife ordered the Lupe Burger with fries and I tried the Chile Rellanos. The burger was very tasty, but a bit overcooked. The ciabatta bun was especially nice. The green chiles on the burger were grilled and delicious. The Chile Rellanos were very tasty but strange. When presented on the plate they looked almost like egg rolls smothered in green chile sauce. In fact, they were essentially green chiles stuffed with cheese and wrapped in a corn tortilla and deep fried. Unlike any chile rellanos I have ever had. They were very crunchy and a bit difficult to cut through but tasted good. The beans were perfect. Service was mediocre. It appeared that they needed more servers to handle the crowd. Christian, our server was very nice and polite but we had to chase him down to get any service beyond our initial order. I finally gave up trying to get a refill on my beer. Water was never refilled either. But I attribute that to simply not enough servers. Again had to chase someone down for the bill. No telling how ling we would have waited otherwise."

On my lunch visit the patio featured a nice mix of tables both in the sun and tucked into the shade of their covered awning. The view is somewhat hindered by the unsightly paved driveway/rear parking lot that creeps into frame, but focus on the mountains and lake, and it&#39;s very beautiful. I can only imagine how nice this place must be during sunset. 

It wasn&#39;t very busy on my visit, and the one waitress was very friendly and did a good enough job balancing the tables. 

The nachos caught my eye on their website, and as a bit of a connoisseur I can never say no. They arrive as an appealing mound of ground beef, melted shredded cheese, pico, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, very mild jalapenos, and a side of salsa. My biggest criticism would have to be that I was craving some freshly made tortilla chips, and these nachos are only made with store-bought chips straight from the tostitos bag. That felt a little cheap. 

Overall, I left relaxed from the view with a pretty satisfied nacho craving."

This was our first disappointing experience, so I am hoping it was just a fluke.  Although everyone was friendly as always, and our waitress was appropriately attentive, there was something terribly wrong with the &#34;large batch&#34; margaritas.  They were truthfully the weakest, least tasty I have ever had, so maybe this is the same thing the previous YELPER experienced.  I did mention it to our waitress, who dutifully asked for the next to be stronger/better, but the truth is that each serving was emanating from a large mixed batch.  So unless a single drink were to be made individually at the bar, the result would be (and was) the same.  Since the vibe, view and margaritas are what we keep coming back for (along with the awesome fajitas) and we often bring out of town guests, I am hoping this was just an infrequent recipe error.  We will definitely go back to check it out again, and will have our fingers crossed that the recipe will be better/right.  Would hate to cross Emerald Isle off our &#34;Go To&#34; list!"

I love that bar and I love being on that patio. To my surprise, Emerald Isle is a weird replica of The Platte. The decor is similar and the patio almost mirrors it as well, with a great view of the mountains. I have stopped by for drinks a few times, but this time, I thought I should try their food. I was in the mood for tacos. Well, when I am not in the mood for tacos? I got the crunchy ground beef tacos and Brian got the Philly sandwich. Overlooking Cherry Creek reservoir, this patio is perfect. There was a guy playing some jams in the sun while everyone sweats under umbrellas enjoying the summer. The food arrived quickly and was piping hot. The tacos were really good, but seemed to lack something.  I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but it was just lacking something. Brian really liked his sandwich, and seemed content with the flavors. The server was great and always attentive and ready to get more drinks for us.

But you guys have GOT to do something about the service.  When I go with my husband and we sit at the bar, they nail it.  Last time I believe it was  Kelly who served us and it was awesome.  Great drinks, quick, attentive service and he cracked us up when he got a few seconds which was awesome because he was pretty busy.  When I go with the whole fam and sit on the patio, it&#39;s a different story.  The view is awesome but for some reason it always takes the servers 10 minutes to even notice you.  Our server last night couldn&#39;t multitask at all.  She&#39;d take our order, walk right to the computer and enter it, walk right to another table, past another one,- hear they need the check, walk right by her two other tables who were ready to order, print the check, walk right by the other two tables who were ready to order,  and place the check on the initial table.  Then she took their card, walked right by her same two tables to the computer, left our drinks in the well and walked back out to deliver the card. I see why it takes ten minutes to get to us.  She then took our order and didn&#39;t write anything down.  This makes me nervous because you have to choose a meat with almost everything on the menu.  She screwed up 3 of the 4 orders. forgot half of one entirely and brought us the completely wrong appetizer.  I know we are supposed to say something but hey, it&#39;s awkward and I don&#39;t feel like waiting for more food and I&#39;m not that picky.  I&#39;m just trying to help.  It&#39;s literally like this every time I sit on the patio, every summer.  Slow service, forgotten items, steak instead of chicken and so on.  The crazy thing is there were two servers and 7 tables, most of which were two tops who where only drinking. 

I understand the bar tenders are usually employees through the winter seasons and they are way better at their jobs. They also usually act as managers and have more responsibilities. The servers usually only work for the summer and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s their first serving job.  Is there any way the bar tenders can maybe train the servers how to multitask and write things down?  It would really solve a lot of problems."

Should be a good sign right? Talked  hubby into going last Friday night to check it out. Walking in from the back parking lot we noticed several empty tables on the patio. Perfect! Except when we approached the hostess, she told us there were no tables open on the patio. When I told her we saw several, she said &#34;yeah, but the servers are overwhelmed and you&#39;ll have to wait at least 25 minutes.&#34; So we kind of looked around at the bar and the table area around the bar and said, &#34;do you mind if we wait over here?&#34; She kind of huffed and said &#34;okay.&#34; I asked her, &#34;would you like our name to add to your wait list?&#34; Got the huff again. We sat at our &#34;table&#34; for about 15 minutes, and since no one showed up to ask if we wanted a drink, my hubby went to the bar and ordered. I use the term &#34;table&#34; loosely because it was literally falling apart and you could not set your drink on it without it being in danger of falling off. The &#34;table&#34; top was coming unbolted from the legs and the legs were not in any better shape. After 25 minutes of seeing people leave from the patio and no one else being seated out there, the hubby went back and asked if we could now be seated and we were. Our waiter (can&#39;t remember his name, but super nice) was great!. We ordered the queso which was very good. The biggest problem with this place is the attitude of the &#34;hostess&#34;, cleanliness, blaring loud music inside when it&#39;s not full, falling apart furniture etc. The view is awesome and this could be a great place to hang. Will not be going back."

I can how ever tell that the staff walks around with a I don&#39;t care attitude and from little details it looks like they follow the lead of their manager or owner. Lights are broken paint chipped showing wear and tear. No patio umbrellas up unless you ask. As for the food and drink we had some house margaritas and they where actually pretty tasty. We had the nachos supreme and that was very good too. All the food I observed leaving the kitchen seemed to look very good.

Beer selection was meh, and prices were a bit high for happy hour.  We were told that they, &#34;don&#39;t split checks,&#34; but they begrudgingly worked with us to pay our bill separately.

Just a few Tex/Mex standards to choose from. Kinda weird that a place with a &#34;Irish&#34; sounding name serves Mexican food.  If you want sides with your entrée, it is extra. I ordered the single Chiles Rellenos. It did not come with beans or rice. I added a side of beans with it. The chili came battered and it was soggy. The &#34;top shelf&#34; &#39;rita was middle of the road at best.

The Isle is a great place during the summer when the patio is open for a local place to meet with friends but it would not be for the food, drinks of service."

Had a few of they&#39;re items on the menu and recommend the Mexican burger, it won&#39;t disappoint! Basically this is your regular neighborhood bar..

They have an extremely large patio out back that can accommodate a lot of people. When I was there with six others it was pretty full and there was still room for more people. For as large as it is, you might think the service wouldn&#39;t be that great, but they make up for its size with a lot of staff. There were more than a few staff members running around to make sure everyone was taken care of. 
 
The food wasn&#39;t spectacular, but it fit the bill for the evening. The menu is fairly large with all your standard bar items as well as a Mexican section with quite a few choices. I had some wings and potato skins. The wings were moist and fairly large and not too bad. The potato skins were a bit dry, but the pico de gallo and sour cream on the side helped with that a bit. And the blue margaritas washed it all down nicely. Overall, I had had a well rounded experience and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for a visit."

Upon arrival, I noticed a &#34; Please Wait to be Seated&#34; sign, and waited...and waited...and waited...and waited some more until my party of two, was acknowledged.  By then, two other parties had come in behind us and no other staff member, even from the nearby bar bothered to acknowledge all us guests.  We were seated to the West side of the patio, where there was a lovely view of trees, telephone wires, and roof tops.  NOT the ideal spot for viewing Cherry Creek.  The patio was insanely busy.  Our server was seemingly rushed and bore little patience when trying to review drink selections on an unfamiliar menu.  Though the menu was detailed in its description of their fruity drinks, they tasted like crap and had to be sent back.  The bloody mary was equally crap and questioned the server about whether the drinks were made with mixers, which she confirmed was the case.  I opted for wine instead thinking this was a safer option and the glass presented had residual lipstick, so that too got sent back.  I ordered nachos to share with my table and was disappointed with the product.  Hell, Taco Bell tastes better than the garbage they had on this plate!  The place cleared out rather quickly and weather turned chilly, so we moved indoors.  Service was slow until our other friends arrived and recognized as being &#34;regulars&#34;.  I guess you have to know the staff in order to get checked on!  I also noticed too, that the teeny bopper servers tend to cater to male patrons than they do females.  Avery runs karaoke here on Saturdays, so be prepared to wait out a long rotation!  Without warning, they&#39;ll have a band play here instead, so call ahead and check!

I went to this restaurant for my first and LAST visit recently.  Our waitress was a complete bubble brain and the service was terrible.   I asked for a draft beer...and she brought me a can.  Really?  When I pointed it out she stared at me like &#34;what&#39;s the difference?&#34;

Prior to ordering, we told the waitress we wanted separate checks. When she brought out one check, she was appalled that we had the gall to ask her to break it up.   It took no less than 4 tries to get the bills correct.

Apparently, she never got it right because days later I see that my credit card got charged twice.  When I noticed, I called the restaurant.  I spoke the manager, Cathy, who was not very helpful or customer service oriented.

And to top it all off, a week later my account still hasn&#39;t been credited for the overcharge."

You get a good, fun crowd (for the most part) and the song selection and sound system is decent.  It reminds me of one of my old karaoke haunts that I frequented before it went all Jersey Shore.  It&#39;s down to earth, no frills, and the drink prices are pretty good.  My only complaint would be that the service here can be really slow even if the place is nearly empty, but usually remedy that by going directly to the bar if I need a refill.  Tara is pretty quick, so I usually hope that she&#39;s working when I go.

The patio is the biggest selling point for this place.  The views are awesome at night and I can&#39;t wait to experience a sunset here while throwing back a delicious, cold beverage.  It&#39;s also huge with loads of seating.  Smoking is allowed on the patio, so if that offends you, I suggest you patron somewhere else.

The inside of the bar is a bit of a dive.  There&#39;s two sections to it.  The middle section is roomy with tvs and games to occupy you.  The front section is where the bar is located.  This section is what gives the Emerald it&#39;s dark, dive bar feel.  The furnishings are ugly and the lighting is low.  Perfect for beer goggle dating!  

The bathrooms are clean and there&#39;s tons of parking so this place is perfect if you have a large gathering.  They also offer food, but I&#39;ve yet to try it."

Ok so the service was not great and the food was just ok but there was a lot of everything.  The thing is how many places around here can we sit and watch the sunset with water in front of us?  To some the Cherry Creek Dam looks like a pond but for those of us who grew up in and around Denver the Dam looks good.  Ok so it is no ocean or lake but it is ours.

Oh back to Emerald Isle.  We probably go back for a Margaita and chips.  We use to go all the time when the kids were small.  They had great Burritos then and inexpenisve.  The prices aren&#39;t bad today either.  It&#39;s a neighborhood place.  Thats the good thing."

I am very glad we didn&#39;t. When we came into the Emerald Isle this time it was like a whole new bar. Not much about the decor had changed, but the atmosphere was very different. The place was packed with patrons, a karaoke DJ, and people were having an amazing time. The bartender, Danni, was nothing short of a delight. Not only was she a total rock star behind the bar, but she even got up and sang a couple of songs. We didn&#39;t get the chance to order any food, so I can&#39;t comment on the kitchen. The front part of the bar was very well cleaned. The staff worked very hard to make sure everything was wiped down and picked up,  and that everyone&#39;s glass was full. I can honestly say I was impressed. My husband and I had a very enjoyable time, and look forward to future visits."

I normally would not go back to a place that I had terrible service from, but the manager reached out to me after my first Yelp review and asked for me to give them a second chance. I am glad that I did. I was amazed by how much this place has changed. First of all, they are under new management and the service is amazing! My friend and I didn&#39;t go empty on our drinks. This is the FIRST time that this has happened at Emerald Isle! We had consistent service and the staff all appeared to be new. Very nice gals that waited on my friend and I. I also want to mention that they have so many more TV&#39;s and you can tell that they have done a ton of renovations. AND THE FOOD ROCKS NOW! Before the food was average maybe a little below. We had the chips and guacamole and also had the chili cheese fries which I highly recommend. I am happy to say that I am now a customer for life. It&#39;s nice to know that a manager cared so much to go out of her way and ask me to give them a second chance. NOW THAT speaks volumes."

The drink glasses keep getting smaller and smaller. The first time we noticed this we had ordered a Happy Hour drink which came in a smaller mug. On a whim, I also ordered a &#34;regular sized drink for $2 more. When it came out, I poured it into the &#34;smaller&#34;  happy hour mug. Guess what? They were the same size! 

Our last trip up on a Sunday, we got the $3.75 Happy Hour margaritas and they came out in these tiny, little mugs. When I looked at the menu again, it said their regular Margarita&#39;s were also $3.75 so I asked the waitress what the difference was. She said no difference and that the mugs were 13oz mugs. I honestly do not think they were any bigger than 10oz. In any case, she brought me a bigger margarita with a bigger price of $5.75. My husband ordered a long island tea which have always come in a pint sized glass. His also arrived in this little, 10oz mug AND he was charged almost $7 for it! Top that off with the fact that we ordered the happy hour nachos and got charged full price as well. 

This has always been a favorite spot for us. We love the deck and even though the food isn&#39;t anything to write home about, it has always been decent. The drinks were usually sized right for the price, but this last time was just too much. Even other people around us were laughing at the little baby mugs they got served drinks in. I hate to say it, but as much as we love this place, I highly doubt we will be back."

And that is where the good ends, I stopped in this place after work and sat down and waited close to 10 minutes before they came over to take my order.  To top it off it was not busy at all, place is dirty and servers need some training.  One of the servers kept pulling down her very tight and short shorts and then was handling food the thought of her handling my food was enough.  Paid for my drinks and was out.

I am looking for a way to blame my tight tingley skin and bloated belly on the Emerald Isle alone but clearly I played some role in the way I ended up today. Oh well why complain when I had such fun on their patio gazing out at the stellar view. One that makes me once again feel like I am cheating the other 49 states that make up this fine nation. It is one of the best views around, Cherry Creek Reservoir and the entire Front Range spilling out before you from north to south, it is quite grand indeed. 

A buddy of mine and I rode on over today and after we parked the bike we strolled on in and sat down on the patio. The server was really cute and helpful and attentive. I dig it when you get good service and we were taking our own sweet time ordering our lunches. This irked her in no way whatsoever and it made us feel quite at home and able to just sit and enjoy and catch up. To not feel rushed around on a Sunday afternoon, in the sunshine, with booze ... it is really swell. 

I believe I have mentioned my great love and devotion for the avocado before. Today I ordered the BLT with avocado. It came with a TON of really delicious and perfectly ripe avocado. I was most pleased. The bacon was also super yummy and the bread was not too thick ( scrape the hell outta your mouth) and not too thin ( this won&#39;t hold my sammie together) it was just right. The fries were also quite good and a bit like Steak-n-Shake fries .... dare I say? Maybe just not quite as thin but gosh darn close. Satisfied was I. 

The margs were also really tasty ... good amount of booze, enough to make a difference in your demeanor .... in a good way and not in a &#34;oh I will have to apologize tomorrow&#34; way. This can be important. I also must admit that at my age sometimes, every so often drinking a margarita will induce a bout of gut wrenching, God take me now heartburn ..... not so today. This too made me feel happy .... not to mention grateful. 

Good job everyone. I will be back and today wasn&#39;t my first time either. I might even be so lucky as to bump into Miss Norah and all her biker buddies next time .... fingers crossed!"

The service has never been great, but they do have some of the best cheese fries. 

This visit was not fun! I stopped by this week for lunch before we headed to the pool. I ordered a Santa Fe salad...I know, sounds delicious. Don&#39;t let the name fool you. It was a pile of iceberg lettuce, a grilled chicken breast, and a ring of tomato and jalapenos. I could have gotten a prettier salad at McDonald&#39;s and for less than $8.00. 

I also noticed on my credit card that the Emerald Isle charged me three separate times for the same amount. I called Jackie, the manager, who sounded like she had been enjoying too many beers on the patio. She couldn&#39;t help me or didn&#39;t offer to take my name or number, but just for me to call back on Monday to speak with the owner. 

Oh well. I&#39;ll just choose to take my patio sitting elsewhere!"

My wife had the unfortunate event of having her business move from a great location to Parker and I-225.  She hates this area and the drive sucks...but the silver lining in the cloud that is Aurora is this AWESOME place.

We came here and had a great lunch on their massive deck.  The beer was cold, the service was great and the food was spicy enough for me to break a little bit of a sweat.

We have been back three other times.  The waitstaff remembered us and asked my wife how here new location was working out for her.  I was impressed that they remembered us after our first visit three weeks earlier.

If you are coming here and expecting Cherry Creek service, food, drinks and prices..you will be unhappy.  This place is not posh, and you will not be treated as if you are more important than others that are here. (That is a good thing.) You will be treated as a regular regardless if you are or not.

If you are coming here to enjoy someone&#39;s company, on a great deck with an AWESOME view, with good food, and drinks that are cold brought to you by a wait staff that is fun and and can carry a great conversation because they are real people ...you found a great place that is called Emerald Isle Restaurant.  (That is one crazy run-on sentence...but I&#39;m sure you caught my drift!)

I love this place and will be be back again when I have the wonderful opportunity to lunch with my wife.

Thank you Emerald Isle for be a great, independent, local restaurant in the midst of chain suburbia.  You are a AWESOME."

I&#39;m not local to the area so I read the Yelp reviews in order to know what to expect.

I wasn&#39;t there to eat so I can&#39;t tell you about the food. I will say that the staff were friendly and attentive and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. 

I was there at night, so the deck was primarily used for smoking. No problem, it was kinda chilly out there anyway.

The interior of the bar is all wood. It does kinda feel like you&#39;re in a cabin or maybe a road-house, but it isn&#39;t rough, it is comfortable.

The karaoke was fun. They have a great song selection and good sound. The local crowd filled just about every seat at the bar and they were some entertaining singers.

This has an absolutely wonderful patio--Yet plastic chairs.. Uncomfortable!!! Great view-No service. Okay---Finally we order.  I order the tex mex--Canned.. Nothing is fresh, not even the meat.  He orders a sandwich. Same deal--Nothing is fresh.. Nothing is unique.. I guess if you like canned beans, canned enchilada sauce, I&#39;m not certain about the rice, this is the place for you.. For me.. I was really disappointed. The location and deck make this an attractive place that could really be something special in the spring and summer.  The inside is very out dated. But that can be overcome by good staff that cares about the customer experience.  Frankly, get on Bar Rescue, because this is one that has good up side, with very bad customer service and food....

We ordered 2 PBRs (on tap). We had to wait like 4 minutes as the tender was helping someone else. When we got said beers he comped them since we had to wait which totally wasn&#39;t a big deal, but awesome! 

I order green olives in my PBR when avail. The tender didn&#39;t shoot dirty looks when it was requested as often times happens. In fact every time we ordered another round he put 2 olives in one of the beers. Sweet! 

There was some wasted middle agers, seemed like most of the clientele were of this variety. 

I hope this place is open during blizzards so I can sip some booze in a cabin.

P.S. they played that B-52s song &#34;Rock Lobster&#34; which is STILL in my head. Awesome."

I ordered food - the Chicken Verde plate was better than I expected.  Both the female and the male (Steve) bartender were great.  They had Barefood wine, which was fine by my immature wine palate.  

Overabundance of men, not many women if that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeking.  The odds are good, but the good are odd.  

I&#39;d go back just to be weirded out again. . . The patio does look great for a daytime soiree."

I was expecting it to be a lot busier, but I&#39;m not complaining! We sat outside on the enormous patio and had a pitcher of beer. My boyfriend got food, and it looked delicious. Huge plate. Don&#39;t really have any complaints about the place, they were having karaoke inside, but from our spot on the patio we couldn&#39;t hear it. I would like to visit this place again, because it seems like a good hangout place. I would especially like to go at sunset, because I bet the sun setting over the cherry creek dam would be beautiful."

On girls&#39; night, after the clubs and see-and-be-seen, you just want a spot where you can gossip and chat with the girls.  That&#39;s Emerald Isle for us.  Except, their closing hours are rather sporadic, and we can&#39;t always guarantee they&#39;ll be open after midnight.

It&#39;s a weird little place just off Cherry Creek reservoir. It was stifling hot the day we ate there. We sat on the indoor patio but were sweltering - definitely would not do that again. Outside on the patio it was crowded and loud, although I do think there was seating in an enclosed area of the restaurant. Not sure if it was air-conditioned though, and it probably wasn&#39;t considering how open the place was.

I don&#39;t recall what the service was like, but I don&#39;t think it was stellar. The food was usual bar food, and pretty bland. 

This might be a nice spot to relax on cooler days, or a great place for bikers. I think they have live music on the weekends, but without a web site, I really can&#39;t say!!!"

It&#39;s a bit far for me, but it was a decent place. Nice patio out back. Some of the food is good, especially for a cheap price, but I heard the nachos were disappointing. The first time I came here there was a live band which was HORRENDOUS. Well, actually, just the singer was horrendous. But other than that, the place has a nice, relaxing atmosphere. Seems to be a slightly older crowd. Service was good the first couple of times, but the last time we went there, something was off. One of my coworkers was smoking a cigar, and one of the waitresses walked over to him and told him about her friend or someone she knew who got cancer. She wasn&#39;t even our waitress. I&#39;m not a fan of smoking myself, and I really appreciate the no smoking in public establishments laws back on the east coast, but I know they don&#39;t apply here. So was it really her place to tell him off??? It was just bizarre. And then our waitress misplaced his credit card for like half an hour. So there&#39;s good and bad. 3 stars."

The bartender was nice but the TV&#39;s were all over the place (flip back and forth) between an early season Av&#39;s game and the CU game and Baseball then back.  Not good.  The stereo was blaring so you couldn&#39;t hear the games nor each other sitted across from each other at a duece.  The nachos were decent but without consistency on the tube we went down the street to Brewery Bar where they had all the games on separated TV&#39;s so you could see them all at once.

The last time I went, they had only been open four months and there were some kinks that needed worked out.

This time, my burger was cooked perfectly and I&#39;d say it was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. That&#39;s right! As a gourmet burger connoisseur, I have high expectations for burgers. This one was right up there with my other two faves at Plan Check in West LA and BRGR in Las Vegas.

Although many burgers on the menu had topping combinations I&#39;d like, the Summer Thyme Burger combined it all: cheese, onions, bacon, avocado, aioli, arugala, thyme drizzle. I especially love cheese, bacon, avocado and aioli on my burgers. It was heaven in my mouth every bite I took. I had to keep myself from eating the entire thing in one sitting (I would have been uncomfortably full), it was that good. My tastebuds said &#34;more&#34; but my stomach said &#34;enough!&#34;

As before, the beer list is very impressive. There were a couple brewery reps in at the bar, promoting their beers. So it was cool to get to chat with them and learn about the beers while drinking them. They were actually more attentive than the bartender that particular night, but really no complaints on service.

I&#39;ll definitely go back whenever I&#39;m in town."

This place was cool when it first opened. Food is decent and the beer selection is vast. The service used to be on point; you would have bartenders and/or waiters/waitress asking if you were ok about every 10 minutes. Now it seems as though even if you were to waive a twenty dollar bill in their face the staff could not care less about keeping your business. 

My boyfriend and I went in a few weeks ago and were greeted nicely and served water immediately. We sat at the bar and wanted to order dinner, which we informed them of our intentions. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. We waited about 20 minutes; in that time we weren&#39;t asked about our drink order, so forget about the food. Did I mention that we were passed by about 5 different bartenders and was never asked once if we wanted to get anything while we had menus sitting right in front of us? ... We decided to leave and just chalked it up it be an off night. 

Last week we went in with our two friends and this time we were asked our order; maybe the other night was just and fluke!!! But then everything was SO SLOW to come out. We ordered drinks but then it turned out two of the kegs had tapped out, no big deal other options were ordered. The other two drink orders, the ones not out of stock, still took SO LONG to come out... At that point we decided to skip ordering food because of how long it took to get our drink orders. I could understand if it was a packed, busy weekend night...but it wasn&#39;t. It was a Monday night with about 15 people in the bar area (at most).

I really liked this bar when it first opened but after my last two experiences, let&#39;s just say it will be a LONG TIME before I return."

We were a group on approx 20 that were asked to leave The Tavern in Littleton and needed somewhere else to go in a hurry. We arrived here shortly after 7pm and they had room for us. Woo hoo! 

The service was a little slow to start, it was like 20 people had just walked in or something, but after it got going it was all good. We all received water as soon as we arrived which was great. The waitress was very attentive and check in us often. We were sitting right next to the till so she couldn&#39;t get away from us really. 

The drinks menu is enormous, and they do flights - yay! 4 X 5oz beers at a time, so if you finish one you can order another. I really like the aspen silver pale ale and blue mountain dry cider. I tasted someone&#39;s stout as well and it was surprisingly good, it&#39;s the very last thing on the drinks menu but I can&#39;t remember it&#39;s name. My hubby ordered a scotch from that same menu I was using, and so did a few people, till we worked out they were scotch beers! What? They were really good about it, took them away and got the guys some real scotch. 

To eat, we got the tempura green beans to start, the wasabi sauce with them was amazing!! My hubby got a Cajun burger with sweet potato fries, he liked it but my bite was a little less Cajun that I expected. The winner of all salads ever - and I am so serious - is the Shaved Brussels. I&#39;ve never wanted to try and recreate a salad at home but this one I took a picture of the menu so I could try. When I fail I&#39;ll be back for it. When my hubby tried it I lost my salad, he loves Brussels more than I do. The best part for me was the amount of dressing, perfect. I&#39;m not a salad dressing person and usually get it in the side, this time I forgot but it worked out great. 

The bill came to about $65, that&#39;s 1 flight, 1 beer, 1 scotch and the food. Not too bad especially for quality food."

My guy and I occasionally meet some friends here to watch football games. The service is always pretty quick and there is a very impressive drink selection here. Once I had a basic mixed drink that did not have enough alcohol, the next time I ordered it, it had too much. Cocktails aren&#39;t really their area of expertise, the beer is what you come here for.

The food is absolutely outstanding, unique and high quality flavors. The green chili is very good. I usually just have a small cup with a beer during a game. The staff is very friendly and it is a large place so there is always a place to sit, even when it is busy."

I&#39;m afraid to reveal my favorite in attempts to keep this Littleton spot from attracting the masses - which is bound to happen since they tout having more taps than any establishment in Colorado. 

Here&#39;s what I love about this place - a glance at the beer list and you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s quite a range of delicious offerings from The Big Bad Baptist, to Stone enjoy by, to sours from across the globe, but all landing in an $8-9 range. The beauty is they offer 5oz samples for just $2 if it&#39;s an $8 beer or less. 

Did you catch that? 5oz samples for $2. How many can you try? I don&#39;t know but me and my wife managed to try 19. Yes, 19 freakishly delicious beers from coast to coast. 

The food is a bit pricy with a bison burger coming in at just over $16 bucks. But you&#39;ll see what the fuss is all about as soon as you&#39;re towering burger slides in front of you by you&#39;re smiling server. Had I had a measuring tape I would suspect they were about 6&#34; high. There&#39;s no easy way around it so just grab it and start getting messy. 

I&#39;ve been here half a dozen times now and the one thing I hope the pint room perfects is their consistency. Some items like sandwiches have been hit or miss but when I&#39;m quick to get disappointed, I look to the array of beer samples in front me. 

You also won&#39;t go wrong with any of their house made sauces like ranch. Ranch on fries, ranch on the burgers, ranch on the onion rings, oh ranch I love you. 

Also ask what their beer of the night is (another hidden gem of this place). Often they will pick a brewery and all pints are just $3 and some nights you get to keep the glass. 

So pull up, have a burger and a beer, and enjoy this amazing Littleton establishment."

The bar is so big there&#39;s no way you could miss it. And the staff is super welcoming and helpful.  Definitely a plus for a bar with over 100 beers on tap.  

Stopped in here to check it out the other night.  Sadly I had already eaten so I didn&#39;t try any food, but they have a good looking and interesting menu.  Two staff members recommended the Brussels sprout app but even that wouldn&#39;t have left room for beer and that&#39;s what I went in for.

The staff was awesome.  Seriously awesome.  The GM was running around, serving, cleaning, working hard.  I love seeing that.  Our server was nice, polite, attentive, knowledgeable, and quick on the draw.

The beers were tasty and there were a lot of them to choose from.  Like, an absurd amount to choose from.  I&#39;d say too many, but that&#39;s not a thing when it comes to beer.  Only negative about the beer was I went 2-4 on getting the one I asked for.  They seem to run out of some quickly.  Bit of a bummer to decide on a beer only to find out they&#39;re out of it.  Twice.

The food was pretty solid.  The cheese curds were perfectly fried and hot when they came out, and even tasty when cooled off.  My country fried steak burger was a bit soggy and fell apart quickly, but was overall unique and good.

I liked it.  I want to come back and sit at the bar and have a few beers and an appetizer.  And I will do so soon enough."

We have heard about this place and finally decided to try it.
It&#39;s very impressive, as you notice the beer tap wall the moment you walk into the place. The taps line the wall of the bar, where approximately 30+ people can sit.
It&#39;s very impressive.  There are 7 televisions above the bar, so it&#39;s a nice place to sit back and have a beer.

We decided to sit at one of the high top tables in the bar area, and proceeded to order. My husband and I split the classic burger, with the green chili, as well as fruit, for sides.  The burger came, and it was not that appetizing. We did eat our burger, as we were hungry (it was a late lunch). It truly, was not that great, really. I was disappointed, nothing to go out of your way for.

Parking - private lot that is shared by all of the establishments there, so, plenty of parking.

Service - good, and the employees all seemed really nice.

Overall - not worth the time, unless you only want a beer."

My husband and I went to the Pint Room on a well-deserved date night.  It was bigger than it seems, and we got a table in the back of the restaurant.  We loved how the menu had beers from many of the breweries we like to visit.  

We ordered the Brussel sprouts to start.  We are by no means connoisseurs of the delectable dish, but we have had better sprouts before.  They weren&#39;t crispy or thin sliced, which are two necessities of the dish. 

I ordered a burger with mushrooms and a fancy cheese (gruyere, maybe?)  It tasted like they might have forgotten to put any sauce on it because it was in need of some extra flavor.  The meat was delicious, but my husband won when he ordered the Sicilian style burger. 

A big party was seated next to us, and it kept growing until there were people standing around our table and we had to cup our ears to hear each other.  It was just like home, so we decided leave.

I will be back to try it again as I hoped for a minimum four star.  I was torn, as the beer selection and burgers SHOULD get them to four stars.....

PROS:

- Great atmosphere, especially patio seating.  Music was good too.
- Exceptional Service!  Very welcoming, friendly and attentive.
- beer selection is quite expansive and an impressive sight.


CONS:

- Colorado Heavy.  I am a fan of local, but in my opinion there are too many Colorado beers, and ones that are VERY common and easy to find.  I would rather see 50-75 less taps and see them offer harder to find beers, and mix in a few more from VT, CA, OR, and MI (for starters). Hopefully they will get there, as they have TONS of potential.

- Food was mediocre.  

Bar &#34;Bacon&#34; was a little soggy. More of a braised pork belly preparation.  When I think &#34;bacon&#34; I expect smoke and some chew, this lacked both.

Beer temp - NOT cold enough. Was close to room temp, which would be fine if it was bitters in a London pub.

The burgers SHOULD be incredible.  Kudos on the selection and flavor profiles of burgers.  Execution was NOT there.   5 alarm burger ordered medium was overcooked with zero pink and highly under seasoned.  Additionally the habaneros and jalapeños had seeds and ribs removed which stole all the heat.  The brioche bun was slightly stale (air exposure).  Fries were a little undercooked and not served hot.


All that said, I want this to be THE place I take out of towners when they visit.  It&#39;s close and I think a little less volume and a little more focus gets them there!

Best of luck to the Pint Room."

1 star for the burger. Honestly, i must have ordered the wrong one for lunch. I asked for it medium (or medium rare if I could get it). It came out well done. If I am paying over $10 for a burger, it needs to be cooked perfectly. It was not juicy. It was well done flavorless hockey puck even though it should have had Cajun flavor. I think they waved the spice can over the top without flipping it over. Next time, i will likely try something else or hit up McDonalds or Freddie&#39;s on the way home."

I&#39;ll start with the positive. The cheese curds were amazing and made me want to give this place 5 stars.... Until the rest of the food showed up. The fries could have been great if they were fried about 3-4 minutes less. They weren&#39;t crunchy and weren&#39;t soft which makes the texture and bite taste almost stale. Totally disappointing when the main item for me to keep coming back is the fries. The burger, well it wasn&#39;t cooked medium as I ordered so it was dry. There was no sauce so that made it even more dry. I tried the meat of the burger plain and there wasn&#39;t really any flavor so I would suggest adding more seasoning. I thought this place was going to be amazing as I stated the cheese curds were some of the best I have had and the Sriracha ranch served with them was tasty but I can&#39;t go somewhere and get full off of that.

Okay update 30 seconds later. My husband said give them 4 stars because the beer selection on tap is awesome."

They have a kajillion beers on tap and most of them are local.  The staff are all uber friendly and helpful.  The place has a really comfy and nice aesthetic, with the recycled wood and the super long bar area.  

So many breweries don&#39;t have specials, and this feels like a brewery, bc they serve small batched beer, but it isn&#39;t.  I would like to see them have a more generous happy hour menu and happy hour eats.  I would come here a lot more if they did.  While I&#39;m wishing,  I also wish they had a few more light wheat beers as well. But that&#39;s pretty small stuff. 

The coolest thing are the small tasters for 2.00. You can try so many beers for such a small price and without getting wasted.  The barkeep let me have teensy tasters of things I was curious about.  They are working on getting a full bar on, with small batch distilleries from across the state as well.  It will be a match in heaven for me if they create local cocktails at a happy hour price as well as 6 kajillion beers.

Tip: if you want to taste a few beers with out stumbling home poor ask for the short 5 oz beer. Its only 2 bucks.

Their food is great as well.  Their burgers are a mix of ground Chuck and Wagyu beef. Wow you can taste the smoky quality in every bite.

I&#39;m Yelping at the top of my lungs about this place.  
In fact I drive an hour from my home town just to get there, yeah its that good."

I gave the bartender my credit card to start a tab. My sister-in-law gave her credit card at the end of the meal to pay for our dinner and signed the tab.

Had a great bloodymary made by the low rider Chicka.  Our waiter the handsome beer delivery guy was great and so was the food.

Great burgers that are creative without being scary, same with sandwiches. Cheese curds that are tempura fried rather than bread crumb battered and they are amazing dipped in sriracha ranch. But the beers. The selection is mind boggling and most come from Colorado. The best news is, for $2-4 dollars, one can get a 4 oz. sample of any or all the things. So comparing and contrasting multiple beers without getting super trashed is possible. The booths were large and gave a sense of privacy. Comfortable, delicious, and beer- an excellent night out!"

This place has a stellar selection of brews on tap in a time when it seems most places want to force me into a small selection on one type of microbrew and the usual monotony of bland major beer brands.  This place has beers on tap from all over the place and includes Colorado beers even I&#39;d never heard of.  And despite the current trendyness of many places that offer only IPA, double IPA, Super IPA, Mega IPA etc, the Pint Room has lagers, wheats, ambers, and all the other great choices of beer types that exist in the world.  

They have plenty of HDTV&#39;s up showing sports etc too.  I think this may be a new place for me to watch football this season.

On top of a great beer selection, they offer incredible tasting burgers.  You&#39;d think burgers have been done every possible way imaginable by now, but I have tried 2 there that I&#39;d never imagined before.  At the suggestion of our waiter, we had a PBJ burger that had strawberries on it and habanero cheese.  It didn&#39;t sound appealing to me, but I tried it anyway.  It blew me away!!  And it went so well with the beer I was drinking, I just couldn&#39;t believe it.  Can&#39;t wait to try more new beers and food there!

The wait staff are fun and even the new people have great suggestions and aren&#39;t snobby if you don&#39;t order a Quadruple Extra Extreme IPA beer like some other trendy pubs are around Denver these days.  They didn&#39;t even mind that I don&#39;t have a big bushy beard and shaved head!  OMG this place is great!

They also have outside seating on a dog friendly patio next to the Platte River.  I&#39;m always hesitant when people bring their dogs to eating establishments, but here they have a box with a small blanket for your pooch and a water dish.  My friends puggle is very mild mannered and quiet and seems to love hanging by the table on the matt provided.  I haven&#39;t seen any dogs inside, but don&#39;t know what the policy there is.  The dogs I&#39;ve seen outside have all been really nice dogs, quiet, friendly and well behaved in public."

How can this be a  bad place? Well, it can. What is the point of having so many beers on tap, if you don&#39;t have any in stock? It took me about 3 orders before I picked a beer that they actually had. The idea of 175 beer choices is awesome, but they need to keep up on refilling these.  My other thought it, I hope they have a handle on cleaning out those taps.
We ordered calamari to start with.  The server then said, &#34;I am going to bring you out some bacon. It is $3 and you will each get a piece&#34;. Ummm, okay. Thanks for asking if we wanted this bacon. The calamari came out and it was exquisite. There is no better word to describe it. The sauce that it was tossed in was tangy and not overpowering. It was laying on a bed of crispy rice noodles and bell peppers that were also drizzled with the same amazing sauce. I could eat this calamari everyday. The $3 bacon came out and I grabbed a piece. They were limp.  I like my bacon to be crispy, but this was just a thick cut of fatty bacon.  My fiance loved it, but I thought it was awful.
We then ordered our burgers.  I went with the classic, medium rare with american cheese.  I asked what the fresh vegetable side was and the server stated it could either be a squash medley or brussel sprouts. She didn&#39;t seem to make any effort to find out which it was when I asked, so I went with the french fries. At this point the server had already forgotten about a beer that we ordered and pretty much forced us to buy bacon. The burgers came out and I started to chow down. The meat was nowhere near medium rare. It was a good solid medium to medium well.  I continued to eat it hoping that maybe once I got towards the center there would at least be some pink. No, no pink. I wasn&#39;t in the mood to complain, and really gave up on this place being awesome at that point. I have spoken to a few others about this place and they all have the same issues. In theory this place could be fabulous, but really, it isn&#39;t worth it."

We had ridden our bikes by this place on our way to Platt River Saloon (which was a fantastic first experience - very warm and welcoming and fun) and decided to check it out next time.  On the way back we decided not to wait and stop for a beer since we are major appreciators of good beer and they&#39;re called the Pint Room!  We locked up our bikes and I was so distracted by the scolding sign telling patrons &#34;under no circumstances will anyone be allowed to bring their bikes on to the patio...&#34; Or something along those lines that I must have missed the &#34;please wait to be seated&#34; sign.  
We saw one table left on the patio near the rail looking over the river and started to sit down.  THAT is where we wanted to sit. We were greeted with a dirty look and told to GET UP and go to the front of the restaurant to see the hostess.  Maybe this is one of their many rules, but it was so rude.  No &#39;welcome&#39;, no &#39;I&#39;m sorry but...&#39;  As we got up, I noticed the restaurant was really long and completely empty other than some people at the bar.  Was there really anyone even up there? 
The girl had gone over to a few other girls and they seemed all worked up about that last railing table. Talking quickly and intensely while looking back and forth between us and the table. It was weird.  
I went up and said, &#34;so I have to go all the way up there?  One of you can&#39;t just seat us?&#34;  &#34;She said well it&#39;s just that we can&#39;t seat you there.&#34;  I said &#34;you can&#39;t seat us on the patio?&#34;  &#34;She said &#34;no, any other table is fine, just not that one&#34;  obviously we didn&#39;t appear to be a high enough value customer to warrant the &#34;good table&#34; even when the place was relatively EMPTY other than the railing tables.  Yes it was a bigger table and there were only two of us, but a few of the other large riverside tables only had two people so that&#39;s a bunch of bull.  It&#39;s not like there was a line of people either.  So feeling incredibly unwelcome and insulted, I said &#34;I guess we&#39;re just going to leave&#34;. And she said in the happiest voice she could muster &#34;really???? Okay!&#34; 
I rarely write bad reviews- but it was the worst first impression I&#39;ve ever had and terrible customer service.  Maybe it was my bike helmet hair? 
Anyway, it put a major sour note at the end of an otherwise great &#39;date-day&#39; - the first without the kids in quite a while. We were definitely going to spend some money!
It must have something going for it by the looks of some of the good reviews but we weren&#39;t even given a chance! 
We will definitely keep riding our bikes right on by this pretentious unwelcoming place on our way to platt River saloon!"

An eclectic yet very cool fusion of multiple dining concepts. It&#39;s a high end beer bar (175 beers on tap from all sorts or micro breweries), a comfortable family dining experience that allows kids to be kids, offering unique burgers, good salads and apps (we loved the tempura green beens with the wasabi and honey mayo dipping sauce and the fried cheese curds with their own unique Sriracha enhanced dipping sauce.

I like to try different burgers,  so I went for the PBB&amp;J burger, cooked perfectly medium to my order. It was delicious! The peanut butter and jelly flavors did not overpower yet added a a surprisingly pleasant balance to the usual Bacon cheese burger flavors we are all familiar with.  I had the gigantic onion rings as my side... As our waiter Sam said... &#34;They are like onion donuts&#34; referring to their epic size. They were a meal by themselves. My only critical thought was that candied bacon on the burger was a bit too sweet for my taste. 

My kids also ordered unique  burgers and enjoyed them as well. 

I ordered a flight of 4 sample size wheat beers, each very good and completely distinct. That was an experience in and of itself. 

The atmosphere was fun, loud, very clean and with nice views of the Platte river out the enormous picture widows. 

The Pint room is very large for a beer bar but they make sure to be very attentive to each table. 

The Pint Room is not a typical beer bar. It&#39;s about as high end as a beer bar can get. The prices reflect this, but I believe are very fair for all that you receive as a patron

We will definitely be returning!"

To start off the night myself and 5 other ladies came for dinner to celebrate a birthday. Our server was not nice and very unaccommodating. One friend asked to taste the homemade sangria and immediately was told no. Ok...I get that, you can&#39;t sample drinks. Then one other friend had questions on the menu and the server seemed very bothered and impatient. The burger menu is extensive with lots of flavors and tastes, so another friend asked if she could taste the mint, avocado mayo before ordering...immediate no. So we asked if we ordered fries could they bring a sample and the server agreed but seemed so annoyed.

Finally our food comes....I ordered a &#34;homemade&#34; veggie burger, while trying to cut it in half my knife got stuck. I picked it up to pull it apart and a huge crinkled up piece of paper was in the middle of my veggie burger. It was so disgusting it was greasy and intentional put there. It was the size of my hand. The other entrees were done incorrectly and the tacos were cold and not good. 

The owner was very apologetic and offered us another meal...but who wants to eat after that. But I was so hungry that I ordered a chicken sandwich, after a very long time it came and it was so salty I could hardly eat it. 

The owner was very apologetic and I could tell he was embarrassed, he took all the food off our bill. Truth is I gave one star only for him. I will never go back and I would like to warn anyone who eats there not to ask too many questions or upset a server because you NEVER know what they&#39;ll put in your food."

I really liked how they designed the place and rows of taps at the bar. Defiantly they put thought into it.

Very clean done area. Bathrooms were clean.

Menu looked awesome. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp which was good &amp; a salad. Salad was awesome.

Everything was reasonably priced.

Reason I didn&#39;t give a 5 star was for two reason:

1) The wait staff, although friendly, lacked knowledge of their menu. Maybe I had a new employee or something? But it was annoying that they didn&#39;t even know what was on the menu.

2) the bacon was a little burnt and dry that was on the shrimp. It seemed the bacon had been sitting around way too long. Any cook with a little attention of detail would of saw that, and recooked a few slices and added it to the shrimp.

Still a cool place, just need to step up those fine details."

Then tried to open the umbrella cause it was sunny (naturally on a patio) it was too windy.  The waiter told me DO NOT open the umbrella. The wind will take it.   So overall. All rules shit service.

The interior is open, breezy, and has a nice combination of industrial and cozy touches. The service was great - our waiter was patient and answered all of our questions. Food was excellent! Large variety of familiar and creative dishes and everything we ordered tasted awesome. 

The beer selection was the best I&#39;ve ever seen from a tap room! Usually, tap rooms can get away with having only a few local craft breweries on tap, and the rest of the beers are from larger, more established places. The Pint Room did an excellent job curating a beer selection that is incredibly varied from breweries that are lesser known. Wonderful job!"

Ya see, winter is coming and my torso will require additional layers of blubber to remain a warm, breathing human being. A diet of beer and meat is essential for the aforementioned blubber-bolstering process. Seeing that The Pint Room had a good rating on Yelp compounded by the fact that they tout an arsenal of over 100 beers on tap I had to verify the awesomeness.

I phoned in a carry-out order of the Hangover Burger cooked medium-well with a side of fries. My significant other ordered the club sandwich. When I called them there was a noticeable amount of decibels happening inside the restaurant which means business is good, which hints at potential quality. The staff member on the phone was friendly taking my order and walked me through a selection of their sauces. I ordered as many sauces that seemed like they would be compatible with my burger order. Estimated wait time for food was 20 minutes.

The Pint Room facility looked newer and had a very clean look. The restaurant offers a long bar seating area that runs parallel to the masterpiece that is the row of beer taps. The 20 minute wait time was accurate for we arrived 5 minutes early to sample from the smorgasbord of beers. Bar staff was friendly and food arrived timely as I was annihilating my brew. Back to my cave (home).

Arrived back at my cave with my satchel of meat, bun, and my cuboid-shaped fried potato units. At first bite I swear I had seen Jesus but instead I was staring at my Hangover burger. The sunny side egg&#39;s yolk within oozed out unto my plate and served as dipping liquid. The bacon was cooked to a firmer-than-average consistency; which is ideal for me. The sauces were not killer but served their purpose to act as a lubricant for my god-burger. Fries were tasty and coated in salt which is ok in my book. Fries were also not too soft or too overly-cooked but juuust right(Goldilocks would approve). My significant other attested that her club sandwich was akin to sex but slightly not as good as fornication but a close second.

In conclusion, we partook in eating dinner here for three consecutive nights due to exemplary satisfaction and have had 2 more nonconsecutive eating experiences here. Coming from a different state this place was a great method of sampling some of the local Colorado beers. As for Mission: Blubber Possible, it was a great success. I suggest offsetting meals here with occasional kale shakes for best health results. I will definitely return here when I am in need of delectable meal provisions."

The beer listing, and the assortment of burgers, are both something I would enjoy methodically working my way through.  I had the Black and Blu Burger.

They have a great patio with a nice section for dogs. Love that! I found the burger to be underwhelming. (I got the special of the day which was a philly style). Lacked flavor and &#34;pizzaz&#34;. The fries are really good. But the worst part was watching a food runner mistakenly give my husband&#39;s burger to the patron next to us. When the patron pointed out the error, they took it back in the kitchen. Count to 10 and out it came to our table. Very obviously the same burger that had just been mistakenly served to the other guy. I don&#39;t think we will be going back."

Both times experienced terrible customer service. The first time the food was awesome. But on the second visit my &#34;medium&#34; burger looked to be more of a rare or medium rare. As well as the fries were very hard/over cooked. Not once in the two visits did  anyone care to ask how the food was and multiple times numerous employees would walk past seeing that my drink was empty but only once was I asked if I needed another drink and it wasn&#39;t even the bartender who asked seemed to be the bar back. And I could understand if they were completely busy and trying to take care of multiple guest but both times they were not busy at all. So if you don&#39;t mind having to ask for everything I guess this place wouldn&#39;t be to bad. But for me when I&#39;m paying someone for my food I like to receive a little bit of attention. And to end on a positive note they do have a large selection of beer to choose from.

Unfortunately I went here around 230pm for a late lunch which may be the cause for my issues. Asked for a burger medium and got it rare to med rare maybe. Bun wasn&#39;t that great almost fell apart as dry as it was. To me the food was just mediocre. Service was the worst. Took our server 10 minutes to come back after giving us beers to take our food order, and when we needed the check he spent more time chatting with other tables all the way to the register and all the way back further delaying our departure.

Our server Dylan was phenomenal. He made excellent beer suggestions and was incredibly knowledgeable about the huge list and beer in general. He was attentive but gave us enough space to enjoy ourselves. Team work was on point too- throughout the entire night there were other servers and bussers stopping by with water refills and to clear empty glasses and plates. Even Rob the manager stopped by to check on us and genuinely wanted to make sure we were having a great time. 

We all had dinner, I had the Asiago burger which I legitimately had dreams about last night. Another person in our party got the PBB&amp;J and all 4 people that tried it swear it was the best burger they&#39;ve ever had. Will definitely be getting that next time! Another guest (100% Irish mind you) got the Irish sandwich and I thought he was going to choke he ate it so fast.

Overall, the Pint Room has an awesome vibe, ridiculously awesome staff and delicious beer and food. We are already planning how soon we can justify going back without looking desperate (btw the answer is tonight, bc we ARE desperate). Finally a low key, beer-centered bar in Littleton without the pretense or d-bags!"

Wow, was I glad I did.  The beer selection is pretty good, though a little too heavy on the IPAs (53) at the expense of other styles (only 2 barleywines? C&#39;mon...).

The Buffalo chicken sandwich was IN-credible.  Really top notch.  Sweet potato fries also were great.  

One of our servers (it seemed that we had 2, with no acknowledgment, nor any rhyme or reason to this arrangement) didn&#39;t really know the beers that well.  I understand she just started, but she admitted &#34;I&#39;m a light beer kind of girl.&#34;  The other server made some good recommendations, and was quite knowledgeable.

They were soggy with old grease and limp. $15 burgers are norm in the heart of NYC but ridiculous in the Littleton burbs. My portobello mushroom sandwich was all zucchini.

Looks like their schtick is the HUGE line of taps and expansive burger selection.

Room for improvement:  While the condiments in the little metal cups is fancy, you&#39;re a brew pub with awesome burgers.  You&#39;re not Shannahans.  You&#39;re not the Four Seasons.  Don&#39;t try to be.  Just put a bottle of ketchup (Heinz) and mustard on the table and maybe a bottle of Cholula; don&#39;t force your guests to constantly ask for more condiments, because it always takes longer than we&#39;d like to get it.  Give the customers what they want and not what you ASSUME they want.

A dessert menu would be a nice touch.  Salads looked good.  We ordered the jo-jo and it was good.  I had the classic burger.  Wife had the 5-alarm.  Our kid had the pizza.

Burgers were good but here&#39;s the problem:  the burgers right next door at Jack and Grill are the BOMB.  So if I&#39;m going for a burger, believe it or not, I&#39;m going to pass on the half-kobe beef burgers with the 20 clever variations.  Jack and grill have the ultimate Americana burger.  And it takes a little more than fancy ingredients to perfect something like that.

I couldn&#39;t determine if the patties were hand formed.  Pretty sure they weren&#39;t.  That would earn bonus points.

But let me be clear:  it was all good.

The beer was GREAT.

I had the Blue Moon Horchata Cinnamon ale.  Incredible.

Service was awesome - big points for that.

Manager, Rob, visits every table and that scores a lot of points too.  I hope they never stop doing that.

I probably enjoyed my kids pizza more than I enjoyed my burger.  haha.  But again the burger was good.  But not a &#34;best of Denver&#34; burger.

We&#39;ll be regulars.  Great place, and especially well done considering they just opened."

The way they cater to dogs is the best I&#39;ve seen! Your dog will get their own bowl of water, a toy, and a yoga mat to lay on by your table. The only two reasons I didn&#39;t give this play five stars is 1) we had to de-vein all the shrimp on our salad 2) it honestly took 33 minutes to get our food which consisted of two salads and an order of six hot wings. When we asked the server if it always takes this long his reply was &#34;it was the wings&#34;. O&#39;well, lesson learned-don&#39;t go starving and don&#39;t order the shrimp (even tho they were cooked perfectly).

I really liked that this place actually has a license to serve food in house unlike a lot of other taphouses and breweries I have been to up north where you have to order your food in from another establishment, so I think that is a HUGE plus right there.  I have to say, I really enjoyed the burger.  I got the PBB&amp;J burger, which was really awesome especially if you like savory and sweet.  Service was good and really friendly too.  I really appreciated the fact that the manager came over to say hi and ask how we were enjoying everything. 

I am excited to see where they decide to go with pricing and specials.  Right now, there aren&#39;t specials or happy hours, but I didn&#39;t think the pricing was too bad for the beers.  Samples are also $2 each, but it&#39;s a good size pour so, I didn&#39;t mind that too much.  With 175 beers on tap, I can see why there would be a $2 on samples, but at the same point, I absolutely hated one of the beers I tried (and I had a feeling it could go either way), so I thought it was disappointing we had to pay for a practically untouched sample.  Maybe there could be some kind of limit system on samples or an option to have a beer flights.

Definitely plan on coming back in the future."

The hostess told us that one of the high top tables in the bar area was open and just needed to be cleared off, so we waited there. Then another hostess came and told us that no one under 21 could be in the bar area. So there were open tables, but we couldn&#39;t sit at any of them because we didn&#39;t bring our dog and because our toddler might have tried to use her fake i.d. to get beer. It&#39;s kinda cool that they have seating for people with dogs, but if that area isn&#39;t full, they should open it up to others."

My wife and I stop there frequently as we&#39;re walking our dogs to try some new beers and enjoy some food.  They are very dog friendly for a row of outside tables, which typically will have a mat and drinking dish for each table to pamper the mutts.  They have a generaous seating area that is outside and not open for dogs, which I wish they would push people to who don&#39;t have dogs. We&#39;ve been there a few times when others without dogs have taken tables in the pet area, which is baffling when other tables are open.  I&#39;m sure the servers are being polite by not asking them to move, but that seems like a reasonable request.  Plenty of good beer options, great burgers and good appetizers.  Beware the chicken wings - they are pterodactyl sized and the one time I ordered them, one bite took me into close to raw chicken.  They swapped it out for another dish (I didn&#39;t have the guts to go back in after that first bite...), but will give it another run sometime.  Servers and bartenders have almost always been great, with one exception of a slow and rarely checking in at the table server during a slow time.  Definitely take the time to stop by and check them out - weather allowing, we go weekly and enjoy the patio."

I&#39;d brought about 20 people there for my birthday, and was treated basically like it was no big deal... they made no extra effort to do anything special for it, and couldn&#39;t have cared less.

When we walked into the Pint Room looking for food and some beverages, it was the complete opposite - they greeted us with open arms, immediately pushed two tables together for us and gave us great service and food.  There are so many beers to choose from, it made the beer lovers in our group really excited (the PB&amp;J beer was kind of amazing, really).  The food was surprisingly delicious, too - I was really quite impressed.  And the waitstaff was really awesome as well - we never waited for anything.  They checked on us often to make sure we were okay, and plates were cleared almost immediately when we finished eating.  

So I&#39;m pretty excited we found this place.  The patio overlooks the river and has a great view.  The inside decor is really attractive as well.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn of a Monday special they had. 10$ for a massive burger and 32 oz of beer from their state of the art beer wall. Talk about a great deal! 
I sat at the bar top and the bartender, Conor, greeted me warmly. He told me about the deal and showed me how to use the beer wall. He even asked about what beers I liked and gave me excellent recommendations. I enjoyed everything he suggested. All of the beers on the wall are local Colorado brews which is pretty neat. I got to try a lot of new flavors! 
The food came out within 10 minutes of ordering. I ordered my burger medium but it came out a little more cooked than I had anticipated. It wasn&#39;t too much of a bummer because the burger still tasted amazing. 

Ambience, service, and food were all near perfection. I will definitely be coming back to try more off of the menu and sip some more beers! The experience was excellent and I can&#39;t say enough good things about Biergarten."

I didn&#39;t get a chance to eat here, but it was such a cool experience. There is a wall of beer taps and you can fill your own glass. If you choose this option, you pay by the oz. for beer. The highest price I saw was .50 cents for an oz. 

For someone like me, and I am sure most of you Yelpers out there are in the same boat, this place is great because you can try a little of everything! Seriously, you can get 1 oz of each of the beers if you want. 

You can also challenge your friends to a game of &#34;Who can pour the best beer with the least amount of head.&#34;

The place is super cute and could be a fun bar. You buy credit on a card and get your own beers and serving size from the taps. The beer was quite stale so I couldn&#39;t drink my beer. We ordered some sliders and wings to share and they weren&#39;t bad but nothing special either"
biergarten-denver,Jarrod P.,FrJ8cCFPGSwAsgFMX_9HEQ,"Denver, CO",0,1,1,112,3,9HZu3_M-scYhgdDLdc3_fw,2.0,2016-01-04,"A group of friends and I (total of 5 people) recently dined at Pourtions on New Year&#39;s Eve. Sadly, it was quite a disappointing experience. 

First of all, the dining room was for the most part fairly empty by the time we arrived. There were only maybe 4 or 5 tables seated with patrons. Otherwise, the dining room was empty aside from the bar (I&#39;ll come back to this later).

There appeared to be only one server taking care of the guests in the dining room and guests at the bar. The server was pretty busy serving drinks and the patrons at the tables seemed to be an afterthought, at least that&#39;s how it felt. I don&#39;t blame the server for this, I blame the management for being understaffed and at the very least having a bartender 

After being seated, we didn&#39;t receive our drink order for approximately 30 minutes. After one hour, we received our lukewarm Starters (Toasted Ravioli). Throughout the evening, our wine and water glasses were empty and we had to ask the server to fill them up on multiple occasions. We were also seated right inside the restaurant entrance, and the exit door going outside the building kept opening and closing, bringing a single digit breeze into the dining room. 

After two hours, we had not yet received our entrees and we asked our server if he could just cancel our order as we were hungry and wanted to go elsewhere. He ran in the back and immediately brought out our order. Surprisingly, the Filet Mignon I ordered was actually pretty decent. One person in our group ordered the Grilled Chicken, which was way over-cooked and she didn&#39;t touch it. Another person in our group received a cold Filet Mignon. We didn&#39;t end up sending anything back as everything had taken a lot longer than we anticipated, and our server was busy serving patrons at the bar. 

Now, as I mentioned earlier the bar was pretty active. There were patrons from the hotel coming in and out of the restaurant to get drinks from the restaurant bar. For the majority of the evening, the dining area became a bar scene. It was loud and there were people standing over us as we ate our dinner. This was a bit annoying, especially at a restaurant that averages $25 a plate. 

We did inform our server about how disappointed we were, and he did take care of our entrees for us. This was a very nice gesture and we appreciated it. However, the manager was walking around the restaurant and did not come to speak with us. We never even heard a &#34;sorry&#34; from anyone. We do appreciate the gesture, but it would have been nice to speak with someone about this experience. We did end up tipping our server 20%, as we didn&#39;t feel the overall experience was his fault. 

I really try to give every establishment the benefit of the doubt, because sometimes things just don&#39;t go right. I get it. However, there were too many issues that occurred to not mention. To define this place, would be to call it a complete free-for-all. 

The identity of this restaurant doesn&#39;t seem to be clear. In my honest opinion, I feel they should scrap the restaurant theme and just make this place a bar. It seems better suited to it&#39;s location and overall feel."

This bar has a swanky self-serve beer tasting feature. Taps along two walls with a range of craft beers - ipads above each tap show description, pricing, and alcohol %.The waiter loads a swipe card for you and shows you which glass to select for various beer types, how to prepare for each pour by cold rinsing the glass, etc. Swipe your card at any tap and pour as much, or as little, as you like. The Ipads help you stay on track by displaying how much you&#39;ve poured.

While we experienced seriously terrible service elsewhere in the hotel, this wait staff was on point. Awesome waitress Victoria kept us having fun and knew a ton about the beers

We had a table, but enjoyed roaming near the taps, watching the Rockies game on some unobnoxious TVs around the room and the particularly friendly vibe among other diners. Food was pricey, but good.

Con&#39;s: was a bit pricey. I dont mind spending $150 if I&#39;m blown away. But, if I&#39;m not, it does sit with me wrong. I ordered two mixed drinks.  They tasted great, but the alcohol level was definitely low. There just wasn&#39;t much alcohol in them. They forgot to bring our appetizer, so it came with our meal. Not a huge thing, but still.

It was our first time here so we were given some recommendations on house favorites which absolutely delivered. Saganaki - flamming cheese with pita bread. We&#39;ve had it before in other places, you cant go wrong with it. 

Next we ordered the Santorini Platter, lets just say we left full, happy and with plenty of leftovers.

Will also go thru the menu very detailed with you. Food is awesome, from appetizers to plates. We ordered one of the combo platters which gives you the opportunity to try a lot of different food options. Keep in mind that one platter will feed a family of 4 very easily, especially if you have an appetizer. Desserts are really good and made in house. We tried the baklava and pudding, both great. At the end they will offer you a complimentary Greek liquor...nice little touch. They have a full bar with lots of Greek beer choices, which they will pair one with your taste preferences, if you don&#39;t know a lot about Greek beers. Very good restaurant we will def be going back."
athenian-restaurant-aurora,Mark T.,RYIhfaNekKLDuqmwqkVi3g,"Aurora, CO",1,1,0,200,955,eL-LZg2XWVfZXia3FhqZxQ,4.0,2015-06-30,"Opaaaaaaaaaaa! OK, I know that was a bit clichéd, but bear with me. I think once you taste the Dionysian delights on offer at Aurora&#39;s Greek gathering place, The Athenian, you&#39;ll see why I get so excited by the mere notion of stopping by.

If we truly are what we eat, you might be forgiven for thinking that my favorite appetizer is dip. And on that note, The Athenian has several stellar spreads for you to sample. As it turns out, one handy-dandy platter contains not only the cool cucumber yogurt known as Tzatziki and the pan-Mediterranean chickpea smash called Hummus, but also Chtipiti (feta cheese mixed with spicy red chili and roasted bell peppers). That last one&#39;s a bit of a tongue-twister, isn&#39;t it? Not to worry - some plump rice-stuffed grape leaves (Dolmades) possess a certain appeal - or what about a nice spinach-stuffed filo pie (Spanakopita)? If you&#39;re seeking something a bit, um, moister, they often have the tangy, lemon/egg/rice soup Avgolemeno - just the thing, in fact, to prepare the palate for the momentous main courses which await you!

Even on the warmest days of the year, I often find myself craving a nice hot casserole. I&#39;m just weird that way, I guess. But y&#39;know, I&#39;m in good company at The Athenian - both the Pastitsio (baked beef and noodles slathered with a Béchamel-like white sauce) and the Moussaka (chopped eggplant and potatoes with that same tasty sauce on top) are simply delicious (or if you&#39;d rather, &#34;nostimos&#34;). Another possibility for you is pita bread stuffed to bursting with tasty marinated pork (Souvlaki) in addition to tomatoes and onions to keep things healthy. If you just can&#39;t decide, there are even a number of combination plates featuring ample portions of quite a few of the things I&#39;ve already mentioned. And I know you can stuff a bit more in, so don&#39;t forget to end with a bit of custard pastry (Bougatsa). Yasou!"

I really enjoyed the meal--everything from the food to the service to the overall look and feel of the restaurant made a lazy evening of not wanting to cook feel like a special occasion. I thought that the avgolemono could have been hotter (it was just barely warm and I like my soups piping hot), but that&#39;s really my only critique.

It&#39;s a sit in restaurant, not a fast food place so the prices are a little more expensive. They are owned by a Greek family, and they make their food taste authentic. For example, some restaurants &#34;Americanize&#34; their food and change the taste to fit a general palate and this restaurant does not do that. They are also very warm and welcoming when you walk into their restaurant. 

Every time I come, I like to order some sort of combination plate so I could eat a little bit of everything such as the Athenian Feast, Grecian Delight, etc. Everything I have ordered here has tasted amazing and that includes their tzatziki sauce. The entrees come with the choice of a soup or salad and I always opt for their salad because their Greek salad is amazing as well.

I love eating here and I am a repeat customer. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an authentic Greek restaurant."

We were pleasantly surprised to enjoy the food here.  The service was super sweet.

We loved the flaming cheese.

We thought the chicken and rice soup was delicious. The salad had a bit too much dressing.

The gyro was  fantastic.  The moussaka was nice, not prepared in my favorite way, but I still enjoyed it. 

The custard dessert was ok.

We had to get to-go boxes for half our food!  Very generous portions.

I was in a bit of a time crunch but had heard great reviews of the Athenian. When I walked in it felt homey and kitchsy all at the same time. 

I was welcomed by the friendly staff and was seated immediately. My waitress was very nice and accommodating for my speedy lunch. 

When I looked over the menu I was a bit thrown by the addition of &#34;South of the Border&#34; options. That always makes me a little nervous as I am a fan of doing one cuisine and doing it well. 

I ordered from the Greek menu and got the vegetarian plate. Nothing to fear as it was delicious!! I had three wedges of spanikopita, three wedges of feta cheese in phyllo dough, dolmas, sautéed veggies and a side of pita bread. The plain feta were my favorite as they were not too salty but perfectly crispy and cheesy. So good!! 

The only thing I could not finish was the salad that came out before the main. The dressing was too heavy and the ice berg lettuce just didn&#39;t do it for me. 

To go I took a gyro for the hubs. Even re heated for his dinner, this was tasty."

So sad. The traditional lemon/chicken/rice soup looked unlike others I have had. Salty--oh yes. Lemony--not at all.  We ordered Gyros sandwiches.  I liked the meat but wasn&#39;t fond of the pita.  Was very surprised to find chunks of raw onion (ick!) and cucumbers in the sauce.  I&#39;ve always enjoyed sauteed onions on my gyro but never had raw.
Do yourself a favor and venture west into Denver: try Central One on Alameda and Pearl or Jerusalem on Evans, east of University.  Either place will serve you GREAT gyro and fries for a comparable, dare I say even lower price."

Most places drown the salad, so it was great to have the choice.  My sister got the souvlaki, which was a large portion and I had a taste.  Wonderful.

Try not to hold that against The Athenian, as it is a delightfully eclectic establishment run by a very friendly staff with excellent food. From the giant decorative liquor bottles on the fireplace...in the center of the dining room to the likenesses of Greek statues adorning the walls, to the Greek radio playing in the mornings, its clear The Athenian is truly one of a kind.

Their Saganaki is definitely a treat as well as I do love their gyro meat, however some of the other items mousakka and their greek salads I just couldn&#39;t get excited about.  The lettuce wasn&#39;t that great in the Greek side salads, the mousakka tasted like it needed more of spices for an authentic Greek touch...Taziki was okay but not my favorite. The spanakopita was good but a very small portion. Oh yeah and the dolmades were good as well.  I always steal a potato off my husbands plates since it has a great lemony taste.

I am not saying their food is bad, it just didn&#39;t wow me. I guess if I could find another main meal other than the gyro there I would give it more stars. I am part Greek, have been to Greece (wish my Aunt could drop it all and open a restaurant here since her cooking rocks off the charts of any place I have tried in Denver.  There is a place that I still love that has my favorite dish of vegetarian Mousakka which is spiced perfectly and has my favorite Taziki and another location which has some great app type stuff which isn&#39;t on typical Greek restaurant menus.

I do love their little outside Taverna set up, which would be great in the Summer.  It reminds me of the Greek Taverna&#39;s of Limni where the locals would watch the soccer matches....obviously a better view then a parking lot, but still nice.

Again the great points are there friendly staff and perhaps the best gyro in the Denver Metro Area. A 3 star isn&#39;t awful, right?"

We started off with the saganaki (flaming cheese) and a veggie plate. The saganaki was delicious and I highly recommend it. The veggie plate was a very good appetizer to have alongside the saganaki. Personally I feel guilty about eating cheese and bread so the peppers, onions, dolmades, and hummus lent a welcome amount of variety to the first course. 

For the entree, I got the Mediterranean pasta(for 2-3) and myself and one other hardly put a dent in it. I probably still have two pounds of food from that in my fridge. It had peppers, shrimp, chick, sausage, and meatballs on penne in a wonderful sauce. Each meat was uniquely delicious in it&#39;s own right and overall the entire platter was fantastic. On top of that, our waiter was phenomenal. She had a fantastic energy about her and was very helpful in the selection of meals. If you like greek food at all, you have GOT to try this place.

EDIT: It&#39;s official, this is my new favorite restaurant.

I went back here again and had the Zorbas platter. It was incredible. It had Pastitsio, which is kind of layered like shephard&#39;s pie with meat layer, pasta layer, and filo dough. It also had Moussaka, which was similar except for a pasta layer there is an eggplant layer and the meat has a more cinnamon-like flavor. Both of those were truly excellent. It also came with a heap of pitas and gyro meat, so you could build your own. I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the gyro meat, but the homemade tzatziki sauce? Best I ever had. That made the gyros phenomenal. There were also Tiropita and spanakopita, which were filo dough triangles filled with feta (tiropita) and spinach spanakopita. Those were delightful. To finish it all off, I had the Baklava. I&#39;ve never been a fan of sweets and have never had baklava before, so it was too sweet for my taste, but my friend who has a real sweet tooth loved it. We had a different waiter this time. She had a great personality and service was again, excellent."

Thankfully we managed to run some errands in this part of neighborhood and to Athenian Restaurant we went.  Wednesday October 10th 2012.  Time was at about 12:10hrs.  When we first arrived at this establishment, there were several other patrons dining in.

We opt to be seated at one of the booth.  Our server is inviting and welcoming.  Thru the Menu, we opt for these following items :

*  Calamari ($9.50)
*  Crispy Hashbrowns, Eggs, Gyro and Feta Cheese ($9.00)
*  Gyro Sandwich with Fries ($8.95)

Hubs had coffee ($2.25).

When my order of Calamari arrived at our table, I like it alot since the Calamari its NOT cut into rings, but as whole to begin with, and with the light batter and all the trimmings, it was indeed satisfying and DeLiCious on its own.  The Calamari as part of the Appetizer comes with its own salad with cubes of tomatoes, raw white onions and crumbles of feta cheese.  It comes with &#34;sour cream&#34; or was it Tzatziki and its own &#34;salsa&#34;.  I am indeed intrigued by the &#34;salsa&#34; sauce, its slightly spicy but yet wonder if its home-made from scratch.

As for Hubs, he opt for the Crispy Hashbrowns, 2 Eggs and Gyro with several cubes of Feta Cheese.  Hubs order also comes with cubes of Green Bell Pepper in it.  The Gyro was seasoned perfectly and Hubs like his order very much since he rate it as 3.5 stars.

I opt for the Gyro Sandwich.  Portion is reasonable and the Gyro meat aka Sliced of Seasoned Lamb meat was D.E.L.I.C.IO.U.S...  Mouth-Watering Delicious.  Even while I am typing this review, cant help drooling or Salivate To The Max!  The Gyro was sandwiched in a Pita Bread, with cubes of Tomatoes and Raw White Onions.  My order comes with Tzatziki and Fries.  I wish I could have more...

With tips and tax our lunch cost $40.  The service was prompt and Hubs had his coffee free flowing during our lunch hour.  With a full lunch in our belly and a satisfying experience, we dont mind returning when needed.

OPA!

Sadly, the rest of the food is only ok.  I still recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for something to eat in Aurora, but it&#39;s not a menu that you&#39;ll want to explore too much.  Stick to the obvious good choices and you&#39;ll be glad you came."

There is a very &#34;Greek&#34; vibe in the place, from the décor to the television playing international television news.  It was not very busy or loud so the service was extra good.

I LOVED IT. It is small and inviting, a beautiful Greek woman served me dinner, and I couldn&#39;t be more happy. As a matter of fact, I just had the BEST Tztsiki (can&#39;t spell it!!!) of my life - like I would eat it with a spoon good. 

I got the Athenian Feast, which was a sampler with several of the Greek classics. All were delightful. I am so glad that I stopped by today. The only draw back was that my dinner salad only had one olive and it was really good so I wish there had been more. Otherwise, I will come back again the next time I am in town and if you have a chance, you should try it out too. 

Entrees are around $20 so not the cheapest place on the block - but absolutely worth it."

I went into this restaurant with my friends on a Sunday in the early afternoon. It was early enough for us still go to nearby restaurant  for breakfast,French Something I believe  it&#39;s called, I wish went there instead.

 When we walked in they set us down at the bar initially because  we were still waiting for others. Naturally,  since I am setting at bar and it is Sunday Funday, I ask if they have any drink specials. This prompts a &#39;hostess&#39; (&#39;trophy  wife who walks around restaurant&#39; may be a more accurate description) to immediately  fetch the proprietor of the restaurant. She brings him over and then says, &#34;He justed ask if this place has Greek food.&#34; She points to the section of menu that says Greek and then goes to explain how the man literally in front of me is greek . My friends come to my aide and tell the woman that I said drink specials. She then exclaims, &#34;I thought  he said  Greek specials.&#34; All of this would have turned into a funny anecdote later had asking the question again not lead to more negative results. The second response I got to my Sunday Funday question was from a surly waitress who said,&#34; The drink special is whatever I make at the time.&#34; She did NOT offer to make me anything or offer suggestions on what drinks I could purchase. Believe  me I tried to probe further. The walls were adorned with alcohol but they were not prepared for questions regarding  the alcohol. In the end she finally  offered me a greek beer which I accepted since it appeared to be the only drink I would get. I would later reget this choice.

The rest of our group arrived. We finally got a table. We had the trio dip and spanakopita for appetizers. The spicy tsatziki dip is incredible so I recommend  the trio dip for appetizers. The rest if the food was so so and not worth mentioning. With 2 appetizers, 4 beers, 4 entrées the total bill was a little  over $120 before tip. The service was unremarkable and at times horrendous. The best example of this horrendous service happened because of the greek beer.

When I asked the waitress  for a second beer after my ordeal to get a single drink from this place she told me NO. That&#39;s right  instead of instantly offering another beverage, I had ask for it be replaced. And then when I asked I was told NO and that I  would have to wait for an undisclosed period of time before I had another. I want reemphasize  that had one beer. Just ONE! I have never had this problem  before and never had to experience wait staff this illorganized. I wouldn&#39;t  recommend this place to anyone on a Sunday. Literally any place you go will be better."

We showed up with a 3 year old and 5 month old. Judging from the atmosphere, we were not the desired clientele in this dark wood semi-romantic setting. But we were welcomed and treated very well. The gyros sandwich and plate were all good with generous helpings. The saganaki flaming cheese was a hit with our 3 yr old granddaughter, as well as the rest of us. One complaint from the mother of the young kids: no changing table in the bathroom. My guess is that most of the patrons are not wearing diapers, so can&#39;t blame management on that issue. Prices are on the high side, but food quality, atmosphere, service all seem to merit the cost."

We started with Saganaki (the &#39;flaming cheese&#39; dish) per other Yelper recommendations. It is something worth ordering; unique and delicious flavor, but also with a great show. It is presented and explodes in flames. 

My other half had gyros and I had the chicken kabob entrees. Everything tasted like what I imagine &#39;home-made&#39; Greek meals would like. I have never had Pitas that were as good as theirs (I assume they make them). Their fries are crispy and fantastic.

I do not have a lot of experience with truly Greek food, but I thought this was a good representation and if nothing else, food that tasted fresh and was made with pride. That is enough to get me to go back."

After the rave reviews, I was pretty pumped for a sensational meal.  Unfortunately, I left disappointed.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the Saganaki (flaming cheese) that everyone raves about, but everything else we ordered just fell short.  

First, I must give props to Athenian&#39;s Saganaki.  It was wonderful and served with fresh, warm pitas.  I wish more Greek restaurants served this delicious appetizer.  We also ordered Spanakopita.  While this was good, I thought it was a tidbit underdone.  

For entrees, we ordered the Greek Salad and the Chicken Kabobs.  The Greek Salad was delightful.  I enjoyed their house dressing a lot.  However, I thought there could have been a lot more feta cheese on my salad.  My husband had the kabobs and found the chicken flavorless.  He ended up adding some of my Greek dressing to the chicken to give it some flavor.  He wasn&#39;t impressed. We ended the meal with some Baklava which was good.  I thought it was somewhat dry but my husband enjoyed it.  

For the price of this meal, I would expect much better.  I don&#39;t feel like the quality lived up to the price.  I was torn between 2 and 3 stars and the price sent me down to the 2.  Overall, a fine meal but I have experienced a lot better."

Service was terrible to begin with especially considering they were pretty slow when we arrived. We asked our server for some recommendations, she named one thing of the menu off a pretty large menu. 

We ordered a few apps and an entree to share. Everything came out within seconds of each dish leaving us feeling rushed. Every morsel of food was bland! Some of our food even came out cold! But with no waitresses to be found we just stopped eating flagged the closest staff member to grab our check. 

No one cared that our food was untouched and my husband and i weren&#39;t happy. So we paid (no tip) and left hungry and disappointed.

The menu says feeds two to three people, but we agreed it could feed four perfectly fine! As you can imagine we didn&#39;t have room for dessert.  I live right up the street though &amp; look forward to going back!!"

It is family owned and you are treated like family as soon as you walk in the door. The saganaki (flaming cheese) is absolutely a must have! We&#39;ve had the gyros, Greek salad, cheesesteak, and some others. The food is flavorful and meat is tender. 

Only gripe is the soup that comes with the meal (lemon chicken and rice?). It tastes ok, just doesn&#39;t taste fresh to me...almost seems like canned soup."

The service is just as fabulous.  The atmosphere is perfect with so much art and replicas of Greece.  They also have a gorgeous patio which is covered and has Greek art and a beautiful fountain.  I need to come back on a warmer day and enjoy it for sure.  We were greeted by the owner and she was delightful.  She explained the menu to us and gave us some recommendations.  We started with the Trio appetizer which we devoured.  The spicy feta was amazing and the hummus delicious. It also came with plenty of warm pita bread, dolmas and stuffed peppers. I knew I would eat a lot with the appetizer, so I went with the Greek salad thinking it was more of a &#34;side&#34; serving but to my surprise it was a very large salad.  Needless to say, I devoured every last bite.  The salad dressing is the best.  It&#39;s not too &#34;oily&#34; and its more of a tang/herb-perfection.  I know I&#39;m not doing it justice by writing about it, but I would highly recommend the Greek salad and the Trio.  There is also an option to add meat to the salad.  My always-hungy-teenage-son had the combo plate with included gyro meat, chicken, potatoes and lettuce/tomato and soup.  There was so much food, that he wasn&#39;t even able to finish it but was able to box it up and enjoy the remaining for breakfast the next morning.  Athenian is definitely on my list of favorite places.  I&#39;m going to start craving that salad and the Trio so I&#39;m gonna have to return very soon!"

I&#39;m sad I don&#39;t live nearby anymore. Tonight I was slightly disappointed, the reason for the missing star. I was rushed through my dinner which was extremely annoying since there was other patrons that came in after me. I&#39;d only had a couple bites of both my appetizer (the wonderful saganki) and salad before my dinner was dropped off. Then I hadn&#39;t even made it half way through my dinner before the check was dropped, with no mention of dessert. After running my card was when dessert was finally offered to me.

So, admittedly, I have not had Greek food before, and the odds are that I won&#39;t again, but this was just bad food, of any sort. I had the chicken kabob and my daughter had the Greek steak. Both were DRY, DRY, DRY. Is this the way Greek food is supposed to be? Our salads were also tasteless and bland. The Greek soup was actually tasty, but I only sampled some from a friend. Everything was overly sour tasting (maybe that&#39;s the Greek thing) but I can&#39;t get over how dry the meat was. Blech. Our server was friendly and welcoming, but there was another young lady who would take our plates who snarled and grumbled. When we said &#34;Thank you&#34; to her, we were met with silence. Surly attitude, not appreciated. Won&#39;t be going back. I have no idea where others have eaten who said this food was good."

They have a great little shop up front by the registers, and you can buy bakery products to go. I haven&#39;t tried their desserts yet, but based on their lunch I&#39;d like to. 

Parking is a little difficult, but the construction in the area is almost done, so that should get better soon."

They certainly didn&#39;t disappoint. It was so hard to choose with so many choices, but we ultimately chose the salted caramel cheesecake and I decided to buy a loaf of chunky cinnamon bread. The cheesecake was delicious and the bread is also great! I am going to attempt to make my own version of French toast with it, but will definitely be stopping by there in the morning one of these weekends to try their French toast.

Lunch rush was done, plenty of parking  and only 2 people ahead of me.  One was paying,  so technically one ahead of me.  I see front cash register manned with young lady and another one was chatting with her.  Dont know what was going on but they were busy chatting with each other while the lady front of me was totally lost on what to do.  Finally another employee came to register and offered to help.  The other two still busy talking.

The power of &#34;Yelp&#34; to st8 out any deficiencies. 

Lady asks something and it was my turn to be helped. The other two still busy talking and finally got the hint that I was irritated and one of the two started odering  bunch of stuff to go to other one she was talking to. When order was done, the other girl steps away and disappears.  Hmmm.  How rude!!!  At least acknowledge my presence.   Nope..none of that. I was ready to &#34;Yell&#34; and totally loose my calm posture and make big scene since I didnt know anyone here....  then.. the other  lady shows up and offered to help.  Wheeww..  She saved me from being escorted out of the bakery.  I herd of people getting escorted out of planes but I didn&#39;t wanted to be 1st one being escorted out of the bakery by the Arapahoe County sheriff.  Now that I got all my frustration out, back to the place.and the food.

* whaaat..no WIFI? 

Atmosphere: several knotches higher than Panera.
Food: about the same but different options.  My banana nut bread bundt cake stood out.

Got small salad  with bread, small coffee  n the bundt cake for $9.15 including tax.  Not bad.

There are severe shortage of low paid workers around this area and definitely shows with lackluster  performance of these two young ladies ( +21 ) but love to blame everthing on the management  for improper training.

Spent one hour  enjoying great music (oldies..very old oldies) ok food  and comfy seats....  looks like shift change has occurred staffed with what appers to be better ones.  

I will be stopping by more often to check out if I really like this place."

The place looked pretty new and clean, but did have some garbage on the floor from dinner no one had attended to.

The panini was not exactly hearty, or of notable quality or flavor, but it was okay.

The homemade chips that came with it were pretty weak. They&#39;re certainly not made to order, you get them cold.

The tart was very sweet, and had a strong key lime flavor. I enjoyed that.

I will probably go back simply because of its convenient location, near my home."

It exceeded our expectations. Despite the line, the service was excellent and the owner and staff brought around desserts to try. The servings are much larger than competitors and very filling. The dessert selection filled several glass cases. I tried 3-4 desserts and enjoyed each one. They also have a ton of fresh baked breads that you can purchase. They have salads, soups, sandwiches and lots of breads, pastries and desserts. They also have many breakfast options. The French toast is my favorite. I had the Turkey Artichoke Panini.

It was almost 8 pm so we missed the parking problems others have had. Liked the decor and menu. 3 of us had sandwich combos and wife had a salad. Minor issue: the menu boards for soups are a little confusing and seem to have been an afterthought. My son thought he was getting a Loaded Potato, not potato soup. The salad was largely lettuce and not much else. No cheese at all etc.  More seriously one of the workers started cleaning the windows with blue Windex. Even from 12 feet away the ammonia smell      was terrible. I had to speak to her and probably shocked her. I love a clean place to eat but you gotta find a less smelly way to cleanup while folks are eating. The food is4 stars at least but the added chemicals makes it a 3 overall.   
Update
Went back at 8 am for breakfast.  The lot was indeed full. Used backup plan instead."

Kneaders has a plan - and it&#39;s a good one.  Obviously I was hungry or I wouldn&#39;t have been there so when they hit me with all that baked heaven, of course I wanted to try everything.  I ended up only getting the snickerdoodle loaf - which was just as good as it sounds. But I almost broke down and tried each of the amazing brownie flavors that were calling my name.
  I also had the combo with a turkey cranberry croissant and a small house salad.  They were both good but I was a little disappointed with how little meat/cheese/other stuff was on the croissant.  It was more like half a sandwich&#39;s worth of filling, spread out over a whole sandwich.  The same was true of the french dip my husband had.  I don&#39;t need a gigantic meal but for the prices they&#39;re asking, I feel they could have been more generous.
  The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly so I will be giving them another shot - maybe breakfast next time."

Note the turkey and cranberry sandwich doesn&#39;t really have cranberries, but a sweet sauce that is the only moisture in the sandwich. The bread is so fresh, it helps make the meal less dry. There is little help in the dining room if you need mayo or something isn&#39;t correct with the order. You have to try and flag down someone in the cashier area. And there is no Internet.

* Sticky Toffee Pudding, Pecans, and Vanilla Gelato

1 star off: I thought the Salmon Salad was kind of bland.  It tasted clean and fresh, but lacked flavor, as if it needed more dressing or seasoning.

I have been searching Denver for a good vegan burger. After disgusting veggie burgers that were soggy, the beet burger here delivered. It was delicious and the side of cauliflower complemented the burger well. My friend got a salmon burger and it looked delicious too. 

I&#39;ll be back here for lunch, happy hour and dinner soon."

- great ambience
- expedient friendly service
- tasty crispy garlic fries

cons:
I just don&#39;t understand the obsession with this place. I find the majority of the food so bland and overpriced. I had a tomato soup that was inedible, salty, and bitter. There was a seasonal salad that I had with purple cabbage and it was supposed to come with a vinaigrette, almonds, etc. When it arrived half of the ingredients of the salad weren&#39;t there, including the vinaigrette. I just can&#39;t justify trying this place a third time."

We had just gotten into Denver and were quite hungry and the Kitchen looked very inviting. Started with cocktails - interesting choices and really tasty. They were accompanied by crispy pigs ears, which were the star of the lunch. I kept eating the dipping sauce after the ears were gone. The ears were crispy, crunchy, fatty, salty and delicious. I had the beef on weck and enjoyed it very much - nice strong horseradish- but it was a little soggy. The accompanying salad was very refreshing. Husband got the lamb burger with garlic fries. He liked the burger better than I did but the fries rocked. Based on other reviews, we decided to try the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. It was good but I think I&#39;m spoiled by my Brit brother-in-law&#39;s version, and this one paled in comparison. Our server was just delightful, and she comped the dessert because we were visitors to her city.  Needless to say, she got a very nice tip. I would defiantly come back here on a future trip and would like to try dinner options."

When we discovered that the Kitchen restaurant concept was in Denver, this was the 1st place we decided to check out our 1st night in Denver and as it was a party of 4, the only option was at 9:30pm on a Friday night, but we took it, and all I can say is that WOW!! The food and service at this place is pretty darn amazing! I feel super lucky that the Kitchen is opening up locally in Memphis!

My #1 recommend is that their drinks are works of art and you absolutely MUST get something from their cocktail menu! Also those garlic chips that we had were so doggone delicious - our party really struggled against not ordering another serve!! And absolutely leave room for dessert - or even have dessert first and then split mains!! Also we went here in May 2015 and its a local seasonal menu, so depending on when you go, the same dishes might not be available.

And speaking of mains, between the 4 of us, we got the Colorado Quinoa oyster mushrooms, chèvre, pickled fresno &amp; mushroom brodo ($17); Ribeye Frites greens, sauce foyot &amp; house cut fries ($38); Colorado Striped Bass lentils, fennel, spicy orange glaze &amp; kalamata olive oil ($27) and Halibut spring vegetables, parmesan consommé &amp; citrus herb oil ($35). For me the standouts were the asparagus included with the ribeye and the absolutely spectacular and perfectly cooked Striped bass with lentils. I liked the Quinoa, but found it a bit heavy and the Halibut was a bit too bland for me. 

For dessert, we got the Affogato (fantastic coffee and lovely ice-cream!); the Sticky Toffee Pudding (dare I say as good as any I have had when living in Australia); the Chocolate Nemesis (it&#39;s a flourless cake, superbly light and delish) and the Meyer Lemon Panna Cotta (the accompanying pistachio brittle made this dish).

The food was so superb, even tho&#39; we felt we over ate a wee bit, you walked away feeling light and content. I loved this restaurant and will def try to come back - can&#39;t wait till they open up in Memphis!

Service overall was great! We sat at the bar and were served right away, especially since time was of the essence and the place stopped serving around 9:30 or 10pm (but still stayed open).
The initial bartender was not great mainly due to her personality, honestly. If you are at the bar, you need to be a bit more outgoing. She was helpful but a bit standoffish and distant which doesn&#39;t do well at a bar - that&#39;s when I want responsive interaction, especially when time is of the essence!

Overall the food was great!  
Oysters were on point (and let&#39;s give the bartender credit, she knew her oysters!), 
Hummus is a bit meh (needs more taste) but the bread that came with it is delish
Beet salad left a little to be desired mainly due to the texture of the beets - they seemed overcooked and slightly shrunken. The goat cheese was a delight!
Pork Terrine - I really wated the salmon but they were out of it so we settled for PT - I always think I&#34;m going to like it and when it shows up chunky , I&#39;m disappointed. So I need to just not order it. The flavor was great though.
Bolognese - OMG!  TDF (to die for) - excellent meat combo and i loved the pasta type which was nicely done and had these fun little &#34;scores&#34; on them.  

Overall - loved it!"

We waited behind a very nice couple ahead of us at the hostess stand.  Once it was our turn, I waited for the hostess to make eye contact and so leaned in and said --we are a party of 2.  Her response was--uhmmmm, yeah...do you have a reservation.  I shook my head no and she smiled at me and said &#34;ummm yeah it looks like there is 2 seats at the bar but haha, they aren&#39;t together.&#34;   So I asked--would it change anything if I told you that we had to be out within an hour?  And she rudely said &#34;Sir, um, I have resssss errrrr  vaaaaaa shunnnnnss so if you could please step aside...and just like that she was done.

And so are we.  Nothing like a rude, entitled twenty something hostess who, while she&#39;s smacking her gum, is dismissing you from the restaurant.  Funny--we walked back by the window at 645--and AT LEAST A DOZEN of the tables that were empty when we came in the first time--were STILL OPEN an hour later when we walked by.   Applause on a great, I mean, GREAT hostess.

This group of restaurants is fantastic!  Everything I&#39;ve had has been amazing and the plates of my neighbor-diners look amazing. It&#39;s obviously on the spendy side, but not crazy for the quality of food!  The quantities weren&#39;t anything remarkable, just fairly normal sized. I had a Persian Lemon to drink, and I could&#39;ve pounded back several but for them being $12 a pop. Cherry Crostinis for an app, which I appreciated could be bought it whatever size serving you want. Green Salad was fantastic, especially the toasted hazelnuts. Almondine Trout for an entree was more citrusy than I expected from the description, but also spectacular. 

I don&#39;t normally go for dessert, and I was already fairly full, but everything was so fantastic that I couldn&#39;t help myself. Sticky Toffee Pudding. Words fail me!  If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s heavenly, you shouldn&#39;t even be allowed to eat food!"

Fantastic bottled cocktails made in house featured daily.
So many awesome things on the menu. Salads, shellfish, beef, pasta, chicken, fresh fish.

Started with mussels. Extremely fresh and plump. Steamed in a white wine garlic cream broth. Nice crusty bread to sop it all up. 

Halibut. I was worried the thick filet would dry out and toughen. Not so. Wonderful crust on outside and flaky tender throughout. Paired with earthy root vegetables and a light consume. 

Told myself I wouldn&#39;t have dessert unless they had affogato on the menu. Wouldn&#39;t you know it, they did. Rich house made gelato topped with espresso. 

Staff is warm and welcoming. You can tell they have been trained to be mindful of the little details that often get overlooked. 

They aren&#39;t just running a restaurant, they&#39;re providing a customer experience. Definitely top on my list of places to return if I make it back to Denver."

Got the hummus plate. Delicious. 
Tomato soup sounds simple, but they found a way to elevate it. Wonderfully fresh and flavorful. 
Cheese plate had perfect selections. I&#39;m not a blue cheese fan, but my friend was. It had a nice honey with it. Ewephoria, ashbrook were my favorite. Orange marmalade, roasted nuts, honey &amp; walnut bread made it fit together nicely."

After a heated discussion, we decided to order 
tomato soup (it&#39;s above average), and Pork ears (we were feeling adventurous) which were a bit over-cooked, but were decent if dipped in accompanying sauce.

But we didn&#39;t stop there!  We also tried the Garlic fries (good but I had better); Maine mussels (tasty w creamy sauce); Carrots (this is probably my favorite, slightly salty and herby. Very unique flavor.); Sautéed greens (was okay, but a bit chewy); and Summer squash (this had a mint and peanut flavor. I guess this is neat idea but I did not enjoy it).  

Our group also got pork chops (perfectly cooked) and steak (seasoned and prepared excellently).

So, some things were a hit; others were a bit of a miss. I would like to come back and try other things on the menu.  

Our waiter was very helpful and friendly but not super timely."

We had a reservation for 7:30 and were seated immediately upon arrival. We were seated in the back room of the restaurant. It was less busy and more quiet back there so if that is your thing ask to be seated in the back but I would have wanted to sit in the front of the restaurant where it was busy but it was too full so, oh well! Upon being seated I glanced over the menu and it was full of yummy goodness! After looking over the drink menu I ordered the persian lemon while my aunt and mom ordered the possession obsession. When they brought the drink to the table and I took my first sip... the persian lemon tasted sweet like candy to my soul! Oh boy was it tasty. Im not into tequila but from what they said the possession obsession was impeccable tasting as well. 

Their menu is constantly changing however when I went the following items are worth ordering for sure!
-Cheese platter. Especially make sure it has the goat cheese with colorado made honey. It was so tasty and with the house made bread, it was over the top good. The two other cheeses were pretty good as well but not as good as the blue cheese.
-The pork chop which is what I ordered was over the top AMAZING! It was juicy, perfectly seasoned and everything you want in a pork chop. It is a huge chop too so be prepared to eat.
-The lamb shank was another notable item. It fell off of the bone and was so tender. 

The kitchen does it right. Their portion sizes are just right and their food tastes amazing. There is something on the menu for everyone even though the menu isn&#39;t that extensive. The service was on point and there was always someone coming to the table to clean up dirty plates, refill our drinks, etc. The only downside of the time I visited this fine establishment was their dessert menu was less than average. Nothing really interested me on it which is pretty hard to do since I LOVE sweets! Overall, I highly suggest this awesome restaurant in lodo (lower downtown) Denver!"

It is a thing in Colordo to come here, it has the freshest salads and they have carbonated water in a bottle for free. Better than France where you have to pay for it. The best thing to do is to first read up about the origin of the restaurant. Then come and have a nice leisurely lunch. It&#39;s in LoDo on your way to the Union Station, and the outdoor seating, if you come in the right season is perfect.

Besides the sparkling water on the house, it&#39;s the fresh bread that caught our eye. It had a really nice nutty flavor to it. We ordered salads. Okay, before I say we, let me back up for a second. She has been a friend of mine for twenty years. We&#39;ve been through a lot. Several years ago she had finally decided to say goodbye to San Francisco, and now their million + dollar house in Inner Sunset and uprooted the family, and move to Colorado. We had a great deal of years spent together, as friends, and watch each other maturing into women. That move devastated many of us, but it&#39;s life and you learn to deal with it. Recently she returned to put the house on the market and we knew it was the finale. At least for now. But Denver is not far, and quite honestly, if the restaurant is any indication of food and restaurant quality, then perhaps more of bay area folks would likely be moving here soon.

Now back to the dishes. We loved the lamb salad and salad salad. It used microgreens and other exotic greens including snowpea shoots, it had the right amount of delicate balance and protein, and it was light and dense at the same time. If you are looking for good salad, this place is as good as it gets.

I had only one complaint. This place does not exist in San Francisco. It needs to."

I am so incredibly impressed with the Kitchen- My party of 12 descended a half hour early on a Sunday, and they graciously seated us and immediately had those yummy breakfast drinks we all live for coming our way.  The bloodies were hearty, the mimosas fresh and bubbly, and UNICORN TEARS- The palest bubbly violet gin drink you will ever have! **No unicorns were killed to make these drinks***

Brunch Entrees did not disappoint. Our whole group was served AT ONCE!  The entire staff must have helped bring everything out, and bam, in synchronicity we all had our plates land at the exact same moment- which is extraordinary. A very Downton Abbey moment for us all!

The food:  We tried the Quiche, the Neiman&#39;s Ham (a variation on the Benedict- yum!), the portabello sandwich and more.  By far, the standout favorite unique breakfast item was the KEDGEREE- never heard of it- but apparently a British/Indian fusion of smoked fish, curried rice and eggs. YUM!!! My friend shared :)

We started off with the garlic fries (nice large chunks of potato, perfectly crispy, not too greasy, with the perfect amount of garlic flavor), kitchen hummus (great texture with grilled pieces of bread), and the goat gouda gougere (melted cheese bread heaven).

Then for my main, I decided to do local and ordered the koberstein ranch steak. Usually I&#39;m totally against a place cutting my steak, but the presentation was so beautiful and the flavor was so amazing - the richness of the duck fat potatoes, the earthiness of the grilled onions, the lean yet succulent flavor of the steak, and the fresh flavorful pesto made this dish a standout. This has to be one of the steak entrees I&#39;ve ever had.

Then if that wasn&#39;t enough we decided to order some dessert. We shared the peach crisp and the sticky toffee pudding. The peach crisp was rich yet perfect for the season. The sticky toffee pudding came out pipping hot, loved the toffee nut topping, the hot and cool contrasting temperatures - so good.

The food was very average for the price.  We started off with a cheese tray which I thought would have been better if served with some sort of nice cracker and plain bread.  You get a cranberry walnut bread and we just didn&#39;t care for it.  Also, the cheese tray would be much better if you would include olives and maybe a few pieces of sliced apple or grapes to mix it up.  It was very boring in presentation and taste outside of the cheese.  I ordered the chicken and it came out very dry on the ends and the rest was fatty and all dark meat.  I would have expected a nicer piece.  This is probably not a  big deal but our waiter never filled our water glasses either.  There was a water bottle on the table and it was left to us to fill our own.  Again, probably not a big deal but you would think in a place at this price level, you would  be checked on more often and they would keep an eye on your water glass.  I will give them kudos for service at the end.  I had mentioned the poor quality of my barely touched chicken and they ended up taking my meal off the tab.

- Mushroom Arancini (it&#39;s not a whole mushroom, but a mushroom risotto - it was ehhh)
- Charcuterie plate (ah the buffala mozzerella!)
- Mussels (the sauce and the way it was cooked, was delicious! we kept dipping the bread into the sauce. Couldn&#39;t get enough)

Left with quite a few &#39;nopes&#39;. 
Don&#39;t think I will be back. 
Unless for vino and a snack. 

That little poem is for you. And this review is for last night, Jan 27th at the location on 16th and Wazee. 

Let me begin my review by saying that the staff is AWESOME. I sat alone, waiting for my late, late date (almost 1 hour), and the staff were very sensitive to my plight. So much so that they brought me a free appetizer! Which also turned out to be the second best item I ingested that evening. 

My three stars are for food value, the bang for my buck (or my company&#39;s buck). So disappointed here. 

I ordered three oysters (about $10). Oysters were really yummy, served with the normal fixings. The geography from where they were harvested spanned British Columbia, Maine, Massachusetts and Washington. 

Now I never judge a restaurants cooking ability on raw seafood alone. Honestly I wish I would have stuck to the uncooked items, because what was cooked was overcooked and lacked flavor. Except for my complimentary pork belly app, which was oh so yummy and was accompanied by sauerkraut (great combo!). 

I am a scallop lover. I could eat them every night. So I ordered the diver scallops with mashed potato, trumpet  mushroom and bacon. They were cooked too long, a bit tough and too crispy on the outside for my liking. It was like eating a seafood hockey puck. I&#39;m not really sure what the mushrooms were supposed to add. Not much flavor there at all. I ate everything on my plate only because it was past 10pm in my home time zone. 

My friend had the Koberstein Ranch steak. I believe this was the most expensive item on the &#39;mains&#39; menu. Absolutely terrible. Tough, thin in thickness, little flavor. It looked like something you would get at a rest home cafeteria. There was a rutabaga mash (trying to be mashed potatoes) as a side. Too, too sweet for me and the consistency was chunky/funky. Also there were roasted root vegetables - carrots and turnips. Those were just ok. 

We also ordered the pumpkin bruschetta a second appetizer. Toast topped with a pumpkin mash, pesto, and goat cheese. I liked the salty sweet combo. Wasn&#39;t mind blowing but way better than the main courses. 

We both ordered cocktails. She two glasses of the Persian Lemon. Which she loved and I hated (sweetness overkill). I had the Las Vegas Turnaround which was a little too bitters and ginger heavy. It was a nice tall glass though. Between a glass of wine, that Vegas and altitude... I was feeling pretty good.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. There are several sections of seating. We were in the very back, away from the windows. Crowd was mostly young professionals. I will say that the wait station where staff enters orders is annoyingly placed right in the middle of the dining area. Having staff discuss work flow and issued as they pass is distracting.

Overall, was a let down after reading a few reviews before arriving, but wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;d never return."

Burrata flatbread - a little boring. Guess I was thinking of their burrata bruschetta that used to be on the menu. Just white on white w. some evoo, tasted fine but nothing special and quite soft. 
Roasted beets- awesome and with some carrots and orange wedges. Refreshing n delicious. 
Mussels- tasted fine but boy does it smells. That&#39;s why I&#39;m only giving them a 3.5 stars because the mussels aren&#39;t as fresh as they should be. As soon as they arrive at the table, instead of the wonderful smells of wine n sauce, it smelled like stinky seafood. Almost bad like trash. For a second I was going to return it but thought I&#39;d taste it first to see if it&#39;s as bad as it smells. It&#39;s fine but even after the meal, it still sinks. Really wish the chef and even the waiter who brought it to me would&#39;ve noticed the unpleasant scent because it&#39;s pretty strong. Hope I&#39;m not going to get food poisoning."

Steak frites, great portion for a hungry dinner or to share for lighter appetites - and medium rare is melt in your mouth delicious. We split this for lunch and opted for the garlic fries (highly recommend). It also came with a plain but surprisingly yummy arugula salad that balanced the plate well.

The WA oyster of the day was medium to small with a great creamy flavor. 

Reason for 4 of 5 stars - We had a glass of red wine which was very average table wine."

We started with oysters, burratta bruschetta, and pigs ears. For entrees we had the butchers cut steak, and half chicken. We highly recommend all of these.... Hell, we highly recommend the things we didn&#39;t even get to eat! Anyone who came to our table was very nice and well spoken. Our server Lauren was great and answered all the questions we had. As a once server/trainer, and bartender, she was ON TOP of her pre drop, pre bus, bus, and remarking. Excellent service!"

So first - kudos to our server. She was absolutely amazing. We got there about 10 minutes before happy hour was over and she made sure we received happy hour on drinks and the apps which was awesome. She definitely went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience. She explained dishes with passion and a true enjoyment of the food they served. All of our choices were based on her recommendations and she did not steer us wrong!

We started with the cheese plate and it was phenomenal. I&#39;m a sucker for good cheese pairings and they did a fabulous job with the honeys, jams, dried fruit, etc. I was so glad we ordered it. Plus their bread was super fresh and crusty - so yummy. We also split the roast chicken. We both were starting to get full so a half portion of chicken was plenty; however if you&#39;re super hungry I would recommend the whole dish for yourself.

This place is fabulous and a wonderful addition to the 16th street mall. I work down the street and am sure that I&#39;ll be back soon."

If you like pretentious, overpriced, poorly prepared food with condescending wait staff this is you spot.  My lamb arrived stringy and cold.  While the portion was small it was inedible.

I informed my waiter Adam, and rather than pick up my plate and heat my food he told me it should be served at room temp.  As I said above his response was condescending as if I&#39;d never eaten lamb before. So I looked it up. Cooking temperature  should be between 300-375 degrees and the internal cook temperature should be served no lower than 140°. This was my anniversary. I wanted to enjoy my evening with my wife. So I did not dispute. Nonetheless, I was irritated by the response and insulted.  What happened to the customer always being right?

As it turned out my wife&#39;s halibut was mediocre at best certainly not to the standard of a restaurant of this alleged caliber.  To be honest, it was the worst restaurant experience I have had in recent memory.  We had this meal over a month ago. I did not want to write a review with anger.  But, after a month, I remain convinced.readers have a right to know my experience and determine whether they choose to dine at The Kitchen."

The ambiance is pretty casual, although it&#39;s a very nice place. The rustic/industrial styling and open kitchen concept make the restaurant feel like home. We started with the Burrata Bruschetta, and unfortunately, it was quite bland. My companion suggested I try the Bolognese, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor of the meat was fantastic. The staff was nice and there wasn&#39;t an empty table in the house. The Garlic Fries were tasty too. I guess I would give this place 3.5 stars if it was an option.

I was happy about the table - it was by the window ...I have to say the tables are a bit close ...its okay though- 
 I looked around  and I thought a lot of the bartenders  and cooks where pretty good looking ..so that&#39;s a plus ..lol
Our waiter came over and was super cool and took our drink orders - of course we had cafe lattes ..
After that we enjoyed a cheese plate ...yum!
Salads , soup , mussels for dinner - All of it was tasty and I enjoyed my dinner - 
We declined dessert because we were stuffed ...
I&#39;ll be back - it was good !!

This very comfortable and stylish eatery is full of unexpected delights in both the food and cocktail department. I had lunch and dinner there a day apart and will go back again before I leave.

The food is prepared simply and deliciously, try the Spaghetti Bolognese and the Bruschetta, they are incredible and the Bruschetta is unlike anything you&#39;ll have tried before likely (and tastier).

The atmosphere is very upbeat and fun, people are connecting, talking and having fun everywhere you look. If I lived in Denver this would be my go to place. But from now on, it will be my go to place when I&#39;m here, I wish I could transport it back home."

However if I were in LA getting the same service and prices id give 5-stars so maybe I&#39;m being unfair.
Regardless - highlights:
-mussels - delicious, great sauce, and yummy bread
-beef carpaccio was perfect
-pea bruschetta sounds weird but was one of my favorite items- light and summery with a hint of lemon 
-Gouda gougere was nice and surprisingly light for a fried cheese ball. I liked everything else more but that was still interesting and a fun choice 
-gin, mint cocktail was delish and refreshing
-great atmosphere

Had my first opportunity to sample the dinner menu and I was not disappointed. The tomato soup was like eating a squished fresh summer tomato out of a bowl. The lamb kabob was cooked perfectly, spiced well, and served with a very delicious middleeastern side dish/salad. The flatbread served alongside was dry and tastless...they should switch to traditional naan in my opinion. As well, the flatbread appetizer fell flat, and I would not recommend!  The Gomez rioja was perfect with the lamb...a good suggestion on the menu from the wine buyer, Zach!  The wine menu is extensive and thoughtful with smaller producers as the highlight. The service fell short and was problematic.  Bar service was sort of slow but it was a holiday. A few in my party did not enjoy their dishes as much as I did, however the manager was present, observant and apologetic. We were presented with sweets and after dinner drinks. We do not have sweet tooths but taking notice and being gracious goes a long way in my book. So 4 STARS!"

It was a beautiful, open space with warm wood accents everywhere. It creates a space that&#39;s both homey and intimate, as well as upscale and elegant. Our servers were wonderful and attentive.

The food itself was top-notch. Featured was an awesome assortment of seafood (not something you associate with the mountains!) and tapas-style small plates.

Our dozen assorted oysters were briny and fresh, with a great selection from around the West Coast. Of course, the Washington State sourced oysters were the best of the sample -- you simply can&#39;t beat oysters from the Pacific Northwest. Both the minuet and cocktail sauces were well executed.

The Burrata with peach on bruschetta bread was a big hit with my wife. She absolutely loved it. The combination is unusual, but quite tasty and they use good quality mozzarella curd.

The St. Stephen&#39;s Cheese -- which is from a local source -- was excellent and creamy. 

Our original small plates were so good, we couldn&#39;t resist ordering a bit more. The results?

Smoked chilled mussels. The description says it all, and the execution was excellent. The mussels were fresh and the smoking added depth while not creating that gamey/fishy quality that smoking sometimes brings out in seafood. 

It was an overall wonderful experience, and we wouldn&#39;t hesitate to return on a visit to the Mile High City."

We were sat at a table that was awkward, on one side was the stand for waitresses to input orders, on the other was a column.  Considering I had reservations, I would have expected a better table.  I didn&#39;t ask them to change us, because the girlfriend got settled in.  To me its about the food not the placement of the tables anyways.

I had the Niman Ranch Ham, which was essentially Eggs Benedict.  The dish was amazing.  My ONLY complaint is that the poached eggs were med to hard cooked, and I prefer a runny yolk when it comes to all eggs.  Honestly, by the time the waitress came, I had one of them already ate, and couldn&#39;t see any sense in asking them to redo the poached eggs, they were that tasty.  The bread is soft and sweet, being Challah bread.  Paired extremely well with the rest of the dish.  The ham was delicious, not dried out, honestly I couldn&#39;t cook it better myself.

The potatoes were standard country style, cubed and fried.  However, red onions were paired with them, and they were pickled.  I typically add onions to my potatoes, and they do add quite a bit of flavor; however, the pickled onions added a nice acid / salt balance to the potatoes.  I think I will be adding this to my tricks when cooking for others.

The Girlfriend had the French Toast, made with the same bread that I had.  It was amazing too.  French Toast doesn&#39;t take much to perfect, but the maple syrup with infused cinnamon.  Pecans, I believe, were on the plate.  Honestly very well done.

All in all great experience."

The Kitchen has a patio and a gorgeous spacious dining room. They have an excellent wine list and they have their own beer director so you can bet the beer list is extensive. The focus of the menu is seafood to include King crab legs, oysters and caviar. The menu also offers salads, sandwiches and other main dishes like ribeye.

I started off with a glass of sparkling Chateu Moncontour Cabernet Franc and ordered the mussels and the potted salmon for lunch. At the price point of the mussels I was rather impressed. There were nearly twice as many as most places serve. The smoked mussels were chilled and served in a mix of garlic, fresno chilies and thyme. This preparation gave it a unique flavor profile without dousing the dish in a heavy sauce. I enjoyed the chilled potted salmon that had a hint of smoke and dill served with a side of lemon and fresh sliced bread.  Jesse opted for the slow roasted Pork sandwich with salsa verde and chunky potato salad. The sandwich was savory, delicious and filling. 

The Kitchen was the perfect lunch spot for us during our vacation in Denver. The restaurant is conveniently located blocks from both the bus station and from the hotel we stayed at (The Oxford). The price point is a bit higher than I would typically spend for lunch but if you are looking for excellent food and service this is a great place to splurge a little."

First off you can do lunch, happy hour, or dinner and you&#39;ll find delicious food, friendly service, and a great environment. 

Each time I&#39;ve experienced The Kitchen it just gets better and better. 

They have an excellent patio that&#39;s dog friendly and fun. Makes for excellent happy hour festivities.  Potent drinks. Delish food. Yummmmm

Now for the menu-- I want one of everything!! Magical mussels every time. Basically close your eyes and point then you can try it all each time. Oysters and the seafood are top notch. 

Most recently I experienced the poached salmon salad and it was perfect in every way. Flavorful, hearty, bright, organic... I will be craving the steak and frites always. Tender, well seasoned, and the fries are just amazeballs.

First off all, parking is horrendous. I recommend the parking lot caddy corner to the restaurant but it&#39;s still $15. My advice is if you must dine here, find a garage or only eat here if you&#39;re already in the area. 

We got seated immediately and the server was nice. 

Since it was a Sunday afternoon, we got the weekend lunch menu. They were out of the quiche which was a bummer since that&#39;s what I wanted. Our table ordered to fried pig ears to start and they were crispy, crunchy deliciousness! 

Unfortunately my husbands lamb burger was lackluster and didn&#39;t have enough flavor. My pork sandwich was a bit better but nothing special. 

The sandwiches we got were not impressive. Felt like I could get the same quality of food elsewhere for a cheaper price and without the parking headache."

Just moved to Denver, went to the Kitchen after reading Yelp reviews stating it&#39;s awesomeness. Not so much! 

The staff is lovely, young, wannabes! Adorbs in terms of haircuts-but, we went there for food.

Eggs Benedict which they call Niman Ranch Ham-wtf!?! Still, we ordered it along with coffee. May I say-the only sweetner they could come up with was &#34;artificial stevia&#34; again, wtf?!?!? We had to try so hard to get someone&#39;s attention-our gorgeous waiter with the fab hair could not hear us saying &#34;sir, excuse me...excuse me Sir! Finally, after a long wait he brought us brown sugar cubes...I&#39;m thinking &#34;Do I have to go in the fucking kitchen and say where is your white sugar?&#34; But I was grateful and said thanks.

Oh the food part-were you wondering when I was going to get there?

Eggs Benedict, remember? Renamed Niman Ranch Ham* poached eggs, hollandaise, izzio&#39;s challah &amp; house potatoes 15

It arrived...on some kind of white-ish bread-challah is jewish-eggs benedict are not. The sweet dry, untoasted and did I say cold? challah did not sync well with that seriously organic brown sugar cubes-just saying.

Bottom line-cold, yes friends, cold, cold eggs, cold hollandaise, cold bread, um I mean cold challah.

Service was great, beer &amp; wine menu was also great. Food slips a little bit. The fried pig ears were a stab in the wrong direction. I&#39;ve eaten pig ear dishes all across the planet and this one missed the mark; under-seasoned, some were too hard to chew, sauce was great. Cheese/ham balls were good. Steak was good, not great. Pasta dish was good, not great - also had the appearance of being scant compared to the other dish on the table. Overall, a 3.5...I was expecting better."

Me and my bud totally spoiled ourselves at lunch. The service was fantastic.  Food was delish.  Can&#39;t wait to go back. The bartender treated us to olives and made a wonderful Rose wine recommendation. I had oysters salad and the ragout.  (I mentioned we totally spoiled ourselves ).

I loved everything about the aesthetic - from the pendant lighting to the exposed brick to the tea towels to the rustic seating. Everything was elegant but laid back. 

Our server was average. Semi-attentive, did nothing above and beyond, but did not neglect us either. 

The food was good. A little bit bland but still, very fresh, rustic, and tasty. 

Lunch was more than I was expecting ($60 for 2 small apps and 2 mains). Overall I just felt like The Kitchen lacked a special spark. It&#39;s perfectly lovely but I was hoping for something really unique to stand out at me. Still, I would recommend The Kitchen and happily return myself."

We decided to give The Kitchen a try based on the reviews here on Yelp and on a recommendation from a friend. With the weather being so nice, we sat at one of the outdoor tables. The staff was outstanding, our waitress very helpful and friendly. 

We started with some oysters and they were delicious. I had the Ribeye Frites and it was cooked to perfection. Perfectly medium rare and the frites were perfect. I finished up dinner with the sticky toffee dessert, and it was yummy!

Definitely worth the price and is on the list of places to visit again."

We arrived during Community Hour so we started with a few &#34;starter items&#34; from that menu. I believe it was the Burrata and Winter Squash Bruschetta, Marinated Olive and Goat Gouda Gougere - ALL AMAZING. My favorite was probably that Burrata and Winter Squash Bruschette. Creamy and flavorful. Man, I could eat that everday!

I also ordered a Persian Lemon to drink (lemon vodka, Pama, pineapple and fresh lemon - delicious!). Highly recommend. 

For an entree I got the House Made Pappardele which was very good. I won&#39;t lie - it&#39;s not the best thing I&#39;ve ever had and after seeing what my comrades got, I kind of wish I would have ordered differently. However, it was flavorful and a generous portion. My friends got the Speckled Sea Trout and the Wisdom Farms Chicken and really seemed to enjoy both.

For dessert, we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding - it&#39;s an absolute must! Rich and sweet...so good. 

I remain a big fan of The Kitchen and I hope to return soon. Next I think I may see what&#39;s up at the Fort Collins location :)"

We ordered the seafood platter and split it for dinner. Everything was perfect, except for the crab. It was flavorless. But I can give that a pass as I grew up catching and eating fresh Dungeness. Dinner wasn&#39;t cheap, but we had a great night in a pretty restaurant with delicious food and wine."

He made the reservations so I didn&#39;t know what I was in for-- boy was I in for a treat! We were a bit early per our reservation but they were able to seat us immediately and took our coats at the door. When we first came in it was a bit on the louder side but he made note on our reservation that it was a special occasion and if we could be seated in a quieter area; low and behold they took note of his request and we were seated in a quieter part of the restaurant!

I splurged and ordered the &#39;Seafood Bar&#39; and my boyfriend got the rib eye. The food was SUPERB and the seafood I had was fantastic, though I think I should&#39;ve gotten the full instead of the half ;) The wait staff was ON POINT; from our waiter Skyler to everyone else... they were just awesome. Insightful, attentive, and friendly-- really everything you expect and more from a restaurant on a service perspective. For dessert, I ordered the pot au chocolat and the boyfriend the apple cobbler. When they brought the desserts out they had candles on the plate which I thought was super sweet and thoughtful.

My boyfriend and I just had such a great time; the food was great and the service was excellent. It was really just a wonderful experience. The hostess even helped me put my coat on! SO SWEET. Thank you so much for the evening, it really made the night that much more special to us."

Enter into a warehouse setting and you can see the bartender using his mixology skills to make one of their unique cocktails. Service was friendly and perfect. Dinner was delicious. The farm to table ingredients in most of the dishes make the food fresh and seasonal. Dont pass up the pumpkin bruschetta which was a table favorite for us. They have an extensive beer and wine selection with many local breweries featured. Highly recommended if you are in the Denver area!!!"

I had the lamb burger for lunch.  It was ok, but it was overcooked.  

I&#39;ll probably try it again b/c my wife really wants to try it, so hopefully I&#39;ll have a better experience next time around."

The oysters are not good compared to the east coast. I had the steak and my husband had the blognese. They were not good and totally not worth the price at all. I won&#39;t be going back.

As far as complete experience goes, this is my favorite restaurant in Denver - the ambiance, the service, the food, the desserts - everything is amazing.

My husband and I had our wedding reception here in the back room and it was perfect and cozy. The guests raved on about the food, especially the dessert... Chocolate Nemeses and Sticky Toffee.

We came back tonight for the first time since our wedding and ordered the pork chop with cherries and the Koberstein steak - both were perfectly prepared. For dessert, the GM, Ken, surprised us with a port pairing as a wedding congrats. It was so unexpected and kind, thank you Ken!

This place has a special place in our hearts and we always look forward to coming back."
the-kitchen-denver-denver-3,Jennifer B.,RRtMl0kS2ntfoxcQPJcmZA,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,974,2,cwJL7q-XcuLkP0Wh6v0RHQ,5.0,2013-11-19,"When the BF and I are downtown we both automatically think of The Kitchen, not because it&#39;s convenient (it is) but because we&#39;ve had stellar service and mind blowing food and coming back time and time again is the only reasonable thing to do.

The atmosphere at The Kitchen is gorgeous, beautiful bar area and a dimly lit dining room that adds to the ambiance.  The exposed brick and industrial lighting gives this place a great vibe.  

Everything we&#39;ve had on the menu has been spectacular.  Simple food executed with perfection by a kitchen staff who cares about every last detail.  

HH offers a wonderful variety of menu items, some from the dinner menu at a discount and some that are just on the HH menu.  My first experience with tasting oysters ($2.50 per on HH) was here, the &#34;fish guy&#34; took great care of me and told me about what would taste best for a newbie.  Turns out, I&#39;m an oyster lover!  The oysters were presented beautifully on a bed of ice with a champagne mignonette, cocktail sauce and of course some lemon.  The oysters had no gristle in the oyster or on the shell and tasted fresh from the sea.  

In addition to the oysters the bruschetta is always a surprise and never disappoints.  The base is a crostini with a generous portion of burrata and the topping changes based on the season.  Ask the bartender or server what the topping is for the evening, we&#39;ve had heirloom tomato&#39;s and we&#39;ve also had a crisp celery salad of sorts on top that was incredible.  

The mussels are also out of this world.  We tried Ingrid&#39;s Mussels and were a little disappointed that the Fresno chili flavor did not come through more, literally no heat, and we love heat.  The &#34;fish guy&#34; quickly offered us a taste of the Chilled Smoked Mussels which have a distinct smoky flavor and became one of my favorite dishes that evening.  If I had choice between the two mussels, I would want the chilled smoked ones every time.  

I dream of the pumpkin soup we had on our latest visit.  It coated my mouth like a warm blanket and made me wish it was Fall all year long so I could enjoy this soup.  On top was a mushroom duxelle with cream fraiche that created the perfect spoonful every time.  We scraped the bowl clean and enjoyed every last bit.

One night before a show down at DPAC, the BF and I split the Halibut.  The bartender was kind enough to have the order split in the kitchen so we each received our own plate (nice touch).  The Halibut could not be more tender and the roasted mushrooms added heartiness to the dish without overpowering the fish.  A delicate dish packed with flavor from the mushrooms and the lemon herb broth.  How do the Yelp peeps say it, Amazeballs!

Oh my, I almost forgot dessert, we&#39;ve actually had two over our multiple visits.  The Chocolate Cake (death by chocolate) was rich and coated my entire mouth with creamy dark chocolate to my delight.  This could easily be shared by three or more and everyone would be satisfied with a few decadent bites.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding was crazy, and could be renamed &#34;The Heart Attack&#34;.  This tasted heavenly, although after a few bites I think I went into sugar shock.  I highly recommend sharing this dessert with a large group.  

The Kitchen creates an elegant ambiance and executes food that keeps me coming back for more.  If I lived downtown it&#39;s quite possible that I would eat here every night."

Ambiance was nice, our cocktails were all good too..... The food was pretty good but slightly overpriced... My biggest problem was the service.  I was warned that service is not great in this town bc there are a bunch of younger people with no work ethic.  Our server was nice but so indifferent... We didn&#39;t have Silverware when the meal came... My friend ordered a glass of wine to go with her dinner and he forgot and brought it at the end of the meal... After dinner our plates were left in front of us for 10 minutes while servers walked around aimlessly.  I said something loud enough for our server to hear and then they were cleared.. My friend asked for dessert menus and she was cut off by the server that ran to another table bc he thought he was needed there.. He didn&#39;t return for 10 minutes which is when we discussed leaving and doing dessert elsewhere.
Overall not my worst experience in a restaurant but it was the first time we went out for a nice meal down town and were sadly disappointed. 

The biggest problem is that our server never acknowledged anything was wrong... I expect good service when I pay 50/ person..a simple &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and an effort to buy the wine that was ordered to accompany a meal yet came after.  No manager presence either.  I ran restaurants for 10 years and would never have had this many mishaps take place without doing something small to offset ... It&#39;s amazing what a complimentary dessert will do to fix someone&#39;s experience.     Maybe we just went to the wrong place??

Ps the Gouda balls were great yet need a cranberry / blackberry jam sauce to accompany."

However, that was the only immediate part of the dining experience. We put in our order and waited 30 min before receiving our glasses of the kitchen red wine. Our entrées were brought out until 50 min later, almost 9pm. We were never even offered bread and tables around us were served and done before we got our food. We ordered the steak and lamb. We were excited about the farm to table concept and thought this would be akin to Founding Farmers in DC, which we love. The food was ok. The steak had a pesto sauce that the kitchen was able to sub out for a vegan pesto sauce due to a dairy allergy. I appreciated that but they didn&#39;t provide a steak knife with the entree and the steak was so tough it was difficult to cut and chew. It took some time to get our bill as well. 

I didn&#39;t think it was worth the wait."

It was fantastic. I got to enjoy 4 courses of delicious food made my Nathan in the company of great people! I took my mother there who was on a 30 day diet of no sugar, dairy, or grains. She was able to have everything but the dessert. She instead had the fresh made mint tea (yummy!). Linda was our server and she rocked it. Highly recommend coming in and trying the community night, it&#39;s a different type of dining that not every restaurant can provide."

Visiting Denver and went because of all the positive reviews and the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  Had the carnitas hash scramble and it lacked any seasoning.  It is the first time I&#39;ve added salt. Additionally our bland food arrived before the house &#34;specialty&#34; Bloody Mary which was also extremely disappointing.  My wife added bacon to her Bloody Mary and was astonished that the $2 up charge was for barely a quarter slice of bacon. The house specialty mix seemed watered down and inferior to store bought mix.  I wanted to sample other diner&#39;s meals t see if we just picked the wrong menu item.  A complete waste of $50+.

The staff were very attentive and friendly, and several stopped by to wish us congrats. We started with a mocktail, perfect and not too sweet. We enjoyed the mussels (amazing!) and the steak with fries (Bernadine sauce was so good!). Both meals had a lovely presentation, the ingredients were fresh, and the plates were warm when served. We thoroughly enjoyed the homemade mint gelato for dessert - it was such a sweet surprise. Best of all, our waitress Taylor told us the gelato was on the house as an anniversary gift. It was such a sweet gesture. The ambiance of this restaurant is great, and the bar appeared to be a fun spot as well. It is a pricey option for dinner, but we found it to be well worth the cost and look forward to a future visit."

I had the oysters and mussels. Let me tell you, the mussels there are HUGE! Some places you go you get mussels that are a little rubbery or chewy. Not this place - these were super fresh and flavorful. Each bite just melts in your mouth.

The other reason why I love this place is because of the bartender. I&#39;m not a picky drinker, but I definitely appreciate when a drink is well made. My go-to drink is a Pimm&#39;s Cup, and because it&#39;s not the super popular drink, I know it&#39;s a good bartender if they can make it well. And mine was perfect - balanced mix of Pimms, soda, and cucumber :) Made my night.

Plus, the bartender also recommended a great bourban based on my scotch preferences. Extra plus!"

For of us took uber on a Friday night so we could try their specialty cocktails.  It was early so it wasnt too crowded, but still plenty of people to create that buzz of excitement and anticipation.  Along with cocktails and beer we started off with oysters and the cheese plate.  The oysters were so fresh and tasty.  If you put your ear up to them I&#39;m sure you could hear the sea.  We decided one plate of them wasn&#39;t enough so we ordered another.  The cheese plate was good but pretty standard.  The bleu cheese and honey was the best. 
We weren&#39;t very inventive with our entrees.  Three orders of crab legs and I had the hanger steak.  The crab legs were awesome.  Not a sound from those three  but the sound of cracking shells.  The hanger steak was a little chewy but you sort of expect that with hanger steak.  It was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.

Perfect service through the night.  Sort of a team concept where anyone can help you.  We never wanted for anything.  Great place.  Can&#39;t wait to go back."

The food, however, is good but not attractive enough to make me want to go back. The garlic fries was good; the organic mushrooms on toast was great; the roasted organic beet salad was good; the pork terrine was just ok. 

The desserts were probably the best part about the visit. Eton Mess was just great! Light and not too filling. The sticky toffee pudding was very good but too sweet. I couldn&#39;t have more than 3 bites....."

I was going to give the kitchen 2 stars but just couldn&#39;t do it. Here is my experience. My party had reservations, restaurant was not crowded, and somehow we got stuck in an awkward booth/table next to the kitchen. The drink menus are long but lack substance. Nothing unique on cocktails, beer is standard, and the wine list is original  but nothing exciting.  The sommelier recommended a wine, in fact it was on the list of the restaurants top picks. He based the recommendation off of our interests, Napa cabs or heavier pinots.  This was nothing like either of those, a sour light red, 2015 vintage, would have been better in sangria. We ordered some apps and while they tasted good, were underwhelming. The burrata flatbread was nothing more than a pita with melted cheese. We ordered the stripped bass, two steaks and the vegetarian pasta. The dry aged steak at 38 dollars was ordered medium rare and the burgers cut skirt steak was ordered medium well( I know) with the béarnaise on the side. The steaks came out backwards, the dry aged was a piece of leather and the skirt was medium with extra sauce on the meat. Our waiter could not be found so it was a few minutes to notify him of the significant error (it is worth mentioning it was about 25 minutes for the food to arrive and the restaurant was not full). After getting up to find the waiter and notifying him, Another waitress came by and to solve the issue. Her solution was just to take the food away. Not offering a solution. We didn&#39;t want to wait more time for two new plates to be made more did we want to send two steaks to the garbage. It became a standoff with the waitress until we finally sent the skirt steak back to be cooked further (maybe the rinsed the sauce off). Overall The steaks and fish were not worth the price. I would rate them low quality. The pasta was the only decent dish, but 18 for a small serving of above average pasta is a tough sell. My other table mates ordered dessert (don&#39;t know why at this point). The three desserts, cherry tart, bread pudding and something else unmemorable were not good. The solution for all the mix up was to comp the desserts and two drinks. A mix up on the order is understandable but not asking what we would like to do to solve it was not helpful.  Wine was awful. Lastly the waiter and sommelier came by the table and apologized about the food but it felt disingenuous as they made the comment and walked away. We won&#39;t come back and hope the restaurant improves the food and menu in the future as the restaurant has the potential to be something."

I ordered the Pork Vietnamese Salad (Goi) w/ spring rolls.  I asked how long till ready and I was told 15 minutes (actually only took them about 5 minutes to hand me my order).  Order was less than $10, so I figured that it must have been a lunch special.

got back to hotel to discover that they gave me a Banh Mi (pork sandwich) instead of the salad.  however, the sandwich was excellent, as were the spring rolls.  I know that I should ding their rating for the order mix-up, but this is such a great little place, I can&#39;t bring myself to do so."

We have tried several Vietnamese restaurants on Federal Blvd., ostensibly the best area for Vietnamese, and I wasn&#39;t impressed.  Luckily we ran into this place, which is on par or above most of the Vietnamese restaurants in San Jose.

Everything about this place is completely the opposite of a typical pho restaurant; service is outstanding with the decor fresh and clean.  The owners are super friendly and greet us by name.  

The Grilled Shrimp Spring Rolls were excellent; the grilled shrimp added a lot of flavor.  Also had pho a couple of times. The pho broth was very rich and flavorful! The rice noodles were also tasty, but I was a bit disappointed that they did not have my favorite yellow egg noodles.  The brisket was plentiful and very tender.  We also had the Vietnamese Plater, which I highly recommend; it&#39;s tasty, fun and healthy.  

Their Fruit Smoothies are amazing and I would recommend the Taro flavor with Boba.  I get it every time I&#39;m here.

 I was informed that they&#39;re mostly for people who order to go but if you ask for one they will gladly accommodate you!

Tonight we tried their Vietnam Platter and it was one of the best! It rivals any of the dishes similar to it back home in the South Bay.

I was first impressed by the welcoming kindness of all the employees I encountered. I went in knowing what I wanted -pho ga (essentially chicken noodle soup Vietnamese style). And I impulse ordered spring rolls, with shrimp only (shrimp and pork is usual here). The food came out quick. 

The spring rolls came with two and were quite large! Also, they were served with peanut sauce -I&#39;m not a fan of peanut sauce to begin with, but it was thick and tasted nice. 

I ordered a large bowl of pho ga, and it was a LARGE bowl of soup; too much for me to eat with the spring rolls. The broth was very delicious and they did not skimp on the meat. I liked that the fixings that you use to control your taste and texture were on the side (jalapeños, limes, bean sprouts, and basil). I wasn&#39;t a big fan of basil in my soup, as I prefer cilantro, but I was happy to try it!"

But I guess it does take a spot on Federal to have better soup. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Pho Vietnam&#39;s pho uses powder mix to make the broth, which you can also make at home, so it won&#39;t even do for a quick fix. 

The grilled stuff is more of their specialty but compared to other old timers on Federal, similar dishes cost more here and the portion is less. But the family that runs the business is so nice their service almost makes up for it. I hope they continue to do well!"

I had pork and shrimp summer roll and noodle soup with flank, brisket and tripe.. this was one of the most flavorful soups I have had in a long time. I added very little hoison sauce. It was served with the traditional basil, sprouts, jalapeño etc...

One downfall is don&#39;t order sake, they don&#39;t serve alcohol lol.. oops I should of looked before I asked.

Literally, I could tell from the great reviews, but low volume this place must be starting out, but man the food is great, the customer service is phenomenal, and seating was available instantly. Parking was plentiful! We tried the Vietnamese sandwich (Beef), the chicken wings,  the iced coffee, and and a large combo Pho. So  one of the only things I found a little disappointing, but it was minor was that they have a sml,med,large, and xlg bowl size for pho. XLG was 9.75, and the lrg 8.75 I would normally go for the biggest bowl they offer, but as this was my first time here I wanted to try a few different things with my girlfriend. So I ordered the lrg, and when it came it&#39;s size reminded me of the mediums I typically see in other restaurants that I frequent. That being the case I&#39;d probably would have been very disappointed with the size of the small they have, if I had ordered thinking it would have been comparable to the small size bowls I&#39;m used to from other restaurants.  The only other thing I could think of was the spring rolls, they were good, but lacking a flavor I&#39;m used to from others I&#39;ve tried, I think it may have been spearmint, but they were fresh and delicious still. Peanut sauce was good as well, but still lacking a little flavor I&#39;ve become accustomed to seeing with other restaurants. I liked that the sauce was thicker than other restaurants I&#39;ve been to, and had extra peanuts!!! Chicken wings were fried to order, were juicy, crisp, and delicious. Sandwich with grilled beef was excellent as well (first time we&#39;ve tried this, it was simple, but delicious, meat was grilled perfectly). We were stuffed by the time we left, and as I stated very impressed. Always nice to find some place new that gives you a great first experience. Waitstaff was extremely nice, friendly, and on point with refilling the waters (before you got down to the ice), etc. Will definitely be back if on that side of town again!

We started with the grilled shrimp spring rolls - some of the best we&#39;ve ever had. Grilling the shrimp adds a very nice flavor to the spring rolls. 

I had the Bánh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich), which was fantastic. The baguette was crisp and fresh, the grilled chicken and jalapeños were spot-on. 

My wife had the Bun with grilled shrimp and loved it. Everything was very fresh, portion sizes are generous. 

Ambience is typical of what you&#39;d expect in a strip mall (which really doesn&#39;t bother me)- but it was clean and the service was fast and friendly.

The Pho broth had almost no flavor.  I ordered a medium Pho Thai Nam.  As someone else put it &#34;they skimp on Ingredients&#34;.  The medium is actually the size of other places Large. BUT, I only got 7 little strips of meat.  We had to get another pot of hot tea because the first one was just warm.  Two others at the table got the chicken, one of them couldn&#39;t even eat his and the other guy thought his was edible but not good. 

There were busser&#39;s tubs of whole chickens sitting on the floor and on a table in the back  room where everyone could see it - code says they are supposed to be thawed in a fridge.  
Out of 5 people at lunch, only one was just OK with his Pho.  The rest of us didn&#39;t like it. 
The new owners of this place are either clueless or extremely cheap.

Along with two handfuls of hard pho noodles in a small bowl. I don&#39;t quite understand how they thought it was logical to be so OBVIOUSLY skimpy with their meat.

Their food is consistently delicious and their service is wonderful.  So far I&#39;ve tried their pho and rice platter with pork chops multiple times. The pho broth is light but has a full flavor and the meat is tender. The rice is perfectly soft and fluffy and the pork chops are deliciously seasoned. Honestly I give Pho Vietnam 5 stars because their homemade fish sauce is to die for, and they have no problem serving me free refills of fish sauce. In addition, Pho Vietnam always has a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy a meal in. The restaraunt is never full to the brim or loud, and the owners always come by and chat. The prices are also fair, I never pay more than 15$ for a meal for myself (I always get an avocado smoothie).

(Was only supposed to be 2, but I couldn&#39;t resist with the smells as I waited) I opened each one and immediately sampled one of everything. Mo, you have a customer for life so long as I&#39;m not struggling to fit in my jeans. 
I always order lots of things to go when trying a new joint, and I have never been so happy with everything as I was with all 10 things I tried. I don&#39;t even LIKE cornbread, generally. But I liked this kind! Nothing was overly salted; I thank you... that is half the reason I can&#39;t stand any BBQ joint in Denver. Proper collard greens that don&#39;t taste like a salt lick?! What!? This is hands down the only place that reminds me of down home cooking, my grandmothers fried chicken, and BBQ flavors that I was used to back in KY. Soul food at its finest. And if you are one to complain about fat on brisket, don&#39;t talk to me. Eat a your quinoa and raw kale salad and stay out of my new favorite BBQ joint. If there&#39;s a rather large piece of fat, you eat a little bit of it with each piece of meat. You goons! 
Customer service was sweet and sincere, and the two men I encountered had the most genuine smiles. I need to know where mister Mo is from though, I&#39;ll ask next time. 
I will also arrive earlier to make sure I get to order Mac n cheese before they sell out to the person in front of me again :) That&#39;s a good sign if you ask me! 
For the record, I am not eating all 3 BBQ plates in one sitting, though I could. I&#39;m sharing and saving some for dinner too. My leg isn&#39;t THAT hollow."

I come from the south east and I know BBQ and Soul. My father owns a smokehouse in South East Ohio and for years now I&#39;ve been looking for good BBQ here in Colorado and let me tell you, I&#39;m pretty picky. This place though, it&#39;s on point! You&#39;re choice of anything on the menu will bring you to a point of down home, mouth watering goodness. 

They bring you traditional fares of collard greens slow cooked with bacon and andouille sausage, mashed potatos with homemade gravy and slow worked ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Their desserts are out of this world and include sweet potato pie, bread pudding with apples, banana pudding and more.

The chef, lovingly called MO really knows what he&#39;s doing and comes to the front to really know you. His kind hearted nature really shows with the food as he puts his soul into his work, business and over all the cuisine that he puts out.

I&#39;d really suggest stopping in a trying what he has to offer, this will be somewhere I keep going over and over again.

The Good: the brisket meat was really tasty, so was the Mac and cheese. Baked beans were also tasty but not incredible. 

The bad: the brisket was really, really fatty. I&#39;m no stranger to brisket and I know some fat is necessary, however this was overkill. Half of my portion was inedible chunks of fat. Not worth $13 whatsoever. The chicken wings were just bad. They were very chewy and soggy and clearly not cooked well or long enough. The fries that came with them were also subpar. 

Note there is no inside seating and this place is overpriced. Would probably not return to be perfectly honest."

When I do eat BBQ, I normally go for pulled pork or something I can put in a sandwich or eat with a fork. However, the ribs at Anointed BBQ &amp; Soul Food are savory and delicious without sauce on them!! The ribs, the macaroni and cheese, the catfish nuggets, the wings - are some of the best tasting foods I have ever had!! The staff is courteous and friendly even when they are slammed. I think the food here is on par with (if not better than) the food I used to be able to get at Tom&#39;s - but it&#39;s not as pricey and there&#39;s not a line around the block for lunch - (at least not yet)!!"

The atmosphere is spot on, as well. It was like being transported back. The rib tips are wonderfully smoky and just the right combination of tender meat with a perfectly chewy bark. The collards are excellent, the beans are an adventurous recipe that still really works. The coleslaw is better than mine. You don&#39;t know how much it hurts me to admit that. (My 6 year old consoled me by saying she likes mine better.) All of that along with with patient, friendly service and this place is instantly in my top 10. I will be back soon and often.

I was so excited to eat some real southern cooking my mouth was watering when we walked in the door. I have to say Anointed BBQ and Soul Food sky rocketed way past my high hopes and satisfied the southern food cravings i have had for years! We ordered 2 dark meat fried chicken dinners, and a rib dinner. Our sides were fried green tomatoes, collard greens, black eyed peas,  and mac and cheese to go as there is no place to sit down and eat. I took a bite of that crispy fried chicken and the meat was juicy and perfectly done. The rib meat fell of the bone. The fried green tomatoes were a bit soggy but flavor of the tomatoes well then made up for it. The collard greens were cooked to tender perfection pieces of smokey bacon and ham hocks! The black eyed peas were chocked full the same smokey  flavor meat. The mac and cheese was baked to perfection.  All in all the whole meal really took me back to the south with every bite i took. I highly recommend this diamond in the rough to everyone! I have added this southern delight to my favorite restaurant list. Thank you Mo for the love that you infused into the bestest ever southern meal i have had the pleasure of experiencing in over a decade!"

Service, space and philosophy all in keeping with its hip RiNo location. The live weekend music was an added plus; we listened to a talented swing trio that entertained but did not overwhelm dinner conversation. 

The Preservery, despite its name, is forward-looking and innovative in everything it does.  It does not allow tipping (and the service charge is included in the menu prices).   It sources as much as it can in-house or locally, from the baked goods, to the herbs on your salad grown on site.  A board shows where most of the meat and produce come from, and you can buy many products from the market counter that adjoins the restaurant.   In some restaurants, this focus on local can come off as gimmicky, but at the Preservery, it seems authentic and part of what they do.  And it&#39;s definitely reflected in the excellent and fresh menu offerings.   We were here for dinner and had a selection of the entrees and salads, along with the house made hummus plate which was a great shared starter.   The ling cod dish was superb, tasty and cooked perfectly.  I had the wagyu short rib dish, which was flavorful and made more interesting with a oatmeal base that was cooked like a risotto.   The meat was a bit lean for a short rib, but it still was fork tender. The porkbelly entree was delicious, and it came in a pool of red sauce that was as spicy as its color.  (The belly itself was a bit cold at its center; I think it needed to be left in the oven longer to heat it all the way through.)     

The service was attentive and comfortable.  We were greeted by both the husband and wife who run the Preservery (he does front of house; she is the chef).  With wide open garage doors, reasonably priced drinks, wicked good live music, and a hip location, they are really onto something worth preserving on the Denver dining scene."

We started with scallops ceviche and samosas. The presentation was a work of art and the flavors were wonderful. The ceviche came on little spoons reminding us of an amuse bouche we had in Napa. Roasted corn, lime and a little kick with beautiful flower petals to top. The samosas were perfectly little fried pockets of curry with a wonderful chutney on the side. 

For our main I got the cod. What a surprising blend of flavors. I wasn&#39;t sure about the advertised tomato broth it came with, but it was the perfect compliment to the fish. The charred leeks and black lentils all blended so well together. My husband got the wagyu steak and potatoes. Amazingly tender as one would expect and perfectly cooked. 

For dessert I had the pan cake which was not at all what I expected from looking at the menu. It was a sponge cake with chocolate mousse layered in the middle and a delectably tart passion fruit sorbet on the side. Hubby got the beignets half filled with Nutella and the other half just dusted with sugar. They were warm and just melted in your mouth. All through the meal I took my time so I could savor each little bite. One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a while!"

This is a review for dinner; I could see it being better for lunch or as a market.

Space: The space is really nice; large, open, and modern (even if the stormtroopers perched in random places struck me as an odd touch). They had live music during dinner, which is an unusual and mostly welcome touch for dinner.

Drinks: Not so good. My wife isn&#39;t big into strong drinks, so usually orders something tall. I can&#39;t remember what she ordered, but it was strong in a way that was really unbalanced. The Old Fashioned was what I&#39;d expect at an average bar, not what you&#39;d expect for $12 at a restaurant with a &#34;craft cocktail&#34; program. 

Food: We started with a salad topped with a Scottish egg; I can&#39;t remember what exactly was in it, but this is truly the worst thing I&#39;ve eaten in a long time. The flavors didn&#39;t work together in a way that was so drastic that it was a bit stomach-churning. It is really rare to get anything quite that bad in Denver, which is what knocks this review down from three stars to two.

The hummus was just hummus.

The grilled octopus was the best thing we had, but it was too rich in a way that didn&#39;t work with the octopus, which has a subtle flavor and stands on its own when well-prepared.

I had the pork tenderloin as my main. I don&#39;t really remember a thing about it, which says enough.

Anyway, it seemed like such a promising concept that I&#39;m sad it didn&#39;t work out, but with so many other great options around, we won&#39;t be back."

The space is super cute, but they failed on the food. It was all just ok. We started with the octopus and Brussel sprout salad. The salad was pretty good, but needed some salt. The octopus was just eh. The sauce it was in was good on the bread alone. We then shared the pork belly and ranch steak. The steak was just a steak that I could have made better at home. The pork belly had some good flavors in it, which you need to get a forkful of everything, including the sauce. We ended dinner with the beignets. They were just eh. Again, space is super cool. Very &#34;typical&#34; of a new restaurant in Denver. They&#39;re trying to do the market, hipster vibe. Bonus, the store next door ha super cute clothes/accessories."

Very friendly staff with solid recommendations. I enjoyed a pinot noir and the braised rabbit in vinegar sauce. My date had the freemont summer ale and the niman ranch pork tenderloin. Both delicious!!! The rabbit was more buttery than I had expected but tasty. Frankly the guy who delivered the plate called it plenty fatty and buttery. That got in my head. BUT I still enjoyed it. 

Some surprising pros to this place:
1. Hipster(ish) environment but the staff were not pretentious
2. Tip is already added to the price listed on each menu item. (Not added to your tab) The staff also remind you of this before your pay. 
3. Not so surprising the the outdoor patio was enjoyable

Was here the weekend before last for a wedding shower brunch and was blown away by the entire experience. From service, food, libations and a few tunes played on the piano-nothing disappointed. I don&#39;t think they typically open until noon on Saturday and we were there beginning at 11am, having the dining room to ourselves.  The space is open, eclectic and inviting. Open deli-like counter displaying meats? Check. A wall of local products and goods? Yep. Storm Troopers abound? Hell yes. I felt like I was hanging at a friends dinner table given the laid back vibe. Nothing pretentious too-cool-for-school here. Breath of fresh air in Rino.

The owner was incredibly gracious and warm while introducing himself and the restaurant.  He even played a few numbers on the piano throughout the afternoon.  I think our party stayed long past our predicted and arranged time, but given the atmosphere and truly welcoming feeling we lost track and let the good times continue!  (And considering that, let me add that we never felt rushed to wrap things up.) The charcuterie and cheese offerings we had were delicious and no empty glass was ever found.  It truly was a fantastic outing.  Can&#39;t wait to return with friends and sample other offerings. Thank you staff of The Preservery for your hospitality and  providing such a memorable experience.

Loosely based around a N&#39;awlins model that brings food, community and music together, the owners have created an inviting space that let&#39;s you relax, nosh on yummy food, drink stunning carefully-crafted beverages, and listen to local musicians in a very casual, welcoming setting.

Our large group of 14 grabbed a high top and started in on the drinks.  We drank them out of &#34;the Blake&#34;, a blackberry and tequila concoction.  We moved on to the Preservery Punch, a Blood Orange and Tequila concoction.  Uber took us home, which was good: the drinks were stiff!

Foodwise, we enjoyed the clams- high praise!  There was almost a girl fight over not sharing the clams (my money was on the blonde). We also tried the beet and kale salad (yum), the beignets, and the charcuterie cheese board.  Ummm.  check out the amazing ancient grain mustard, then buy some- they have a little pantry..Mmmm

Overall, it was fantastic but I was surprised to see the place was pretty quiet on a Thursday night.  For four people, we had two appetizers and three entrees.  The wagyu sliders should be illegal.  OMG.  The pickles were also pretty good, but on our night they screwed up and also brought us a cheese &amp; charcuterie plate by mistake - our win!  The chicken, short rib, and cod were all great with my favorite being the rib.  The nutella beignets, while a bit non-traditional, were absolutely sinful and went very well with the apple butter ice cream.  With the built-in tip, the check seemed high at first but it was pretty odd yet enjoyable to be handed a receipt with just a signature line... considering the volume of food we had with wine and cocktails, per-person price was right in line with comparable restaurants.

Today we went back for the second time and we decided to have the same sandwiches that we have the first time. Big mistake!

They serve a variety of the local craft beers along with mixed drinks. I had the citrus lager, excellent. My friends had the Margarita  and raved over the freshness. All of their prices included tip. This was a first for me. The only downside is their menu is limited. So if you or your guest are picky eaters, this could pose a problem.

The first thing we noticed was that they have no tip pricing, and the prices were reasonable even with that caveat.  

The drink menu looked creative and enticing, but I&#39;ll need to return to order a cocktail.  We shared the dishes between the 3 of us, so the amounts were perfect and the price reasonable.  We got the scallop ceviche which was nicely seasoned (delicate flavor not overpowered by one thing) and the wild rice croquette with mushroom gravy (hints of sage and fried perfectly.). We ordered the West Coast Salad (olive caramel is hard to describe how wonderful that is on the frisée) and the short ribs and the chicken as the second course.  Those two dishes were very good and arrived hot.  The only complaint is they didn&#39;t have a serving spoon since we had told them we were eating family style.

The waiter and entire staff were attentive (maybe overly asking me if they could take my plate, I told you I was a cynic!) The duo was really fun in the background, I love that the restaurant supports local musicians.

But today we were 5 people that arrived to take lunch to go.  I ordered first and after my friends all got their sandwiches and I had not I spoke to the woman at the counter.  She gave me a free cookie for their error.

The muffuletta was $12 and the bread was wrong.  Spongy and too much.  It tasted fine.

Kinks are being worked out, so I&#39;ll give it another shot.

It took me a while to try it out because the first few weeks it was open, it was slammed.  It has been open now for a little over 2 months, which should be ample time to work out the kinks, right?  Apparently not.

My first visit was Saturday night, a couple of friends and I stopped by for drinks.  The blonde bartender sauntered over and was not knowledgable or helpful in the least.  And $9 for a draft IPA?  Come on.  (and yes I know all about their &#34;no tipping&#34; concept.  I&#39;ll get to that).  We were only having drinks but we watched lots of yummy food come out to the tables around us, so I wanted to return and try lunch and dinner.

Yesterday my friends and I arrived for lunch.  The place was not busy at all, and there were at least a dozen or so employees milling about, but no one greets you when you enter or sit down.  We were a little disappointed in the limited lunch menu, but decided to check it out anyway.  What struck me immediately is there doesn&#39;t seem to be any &#34;flow&#34; to this place.  You are basically left to fend for yourself.  One of the lunch items listed permanently on the menu is a &#34;market special&#34; that obviously changes daily.  Is it written on a chalkboard or anything anywhere?  Nope.  So we finally go up to order.  My friends placed their order first, which included 2 glasses of wine.  They returned to their table only to watch the bartender mill about for a good 8 minutes before noticing the ticket for their wine.  I go up to place my order and the ONLY smile I got from an employee in two visits was from the blonde lady, who turned out to be one of the owners.  I ordered the muffuletta and asked that it be toasted (all of their sandwiches are cold, btw).  She said yes, and said to allow &#34;an extra minute or two for it to be toasted.&#34;  No problem, I said.  I went and got my own fountain drink, bag of chips and sat down.  And waited.  And waited.  We were one of maybe 4 other tables in the entire restaurant at this point, two of which had long since eaten and were chatting.  I waited an eternal 17 minutes before my friend got up and asked what was taking so long.  In that time NO ONE came up to check on us.  I watched as the guy behind the counter went to the glass deli case, removed a sandwich and popped it into the toaster.  A minute later I had my sandwich, delivered with a half-hearted mumbled apology.  I asked him to please send over a manager when he had a moment.  The owner came over and instead of really apologizing, said repeatedly that it was &#34;just a miscommunication.&#34;  She argued with me that my sandwich had been in the oven the entire time, when I questioned whether or not she&#39;d forgotten to enter my order.  No real remorse, she turned and left and didn&#39;t offer to comp my meal.  A few minutes later she returned with a brown paper bag containing a large bag of chips, a couple of cookies, and the molten lava that was my sandwich that had been in the oven for 20 minutes, wrapped in aluminum foil and now hard as a rock.

Here&#39;s why I&#39;ll never go back to the Preservery:  There are SO MANY great restaurants in RiNo.  I know, I live here.  I almost exclusively eat out in my neighborhood.  The staff at the Preservery is sullen, apathetic and oblivious.  It truly was some of the worst &#34;service&#34; i&#39;ve ever had in my life.  It&#39;s too bad, because the concept is interesting; providing a decent hourly wage and health benefits to each employee.  Scratch made, locally sourced food.  But the one thing they have paid zero attention to is hiring pleasant, helpful front-of-the-house employees, and giving any attention to how those employees take care of their customers.  The food was good, but it&#39;s eclipsed by such substandard service."

The Preservery has some of the absolute BEST food in the US, and can certainly hold its own on a global basis as well. Everything that comes out of the kitchen is a creative masterpiece - you really can&#39;t go wrong no matter what you chose from the steak to the fried fish to the pork tenderloin. Awesome ambiance and bar that opens to a fabulous patio - favorite drink for summer is a gin drink served in a metal cup and it&#39;s icy cold - be careful - its more like lemonade than gin - super delicious!"

If you go before the dinner rush, your food is delivered by the head chef. Throughout the night the owners can be seen greeting guests, running food, and cleaning the bar. Gratuity is built into the pricing and staff are paid a living wage...it&#39;s a great environment and it shows on the plate!!"

However, I have yet to have a bad food experience. It makes no difference how much I love the staff or the location, good food in this hood is a competitive game - there&#39;s a lot to live up to. I love The Preservery&#39;s concept. It&#39;s progressive. They&#39;re giving their staff a good wage and taking out the extra step of tipping. Even though the staff isn&#39;t working for tips, they&#39;re just as passionate about the food, service and neighborhood as though they were. There are no traditional servers which gives you an opportunity to see and talk to the rest of the staff whether they&#39;re taking your order or delivering it. I always liked that about Crema, and it&#39;s similar here. 

Okay, so I eat here an embarrassing amount and In the month they&#39;ve been cranking I&#39;ve loved the nicoise salad. It&#39;s served kind of like lettuce wraps which makes eating it for lunch way easier than in a huge salad bowl. My go-to drink is either one of the tap beers or the Lawrence. Fresh pressed juice and alcohol. Yes. The escolar under the snacks menu is perfect at happy hour and the baked clams are on point. Kombucha on tap, a flapjack pastry and a strong, large coffee are my go-tos in the AM. 

If you live in the area, you know how much we needed a quality market. Their cases have local eggs, sweets, meats, kombucha, olives, chips, coffee beans, fresh baked bread (I ate a warm ciabatta whole while walking to my car the other day. It was not my finest moment, but i definitely don&#39;t regret it), chocolate, hot sauce, mustards and more. AND if you&#39;re a Noosa yogurt fan like I am, their prices on Noosa are at or lower than other stores. 

Add in live music and a nice patio and you can&#39;t go wrong."

I&#39;m ok with counter service, but paying $11 for a cocktail and $28 for an entree is not what I expect with counter service. Gratuity is included, but I don&#39;t normally tip 20% with counter service since you have to find your own seat, bus your own table, etc, so this isn&#39;t a good deal to me? The halibut was awesome, the cocktail was pretty weak, and not that great. If I&#39;m going to pay $11 for a drink I want Williams and Graham quality. The menu is limited and they don&#39;t have happy hour. I like the concept, but think they need to work out some bugs."

They don&#39;t open til 9am on week days and noon on weekends. WTF?  These guys need to have hours that reflect the neighborhood which means open at 7am M-S.   So, other places in RINO are better suited for early risers ie: Hi-Rise, Ink, Creama, Hutch &amp; Spoon,  Prices are step for neighborhood as well."

The Pres. has a lovely vibe inside (hip yet comfy) with wonderful food to match. The most concise way I can describe it is- thoughtful! My hummus on homemade ciabatta was perfect is every way; the mix of preserved lemon and pickled radish was super fun and refreshing on a classic vegetarian dish. I should also mention the Owners&#39; bread making skills rival any bakery in town. I&#39;m already looking forward to next time!

It took about an hour and a half for us to receive our food. While I appreciate that kitchens sometimes get backed up, we had no one speak to us in that entire time. No one came by to ask us how we were doing, no one came by to refill water, and no one updated us on why our food was taking so long. If anyone had come up, even once, I would have given this restaurant a much higher rating. When we did receive our food, it seemed as though the waiters and waitresses didn&#39;t know who it was even supposed to go to. We saw our plates walked around the restaurant and back into the kitchen before we were finally able to flag a waitress down. Additionally, we decided to order dessert, as the entrees were not very large, and that took another 35 minutes. Again, no one came up to ask us anything. The only thing that was quick about this restaurant was getting the check and processing our payment, which left an even more sour taste in our mouths. I really did want to like this place, as the decor is beautiful, and again, the food was truly amazing, but after the service we received, I don&#39;t think we will ever come back."

But it was an upstream battle because the place is just odd. First, you find a table in the same way you do at a ski resort cafeteria. You watch, hover and jump on a table as people are leaving. Everyone fend for themselves. To order food or drinks you got to either the counter or the bar. If food, you take a number to your table for delivery. Now, we&#39;re all used to this model---well, maybe not having to go to 2 different places to order, but the order, sit and wait for delivery part. But restaurants that have this model have price points around $10-15. We ordered a $28 entree and a snack and a salad. All prices include gratuity. Also an experiment in the industry that at first is jarring. The menu is limited. Some restaurants pull this off. Here it wasn&#39;t easy to find something I got really excited about. The pork cracker jacks on the starter list were port rinds with roasted peanuts and chocolate. The rinds were chewy and tough. Their take on fattoush was meh. The halibut was superb. The dish and presentation were just incongruous with the service model IMO. The industrial atmosphere isn&#39;t new, but it somehow lacked appeal vs. the larger The Source. The entertainment this evening was a piano player and an opera/show tune vocalist. Okay, that was different and, in a hipper place, cool. For dessert we got a few things from the counter/bakery, including the whiskey bread pudding. It was quite good. The bakery display was not enticing. Some eclairs and &#34;P&#34; shaped cookies. Hmm. Expectations are rising in this city and this new venture seems a step behind. It&#39;s not a place I would go out of my way to return to, such as Avanti (yes, totally different---but it has the &#34;it&#34; factor missing here)."
