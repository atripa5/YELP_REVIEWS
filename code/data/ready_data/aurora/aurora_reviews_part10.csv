The dining area is really clean and open, there is plenty of seating, so if you happen to go during a busy lunch rush, chances are that you;ll still be able to find a table easily and get served quickly.

On my visit here, I had the vegetarian pho (because this girl LOVES tofu!) with beef broth instead of the veggie broth, There were a lof of veggies present, which is HUGE. Pack those broccoli florets, cauliflower, mushrooms and carrots in there!

Definitely will be back, close to work and satisfies the pho-urge."

----------------------------.......-----------------------

It&#39;s been about a month since they opened and several of my Viet friends ate here and didn&#39;t complain too much so it was my turn to check it out.
Place is new therefore,  very clean.   Nice clean furniture, left over from precious business. I  came to eat pho at pho restaurant and if clean, that&#39;s a big plus for me.
I ordered my favorite Chin Nam medium size.   I must ate more than 100 bowls stretching from Federal to I-70, Havana strips and now here.

CON: absence of chili paste on the table.  Regular size bowl of pho was tad smaller than other places.  Felt like I was getting cheated
PRO: Soup was good, tad sweeter.  It wasn&#39;t salty so that was plus.  Plenty of sprouts,  basil, lime slices and jalapeños.   No long green leaves. 
Wish them successful future since it&#39;s just stone throw away from my den.
Like previous Yelper said... please don&#39;t be putting on fake 5 star ratings when you have only written one and only review and ... that one review is this place. That&#39;s lot fishier than any fish sauce you have.  Sometimes no review is better.  Don&#39;t be like Pho Duy!

I like the 7S grilled meat noodle bowl and a friend of mine enjoyed the pad thai. However, both times my credit card was charged more than what I signed for (over the amount that I tipped). The first time I let it go thinking the check out person made a simple mistake. After the second time it happened about a month later I visited the owner. The restaurant refunded the over charged amount quickly and called a couple of times to apologize. I&#39;m disappointed about what happened but happy there is finally a good pho restaurant close by.

But, for a place near the intersection of Parker Road and Arapahoe, it squeaks by with three.  I had been meaning check this place out.  I see frequent coupons in the Val-Pak mailers, but of course I did not have one with me on this impromptu visit.

The Good:
This is where the short-lived Maid-Rite (home of the loose meat sandwich) was previously located.  So, it is in a good location, still has the retro-ish chairs, and is not too crowded inside.  My service was good.  The pricing was not bad considering the amount of noodles and meat and veg.

The Bad:
My veggies were so cold as to be borderline frozen on the bean sprouts.  I only put a few of them in the soup so as not to cool it off too much.  It was just a rather boring bowl of Pho that could have (should have) been better.

The Ugly:
The broth.  Okay, it was not terrible (no strong off-notes).  But, the predominant taste was just salt.  There was no richness, complexity, or (wait for it) depth of flavor.  And with Pho, &#34;If you ain&#39;t got good broth, you ain&#39;t got nuthin&#39; bruddah.&#34; (I was trying to channel my inner Doug Y. on that last comment)"

It looks like a 1950&#39;s style diner with lame music with only white people dining. On top of that, I get a fork with my chop sticks- major red flag! Nonetheless, it comes down to the food. 

I know pho is a very complicated dish with many interpretations but I just was not a fan. It was very aromatic yet the taste was just off. I cannot pinpoint why but it did not work for me. I was disappointed that I got just a little bit of mint and absolutely no cilantro. Siracha is the only option I had to add any spice (or flavor) to my soup. It just came up short on all levels.

My poor husband risked his safety to go out there and get the food. He returned with a large black bowl that was unfamiliar to me. Apparently they decided to purchase new to-go Tupperware, the noodles and chicken is placed at the top and the broth is stored at the bottom of the container. Okay... It would have been nice to know this ahead of time. There were NO sprouts, NO basil, NO hoisin sauce, NO Sriracha, and about 3 tiny prices of green onion. Why would I want this fancy container when you&#39;re going to eliminate all the flavor additives. The entire purpose of pho is to be able to customize it to your liking, some spice or veggies, or full load of both. I am so disappointed!

HOWEVER, their customer service is something I have struggled with for quite some time.  In continuously give them the benefit of the doubt and am constantly undervalued and Ill-cared for.  It&#39;s one of those &#34;screw me once shame on you...&#34; scenarios. But on Saturday 7/2/16 around 5pm I finally had enough.  

I called to place a to-go order for the fams and was greeted with 4x &#34;sorry I&#39;m putting you on hold&#34; statements, I seriously repeated my order 5x times as she was distracted by something/someone else when taking my order.   

Anyway, not spending too much energy on this review, because they couldn&#39;t even be bothered to take my order.  Soooo, in the competitive space such as pizza, especially in Denver, I&#39;ll be exiting stage left and not tying the &#34;knot&#34; with this establishment."

We usually order from the one on Logan and they&#39;re actually pretty good. I decided to order from this location because I realized they were closer to our house. 

Pizza- not warm at all, way to much cheese and soggy. 
Mozzarella sticks- how do you deliver half cooked sticks?
Garlic knots- more like salty knots, no garlic whatsoever 
Hot wings- my gain and couldn&#39;t finish one; that&#39;s saying something. How do you go wrong with wings?
Greek salad- huge chunks of tomatoes, one measly slice of cucumber a few olives and some wilted romaine.

Everything mentioned went directly in the trash can. What a shame. We couldn&#39;t even finish a slice of pizza? How could it be that bad? Really not sure but it was. We had to change yo our dinner plans for tonight. And to top it off an hour and 20 minute delivery time."

The pizza i added sausge to it asked if it was crumbled and she said it was idk wth that was but def not sausage looked more like bacon bits. Im sure Denver can do better than this for Pizza.

Food and pizza was decent at best. Didn&#39;t like the flavor o&#39;s mozz cheese on pizza, can tell it&#39;s of lower quality. Dough was decent too but the pizza was cooked perfectly however.

His shirt might have been white once but was so stained and grimy, it alone was a reason to leave the restaurant.  Not helped by the fact that he was literally dripping in sweat.

It took us 10+ minutes just to have someone to come to the table &amp; bring us menus &amp; see what we wanted to drink (we had to seat ourselves). 
Then, when my order came it was wrong. And, instead of re-making the slice of pizza, the waitress or cook just tried to pick off the jalapeños &amp; put (cold) banana peppers on top. When I told the waitress I would be able to taste the jalapeño juice &amp; I would like the banana peppers cooked with the pizza, she took it back again. 5 minutes later she comes back &amp; the chicken &amp; banana peppers were loose on top (when I tipped the pizza to the side, everything fell off). So, it wasn&#39;t a new slice that was made but they just took off what was on there originally &amp; put new items on &amp; warmed it up. I could taste the jalapeño juice &amp; later got a stomach ache from it. 
We had to ask the waitress 2 times for water &amp; she just told us she had a long day...&#34;she had worked 10 hours.&#34;  I guess that&#39;s why the service, &amp; food, was so crappy!?! We WON&#39;T ever go back there! They are lucky to get 1 star from me."

(Note: they used to get lots of 5 star ratings - not any since the beginning of 2016, and mostly 1-2 star ratings this year).

Since this location was purchased by new owners in the last year, it has completely gone down hill. After two bad delivery experiences in a row, we probably won&#39;t be back.

Tonight :
- They delivered the wrong pizza 
- an hour and ten minutes after we ordered (45 minutes was quoted)
- The pizza arrived cold
- The garlic knots arrived cold
- The salads arrived warm and watery.
- The charged us for an extra salad (which they delivered, warm, like the other 2 we actually ordered).

The pizza still tastes as good as it used to, except that we had to heat it up in the oven and ate it an hour after we had planned to have dinner. 

The salads weren&#39;t as fresh as they used to be (of course maybe that&#39;s because they sat in a car for an hour) and had water in them (not drying the lettuce presumably).

Finally, the garlic knots were chewy and hard, not warm and soft like they used to be.

Oh well. Maybe these new owners will figure it out. Until they do, stay away."

I have ordered for both delivery and take and bake and have tried three pizzas (in desperation due to lack of time).

Once I ordered a pizza and it was actually pretty decent.  I got extra cheese and that is probably why--who doesn&#39;t love cheese?  In fact, i think of pizza as a vehicle for cheese...Sadly, although I gave it an honest try, the next three ordered pretty much sucked.

The people are super nice, but the pizza is pretty bad.  Once, I ordered a medium and it came small (and they claimed it was  12 inch pizza--what a JOKE).  It was shrunken, and looked more like a soup bowl than a pizza!  That is,  way too much &#34;handle&#34;  and way too few ingredients.  

Another time I ordered the pizza it arrived cold.  So, I decided to do take n bake.  

The take n bake is a MUCH better value than delivery, but it&#39;s rather like the old joke; &#34;the food is bad and the portions are too small.&#34;  

NOW the pizza... DO NOT order anything with meat--in particular sausage.  The sausage is a weird red color and clearly is extruded meat.  Very cheap, very bland , very dry and very gross!

They skimp on the cheese and have done so on all the three pizzas I have had --except that one....

The crust is good, but the sauce is thin and bland.

In short, don&#39;t order the pizza."

The foh staff seemed disinterested in helping anyone. My thought was they must of had a nice lunch pop but why are you ignoring customers. One gentleman was sitting in the dining room before me finally got up to figure out where his salad was that he ordered 10 minutes ago. Now i know when people complain and say its been ten minutes its normaly been 4 or 5. But this was legitimately 10 minutes. When he finally got hold of someone the server was rude and confrontational. She made the salad, dont know if she washed her hands, than finally someone realized i was still waiting in the to go area. She went checked on my food and it was finally up except my house salad. They finally got all my food. But the conversation we had is why im writing this review. 
Her: Sorry for the wait.
Me: no worries i have my food.
Her: Thanks for being understanding we are short two people today.
My thoughts when she said that. wait what you are short two people its hectic and ive seen five of the staff members come back in from a smoking break. That explains why it has taken almost 45 mins for a calzone and salad. I get home the salad was luke warm and the calzone was chewey. Sorry garlic knot you have lost my business."

When the driver arrived, she was very sweet and apologetic about how long it took and apparently everyone had the same idea for dinner that we did. 
The food was still hot upon arrival and was delicious! The garlic knots were perfectly cooked and came with a side of their yummy marinara.

We went here last nigh thanks to them sending me a free pizza and garlic knots coupon. There were two other tables seated when we walked in the smell of the place alone is enticing and had my belly grumbling. I have no idea what our servers name was because she was just there and had the personality of a wet mop. She brought our drinks, forgot the sweetener for the tea (the tea? Absolutely disgusting, pass) and was just meh. There was one other server working and she was talking the ear off someone about how she grew up in NY, all about living there, blah blah blah, it was distracting and annoying. Everything came out really quick which was appreciated but that was the best part about the experience. The house salad is enough to fill up two people so split that if you want a salad. The garlic knot basket is huge and I made the rookie mistake of filling up on those but they weren&#39;t garlicy at all so that was a let down. 

Our pizza came our right after the knots and it seemed small for a medium sized pizza (6 slices total). We got the sausage and pineapple and I love that the sausage was more shredded/sliced than traditional crumbled sausage. The pineapple was canned and too sweet and the pizza as a whole was unmemorable thanks to a bland sauce and tasteless dough. I&#39;m not a complete fool though, I took it to go and it was a little better the day after. Our server was quick to give us the bill and we were on our way and yeaaaah, just a lousy experience as a whole. I couldn&#39;t waste my money on this place when there are tons of other pizza places out there that are more reasonably prices and actually have some taste to their food."

Clean and neat, not fancy, good food, good prices, and nice servers. I love the lasagna, Greek salad, and pizzas. My son&#39;s favorite is still the chef&#39;s special penne pasta. Can&#39;t forget the pinwheels, meat or veggie for just $4 and a meal in itself. Having beer and wine available is great, and the house red wine is very pleasant. There&#39;s also ice cream if you ever have any room left!

The other night we had one of the best pizzas ever. The Five Boroughs gives you your choice of any five toppings. We thought hard and chose pepperoni, breakfast bacon, artichokes, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes. The pizza came out heaped with toppings! It was so delicious. We got the 18 inch extra-large pizza and took half home. A bargain at $22.25."

but that doesn&#39;t do enough to make up for the sad excuse for shrimp scampi I just consumed. There was absolutely no sauce to be found. The noodles were dry, and there was less than a quarter of an inch of water, what I maybe should assume was the sauce? It was more likely just shrimp juice that tasted slightly lemony. Sort of. It was actually pretty gross. If you had thawed frozen shrimp, then boiled the spaghetti and threw some butter and garlic powder, it would have been easily 5 times better than what I order. Plus , it was a lunch quantity? 
If I&#39;m paying over $10 for a piece of meal, I expect it to taste better than the Italian equivalent to a dollar menu burger.

So basically what I&#39;m saying here is stay the hell away from the shrimp scampi."

The garlic knots could use some more...how should I say it,  GARLIC!  They weren&#39;t bad, but when this is what your establishment is named after I expect them them to be outstanding.  Only hints of garlic and they we&#39;re chewy like they had been thawed from a frozen box.

The staff here is awesome-very nice, and fast. As mentioned, I went for carry out but noticed that their dine in area looked really nice. They have beers on tap and to my knowledge, a happy hour too.

We started off with the garlic knots, which were pretty good - if a little overcooked. Maybe I&#39;m pampered because I&#39;ve been to Big Bill&#39;s, but they didn&#39;t wow me like Bill&#39;s does.

The wife and I both ordered a calzone with pepperoni and sausage. The server made a point of telling us we could have up to 4 toppings and that that&#39;s what we were paying for, but we both ordered what we wanted so that&#39;s what we stuck with. The calzones were good, but again they seemed a little overcooked.

Now the bad... He never once came by to see if we wanted refills. I fianlly got up and ran over to the fountain machine myself and topped us off. Not getting refills is one of my biggest pet peeves. My other peeve happened at the end of the meal.

So the second we were done eating and just sitting there talking he came by with the check and said, &#34;I don&#39;t want to rush you, no rush.&#34; But he was going to anyway.  &#34;My shift is over soon&#34;. And then he hovered. So finally I handed over the CC and he went and ran it and came back. And then hovered some more. Finally we left.

The service makes this a 2 star, but the food make it 4, so I&#39;m going to split the difference."

You can&#39;t even see the menu online, it&#39;s either microscopic or gigantic.  But hey, it&#39;s pizza, so just go with it.  So, we ordered a large pie with generic toppings.  I asked about their appetizers, I could hardly understand the chic on the other end because it was really loud.  I figured we&#39;d try the garlic knots, since it is their namesake and all-they can&#39;t be too bad.

The pizza was delivered quickly. It was piping hot and they delivery guy was very nice, we weren&#39;t ready for him, he came too fast!  The pie was good. I personally thought it was a bit on the small size for a large.  One thing that stood out to me was they went light on the sauce, which is plus for me.  The crust was good, it was on the thin side, but no NY pizza thin.   We all very much enjoyed the pizza.  The garlic knots weren&#39;t bad either, although my husband and I would have preferred more garlic.

My coworkers are sort of obsessed with this place, they can go 1-3 times a week and they don&#39;t really do this with any other restaurant.

For one, it&#39;s super cheap. You can get lunch for $4.99/person. It includes a drink, either two slices or one slice and garlic knots, etc.

Two, the cinnamon knots are to die for. My coworker ordered them for our table and they went really quick. They use the cinnabon frosting to dip in. It&#39;s amazing.

Three, it&#39;s fast! You&#39;re in, you&#39;re out. You order, you sit, you wait for a minute and your food is served to you.

This is soo NOT for the person on a diet or looking to eat less carbs/calories, even if you try the salad. The caesar salad looks almost worse than a slice of pizza.

They seem to do a brisk take-out and delivery business so the front reception area is split between that service and seating walk in traffic.  High backed booths in green leatherette, tables covered with checkered tablecloths, hanging overhead lamps, the décor matches expectations.  My only complaint is the service is at times inexperienced and lacking in the more subtle points of restaurant service.  That minor quibble aside, generally I&#39;d recommend this restaurant for a family outing or for delivery.  And, yes, they do have actual garlic knots that are small tasty morsels of garlicy, buttery, baked goodness."

But it was our first time eating at The Garlic Knot. When we walk in, our waiter just sat us down and walked away. She didn&#39;t even tell us her name, ask for our drinks or even greet us at that. We had to get up and go ask for drinks. She was not friendly and had a mad face the whole time, she didn&#39;t even interact with us. When she brought us our food she forgot our garlic knots, which was the whole reason of going there in the first first. Great food but overall bad service. I believe her name was sasha but who knows because she didn&#39;t even talk to us."

We had the garlic knots with mozzarella because we figured, hey if they are going to name there restaurant after an appetizer, the appetizer must be their signature dish.  It was alright, but nothing spectacular.  We were not in the mood for pizza so we asked for recommendations and ordered the Chef&#39;s special which was a creamy penne with chicken and broccoli and the shrimp scampi.  It was on the heavy side for lunch, but tasted okay.  I don&#39;t think broccoli is appropriate for a pasta.  Maybe cherry tomatoes, maybe even spinach, but not sure they pulled it off.  The shrimp scampi was average as well.  Service was great and it seemed like a neat little local joint.  All in all, its a decent restaurant, but nothing special in my book."

Food was at the table within 10 minutes and she graciously brought us garlic knots and a house salad lickity split when we asked.

The food came out fast and tasted great.  The garlic knots were nice and chewy. The pizza was good, but nothing particularly of note.

Review of Yum Yum Cake &amp; Pastries... check! Review of Las Fajitas... OOPS! How did that one slip by? Well, since they&#39;re all right next to one another, why don&#39;t I just go ahead and complete the hat-trick now?

Some of the best dishes at Las Fajitas, in my ever-so-humble (ha!) opinion, are the ones that take the everyday Mexican classics and put just that slight spin on them to make them stand out. For example, the eatery is one of the few places I can think of locally where one can get a chile relleno stuffed with chicken in addition to cheese. Alternatively, try one of their &#34;Especial&#34; burritos, like the one packed with chunks of tender beef awash in the spicy, brick-red stew known as Chile Colorado. If instead you prefer that *other* tortilla-based dish, I believe you&#39;ll heartily approve of the Enchiladas Del Mar, whose thick jalapeño/cream cheese sauce hides a filling of krab and baby shrimp. And many Mexican places serve bacon-wrapped shrimp, but I ask you - how many think to side them with ranch dressing? Yes, culinary curveballs abound at Las Fajitas - and luckily they all taste phenomenal.

But you know, sometimes it&#39;s good to get back to basics, isn&#39;t it? And as it turns out, fans of the popular faves will find themselves in good hands here too. If you get there early enough, their Huevos Rancheros feature *three* green-chile-and-cheese smothered eggs in addition to beans, rice and tortillas - you won&#39;t be eating for a while after that one! Card-carrying carnivores can partake in an order of succulent pork chops, or marinated grilled chicken, or a ribeye steak, while veggie devotees will find that the spinach enchiladas or black bean burrito will suit them to the proverbial &#34;T&#34;. And if indecision is getting the best of you, never fear - their substantial A La Carte section will let you have a grand old time mixing and matching to your heart&#39;s content. So next time you&#39;re visiting the beautiful Havana Street District, why not spoil yourself and give Las Fajitas a whirl? I think you&#39;ll be glad you did."

Once we got there, I changed my mind.  Since this place is called Las Fajitas, shouldn&#39;t I try their fajitas? The service is a bit slow.  They weren&#39;t even half full and the wait staff acted like they were extremely swamped. Once the waitress came over, I ordered the chicken fajitas and a large melon margarita. Brian got the mango margarita and the chicken fajita burrito. They came out piping hot. The fajitas were sizzling and smelled delicious. The portions are extremely huge.  We should have split a meal because we had a ton of leftovers. After the restaurant calmed down, the service got a little better. The food was awesome and fairly priced.

It reminds me of being in an open-air tacqueria in zihuatanejo, mexico, where you order tacos al pastor and icy, cold cervezas. I think they do a good job of marrying the messy, goopey, cheesy Mexican faire that folks here like and traditional dishes, like their tacos. So it really depends on  your tastes on what you&#39;ll like here and what won&#39;t move you much. Last night we ordered queso, which was waay too thin and not spicy enough for me. I ordered a crispy releno and it had too much batter for me, but, I loved my taco al pastor with pineapple and pork. I noticed they have some decent deals on daily lunch specials around $6.99 which is a great way to try out this little local (non-chain) place.

So yes, I had the fajitas - and yes, they were delicious.

I had the steak fajitas, which came out sizzling and steaming hot - as they should. This was quite the heap of fajitas! The meat was tender and well marinated, especially compared to other fajitas I&#39;ve had in town - very tasty and hit the spot. Copious amounts of onions and peppers came along for the ride too. The tortillas didn&#39;t seem freshly made, but were warm, soft, and did the trick (NOTE: extras are $1.25). The Spanish rice had tons of flavor, while the beans were your standard beans. The guac was pretty bland, but the pico decent. The free chips and salsa were good, but pretty standard too. But the important thing was that the main dish delivered. Prices were decent, especially for the amount of food.

This place is pretty small, but cozy - it actually felt like a Tex-Mex joint. Despite the size, they somehow fit a keyboard, mic, and speakers in a corner for a lady to sing. It was a bit cheesy, and I loved it :D It kind of accented the cozy vibe, and the kids were certainly enjoying it too.

Instead, I veered to the right, walking into Las Fajitas cold (and windy!) It&#39;s one of many typical mid-range Mexican restaurants around town. A small storefront, shabby mexi-chique setting.

Shortly after sitting down, I received my menu, and chips/salsa. Nice moderate heat pico de gallo sauce with prefab chips. I ordered a small beef &amp; bean burrito. It comes smothered in their green chile, with lettuce &amp; tomato garnish. All in all, the small was just right for today. I fear the size of the large.

Reviews looked good so we gave it a try.  She had the chicken fajitas which she said were just okay, not much seasoning to them but sizzling hot.  I had a combo plate which was decent.  Enchilada had flavor, burrito was okay and the relleno was pretty good. Tamale was mainly masa with just a little pork, which was fairly bland.  Chile had good flavor and their salsa is some of the best I&#39;ve had in our area.  The fried ice cream was delicious.  We&#39;ll come back."

We chose this restaurant, unfortunately, instead of the highly rated Korean BBQ place next door. 

We could NOT believe how disgustingly bland the food was. The food was warm and had different textures, but the food was just TERRIBLE and extremely unsatisfying. The service was nice enough and we got chips/salsa with the food, but that did not take away from the fact that the food had absolutely NO taste. The beans tasted exactly like the rice, and tomatoes, and the meat. The salsa was really watery. 

Then we realized the only other customers in there were old folks, who I suppose enjoy the non-spicy nature of the sub par menu. 

We also ordered the &#34;tortilla soup&#34; and it was EXACTLY like a can of Campbell&#39;s minestrone soup, with a few chips and avocado bits on the side. No true tortilla soup has pasta shells and celery in it- just theirs. 

Bottom line: Go somewhere else- like maybe Taco Bell."

With that said, I walked in at big city burrito not expecting much; however, I was impressed they had white meat when I asked for it, but failed to delivered as it was mixed dark and white meat; nonetheless, it does beat some of the options at chipotle.

On to the salsas, nothing special really, surprised as it taste just &#34;blah&#34; not sure how many locations BCB locations there are, but I would expect more flavor, even chipotle&#39;s salsas have some taste and it&#39;s a big franchise. 2 stars for that. 

Now, onto the guacamole, it&#39;s bag-premade-factory guac and they charge $1.49 extra - I bought a whole box of premade guac!!! Truly a shame, I know all the overhead crap, which is sad.

It&#39;s just perfect for when you wake up and don&#39;t want food, but really need it. You can get a fantastic jalapano tortilla wrapped around potatoes and protein, which let&#39;s be honest here, that is really what you need after a long night of drinking. I had to come by the other day after GABF with the amount of beer I managed to consume. I prefer the Mama&#39;s Mole (with black beans) because the chicken mole is delicious and every true BCB burrito needs ranch. I&#39;ve been going to the FoCo location for the last ten years, but now that I&#39;m in Denver this one works too. They do things a little differently, it&#39;s much fancier looking, and they do shredded cheese vs. the slices, but it&#39;s good just the same. It also feels a lot cleaner than the original in FoCo (I haven&#39;t decided if that&#39;s a good thing or not, I kind of love the original building). One thing they are missing though is a hot sauce wall, because there&#39;s an apple hot sauce they always keep at the FoCo location that&#39;s more addictive than crack.

Like its international monster cousin Chipotle, Big City Burrito is a mission style burrito joint founded within the rectangular borders of my favorite state (Hint - it&#39;s not Wyoming). They craft gargantuan burritos that seemed just perfect in high school and even later into college, but now leave you feeling just a little gross if you didn&#39;t run a half marathon earlier in the day.

But man, is it worth it.

For those of you who have never eaten Chipotle: seriously? Wow. I&#39;m not even mad, that&#39;s impressive. Suffice to say they custom build you a fat burrito crammed full of whatever fresh ingredients you see fit.

The similarities end there. The big edge Big City has on Chipotle is options. It starts immediately with your size - regular or super? I&#39;d recommend the former for all but those who wear a blue and red spandex suit with a giant &#34;S&#34; emblazoned beneath their mild mannered disguise.

Choosing size is easy, but then, KABLAMMO: White, wheat, tomato chile, pesto, jalapeno/cheddar, or spinach tortilla?

And it goes on like this. Two different kinds of chicken, carnitas, veggie, carne asada, etc etc etc. If that still seems kind of samey, SHAZOW: potatoes! Big City gives them a little extra fry before they put them in your burrito and the texture they add is something you&#39;ll grow to miss in ordinary burritos. Finish it off with whatever sauces or other accouterments you like and you have yourself a meal and a half.

After Chipotle the number of choices given feels downright overwhelming. I left my very first order up to the staff and have been tweaking it to perfection ever since. Don&#39;t be afraid to do the same.

If a massive, savory burrito is not enough to crush your appetite, consider also ordering the churros. They&#39;re prepared fresh every single day because they sell out EVERY SINGLE DAY, and I&#39;ll be damned if there isn&#39;t a reason for it."

The breakfast burritos are great.  I get the chorizo egg and potato with green sauce and white sauce.

The regular size is more than enough, and holds a good amount of contents.  They skim a bit on the meat (I had chorizo) but plenty of potato and egg.  The salsa is not as hot as I prefer (it was their hottest), and not much flavor in it.  They would be better if they offered a green chile option (they don&#39;t) and if they had fresh jalapeño instead of pickled, it would be a big improvement.

The total cost was almost $5 for the burrito (it would have been a dollar more for beef, pork or chicken) and was not, in my opinion, worth the cost.  I will once again go back to Sabor on Arapahoe where their breakfast burritos are big, full of flavor, spicy, and only about $3.50."

Meat: Tiny needles of super dry beef. One needs vice grips, not teeth, to chew through the tough, indigestible rubber.

Everything else: Soggy, flavorless, wet, inedible mush, drenched in and dripping with what can only be described as dish water.

I had never been, but we got a coupon and decided to try it. The place is not clean. I walked up to the counter to order, and I was completely ignored by the employee. There were three employees there, and only one person bothered to give any semblance of service. The meat was undercooked, and the sour cream looked like it was going south. They displayed no hygiene practices, and again the preparation area behind the counter, and The main dining area were filthy. I ultimately handed my burrito back to the cashier and told him I couldn&#39;t even try to eat it after what I had seen. So, I honestly don&#39;t know how the food tastes.

Update:
Brad, the owner, sent me a sincere message apologizing for the not so great experience, and did point out they had some problematic employees at that location, whom have since been replaced. I plunged and gave them another shot, and must admit it was a much better experience. He also made some recommendations on his favorite burritos, and they were delicious with lots of chunky juicy beef. Thanks, Brad!"

On a side note... My partner and I made a quick pit stop at the Parker and Peoria location in Aurora CO this morning, as we made our selection and the line built up behind us the staff were jaw knocked by the failure of their POS system (Cash Register), but it didn&#39;t stop progress.  Since it came during such a busy rush, we were treated to free breakfast for the inconvenience.  Bravo and cheers on a difficult situation well managed.

Our group shuffled in just before the major lunch rush, and made it through the line relatively quickly. The only point of delay was the woman ringing people up, that seemed to go a bit slower than necessary, and a member of our problem trying to use a card (apparently there is an un-posted minimum on cards!)

I was impressed by the range of selections, and the numerous possibilities that exist for all kinds of crazy burrito. I ordered two different burritos, one with rice and beans and the other with potato.

Get burritos with potato.

The &#34;for here&#34; basket I was given was greasy on the bottom, rather disgusting as I believe they were taken straight from the pile on top of the trash can and given to customers without washing, or there&#39;s a quality control issue with cleaning. The TV in the order line was broken, not sure why they just didn&#39;t switch it off.

I did not go to the actual location, so can only comment on the food, which was AMAZING!  Big City offered 8 of their customer favorites, and while I didn&#39;t sample all of them, the two I had were so wonderful.  The tortillas were super soft, the green chile was hot and flavorful, and I thought the flavors to be perfectly balanced.  I love the fact that they didn&#39;t glop cheese all over everything so I could taste the ingredients.  They offer a variety of carnitas, eggs, carne asada and chicken mole burritos.  My favorite was the Brad&#39;s Bomb: chile verde with potatoes, cheddar cheese, ranch, BCB jalapeno sauce on a jalapeno/cheddar tortilla.  YUM!

I personally only like them for their breakfast burritos but at times they can be a hit or miss depending on who is working. 
Great place if you are on the run and need a quick fix, the lines do go fast!

So for some nit picks
Tables are usually dirty and messy, but this is mostly on the customers that come in and do not realize that it is a sit down clean up after yourself and put your baskets and dishes in their bin kind of place.

I ordered Quesadillas with chicken mole and little cheese. I added baked potatoes inside of beans. The potatoes are fired perfectly and are crispy.
Coming to salsa, Salsa de Lupe is special blended hot salsa is very spicy and it enjoyed. Be cautions if you not habituated to eat extra spicy in your daily food. The only complaint I had is about the service. I saw 3 to 4 folks working, but one of them was very slow in serving (though she is careful in handling the tortillas) and hence I had wait few more extra minutes in the queue.

Since that last time I was here I became a vegetarian, but I really love the mole&#39; sauce. I asked if the could have them put some mole&#39; sauce from the chicken on a vegetarian burrito. The sauce was well absorbed into the chicken. The guy went to the chicken that was cooking and it was absorbed in that chicken too. So as he was checking the kitchen he told the other guy and they got a pan out and whipped up some mole&#39; sauce.

The chorizo has nice balance of flavor and spice, and the potatoes are nicely seasoned as well. I love the selection of different flavored tortillas. For the Texans out there, it reminds me of Freebirds. Why don&#39;t other burrito places do this? I enjoyed the tomato chili tortilla, but I think the jalapeno cheddar is my fav.

The tortillas are too thin and fall apart. The counter they are sliding your food on is not particularly clean and they do not use a piece of aluminum foil like Qdoba does.

I got the carne asada - it looks like dog food steak in a thick dripping sauce. The guy had to squeeze the water out before dumping onto the rice which was nothing special too. Gross. Salsa is nothing special. When i got the burrito it was luke warm at best and got cold real fast. The bottled drink was pretty good, no complaints there.

If you are looking for a place better than Qdoba this is not it.  This place is trying to offer so many varieties and options and none of them are great.  They should focus on making a good product and then expanding.  Who needs a selection of 5 varieties of tortilla?  Nothing tasted fresh or flavorful. Maybe Qdoba has a limited menu but everything is fresh and tasty.

The numerous signs about fresh and quality food is BS.  The decor and ambiance is very strange - it reminds me of a dance club just after closing when they turn the lights on.  There are bright spotlights and black walls throughout, very odd.

Oh, and the Raid roach bait cartridges on the floor are no benefit to the dining room.

And they don&#39;t have refried beans. Lame.

It was, however, cheap.

Skip it. There are better mexican options, including Chipotle."

The food was okay, but the restaurant was dirty and the employees expressed a level of apathy that only the genius possess and the insane lament.

Concerning the food, it was confusing.  There are so many choices of food and filling (and even type of tortilla) that I found myself making random selections.  It was kind of like going to Baskin &amp; Robins and trying to pick out your ice cream without being able to have any samples.  I was just picking based on how clever the name sounded and the color of the items in their warmer bin.  It will take a lot of trial and error (and money) before I can find the combination that is right for me.

The employees were all teenagers.  All three of them spoke no louder than a mumble and appeared to have little interest in providing more than the bare minimum in service.  As soon as there were no customers at the counter, they all disappeared into the nether-reaches of the restaurant.  

The tables needed to be cleaned, the napkin/lid/straw station needed to be restocked, and the trash bins needed to be emptied.  The place was a dump.  It was not that busy, but everyone working apparently had something better to do.

I have heard good things about Big City Burrito&#39;s in general, but in my experience, this store should be avoided."

I&#39;ve had it at the Fort Collins location, the Boulder location, and here -- all equally SO good.

It seems others feel that the breakfast burritos are good, but the ladyfriend and I had a veggie burrito and a carne esada burrito respectively.  Also had a side of rice and beans, chips and green salsa.  The chips and green salsa were the best part of the meal, and still only mediocre. 

The burritos were flavorful, but small and nothing spectacular.  We would&#39;ve paid the same amount for larger and much more tasty burritos (and hence two meals worth) at Chipotle.  

The rice and beans were incredibly bland. I&#39;ve had uncooked tofu with more flavor.  

While it&#39;s nice to get a burrito from a place that doesn&#39;t force you to order giant portions, it would be nicer to get burritos that are worth the money.

In addiction the service was slow, the guy seemed like it was his first day, and we had to repeat ourselves multiple times to remind him what we wanted.  He also forgot about the guac we asked for.

Overall, poor experience, and lackluster food.  Won&#39;t be returning."

I would have to agree with Chris J&#39;s review of this joint, as the past couple times I have been here, the service and the food have been very inconsistent. Having been a fan of Big City Burrito close to campus up in Greeley, I would regularly fuel my hunger when I felt like a tasty giant burrito stuffed with potatoes, deliciously seasoned meat, and other various fillings. 

Seeing BCB all the time as I drive down Parker, it just sorta came to me, when pondering where to get some dinner one night. I stopped in and ordered the chicken burrito, which I might add, was fantastic! Just as I had remembered it; they freshly cooked the potatoes right in front of me and everything appeared to be very fresh. 

Over my next couple visits, the quality of the food has been off and on. My most recent visit, yesterday, was inspired by my craving for an easy and close breakfast burrito. Since I&#39;ve been a fan of their regular burritos, I figured their breakfast burritos wouldn&#39;t be any different... WRONG! I might have reconsidered my take on the staple American breakfast item from this establishment, if the chick I ordered from didn&#39;t douse the entire inside of the burrito with ranch dressing! Maybe I was just starving out of my mind from the gym or maybe I was naive in thinking it was some sort of county gravy, but the minute I got home and sampled this fare, I was sadly disappointed. I don&#39;t know what those of you who enjoy ranch dressing, but the combination between eggs, potatoes, sour cream, salsa, pork and ranch, didn&#39;t really blend together to form any cure of satisfaction. 

If you are in the area and want something a little different than the standard Chipotle burrito, this may be the joint to fit your fancy. I would steer clear of this place if you are in the area and want a breakfast burrito. You are better off driving a little bit to hit up Santiagos or one of the other great breakfast burrito places in town."

Their potato burritos are really good and the jalapeno chips are bomb. If you frequent Chipotle often, give this place a try. 

Pro: More choices than Chipotle like different wraps and breakfast burritos. They also have different hot sauces next to soda machine.

The only reason I don&#39;t eat here every day is because I can&#39;t afford the wardrobe I&#39;d inevitably need to accommodate such a delicious lunchtime ...exercise. I&#39;m going to be rich someday, and I&#39;m also going to be fat. And I certainly hope Big City will still be around.

I haven&#39;t actually tried the potato burrito yet but have been very satisfied with the other options. The carne asada is fantastic and everything else is always really fresh, too. Maybe I&#39;ve always come at a good time, but I&#39;ve never seen any nasty-looking ingredients. My one complaint about this place is that they don&#39;t have lettuce, but I&#39;m going to give it all five stars anyways out of spite for all you haters who came here once, had a bad day, and chose to blame it on Big City.

Seriously, though, besides their hot -- and fresh -- food, the gazillion bottles of hot sauce just make it even better. I&#39;m a wimp when it comes to spicy, but OMG the banana jabanero sauce on a burrito with black beans is so good that I feel scandalous just writing about it. Beyond the food, I&#39;m continuously impressed with their friendly and courteous staff. Yes, many of them are obviously younger than I, but just because I only get carded out of pity these days doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m too jealous to acknowledge their competence. In fact, thanks to Big City, my faith in tomorrow&#39;s future is completely restored. I think I&#39;m going to go have a burrito tomorrow, though ...just to be sure."

I like the chicken mole the most. 
Whatever you get, get it with the potatoes. Kind of their specialty. They fry them like french fries and season them.

I tried the Ribs, Brisket, and Burnt Ends. I also had the Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. The sides were solid, I should&#39;ve tried the BBQ Beans because I saw them on someone else&#39;s order and they looked fantastic! The brisket was rock solid but my favorites were the ribs and burnt ends. The ribs were cooked perfect, great flavor without any sauce even on them. Burnt Ends were outstanding, definitely on point! I tried the sweet and spicy BBQ sauces, both good, but mixed them together and found my personal preference, definitely kicked the taste up a notch but you could absolutely eat the meats without anything else but the rub and natural flavor.

I try to eat healthier (not always with success haha!), I&#39;m typically an organic/naturally and responsibly raised and produced type of guy and this place fits that bill. They utilize local goods when possible and the ingredients they use are high quality. The service was awesome, people were friendly and quick even though there was a line out the door. Place was clean and you get a good vibe and feeing just walking in the door. You know a good meal is coming just from the atmosphere, kind of like when you walk into your grandparents house. It&#39;s small so expect to wait for a seat or squeeze next to someone but even the customers were nice. Good food always seems to bring out the best in people! 

This is a great place. Unfortunately I don&#39;t live close by but when I&#39;m in the neighborhood I&#39;ll definitely be stopping by again. I can&#39;t imagine anyone. It enjoying this place, the only bad reviews seem to be because they ran out. Small places like this run out, that&#39;s how they operate, get over it and get there sooner!

I always read the 1 and 2 star reviews for a place that&#39;s highly rated and what I normally find are whiners or people with totally subjective rather than objective tastes? Read some of them and see if you agree. 
Here&#39;s an example... bad score because you got there after they ran out of their most popular items? They&#39;re not a bad restaurant, you&#39;re stupid. A lot of BBQ joints only stay open as long as they have food. Learn to live with it. Get there earlier.
The food didn&#39;t have enough salt? Although I do agree that most of what I sampled was under salted, I tend to believe that was the cook&#39;s intention to be healthier as all the meats I tasted were cooked to competition grade standards and he&#39;s choosing to use healthier ingredients. My wife doesn&#39;t like overly salted food as do most healthy people. It&#39;s really quite simple, don&#39;t be a lazy ass, add your own salt. I did. 
I may have eaten more BBQ than most. From every joint I can find in CO to every competition I&#39;ve judged for the last 6 years as a KCBS certified judge to any joint I can find at any place that I travel. i&#39;ve eaten from grungy trucks and carts to scary places in East LA that I classify as &#34;down and dirty&#34; BBQ. I must admit, this was a first for me. A &#34;new&#34; category of BBQ if you will. &#34;Clean&#34; BBQ. Why does that sound so wrong?
We had the brisket, a full rack of ribs, and two orders of burnt ends with potato salad, collards, coleslaw, baked beans, the drop biscuits, and chocolate strawberry pie as sides. All the meats were cooked properly but definitely under seasoned but I already talked about that. The biscuits, coleslaw and potato salads were decent, the collards were cooked but desperately needed a pig infusion (a healthy dash of the table hot sauce and some salt improved them a lot), the beans and chocolate strawberry pie were the winners. 
Is it my favorite BBQ joint in CO? 
No. 
Would I come back? 
Absolutely.

We ordered the ribs and pulled pork plate ($14.99) and the burnt ends ($11.99). With each plate, you get a side of your choice and biscuit. You can add an extra side for $2. The sides deserve their own show, just in the mass of options; avocado kale salad? Dill cucumbers? Slice of pie?! Brilliant! 

We opted for the BBQ beans, Mac &amp; Cheese, and how can I resist, a side of pie?

The ribs are not baby back, so there is more meat, and it somehow managed to stay suckling tender just like baby back ribs. These are served Kansas City style, dry and you add your own sauce. On the table you have your original spicy versions of Kansas City (a deep, rich, honey based) and Carolina (a more vinegar with a hint of mustard) BBQ sauces, as well as a hot sauce. You want the KC Spicy, trust me on this! Slather it, wear it, own it. It&#39;s so good!

The pulled pork was one of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. Juicy, smokey, and tender. It didn&#39;t even need any dressing. The biscuit seemed like it had a cheddar flavor to it. While I appreciated the homemade addition to my plate, it wasn&#39;t a real standout. The mac and cheese was okay, some of the cheese remained curdled and left an unpleasant texture on the noodle.

Burnt Ends were another hit, the good pieces had a salty crust formed by the blessed seasoning meeting their maker on the smoker, while keeping the meat in the middle succulent. There were some pieces where there was fat unseemingly present, but ah well, that&#39;s what keeps the meat juicy.

The chocolate peanut butter pie was divine!! Scene: A layer of rich chocolate sits on a bed of crushed Graham crackers, layered with peanut butter in between. So good, and totally worth the $2 extra.

It&#39;s a small operation, the food are prepared ahead of time (cooked the night before for the day of) and in warmers. Don&#39;t let that deter you, it&#39;s just to help move the long masses of body along in the ever forming line at lunchtime. 

There was family ahead of us with all kinds of allergies under the sun and the owner and manager were very knowledgeable with each ingredient in their dish and was able to accommodate them all, with more patience than I would have.

You will not find better BBQ anywhere in the Denver area, and I challenge you to find better BBQ in Colorado.

Everything here is made from scratch, in house. Everything. Except the soda and salad dressing. Even the BBQ sauces are made from scratch in the kitchen.

Some advice: try the burnt ends, a Kansas City delicacy."

When I got there, half of the menu was unavailable, so I had to go with second and third options.  And no offense to the kale and avocado salad, but I would have much preferred to try the greens.  I will also say the atmosphere and location did nothing to pick up my disappointment.

The pulled pork was amazing, sausage better than average...and the pie I had was great, just disappointed I didn&#39;t have any options and didn&#39;t get to try the food I anticipated having.

My recommendation is not to cross this off of your list, just call ahead to be sure they have the menu you are looking for.  The meat I had was great, just not sure I would have gone through the trouble to find my way out there."

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, sliced brisket, and burnt ends. Our sides were the mac and cheese, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes and biscuits. 

I&#39;m a Texan who knows how to smoke meat properly and slowly all night and day. I take extreme pride in the art of being a pitmaster. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed with their offerings. 

All the meats had been sitting in warming ovens or trays for hours, probably the entire day. The meat had zero smoke ring though it had a slight smokey scent, it was brown/gray which means it was not cooked in a traditional low and slow wood fired smoke pit. The brisket had decent pull on it though it was sliced into 1/2&#34; thick slices which is too thick. If sliced to the correct quarter inch the meat was so dry it would have crumbled apart rather than pull apart. This is a sign of a brisket that was cooked at too high of a temperature and fast, sat warming all day or most likely both. 

The burnt ends were the color of dark leather inside and black coal outside and were as tough and rubbery as I&#39;ve experienced. No smoke, no flavor not even of beef and were nearly inedible. 

The pulled pork faired better than the other two. Though it was extremely dry unfortunately needing to be slathered with sauce (which is sacrilege in my book) the pork flavor was there and it was quite simple like it should be. 

Final thoughts, the place puzzled me a little. They seemed to struggle with identity in that they had Carolina style &#34;bbq&#34;/sauce and Kansas City Bbq sauce. None of the Bbq we had really spoke to one style except maybe the pulled pork. The pork could have been drenched in their &#34;Carolina&#34; sauce, but I&#39;m not a fan of the mustard or vinegar bases. 

Bottom line, average Bbq and sides, very bad biscuits and watered down root beer. I may give it one more chance and go early in the day when they first open up to be 100% fair."

I will definitely be returning and letting others know about this restaurant. Best barbecue that I have had in Denver, so I will have to make the trip from Broomfield with friends when they come to town.

I&#39;ve been coming since this place first opened so I&#39;ve gone through things with them (we peoples) and I am happy to say we are now in a stable relationship. 

For one, they&#39;ve updated their menu. Now offering full-sized salads (FINALLY), combo plates, and regular sides! Their pricing is now permanent too (they have a permanent menu and everything, it&#39;s REAL), so no more guessing games as to how much lunch will cost each time. Additionally they offer vegetarian options (at a BBQ joint - HA! But for real, have you had their portobello mushrooms?!) and they also offer any meat as a sandwich. With a side it comes right at the $10 price point, making it more affordable and more portion-friendly. It&#39;s even better than when we first met, I can really see us growing old together."

Quick disclaimer - do NOT expect something fancy coming here. This place is as casual and relaxed as they come. Food is served in to-go or throw away containers and the utensils are plastic. One other quick disclaimer - when something is gone for the day, it is gone. I really wanted an apple crumble but they were sold out by the time we got there so no crumble for me.

However - with all of this being said, Kitchen Table has some of the best BBQ in Denver. Please do yourself a favor and go try it. I ordered the burnt ends and brisket and they were fabulous. Burnt ends are one of my favorite BBQ dishes and this place does them right. They are big and juicy which is a must with burnt ends. The brisket is fabulous as well. I love that they do not skimp on portions. They know you want some BBQ and they give you some BBQ. 

In addition, I ordered the Mac N Cheese and the Kale salad - both were amazing. The Mac n Cheese is so creamy and yummy cheesiness. The Kale salad was a perfect compliment to the mac n cheese for me. The only thing I was disappointed in was the biscuit but part of that is me since I am not a huge biscuit fan.

This place is an amazing gem tucked away up by Five Points. If you&#39;re looking for good BBQ I highly recommend coming here - however you may want to call ahead to ensure that they have food and are still open if you plan to eat here for dinner!"

Star of the show was the corn-hands down. What?? I know! Kansas City spicy BBQ sauce was amazing. Meat was good-don&#39;t waste your money on the burnt ends-they were nothing special and extra fatty. Brisket is yummy in and of itself. Biscuit was yummy and a nice, small size. 
Good drinks - never heard of Boylan&#39;s soda, but with real sugar and no fake stuff, it went great with the food.

It&#39;s definitely small, like 5 tables small, but the que is dynamite.

We came in around 3pm on a Saturday and half the menu was sold out. Indicative of how good the eats are.  I do quite a bit of smoking myself so I realize the amount of time and love that is required to put out a flavorful, juicy product; it&#39;s obviously not as easy as slapping a frozen patty on a grill, but they close at 8 and should really try to keep up with demand!

End mini-rant.

Tried almost everything left on said menu and everything was fantastic. Burnt ends were juicy little flavor bombs, pulled pork was perfect as a standalone, sausage was obviously house-made in natural casing with the perfect amount of seasoning. Favorite sides: potato salad (heavy on the dill and pepper, yum), mashed potatoes and brown gravy (very heavy on the pepper, but delicious) and the collard greens.

Come here and walk away happy."

This is a very small place located between a pet food store and a liquor store, with some sort of a studio in between.  

Only 5 tables in the place so you gotta get there early to get a seat or else you&#39;ll be taking out.  They also run out of the most popular items (Burnt Ends, Brisket) so don&#39;t get there too late on a busy night.

I got there around 3:30 on a week day and enjoyed being their first dinner customer!  The blackboard had all the entrees and sides, and the food was on plates and in our hands seconds after we ordered.

Burnt Ends - Crusty seasoned chunks of brisket ends with a blend of pull apart juicy meat and chewy blackened smoky tips.  Flavorful and satisfying, even if you get the smaller portion (half pound).

Baby Back Ribs - Moist and tender but with enough texture to not fall all the way off the bone.  A complex dry rub compliments whichever of the 6 sauces (Spicey, regular, mustard, etc.)  you want slather onto your ribs.  

Black Beans - Rich and soft but not mushy, with hints of sweetness and cumin.

Mac and Cheese - Creamy and soft with a strong pepper flavor and only mild cheese notes.

Cole Slaw - Bug chunks of cabbage in a tangy and not sweet slaw sauce. 

Rasta Corn - Saw rave reviews, but I thought it was just OK.  Buttery, with milk but was it really fresh corn?

Check in to get a Free Soda.  Nothing but all natural cane sugar Boylands at the fountain here.  Normally $1 with a meal, so still a good deal."

But it is no surprise, as there are so many delicious menu options, and the menu is posted online on their website daily, so you can scope it out before you head over.  And for food options - no matter what the menu of the day is, you can&#39;t go wrong.  All the BBQ is fantastic, the mac and cheese and rasta corn sides are delicious, and they even have a vegetarian entree option of stuffed mushrooms.

My husband and myself are proud supporters of this place and the owner Dave. He takes so much pride in the quality and integrity of food. 

Speaking of food... What amazing flavors and savory dishes. Some people may give the place a lower rating because Dave can sell out of items throughout the day and you might get a night when its slim pick&#39;ns. But come on look at it this way there are just so many people racing to get this amazing food. He is just one man cook&#39;n his heart out. We are multitides racing every day to have some of the great food. Just get there earlier and faster than everyone else and you&#39;re golden. 

Try the meat loaf its my favorite. More on the sweet side but still really savory. My husband enjoys the thick protein and less sweet brisket. Burnt ends and pulled pork are great choices for kids with a side of mac-n-cheese.

Dave has also put a twist on some traditional dishes I wouldn&#39;t normally eat. His version I just love. Rosta Corn, Chicken Gumbo just amazing sides with a chocolate pie.

But make sure you get there early because everyone knows it. They have fantastic stuffed mushrooms, and to die for brisket/burnt ends. But their Apple Crisp is to KILL for. It&#39;s made with rolled oats, brown sugar, fresh apples, and lots of love... the love adds the extra crisp.

All their ingredients are fresh, the prices are very reasonable, and even their sodas taste unique and delicious. I have morning meetings nearby on Fridays and pretty much plan my afternoons around lunch at Kitchen Table! 

One thing to note--the space isn&#39;t very big, and therefore isn&#39;t conducive to large groups. If you do have a big group, grab the food to go and set up shop at a nearby park :-)"

Thank you so much for having separate sauces and letting us determine how to use them.  This time I tried the ribs and rasta corn.  Both went well with the Boylan cola.

Pulled pork is my go to, and it is consistently on point.  The sandwiches are PACKED with whatever meat you&#39;ve chosen, to the point I sometimes have enough to buy a spare bun and take home the extra pork for a small sandwich later on. The chicken is also delicious!  Great tap sodas! I appreciate the consistent quality at this spot and have never had an issue in the 10+ times I&#39;ve already frequented. Keep it up Kitchen Table!

-amazing food
-amazing service
-cozy ambience 

Negatives:
-they ran out of food
-so popular that they run out of space to eat

Went to this place because of yelp reviews. Was going to order the ribs, but a large family came in before me and got the rest of it. Luckily, I got one of the last meatloafs that they had left. It was a bit pricier than I thought it would be, but I guess it made sense for organic ingredients.

They actually ran out of space to eat because they were so crowded. Dave, the manager, was really nice about it and wrapped up my food in foil to go. 

I was thinking, boy, this better be worth it because this cost me $13! Well, let me say, I normally can&#39;t stand meatloaf, but I would eat this one any time of the week! It was the best meatloaf I had ever had in my life! The mashed potatoes were also amazing and the gravy had a Rosemary flavor. The Mac and cheese was completely delicious! Even the drink (some sort of organic soda), was outstanding! 

Bottom line:
Definitely recommend this place. I would come back here again if I ever visit Denver in the future."

The owner is so passionate about where he sources his meat and produce combined with the process of cooking the food. He&#39;s also humble and engages with his customers in ways that make you feel good about supporting his business. 

The best part of my meal was hands down the pulled pork. Omg. It was served with a mustard based BBQ sauce that perfectly balanced the fatty juiciness of the meat. Wow!!! I also sample the brisket which I felt was a little dry. I like my brisket in thinner slices versus a thick slab since it is a tougher cut to begin with. 

The sides were a home run with the BBQ baked black beans. I&#39;ve never seen this with black beans which are my favorite bean. There was a nice hit of heat, some red peppers and little chunks of pork. So. Good. The pepper biscuit was also very good. The stinker of the plate was the coleslaw. I found the cabbage to be cut too thick for my taste and not enough mayo and/or seasoning. On a health side it&#39;s probably better for you the way they serve it but compromises on being memorable coleslaw."

Where have you been all my life? I&#39;ve been looking for somebody just like you for a long time. My taste-buds were tantalized by that delicious brisket (although, I have to admit, I&#39;m a little sore that upon my visit you had already run out of burnt ends... couldn&#39;t you have saved a serving just for me?) My mouth was fulfilled (and filled) with your mac &amp; cheese and those delicious bbq beans (although, again, maybe next time you could save me some collards, huh?). 

I&#39;m going to be honest with you: you don&#39;t really look like much from the outside. I guess, come to think of it, you don&#39;t really look like much from the inside either... Too much? Well, let me say this - I don&#39;t care. You don&#39;t need to look like much, I&#39;m not into you for your looks. In fact, I&#39;d probably think less of you if you tried to glamorize the otherwise unglamorous world of really delicious bbq. Arthur Bryant didn&#39;t need glitz, and you don&#39;t either. Respect. 

Aside from the taste and quality of your succulent meat-treats, I really appreciate the obvious efforts that you make to be a good community citizen. I appreciate the obvious effort to locally-source products. I appreciate the recycled and recyclable eating tools that you provide. I appreciate that, even with an added expense, it is worth it to you to be a citizen, of the community and of the planet (and I appreciate that you do all of this at affordable prices). 

Kitchen Table Cafe, I can&#39;t fight this feeling anymore. I&#39;ve forgotten what I started fighting for... 

Love, 

John B."

This is definitely worth your time. I had the burnt ends, kale/avocado salad, baked beans and mac and cheese.

Burnt ends: really nice flavor and really solid meat.  One piece was a little *too* burnt, making it hard to chew. The rest was awesome.  8/10

Kale avaocado salad: This thing was the truth. I loved it. Bright and tangy and delicious.

Baked beans: you&#39;ve had better, but I bet you&#39;ve never had better that were 100% organic! I liked these quite a bit. Not mind-blowing, but nice.

Mac and cheese: this was the only &#34;meh&#34; item. It was fine, but nothing special.

Sauces: the carolina gold sauce was bomb; the KC stye BBQ sauce was OK.  Both were labeled spicy, but neither was.

The Boylan soda bar offered most options, and was a most welcome alternative to the usual coke/pepsi.  At only $1 extra with a meal, you can&#39;t go wrong.  You&#39;re in a non-chain place, try the great soda as a better choice, and sample the varieties.

I&#39;ll go with fresh-today, and I&#39;ll just plan ahead.  It isn&#39;t like they can throw some frozen food in the deep fryer, upon demand.  Good BBQ takes time, just deal with it.

I almost always get the meatloaf, if there&#39;s any left! If not, my fallback order is the pulled pork. We&#39;ve eaten here about 5-6 times, and it&#39;s always delish. I lived in Louisiana and Georgia for about 7 years, and this reminds me of some of the real Southern comfort food I&#39;d have down there. Also get the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese as sides!"

And by good eats, I mean flipping awesome tasting food plus Kitchen Table Cafe is a place with food integrity.  They have a great mission statement and source BOTH veggies and meats organically and locally.  Which makes them way ahead of the curve -- kudos to you, KTC. 

As for mains, I just love the brisket or the meatloaf.  As for sides go for the mashed potatoes and gravy or collard greens.  Plus, they have a variety of yummy sauces that will satisfy any barbecue craving.  You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu -- everything is very delish and well executed!  I am so happy to have them in the neighborhood. 

Get there early because they often sell out before closing time.  A few times In the past, I&#39;ve tried to get food around 7pm and there was nothing left."

The chicken is a 4 star rating ...it&#39;s really  good.
The sauces and sauce selections also 4 stars
The sides are all good 3-4 stars

Sadly for me where this all totally falls apart is value, I am writing this following my second visit and here are my concerns

First visit with 6 people and I paid 103 bucks to get enough chicken, sides and drinks for my group. ( no beer) And my second visit was with three people and the total was 44 bucks.(no beer)  For those numbers you can go to quite a few places and have a darn good meal.  Basically a  dollar a piece for a chicken wing is pretty crazy!!!

This is just WAY too much $$$ for some chicken wings. 

Part of the problem is that the prices  are quite a bit too high and then also the cashiers flip around the apple pay system for you to sign and it has a 20% tip button that you have little choice but to push as they are &#34;tip shaming&#34; you.   And finally they nickel and dime you for ranch dressing in these tiny tiny little thimble sized cups..... All this for a walk up order place..shame shame on you.

Another irritation is that they have no plates...not even paper ones,  so this basket of chicken shows up for your party and you all have to eat on is a paper towel and there is no place to put your bones....it&#39;s all a bit too sloppy at the tables with paper towels laying everywhere with chewed bones all over.  Would be easy for them to fix.

The chicken is Great but I could go get 5-8 full buckets of KFC for less.   It&#39;s too bad that for me that perceived (and actual) value trumps quality ...but there is just no value here you either leave hungry, or broke or both.

As a result it slides my review down to 2 stars. Go if you must, but either plan to go to DQ for ice cream after,   or you will be hungry... and make sure your wallet is well stocked with jacksons."

We stopped in here one night after hearing great reviews on the Free in Parker site. We got the chicken tender sandwiches and the chicken tender kids meal for our boys to share. 
The portions are HUGE! We were filled up for hours afterward. The fries were the shoestring type fries with good seasoning and very tasty--coming from someone that is NOT a huge french fry person. The boys SPLIT the chicken tender meal and still ate it for the next 4 days. 
My husband dreamed about their chicken for the next few weeks till he convinced me today that we needed more chicken and he ran off there and brought us home some more chicken sandwiches. I couldn&#39;t even finish mine tonight.
We haven&#39;t tried anything but the chicken finger sandwiches, so maybe next time I will try some wings and see how those are :-)
Definitely give this place a shot, but give them plenty of time if its a game night, they get slammed!

The first time, we ordered a couple dozen wings to go... got home to enjoy them but could barely eat them because they were so so salty.  We liked that the breading was crispy but were  disappointed that the breading was so thick - way too much for wings.  And lastly, the flavors aren&#39;t built into the batter - you just order sauces.  The fries however were good - crisp and not mushy.  We tried the place again a second time a few weeks later, hoping we&#39;d just caught them on a bad day and that it would be better since a lot of folks seem to like them... they were less salty but still not great.

I decided on a chicken sandwich with cheese. I didn&#39;t order the combo because fries don&#39;t usually hold up well.

When I got home and opened up my take out container, I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. There were 3 tenders on large roll with a melted slice of cheese on 1 side and the crown of the bun on the other side dressed with lettuce, red onion, pickles and tomato.

They offer many different types of sauce, some free and others for a small extra cost. I settled on the free hot sauce which I believe to be straight Frank&#39;s hot sauce.

I took my first bite of this large sandwich and I knew that I stumbled upon something special. The chicken was hot and very juicy. It tasted like no other chicken I have ever had. The crispy coating was seasoned perfectly and the melted cheese cut into the spiciness of the hot sauce nicely. It was so good that I had to try it again tonight. This time I ordered the combo with the fries!

The only drawback was the price, it was a bit steep for a wing place, and Pepsi products make it a place I will never just stop in for a quick lunch.  With these two factors I will not stop in too often but here and there it would be a great place to pick up dinner."

I was searching on line for someplace and found the Chicken Shack. It had good reviews and it looked really good so we decided to try. I could not be more happy with the Chicken Shack. The cashier was fantastic, she has so much personality, is so friendly, and she made good recommendations. My friend had the three fingers plate, they were huge the best little shoestring fries, I had a combo plate with three fingers and three wings. The wings were huge, cooked to perfection, and I couldn&#39;t of been happier. We ordered a side of macaroni salad and coleslaw to split, the macaroni salad was fantastic. We didn&#39;t care for the coleslaw but when the cashier asked that&#39;s about it and we told her we didn&#39;t care for it she replaced it with a potato salad that was excellent. The Chicken Shack is one of our new favorites when dining in Parker. It&#39;s a small restaurant and when we went it was packed. They do big orders for tailgates are parties and I&#39;m sure will be trying that option in the future also. Again this was one of the best little family owned and operated Chicken shack I&#39;ve ever been to. Also they have a ton of different sauces. I will definitely be trying those in the future. They do have an iPhone app and I would suggest anyone get it look at their menu and give them a try."

When it comes to a wing place, one sauce can be determinative. That is the case here with the lime chili sauce. It has a full flavor and just the right amount of heat. We also had the Cajun and Sweet Chili sauces. Both could hold their own and can open your sinuses. It is nice when the flavorful sauces are hot and one doesn&#39;t have to order the hottest wings on the menu just to taste something. But these sauces may not be for children or the weak. 
The wings are huge. Now, I am usually not a fan of larger wings. You get more meat, yeah, but it is harder to get a consistently moist and uniform wing. However, these wings were very good and could change my opinion over time. They were juicy and yet crisp on the outside. They were perfectly done. 
Their other items, if you insist on wasting your time with something other than wings, are acceptable. My wife had a burger with fries. The burger was made to order and done correctly. The fries here are the thin and crisp variety. My son had the kids chicken strips meal and those were two ginormous hunks of chicken. They were very good as well and came with the same fries. 
The employees were very friendly and gave plenty of smiles, as if they actually enjoyed what they were doing and appreciated the business. 
The cost was reasonable, especially for the sauces. One could pay 20% more at a chain wing place for mediocre wings."

Attempt #1 - Stopped in with my wife and kids on a weekend.  Line of only about 3 people but it took forever to even get up to the register.  It is a very small place and limited on seating.  On top of that, they have the tables organized in a strange configuration or they could have fit at least room for another table or two for four people.  We left before ordering once we realized there wouldn&#39;t be anywhere to sit either way.

Attempt #2 - Takeout on a Saturday for college football watching at home.  Wings were terrible.  Breaded but soggy and warm at best.  We only live 5 minutes away so not sure how that is possible.  Prices are way to high for wings that make Dominos look good.

Guess it is back to Golden Flame for us for now...  Sorry Chicken Shack.  Hope it gets better as we would definitely give it a second chance."

We also tried both of the garlic parmesan options (the cream and the rub) the cream was our favorite out of everything. Their fries are good, they are more of the shoe string kind. The girl at the counter was nice also and made sure we liked our food. Definitely will be back."

The space is modern and very dimly lit, at night and the general ambiance is just very mysterious and intimate. It&#39;s really that they generally support local jazz artists, and that the club had a very grassroots beginning, being crowd-funded by the community. 

We came on a Friday night around 11pm, and the place was about half-full, mostly older couples, enjoying a bespoke cocktail at the bar. While there wasn&#39;t an actual band playing, there wasn&#39;t a band playing, there was someone playing the piano, at a very casual, comfortable volume level. He wasn&#39;t formally taking requests, but in the end, we got him to play Piano Man, which he played from memory quite well.

Drinks came out quite fast, and the Manhattan I got was very well-balanced. Prices are easily a bit more on the expensive side, but given that they do take the time to make your drink properly, I&#39;m a fan. As previously mentioned, our waitress and bartender were very quick about getting our drinks, and were very attentive throughout the night.

I&#39;ll have to come back when there is a full band playing, and perhaps try some of their food. Definitely a romantic place for a date, and a good change of pace from the other drinking establishments in the neighborhood."

I was able to get in on short notice (the night of), and we had a great spot close to the stage. 

The music was tad loud when you sit close, but we could still carry on conversation. It&#39;s full dinner service, so we made a night of it and had appetizers, a bottle of wine, and the whole nine yards. I had the special which was a white fish, it was excellent - cooked perfectly, fantastic presentation - for the price it could have been a slightly larger portion in my opinion but I left full. 

The desert might have been the best part, and then we had after dinner drinks and continued to enjoy the jazz. I&#39;m not what you would call a jazz connoisseur by any means, I simply enjoy it, and I thought the band did an excellent job. They have different acts all the time, so it will be a new experience every time you go. 

It looks like the bar area is very popular for people just coming in to have a drink, and not getting a table. If that&#39;s your plan, prepare for standing room only, or at least that was the case the two times I&#39;ve been there. Anyway, if you&#39;re looking for some live music paired with a good meal and perhaps some drinks, I would recommend Nocturne."

With live jazz from Tuesday through Saturday, you will also be in for a treat. Weekend nights get very crowded to be sure to make a reservation but on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, you should no problem finding a seat.

The service was outstanding from the hostess, to the cocktail waitress, to our server who as very attentive and informative of the menu. The menu is small yet creative with rotating dishes and chef specials. My wife had the lamb shank (it was cooked to perfection) and I had the truffle linguine which was beautifully creamy.

We told them it was our 5 year anniversary so they brought us free champagne. Always helps to make you feel a little more special.

First, Katy is great to work with for groups. She explained everything very well. They have a really small kitchen, so it is hard for them to accommodate groups. Therefore, I highly suggest the family style meal. I have a ton of picky eaters. I have vegetarians, pescatarians, shellfish allergies, grain allergies, etc. All of this would make you think family style would be a nightmare! But Nocturne went out of their way to ensure that everyone was accommodated. The food was incredible!! Every person was satisfied! The salad was great, and the flat breads were so good! They were a little spicy, which was nice. The octopus is highly recommended. Everyone who eats meat loved the pork sandwiches! The desserts were good as well.

The place is small and packed, and it seems that every seat in the house is a good one. If you are looking for a relaxed, soul reviving night out, Nocturne will do it!

There is a cover fee for each band. We paid $10 per person, but they will let you know immediately at the door. The wine and cocktail list is extensive. We had several questions about wine and what our attentive server didn&#39;t know, she happily asked the bartender about!  We enjoyed the cheese/charcuterie plate and rabbit ragu. The charcuterie was fabulous, but the ragu was only okay. I would recommend having lots of spirits and an appetizer, but maybe save your main meal for somewhere else.

The band was fantastic and played for two solid hours without stopping.

Nocturne also added those little extras, like checking my coat when I entered, that makes this place a gem!"

Unfortunately, the food and atmosphere kept me from giving the place five stars. For food, be narrow and do it well. At the moment is seems more &#34;flash in the pan&#34; or trendy vs. concerned with tried and true consistency. I ordered the pasta, boyfriend had the tasting menu. Skip dinner, go for music and drinks.

I have to disagree with the people calling the space intimate. I liked how the space is broken up, but it still is cavernous. I associate intimate with a comfortable, homey vibe. A place where I can have meaningful conversations with friends and dates or hide-away solo and lose myself in the music. I think this is possible at Nocturne but not where they currently are at.

But perhaps none of that matters, because again, one of the best gin martinis I&#39;ve had in years."

They did a great job with the space, it has a lot of character, but most importantly it is intimate and they draw great acts. We were seated near the stage and it was fun to take in some live jazz in such a &#39;snazzy&#39; place, to quote a fellow Yelper. 

They had a pretty extensive drink list. We both had a glass of Malbec, which seemed to fit the mood that night. We did order the summer picnic, which is a charcuterie plate. That was really nice and we should have stopped there but we went for the rabbit ragu. It was good but it was small and the rabbit nearly non-existent. 

What I found very interesting about this place was the clientele. It didn&#39;t feel at all like I was in RiNo. It was definitely an older demographic and one that seemed to be professional. I liked how everyone was dressed up- the guys mostly in coats and the ladies in dresses. That&#39;s nice to see.

Overall, I think this is a great spot for jazz, a drink, and maybe something like charcuterie but I would skip on the entrees and either have those before or after the show."

I just love this little block in the RiNo Neighborhood. Adding the addition of Nocturne has made for one cool little spot. 

It&#39;s kind of tucked away behind some buildings so it&#39;s little hard to spot on a dark street at night. But that&#39;s ok. When you walk through the door, it&#39;s like your whisked away to a classy 1940&#39;s jazz club. The sound in Nocturne is incredible. You can hear each instrument clearly. 

Every time I&#39;ve gone, I&#39;ve always sat downstairs at the bar. It&#39;s perfect because I&#39;m close to my favorite thing, the bartender, and it&#39;s not too loud so you can have a conversation. Next time I go, I would love to sit in the upstairs space. It always looks so hip up there. And since the space is so open, you get a great view from up there. 

The last time I was there, I had light appetizers. I wish I remembered specifically what they were but I don&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t anything to rave about but it wasn&#39;t bad. What&#39;s superb here is the music and the drinks. The very attractive and attentive bar-staff are always on point. They are very knowledgeable about their bar and drink lists. There is a wonderful selection of imported wines if that&#39;s your thing. 

The music is always superb. I&#39;m a huge jazz lover and a fan of so much local talent that plays here. The sound quality in the joint is great. The way they have it set up is conducive to the space. Sometimes, it can be a little loud, but the music is so good, who cares.

From our group, the Lamb belly was succulent and delicious and was by far the event of the night.  Their house punch aperitif was delicious and dangerous, with a hint of smooth bourbon in a fruity innocent disguise.... The drinks packed a punch, and it didn&#39;t take too many to rock our world!

Was here on a Wednesday evening and it was about half full. Glad there weren&#39;t more because the tolerance for conversation is higher here than Dazzle, which is quite a bit more strict about keeping noise to a minimum. Had read previous comments about the food being subpar so we didn&#39;t splurge on the set menu. 

We started with the &#34;riffs&#34; which included house made pickles, fava beans, marinated cherries, olives and grilled bread. The bread was tasty but dry and needed a spread or olive oil. It was a nice way to get the evening started overall.

Next course was bison carpaccio, which was about what I expected. Then came the bacon and beef meatballs with Olathe sweet corn and chanterelles -- this was delicious but quite rich so perfect for splitting.

We ended with the risotto, which was definitely the weak link. Way too much going on in this dish -- inexplicably fermented taste which was quite overpowering. 

For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate torte which had passion fruit truffles, which redeemed the prior misstep. 

The wine list was well curated and the cocktails we had were quite good, particularly the Old Old Fashioned, which was enormous.

Service was on point - attentive but not obtrusive. Prices were generally reasonable given the real reason you come here, which is the jazz, though I&#39;m concerned that they are a bit too high for the Denver market. The menu needs clearer indicators of the sizes of dishes and also to indicate prices of individual items from the set menu, since a la carte is an option."

Food and service and atmosphere gets 2.5 stars. The decor, paint, etc is ALL grey; which is fine but in the evening, the inadequate and/or type of lighting makes it look like a dungeon. We sat at a table upstairs and not one of us 30 something&#39;s could hardly read the menu. Pendant lighting from the ceiling above our table or one of those small table lamps would have been very helpful.  Drab. Drab. Drab. 

The menu: SMH. 

The &#34;African Grain Risotto&#34; was terribly disappointing. It was served in a shallow saucer/bowl and looked liked mush with wild flowers on top. The temperature was Luke warm and it frankly looked disgusting. The flavor was OK but my brain had a difficult time getting past the presentation and color the risotto. It was an appetizer...and $13. WTF. The $6 Cubano slider was meh! 

Cannoli in a jar tasted more like butterscotch pudding with whipped cream on top. The brown butter cake was served on a mound of powdered sugar that was somehow made to look clumpy. And it really just looked like cake served on a mound of feta cheese.  Again, presentation was baffling.  The cake was just OK. May have tasted better if it looked better. 

We planned to order more food but the service was SO slow and the food wasn&#39;t impressive at all, so we decided to just stick with cocktails. Oh, and the coffee I ordered with desert never came and I was too exhausted with the long waiting on everything to remind our server.  

I&#39;d go back for the live jazz but will not order food there in the future. Nocturne was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I&#39;ve ever had in Denver."

They&#39;re supporting live Denver&#39;s live jazz scene and I hope it continues. But, it doesn&#39;t lend itself as a &#34;regulars&#34; establishment because of the inherit cost involved.  I would like to frequent Nocturne more often, but unless it finds a more reasonable price range, I will make it a &#39;once it a while&#39; destination."

We were both pretty casual, and weren&#39;t sure that they would let us in.  The woman who checked out IDs WAS friendly and very accommodating.  She said that the cover is usual $10 (it goes to the performers), but if we just wanted to have a drink and check it out, we wouldn&#39;t need to .  pay this time.  Awesome!

Got inside and were seated inside a bar that can be described as dark and elegant, with blue lights lighting up the performers.  We were given the drink and specialty food menu, which was impressive.  I wish I would have tried the food.  It sounded great. The waiter came over and I felt kind of like a slob due to how I was dressed compared to everyone else. However, the waiter was awesome.  Knew his stuff, wasn&#39;t in a rush, and had a conversation with us.  (Ladies-He was handsome and didn&#39;t have a ring on.)  He definitely made us feel welcome.  Furthermore, there was someone filling up our water continuously.  

I was expecting to have tabs kept on me while we had the drink, so we didn&#39;t stay too long without paying cover, but nope.  Just needed to enjoy myself.

If you want a nice jazz club and a to experience what good service is in a day where it is rare, check this place out.  My suggestion is to dress up instead of down."

Expect to walk into a very clean, sleek and sophisticated space with Amazing music, stellar service and succulent food. I really hope the chef stays (please stay humble and creative), I really hope the owner continues to frequent the floor, as I hope the musicians stay happy playing at our new favorite spot. 

I&#39;m very happy to say this place will continue to do well. Obviously the owners/managers have poured a lot of thought into this place, it shows tremendously thank you. Love the layout. Such a breath of fresh air from the usual more tired jazz venues in Denver, which are few to begin with.

Bartender was top notch. Patiently and passionately  explained all his creations. Old old fashioned wow, as well as the 12 mile and my wife&#39;s gin drink. Beer selection also decent and seemed varied enough to keep me happy with choices for future visits. Wine - I didn&#39;t look but heard from others that prices seemed a little high. 

Best fries I&#39;ve ever had. Seriously, I know its a bold statement but I would come here just to eat fries. Mashed fingerling potatoes with the skins . . whaaat .  . with crab seasoning .. WoW. Thanks chef for not copping out and just pouring fries out from a bag. Kale salad was fresh, lemony and pleasantly chopped. Octopus was hearty, and deliciously thought out with some very green, fresh veggies, various legumes and nicely toasted bread to sop up the sauce.

As for past reviews about prices . . they seemed in line with most other restaurants + the prices help keep the food and drinks at the quality you should expect. Prices help keep standards high and the club at a more premium level. I think mature, cool crowds will continue to frequent keeping this place on the map. Maybe the club has weekday/night specials/drink discounts? That would be nice to keep the regulars happy.

We&#39;ll be back for sure and we&#39;ll recommend heavily because we want this place to do well even though we would love to keep our new secret to ourselves.

We came for the jazz and the vibe.  Full marks!  For Denver (important caveat), classy, hip, intimate, almost unique.  The bar is well worth visiting and having Topher make something up for you.

Music is loud, but not &#34;noisy&#34;; just don&#39;t expect intimate conversations unless you&#39;re upstairs or maybe in the bar.

Perhaps they were eager to exploit and gentrify it the way all of these new bars are, which is a shame, because so many locals here were born into jazz. If they actually wanted to support the Denver jazz scene, this is not how it should be done. Nocturne was more welcoming to those -whom are most likely not even locals- that can afford a couple of subpar cocktails for over $70 (this is without food). The music was incredible. The musicians were mingling amongst the crowd which made the experience even better. The environment is absolutely stunning. (The three elements that warranted three stars). But you can feel the pretentiousness upon walking in. I was laughed at for wanting to start a tab (most likely because he didn&#39;t think we could afford more than one drink), only to be asked at the end of the night by a different bar tender if we had a tab open, which we didn&#39;t- as we were refused one. Snarky is the best word I can use for it. My friend and I were there to stay for all of the musicians whether they thought we could or not. To put it lightly- it did not feel welcoming for someone my age, even though there are plenty of young people eager to get highly involved in the Jazz scene. I was expecting more of an artsy, poetic type environment and was disappointed in seeing more of the &#34;suburban crowd takes their monthly trip to downtown&#34; folks. Cherry creek or perhaps Littleton would be more fitting for this place. That&#39;s okay though, they can keep their upscale &#34;jazz bar&#34;. I&#39;ll be waiting for one that celebrates inclusiveness in this great community in the meantime."

I shared stories about Nocturne on Facebook several times.  Made a reservation for their Friday opening night.  Made it online, for 8pm, the earliest they offered for dinner for 6 people on the ground floor, in front of the stage.  Got the confirmation email.  Everything seemed great.

As my party began to arrive, we were told by a hostess at the door that there is currently a private show happening, and that they were &#34;almost done&#34;, and asked us to wait at the bar before being seated.  This is quite understandable.  Bands start late due to technical problems all the time.  No biggie.  

But then, an hour passed, and we were still standing around uncomfortably in heels at the bar, with no complimentary drinks in our hands, no place to sit, and waiting to be seated so that we could eat.  Every time I asked someone how much longer, I was told, &#34;oh they should be done shortly&#34;, or some other similar lame excuse.  While waiting, I had a French 75, which tasted just like cough syrup.   Yum!  

After about an hour and 15 minutes, and certainly before the private show was completed, we were finally seated, upstairs in the loft.  I am not sure if the reason we were seated there was because of the size of our party, or if it was because they wanted to finally get us seated.  And since the band was still playing, all the ground level seating was still occupied.  Either way, you cannot see the stage when you are seated on the loft.

We received no apology, were offered no complimentary drinks or appetizers; nothing.

Our waitress was kind and fast.  But she forgot to tell us about the dinner special(s).  I only found out about it on my way out the door after talking to another friend that was there.  We asked for the $49 five course meal, but was told it was not available yet.  I ended up ordering the Frites, and the Lamb Belly.  Both were actually really good.  I tasted some of my friends meals, and they were pretty &#39;meh&#39;.  The oysters tasted like fishy salt water.  Another friend got the African Risotto that was covered in wild flowers.  The only highlights, besides spending time with friends, was that the second band was pretty decent, and that I was able to buy a $17 glass of Remy, which is something not a lot of places carry here.  

I think I was expecting too much of this place on their opening night.  They have a lot of kinks to iron out.  I will give this place another couple of months and try again.  Hopefully I will return with a better impression and a better review.  :)"

Initial impressions were great; loved the space and the music but the food and cocktails were a bit disappointing.

The good:
- Fantastic wine list with a knowledgeable sommelier
- Had a glass of a pigato from Liguria (can&#39;t remember the producer) that was outstanding
- Great live music with a small cover ($5 when I was there)
- Very friendly servers, waitresses, and hosts
- Delicious &#34;Boardwalk Frites&#34; (best thing we tried)
- Good sazerac.
- Good cannoli in a jar
- Oysters were delicious!

The not-so-good
- I was seated in a high-traffic area and felt like I was in the way every time someone walked past
- Cubano sliders were decent, but nothing special. They used a super spicy mustard that was a bit overpowering.
- My girlfriend ordered a boulevardier which was served piled high with cheap cubed ice. Way too much ice!
- I had a glass of wine poured before the food came. I finished the glass and wanted to order more, but they never asked. The waitress even cleared my empty wine glass, took our dessert order, and walked away before I could mention that I wanted more wine. 
- Lamb belly was disappointing; just not a very good dish. 
- Brown-butter almond cake was disgusting. Seriously, I&#39;m not sure if the chef was tasting what he was sending out because I don&#39;t see how he could have served this knowing how it tasted. 


The summary:
3 stars for the music, frites, and wine list. 2 stars for the rest of the menu. 
I&#39;ll probably go back, but I&#39;ll only order drinks, frites, and oysters."

I applaud the effort towards the first -- local jazz musicians now have another place in Denver to perform, be appreciated, and be paid. The stage and sound are wonderful. Opening a jazz club is a courageous move and I couldn&#39;t be more appreciative. Five starts for that part.

As for the second, I have to admit that I didn&#39;t eat anything because I was so annoyed by the prententiousness of the menu. I mean, &#34;Robiola Bosina,&#34; &#34;Farmhouse Riffs,&#34; &#34;Gnoccho Frito,&#34; &#34;Chickpea Duck Soca&#34; -- what are these things?  The place is dark, tne menu is dark grey/black, the dish titles are vague references (and I rarely have trouble with food terminology in different languages), and the dish descriptions are printed in tiny upper case letters--it&#39;s hard enough just to read the words let alone decide whether a dish sounds appealing. Do I really need to know that the Cuban sandwich has &#34;smoked pig parts&#34; instead of, uh, ham? Jazz fans come out for the music, which we&#39;re more than willing to support by ordering a drink and a bite. Don&#39;t make us decypher the menu -- it takes away from the music.

My friend and I sat at the cocktail tables, actually a built-in booth with little immovable tables. They&#39;re cute, but try actually eating (my friend did order food). You have to either lean forward, sit at the edge of the seat, or lean back and hold the plate in your hands. Like the menu, the emphasis seems to be the asthetic more than the customer&#39;s experience. 

I could be wrong, but I believe that folks who are real jazz fans and and folks who appreciate (and want to pay for) &#34;Boardwalk Frites&#34; (French fries, I think) are not the same. I hope Nocturne figures out which group it wants to attract -- and I hope it&#39;s the former."

The atmosphere is art deco/speakeasy style and very appealing.  The Jazz was fantastic.  Sadly the food and service were a complete disappointment.  

Let&#39;s start with the food.  The tickets for V Day were $75 per person, and the menu was a 4 course prix fixe.  The menu was New Orleans inspired and looked amazing.  Unfortunately, the reality did not live up at all!  The plates were tiny!  Even smaller than one would expect at a tapas place, and this was supposed to be a dinner menu.  My first course was a single piece of grilled toast, with two small pieces of cheese and sauce.  My sister&#39;s salad was in a soupl cup.  The &#34;ravioli&#34; course was one ravioli, about 3&#34; diameter and less than 1/2&#34; thick.  The pasta was homemade, but severely under-cooked and to us, inedible.  The filling was OK, but there was not even close to enough.  The main course was a vegetable pave, and just that (not sides).  This was more substantial than the other tiny plates, but certainly not a meal.  The pave was 4&#34; in diameter, and only 1.5&#34; tall.  The flavors were mediocre.  The dessert &#34;course&#34; was a house made box of chocolate.  Just one.  For two people.  It contained 4 small chocolates that were delicious.  

On to the service, the website said doors opened at 5:30 pm, but they did not.  We were there about 5:45 and stood outside in the cold, watching people walk around inside and ignore us.  By the time they let us in just before 6, there were at least 25 people outside with us....all freezing.  Kindly, one hostess did try to seat us in the order we arrived.  The other one was less caring, and I even watched her seat a party with a woman on crutches upstairs, without ever asking if their party would prefer to be downstairs.  Our server was nice, but after taking drink and dinner order we never saw her again....until we flagger her down for drink refills.  Food runners did the rest.  To end the evening, we were given a single rose with dessert.  One rose.  Really, couldn&#39;t have stepped it up with one for each women??  (We had mentioned to our server our situation so she knew we were not a couple).

I had heard from others that their tasting menu&#39;s portions were crazy small, but even so I was floored.  Had I actually paid the $75 per person for this meal I would have been ballistic.  

Go for the music and ambiance, but be sure to eat somewhere else...this place would only fill you up if you have just had gastric surgery and can only eat a few ounces of food at a time."

Then sat us at that same table 2 minutes later. They said a $10 musician fee, per party, was optional, then tacked $30 on our $24 tab and said it was not optional, which equates to $10 per person. Most places upon opening try to make people feel welcome. They go for theft. Musicians were great. Management was terrible."

Nocturne is a fabulous chic new Jazz club in the RiNo neighborhood.  They have a great wine and cocktail list.  Not sure what to order?  Just ask the somm, bartender, or your server they all seemed equally passionate and knowledgeable about their offerings. 

The food is fantastic with many great options to choose from.  Each of the dishes we tried; squid and octopus, robiola bosina, gnocco fritto, and cubano sliders was beautifully presented and had such delicious flavors.  

Finally... I am a bit picky about ambiance and I was so impressed by the overall feel of Nocturne.  The atmosphere is great and the service is friendly and genuine.  Nocturne is a hidden gem and I am so glad that this is part of the Denver nightlife.  I will be back!!!"

We had a reservation and were immediately seated at a balcony table with a great view of the stage.  We started with cocktails and the kale salad, all of which were delicious.  Then, the boardwalk frites, which were out of this world with aioli for dipping.  The lamb belly was the standout entree and the wine recommendations by Scott were spot on and outstanding. 

It was a Saturday so we got to see two excellent and very different jazz bands for the reasonable $10 cover charge.  A more traditional jazz ensemble with excellent soloists and also a Latin Jazz combo that was very tight and coordinated in its intricate arrangements and strong solos.  Top flight jazz musicians for sure.  

We met Scott and Nicole who are super nice and personable and have obviously poured their heart and soul into the concept and its execution.  They took an old warehouse space and turned it into a very cool jazz club with absolutely top quality food, wine, cocktails and service.  There is no other place in Denver that has all of those qualities together.  

Bravo to Scott and Nicole and we will be back soon!"

The music was just the right volume (i.e., still possible to have a conversation). Dannette and the Old Souls were solid and Dannette is the consummate performer. The room is well appointed with comfortable booths. The loft is really inviting with an interesting view of the action below and old factory-style windows high above the tables.

I loved it, the jazz music, the funky drinks, the friendly bartenders.  I loved it so much I brought other friends back the next night. I just wanted to show them the place, we werent planning on staying.  The gal at the door came and found us at the bar and said someone did not show up for their reservation if we wanted their table so we decided to stay.  I got a quick little appetizer. It said &#34;sliders&#34;  but it is just one by the way. Friends got a cheese and olive plate. They loved it.  Bread service was brought with it.  The music was on point, all was going well. My friend was so excited with the feel of it all he was tapping to the beat with his glass.  We were having a great time. Then the manager, a blonde woman, comes over and says I am going to have to ask you to stop doing that, and walks away.  The mood shifted, the rudeness of this woman was so uncalled for. She had no people skills whatsoever.  She did not ask us how our night was, nor if we liked the place, nor a thank you for not doing that because it may bother guests, (even though the music was so loud I doubt anyone could hear the tapping). Anyway she just stormed over, made that statement and walked away with an ugly look on her face.  We had planned on ordering dessert, however decided against it after that. When the bill came there was a charge on it for $10 each for an entrance/artist fee, a fee which we were not aware of.  Luckily they took it off the bill. The waitress was nice, but said next time we will have to pay that. When we left we tipped the band directly. Now the key, apparantly, is that if you sit at the bar you do not pay that fee. All in all great place with a few kinks and I do hope that manager gets a new job or learns how better to work with people in such an industry.  Thank you to all the people who were nice and the musicians who were fabulous!"

Well our experience was nothing like the reviews here indicated it would be. There were four of us and we were treated like red headed step children. We had to wait forever to be served. Our waiter was not friendly. My drink - a punch of some sort was served in what could only be described as someones grandmothers glass tea cup and had very little punch in it, it and a lot of ice. I asked for my next round to be a double and in a tall water glass. Well, you would have thought I asked the waiter to peel grapes for me. I was so hungry by the time we got our food that McDonalds would have sounded good to me. We ordered what they called Lobster Bisque. Nope. I lived in Maine for 15 years so I know what lobster bisque should be and this was a slighlty milky soup base on top of onions (? - not really sure) garlicky croutons and some lobster meat. It was not creamy or rich like a bisque should be. For $15 per bowl I expected better. We shared two orders of cubano sliders, three &#34;lobster bisques&#34; and some other puff pastry happy hour appetizer item, we had about 12 drinks between us (most at happy hour prices) and our bill was almost $150.00. We dine out often as we live in downtown Denver and this was a most disappointing experience - mostly because our service was so begrudginly provided. I am happy to spend plenty of money for a great dining/entertainment experience but I am not happy to spend it on an unfriendly server in a restaurant with poorly executed food. Not me - never again."

He allowed us to sample some of the wines to help us decide what we would like most. Brian wasn&#39;t full of himself and if he didn&#39;t know the answer to one of our questions about the wines, he would go find out from the owner or another employee.

The din of chatter by the crowd at Nocturne made the music difficult to listen to. The crowd at this venue seemed to believe the entertainment was background music.

Down side for music fans is you can hear the bartender making drinks. Table of women seated at stage talked loudly all night almost drowning out jazz singer. Fortunately there is an upstairs so if you are there for the food and less about music go there. Maybe this is a question to be asked by hostess; are you here for great music or dinner and drinks? Definately worth going for food, ambience and great cocktail choices just don&#39;t ruin it for the rest of us. This venue is an excellent spot for top name performers.

We liked the ambiance, nicely adorned with upscale trappings, high ceilings, and wonderful sound system. Service was very good and attentive. 
So why, you ask, did you rate Nocturne with only three stars? Well, a couple of things. First, although the food was pretty good, it was pricy for what you got. My wife and her friend ordered individual portions and left hungry. The guys ordered the whole five course meal and were satisfied. The bill came to $190 per couple, which is a bit pricy in this market. The entertainment was  good, a singer who is booked every Saturday night for the summer, which means why would we come back on a Saturday night to hear the same entertainer?

It is a competitive market and we wish you well, hoping that there will be more alternative jazz entertainers in the future."

The owner Peter was very nice and very humble, I recommended a dessert which was some rice pudding along with coconut milk and mango, we thought the food was so good we figured we&#39;d try the dessert! Worth every single penny!! I recommend this place 100%"

The owner, Peter, is a most humble and pleasant man who has created a wonderful atmosphere and an incredible menu. The place is very clean and orderly and the staff is swift to keep your glasses of water or cups of tea filled. It is not the quickest to bring out the food, but it is well worth the wait. 

Oh my gosh, the chicken coconut soup (Tom Kha Kai) is absolutely delightful. One can add a higher level of spiciness if desired and it&#39;s extremely tasty and truly an elevated experience for the tastebuds. I was in Nirvana while consuming that scrumptious bowl!!

Then the Panang curry came out and I was blown away by the richness and depth of flavors in that piping hot, freshly made bowl of wonder. I only meant to eat half of it and have lunch leftovers for the next day....but I couldn&#39;t stop myself!! The steamed jasmine rice served with the dish complements the flavors fabulously. 

All you other Yelpers, STAY AWAY!! This place is a hidden secret!! Hahaha"

I thought it was nice of them to hold the table for us for that long. The menu offers a ton of options from soups to curries, noodles to fried rice, meat dishes to vegetarian. The options are endless. I tried:

-Pad Thai- not the best pad thai I&#39;ve ever had but wasn&#39;t bad either 
-tom yum (2 large:1 chicken 1 shrimp)- pretty spicy and delicious
-tofu vegetable basil stir fry
- drunken noodles
-panang curry-perfectly balanced flavor, was by far my favorite dish of the night
-Mango sticky rice- great presentation &amp; not overly drenched with coconut milk; 1 of my favorite desserts in general

The total: $90 for 6 people. The manager was super friendly &amp; was eager to ask us about how we enjoyed our meal. He was very attentive and full of energy. The restrooms are clean. The ambience was casual &amp; felt home-ish without all the fabric and furnitures."

I stopped by on a chilly evening, right before the dinner rush. No one else was in the restaurant at the time so I was promptly seated and offered a menu. Usual items that I have found in other Thai restaurants, such as Pad Thai and a variety of curries, took up the majority of the items available but I found it refreshing to also see unique dishes on their dinner specials. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable about any questions I had about the dishes. I opted for the Pad See-Ewe, a rice noodle dish with stir-fried vegetables, for this visit. 

My wait was a bit long, as customers started to fill the restaurant quickly and the phone was constantly ringing from to-go orders, but I soon found out that they were busy for a reason! The rice noodles were fresh and the stir-fried vegetables were seasoned well. The slight sweetness of the sauce they used in the noodles complimented the medium hot spiciness that I chose. Each bite was flavorful and the heat was not overwhelming; just enough to keep me warm when I left."

Decided to give this restaurant a try after years of being in the area, and with the amount of awards it sounded like a great place. I was severely disappointed. Poorly staffed, LONG wait time, and no apology whatsoever.

Customer service: SUCKED, they took twenty minutes to take my order, and the guy did not care about our wait time. 

The food: Nonexistent. We waited forty minutes, plus an extra twenty, and not a single word was spoken about the wait. 

After waiting an hour, the guy at the front unflinchingly let us leave.

I work nearby and ordered some pad Thai for pick up. I waited over ten minutes at the host desk and wasn&#39;t greeted or spoken to at all. I tried to make eye contact with the waiter and was unsuccessful. The waiter even walked right by me 3 times to grab water for seated customers and ignored me. I said, &#34;Excuse me, sir&#34; politely to try and get his attention with no success. So disappointed!

My wife and I got the pad see ewe with medium spice. The food was really good, the spice was not overpowering nor was it too weak, just right. Portions were about right for what we paid. We also got the crab cheese wontons, these things were stuffed so they&#39;re generous with those portions.

This restaurant is INCREDIBLE and I actually didn&#39;t want to write a review so everyone would know how amazing they are! But I guess I&#39;ll share good food! First of all, this is a family run Thai restaurant. They have family working there and everyone is friendly. The decor is very quaint and colorful, you feel like you are dining in someone&#39;s home. There aren&#39;t a lot of tables, so come early. They have a hotness scale of 1-6, so they&#39;ll ask you how hot you&#39;d like your order and it&#39;s totally custom. I like things very hot so I usually do a 5-6, but my family does a 3-4 if you like heat but you don&#39;t want to die. I ordered the coconut chicken soup and OH MY GOSH it was so delicious!! Fresh ingredients, the soup was made from scratch and was piping hot and spicy. Then we ordered the entrees. The panang curry was so fresh and delicious... I really fail to find the words to express how much my mind was blown. I ordered the Royal, extra spicy of course, and it came with crisp vegetables and each dish was served with jasmine rice. I love this restaurant and I will absolutely be back."

After trying a good selection of the food these positive reviews confound me.  I ordered pickup and was told due to their crowds it would be an hour wait.  &#34;&#34;This must be a great place&#34; I thought.  The restaurant itself was small and cramped.  The food was mediocre at best.  We started with Tom Yum Soup.  The spice level was nice.  No complaints here.  The shrimp egg rolls were small and overpriced.  The fish cakes were bland, dry, and boring.  The entrees were average at best.  Despite asking  for  hot green curry. it was mild//medium at best and overly soupy. The steamed rice was overcooked and soggy. We also ordered Pad Thai.  Not a good choice.  I ordered it to be &#34;&#34; Thai hot.&#34;  Nope.  It turned out so mild that I needed quite a bit of Sriracha to give it flavor.  The noodles were mush and had been stir fried so excessively no noodle was longer than an inch.  The consistency  of this dish was more like dry sticky porridge than pad thai.  I ve spent time in Thailand and really respect well made Thai food.  I didn&#39;t find it here.  My recommendation,  Go to Thai Flavor instead."

But the the food is out of this world. I had the yellow curry with chicken at the &#34;pretty spicy&#34; level and loved it.  As is noted elsewhere, when you request heat (spicy) you get it. 

The service is very polite, attentive and quick. The owner Peter wanders around assessing your satisfaction, attending to your needs and granting every request - he offered me more rice to finish off the curry.  He says they are completing their 10 year open next month. 

The interior is simple but pleasant. Lining the wall are some awards and art. Despite the recognition of yelp and those awards, I say Siam is under appreciated because I came on a Saturday evening and less than half the tables were occupied. The quality of this food merits more diners. 

Come enjoy it this great food."

I knew they were very busy because it took a while for him to answer. He was very gracious and asked if I could hold while he finished up on another call he had been on.  I waited no more than a minute and he came back on. I placed my order and Peter told me that it would take about 30 minutes, and asked if I was ok with that. I assured him that would be fine. 

My wife stopped by to pick up the order 30 minutes later and true to his word, it was ready. I have yet to be unhappy with the quantity or quality of the food. The Pad Thai was absolutely delicious, spiced exactly the way I like it, and the portion was plenty. The Som Tam (papaya salad) was also delicious. Seasoned and spiced perfectly!  The one disappointment was that I had ordered 2 orders of sticky rice to accompany the Som Tam. Unfortunately, when we opened up the bag, it contained regular rice instead of sticky. 

Bottom line - eating in or take out, Peter serves up authentic dishes well worth the price. Only recommendation is to be sure to check your take out order before leaving the restaurant."

Peter is one of the kindest people you will ever meet and truly provides genuine Thai hospitality. I&#39;ve tried most Thai restaurants in the Denver area. None of them have been able to top Pearl of Siam. 

I loved Peter&#39;s food before I started exploring Thailand. I was worried that I would be jaded after experiencing the real thing. Not only were my fears unfounded, but I found myself comparing a lot of the food in Thailand to Peter&#39;s versions. His food actually beat authentic Thai food from Thailand on many occasions. This is because he is actually Thai. He uses family recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. 

I love spicy food, I mean really really spicy. A lot of places are afraid to turn up the heat. Peter knows I can handle it, and is not afraid to do so. 

Please support this business. Peter works so hard to provide an authentic Thai dining experience with amazing flavors and impeccable service. I promise you will fall in love with Thai food and culture as much as I have. Peter is like family to me now, and every time I step into Pearl of Siam, it&#39;s like I&#39;ve got a little piece of my favorite place in the world right in front me... Thailand. Enjoy!"

Cons:

The staff was nice and sweet and caring, the food was served fast enough, but in all the most important is the food flavors, we ordered the red chicken curry, PadThai&#39; and Redsnapper in 3 flavors, all were in excellent to best of taste, this chef is real Authentic Thai, not as some mixed up Chinese chef tries to cook Thai food.

We had the Massaman Curry and Pad Thai.   The curry was better than the Pad Thai, not the the best we&#39;ve had but quite decent.  I had the iced coffee which was better than I had overseas.

The restaurant was very busy, so obviously a popular hang out for locals, by the time we had finished there was a line outside the door.

We had to sit next to the kitchen door which wasn&#39;t that great, quite distracting.  The ambience and decorations in the restaurant could be better although it was clean.

The prices on the menu didn&#39;t match that on their website, so I would like that updated so clients don&#39;t get any surprises.

In regards to the environment, it was a quaint hole in the wall restaurant with photos on the walls and less than 10 tables.

The owner is super friendly and the staff was very friendly and attentive as well.

The Pad See-ewe was a delight to the senses and I have had their curries as well which are very good.  I was not a fan of the Country Curry, but that was my fault since I didn&#39;t read what it was correctly since I am more of a coconut curry/peanut curry/panag (sp) curry girl.  It did have extremely fresh ingredients. My husband was a fan of their Thai Coffee s well.  Their spring rolls that they do are very interesting and I have not seen them done like this elsewhere and from the reviews I don&#39;t normally order dessert at an Asian restaurant since their desserts on not my style, but it sounds like the mango sticky rice is a must try.

Overall the interior is not fancy but works, and on a Sunday early evening there were some tables taken, but there were plenty of people coming in for take out.

The portion was almost enough for 2 people.  There was tender white meat chicken slices, cubed potatoes, canned pineapple, and sliced carrots.  The streamed white rice came in a simple bowl.

40 mins and they could not even bring out the Thai Tea.  During this time, I noticed only ONE dish was brought to the table. They did have one carry out.  Other than that, 6 tables, including ours were waiting.

Everything was perfect and had some unique flair to the flavors. Not your run of the mill &#34;Americanized&#34; Thai food. But not so authentic that you won&#39;t like it. Yes people you don&#39;t want real authentic Chinese/Thai food like what they eat in China and Thailand. That &#34;real&#34; authentic food does not taste great because they don&#39;t put high amounts of oil, salt and sugar like we get in the restaurants in the USA. I&#39;ve had it on many occasions in Asia so I know. Anyway back to the review......

My only gripes were the tables are really small (due to the small size of the place) and service a little slow. The food more than made up for these small issues so I did not deduct a star. Try it guys. You will love it."

Fried Fish Fleit with sweet chili

We had jasmine tea (very large pot), then edamame &amp; potstickers to start, and chicken in peanut sauce and beef in garlic sauce. Everything tasted great and quite big servings. I LOVED the peanut sauce.

My original review of 4 stars was posted March 29, 2016. I just checked my account and the total charge came through for $53. As stated in the previous review, I ordered the whole fried pompano for $38. I was not expecting lunch to be that much and only tipped $5. I clearly wrote a total of $43 on the receipt. I guess they decided to add a 1 in front of my 5. I WILL NEVER BE BACK TO A PLACE THAT ***STEALS*** FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS. It may just be 10 bucks but it&#39;s the principle. And what if they&#39;re doing this to other people?? I will be contacting my bank about this tomorrow morning. 



Original review: The lady is SO nice! Haha first thing. The place is small with small tables and nothing fancy. My sister and I went in at 1 and it was pretty much full. I knew it was going to be good, ive had this place bookmarked for months. Sister got the chicken tofu pad Thai in medium spicy lunch portion. Portions are pretty big! Spicy was just right, all the other flavors still came through. Delicious, one of the best I&#39;ve had. We also did the whole fish (pompano) fried with garlic and a sweet sauce poured on top on a bed of broccoli, baby corn, zucchini, carrots and mushrooms. It was not amazing but good. Fish wasn&#39;t fishy or anything but the sauce was super sweet. Maybe I should&#39;ve asked for it on the side. Ok this is where the star gets lost. On the menu the fish either came fillet or whole. Fillet was $15.95 and it stated &#39;market price&#39; for whole. It was $38 - THIRTY EIGHT. I thought that was pretty outrageous especially since 1. It was small and 2. I know for a fact pompano isn&#39;t that much per lb. So yeahhh, I was shocked when I got the bill. I should&#39;ve asked how much it was but I seriously thought it would be like $20-25 tops! There&#39;s another Thai place I reviewed in Denver and I ordered a similar dish. The fish was HUGE and it was $20. I&#39;ll be back for the pad Thai :)"

I came in around 1230 and there were a few tables seated, always a good sign! I sat down and was promptly greeted and went with my usual-Chicken Pad Thai medium spice. The lunch specials are around $8 and served with chicken rice soup or crab rangoon so I opted for the rangoon. They came out crispy and huge, perfect little appetizer before the main dish. And speaking of main dish--it was huge! Definitely enough for two servings so I wolfed down part of it and got the other part to go. My only gripe was that it&#39;s served on a small plate and I like to play with my food to make sure the sauce is evenly distributed so it got a bit sloppy. I&#39;ve found that some pad thai in Denver tends to be served in a sweet and sour sauce vs the traditional tamarind sauce and I was pleased to see Dancing Noodle keeps it real and traditional.

Comes with your requisite old peeling wall paper. Family owned. Personal, warm and friendly service. The charm isn&#39;t in the decor it&#39;s in the food. 

Felt the biggest hole in my stomach at the mention of Thai food. Airport food just won&#39;t do it. So from the airport we drove here directly. Besides they close at 9pm.

Easy choice. C4 Gaeng Panang. Based on the description this is their most popular curry! It comes with mushrooms, herbs, baby corn, carrots and zucchini. In coconut sauce. We chose pork as our meat. You have the usual other choices of meat such as chicken, beef etc. 

On point description of &#34;Wonderfully rich and moderately spicy&#34;. The amount of ingredients and meat? Pretty damn good. They give you the right amount in a bowl for $10.95. That is for pork. You pay a bit more for scallops and mixed seafood. $15.95. 

The chicken satay is probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Fat, juicy and the peanut sauce? Wow! And I don&#39;t even love sauces! This one is not too sweet with a perfect hint of peanut. 

This and a small side of plain rice welcomed us to our first night in Denver. I&#39;m satisfied.

Which brings me back to my unanswered question from years ago. Why does Denver have the best Thai food? What happened to Cali Thai food? I&#39;ve been disappointed with Cali Thai food as of late. It&#39;s either too sweet or too expensive with nothing to show for. Unbelievable."

This place was great, it&#39;s a cute little place that caters to people who want to sit down and take-out and the woman who runs it is very kind. I decided to go simple and order the Pad Thai, she offers a 1-5 rating of how spicy you would like it and it felt great to be catered to my specific needs (i got 3 but next time i am most likely to go to 4). The pad thai comes with crab rangoon or a chicken soup as do most entrees, i got the crab rangoon and when it came out it was steaming! Super fresh and tasted delicious, the pad thai also came out super hot and fresh, this may be a con for some of those who like to dive in face first, but to me hot food means it was freshly prepared and tastes great! The portions are sizeable as you can see in the photos. The reason I mentioned the woman who ran the restaurant being kind was that my friend wanted more rice to accompany his curry meal and she brought out a large plate free of charge! 
Summary: Overall, I really enjoyed this experience! Very fresh and tasty food and all within a reasonable spending limit. I believe by the end, including tip and tax I dished out $13, which if you ask me is a great price. I will definitely dining here again!"

I had the Drunken Noodles, moderate spice. They tout hand made noodles, and some of the noodles were a bit mushy and overcooked. Overall flavor was very good, with big chunks of beef and vegetables.

May be worth further exploration."

I like thai food that much. Food is great, spiced to order and the rice soup with the garlic infused oil?? Holy yum. Best part for me: I walked in at odd hours and the family was sitting down to a family style lunch. You can always sit back and relax when you know the employees not only eat their own food, but keep it traditional Thai. That won points with me.  
 I do agree the packing could be a little better, thank goodness they double wrapped my stuff because there were a lot of leaks. But I also have a 20 minute drive home, and I don&#39;t care as long as the food rocks and it&#39;s not leaking on to my car."

It was very flavorful but lacked in quantity and variety. I ordered the Tom kah, which is my number one thai dish I always order.  I have never had such &#34;empty&#34; Tom kha.  It was a bowl of broth, while very flavorful, totally devoid of any substance.  One whole onion sliced up and a few bits of chicken.  Would have been great if I was on bed rest and needed to get back to solids gradually.  

We also ordered pot stickers which were decent but nothing to write home about.

I wasn&#39;t super duper impressed with it though. Maybe my expectations were set to high? Overall, the food was pretty good and the portions were nice. The customer service was lovely. I&#39;d come back again and try different dishes, for sure!

We ordered Drunken Noodles, Eggrolls and Massaman Curry. 

The eggrolls were pretty good. Crunchy and big. They were also more seasoned and filled with a mixture of veggies than overrun with cabbage or rice sticks/glass noodles as one so often finds at these kinds of places. 

I ordered my noodles with egg added, but it wasn&#39;t stir-fried in it, but came scrambled on the side. I&#39;d never had fresh noodles quite so thick. I don&#39;t know how I felt about them over all, but they weren&#39;t bad or anything. The dish had a nice smokey flavor. I got the Drunken Noodles With Veggies version and it included tomato, my BF got this noodle dish with chicken and his had no tomato. So if you&#39;re looking for &#34;that kind&#34; of pad kee mao, ask for them to add it to your dish. 

The massaman curry was ordered at a spice level of 2 but was oddly the hottest thing on the table. Must have been a random kitchen mix up. I was also unmoved by the curry flavor. It was a little thicker sauce and duller than what I prefer. However my bf seemed to enjoy it a lot. He&#39;s never been to the thai place that makes my fave massaman though, so, he didn&#39;t know what he was missing. 

The customer service for this place is pretty awesome. We were helped kindly and quickly. The inside isn&#39;t cute or festively decorated. But it has tables to sit at and was clean."

My only complaints would be that they could stand to offer spicier options. Their hottest option, 5 stars, is spicy, but not &#34;Thai&#34; spicy. And the restaurant is very small, so it can feel cramped. I utilize their pickup service often because of this.

Overall the minor nitpicks I have are far outweighed by the quality of food and the graciousness and friendliness of the staff."

I am not a fan of Thai food typically but have found that everything on their menu is prepared with spices and flavors beyond what you would normally expect.

We order their Pad Thai with either chicken or shrimp and mix it up with a different side.  Their Pla Chue Chee and Thai Supreme are excellent options.  If this is your first time in the restaurant, but you are familiar with Thai food, order a &#34;level 3&#34; spicy.  Anything above a 3 can leave a mark.

My husband ordered their drunken noodles with tofu. It is prepared using their homemade noodles. It is so damn tasty I would have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The noodles has some nice smoky taste. 
I had their red curry with coconut milk and vegetables served with rice. They ask for your spice level preference, which is a good thing. The curry was amazing with many different vegetables giving out so many different bursts of flavors.

Like every other reviewer has said, the food is excellant. Also, there are five different levels of heat, or spice, for your food. When ordering, the waitress advised me that spice level 4 may be too much, and that if the level 3 wasn&#39;t spicy enough, she&#39;d add more. I got the green curry dish with shrimp and it was amazing. I did end up adding a bit more spice, which the waitress brought to the table so I could do it myself. This was a nice touch. 

Dancing Noodle&#39;s spices are the real deal: they are authentic, ground Thai spices. Other Thai restaurants I have been to will use habanero, so it was exciting to see for myself how legit Dancing Noodle is. 

My boyfriend had the red curry with level 4 spice, and loved his dish. The level 4 heat had him red in the face, which is how he likes it.

The Pad Thai is real-deal fresh and tasty. The egg rolls are almost to large to be believed. The filling of the egg rolls is crazy good and the crunch on their rolls is probably the best ever.

The spice chart runs 1-5. 
1 is,  you must have never visited Thailand so we will not scare you off. 
2 is, oh, you have been to Thailand and you had something you thought was spicy.
3 is, you have survived a real Thai dish from the streets of Bangkok, enjoy.
4 is, you have a look of someone born in Asia, you can handle this.
5 is,  you have a death wish and you need to seek help immediately for your issues.

The best part of real Thai spice is that even though you are suffering, the flavor of the dish still shines through. (Your tears in some cases)

The Thai tea is just like you find in Krabi or Chang Mai. If you love Thailand and the food of that country, save the $2K on a flight and make your way into the Dancing Noodle."

The place is very small, seating for maybe 20 and there were 7 of us at 6PM on a Friday night.  That was a mistake!  But we waited. There were only two ladies it seemed working, one serving and another cooking up a storm and it was packed plus they were serving take out on top, but the smells were heavenly so we waited for quite awhile for room.

I went for my traditional favorite, Penang Curry, my wife and daughter for Pad Thai.  The food was phenomenal!  I can&#39;t eat much as I had bariatric surgery earlier in the year so what I can eat I want to be superb.

RACISM is a part of Challengers Bar &amp; Grill daily business....Challengers is clearly not looking to make a difference after POOR and RACIST service....but...they are without question looking to make a dollar after providing RACIST and UNPROFESSIONAL service.
 There are complaints of RACISM...HORRIBLE food AND POOR service that date back as far as 2013 at Challengers. There are multiple reveiws in 2014 that include complaints of RACISM and POOR service at Challengers. There are multiple reveiws in 2015 from DISSATISFIED customers that share the same experience of RACISM and VIOLENCE towards patrons from Challengers management. That RACIST sentiment.....POOR service...and HORRIBLE food quality echos many opinions in 2016......especially from Challengers management.

Having African Americans on staff does not excuse RACISM from your business.

EVERY person of color AND especially Black people should NOT spend ANY money at Challengers....reviews should be left on FB and Yelp.....ALL your friends...family...neighbors...coworkers should know NOT to patronize a RACIST....HORRIBLY run establishment."

I wish I could leave a better review, honestly. The problem is the customer service and the cleanliness. I&#39;ve been here a lot, and every time I come here the service is almost nonexistent. Trying to sit at a table means waiting an hour for someone to take your order - and good luck getting drink refills. That being said, it can get crowded and it seems powerfully understaffed. I recommend sitting at the bar because the service is much more attentive. The wait staff can come across as a little rude, and definitely ambivalent. One thing that drives me nuts is that the ice water generally tastes like a dirty rag, and I&#39;m not saying that to be mean, it really tastes like a rag. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just them exacting vengeance or if they just aren&#39;t cleaning things properly but I wish they&#39;d get that fixed.

This place is so sketch with the credit/debit card transactions!

So my total was $16.50. When I checked my checking transactions, which was officially charged on my card 4 days later, it says that I&#39;ve been charged $54.91. So then I called my bank to file a claim, and the operator of my bank did confirmed that the original charge was $16.50 and that Challengers had overcharged me. So the next day, I went to talk to the manager to see if I can get my money back faster. The manager asked for a receipt but I didn&#39;t have one because I don&#39;t really keep receipts (which I will start doing from now on). So he said that there was no prove. Then I told him that I talked to my bank and they did confirmed that I had been overcharged. So the manager said he was going to go to his office and check the transaction history of that particular day that I was there, based on my full name and last 4-digit of my card. When he finally came out of the office, he told me that my transaction was never on file and is not on their history. I told him that that doesn&#39;t make any freaking sense. Was a ghost or something? I pointed the specific table where I sat and perhaps just check the camera. Then of course.. he replied saying that they don&#39;t have a camera at the restaurant. I was like... Are you freaking kidding me..... He also said, &#34;Dude, it&#39;s only 40 freaking dollars....&#34; I looked at him and was just like, &#34;Are you freaking kidding me? Did you really just say that?&#34; 

He kept trying to push me away and have me deal with my own bank. But then after he told me that my transaction was not found, now, there is a possibility that my investigators from my bank won&#39;t be able to find any prove.. but I really hope that they are good enough and that they will. The manager told me to go in the morning to meet the owner when they open and talk to him. If the own doesn&#39;t reimburse me, I will definitely sue them, since this IS NOT the first time it has happened.

Btw, a friend of mine also experienced the same thing at this stupid place, and he was over-charged for $100 more. 

The manager is the white bartender at the bar, fyi. 

So I will go see the owner tomorrow, and of he doesn&#39;t give my money back, I will sue him, and I am not just saying that not just joking. I will legit do it. I will post another review and tell you guys what happened next after I talk to the owner. 

So again, DO NOT GO THIS PLACE!!!!"

A few days later, I checked my bank account and found out that I was charged $44 more than I was charged earlier.
I called, no one called me back. 
I called the second time, and a lady called Chris/Kris (thank you!) was really helpful and friendly to get my message to the manger/owner.

I finally get a call back from the manger/owner,and he was telling me to ask each of my friend to pay me back.

EXCUSE ME???????

First of all, they processed an UNAUTHORIZED payment without my signature, which I can technically call fraud department.
All he said was that they do not know why it happened, but the transactions were not processed, so they ended up charging my card for the entire bill WITHOUT my consent.

No one apologized once.

The only thing I&#39;d say Challenger&#39;s needs is a better web presence.  The only menu I can find online is really old, so the prices are incorrect.  They also don&#39;t list their happy hour.  Their Facebook page is just a bunch of &#34;here&#39;s where the checkpoints are&#34; which is kind of sketchy."

Beats the hell out of The Ribbery in Springfield, MA. Better wings than I can make at home and their half and half sauce is to die for.

Good bartenders and wait staff, I have never had a problem. I&#39;ve barbacked and bounced in dives, huge nightclubs, and gentleman&#39;s clubs and I know when staff suck or don&#39;t know their job. 
The employees are friendly, personable, and I&#39;m more than willing to bet they&#39;re empowered to make good decisions on the spot to mitigate problems with customers. 
Bathrooms aren&#39;t Hotel Teatro clean but are always in working order, certainly presentable, and they&#39;re never out of things like paper towels or soap: A win for your everyday bar.

This is THEE place for me to get a drink (and wings, WINGS!!!) any and every time I am in and around Aurora.

Interesting and colourful dynamic of people especially on weekend nights. Nothing to worry about, just a high energy crowd there to have a drink and forget about their problems for awhile.. what every bar and America hopes they can one day be. 
Very quiet and low key bar on early afternoons.. this place always matches my personnae.

Don&#39;t miss: Wings
Green chili cheese fries."

This place isn&#39;t &#34;flashy&#34;, it isn&#39;t &#34;hip&#34;, and it&#39;s not &#34;trendy&#34;, so if you&#39;re too focused on how the place looks, this may not be the place for you.  This is a sports bar, t.v.s everywhere, pool tables, loud people, loud music, and a big bar.  

There are a lot of tables all over the restaurant so during peak hours, it can be hard to get through.  Although there are a lot of tables, it&#39;s near impossible to find an empty one during a football game, get a friend to hold one for you, if possible.

The wings, though small, are very filling and delicious.  The wings are very inexpensive and are part of their Happy Hour special so they get even lower in price.
The rest of the items on the menu are really good too, not just their wings, and very affordable.

The staff are very friendly and they&#39;re very efficient."

I&#39;ve been here a dozen times and the service always sucks. Usually it is really busy so a little slow service is understandable. The thing is even when it&#39;s not busy the service is still terrible. Came here last Saturday Nov 1st at 9pm. There was not that many people there at all despite being a saturday night. We sat down and waited for someone to come and get our order. A male waiter finally came and took our order. A female waitress came a little after asking if we have been helped and we said yes. We still haven&#39;t got our beer a good 15 minutes later. Finally that came. Halfway through we decided to get food. We ordered through the female and from there I guess she took over serving us. We got another round of beer and we were  still waiting on our food. Then the lady came and asked if we odered food we said yes and she said OK what did you order the kitchen lost the order.  She said it really rudely and didn&#39;t even apologize like it was our fault. All we ordered was an order of 10 wings and some chili cheese fries. After 30$ on 4 beers, wings, and fries and an hour and a half of un necessary waiting we could finally leave. Everything was just in slow motion there.

The other times I came here I&#39;ve had basically the same experience, but it was busy so it was somewhat understandable.

Another thing is the food. Everyone talks about how good the wings are. I have to disagree. The wings are usually tiny. I had the fries a few times now, the chili isn&#39;t too bad, but the fries themselves are like McDonald&#39;s fries. 

Now one thing I would recommend is going during happy hour times.
 That way at least the food is decently prices, but do be prepared to wait for ever."

My boyfriend works in construction and he just got off of work, so i told him to swing by challengers to grab a drink with me before we had on home for the night.  He orders just the one drink and minutes later this man comes over and proceeds to belittle my boyfriend and mock his appearance. Like i was saying,  my boyfriend works construction which is a job that you get a little dirty.  At first we were laughing with the guy because we thought he was joking.  APPARENTLY, the lovely ladies sitting next to us, that had just walked in, decided that they asked the man to make my boyfriend leave because they don&#39;t like the way he looks.  So instead of asking the ladies,  that just walked in, to find a different location if they don&#39;t like us, because we too are paying customers, he approaches my boyfriend and says &#34;don&#39;t you think you should take a bath before you go into public?  It&#39;s embarrassing.&#34; So my boyfriend laughs it off and tells him about his line of work.  The man was on a mission though.  He looks at my boyfriend and asks him to finish his drink and leave... and quote &#34;go take a bath.&#34; Once again. .. should have saved all the problems and asked the ladies to move if they have a problem. But instead he decided to embarrass my boyfriend for wanting a drink when he got off of work. We wouldn&#39;t have even minded moving away if we were asked nicely but instead this mean guy on a power trip,  made a good man feel belittled."

We are a mixed couple &amp; our teenagers are mixed as well. The other couple are both black &amp; their kids are black too. I mention this because it comes into play.
So we all arrive while it&#39;s still day light outside. We get greeted &amp; seated right away &amp; so far so good. Then our Caucasian female waitress shows up with a tank top on showing off all her tattoos, &amp; her hair pulled back as if she just got out of bed.. GROSS! So we begin to place our drink orders &amp; we order a couple pitchers of beer &amp; tall ice teas for the kids. This is where the problem occurred. 
Some how the waitress thought we were trying to order Long Island Iced Teas, but in fact had said Tall Teas. She began to argue with us saying that she heard us order the alcoholic drinks &amp; not the soft drinks. I stated that isn&#39;t it obvious that these soft drinks are for the kids &amp; not for us. You never even asked for their ID, but you&#39;re going to bring them an alcoholic beverage?! She insisted that she was correct in hearing us order alcoholic drinks. So I said I need to talk to your manager, now please. The waitress then got all flustered &amp; turned red in the face &amp; mumbled something under her breathe. As she turned to storm away from our table we all heard her say &#39;fucking niggers&#39;. 
We were all surprised &amp; the look on all our kids faces was in disbelief!!!! We all gathered our belongings &amp; started to walk out when the manager approached us; turns out the female Caucasian manager is the owners daughter. She immediately had attitude towards us &amp; demanded that we pay for our drinks. We said that we are not paying for the alcoholic drinks that we did not order. The waitress made a mistake. While trying to explain the misunderstanding, the manager interrupted me &amp; said &#34;I don&#39;t care, &amp; I don&#39;t believe that my waitress would act &amp; say that to anyone.&#34; So at this point I just paid the manager in cash without any tip! 
We have never been back since. I called the city &amp; the state, &amp; even a lawyer. All said that there is nothing that I can do. It&#39;s my word against theirs. If this is the case, then they can treat their customers any way that they want without consequences! It seems like they practice this a lot just by reading these other reviews on here."

We bought our house a few miles away about a year ago we&#39;ve been coming here since then!  It has been a great way for us to get to know our neighbors and make some amazing new friends! The staff has been warm and welcoming from the get go, always serving up a smile and hello with my nice cold beer. Challengers&#39; bartenders and staff- you guys rock my world and treat us like family!

Beer-it&#39;s affordable, fresh tasting, plentiful and ICE COLD! (I&#39;ve been to plenty of bars where that wasn&#39;t a priority-so this is a big deal for me) They make a mighty fine jack and coke however, and the Bloody Mary&#39;s are the best I&#39;ve had. Rootbeer barrel shots on Happy hour- are tasty and cheap. This isn&#39;t a martini bar, but the bartenders know what they are doing back there. Don&#39;t ask for some bizzaro flaming appletini or you might get a look, just sayin&#39;.. you might wanna go downtown if that&#39;s your scene!

Food: The wings are some of the best in town (insider tip: if you ask for them a little on the crispy side they are even better!) The pizza is what really got me, being from Illinois, it&#39;s hard to find a place that serves THIN chicago style pizza. You heard it right- not the deep dish- but cracker thin and cut into squares. It&#39;s SO good! I&#39;ve pretty much had most everything on the menu- and it&#39;s all good.

Trivia: They have NTN Poker and NTN trivia and the &#34;trivia locals&#34; are pretty friendly once you get to know them, but it&#39;s also a friendly  competition so expect to bring your &#34;A&#34; game! They also have live trivia on Mondays and Wednesdays. Mondays is music trivia and Wednesdays is general trivia. Both are super fun and pretty competitive since you get to win bar cash and bottles of liquor. I&#39;m slowly stocking my bar this way! Huzzah!

Sports: Yeah, it&#39;s a sports bar, so expect sports. They have plenty of TV&#39;s for those of you who dig &#39;em. They also have that UFC wrestling stuff, but it gets pretty packed so I avoid going on those nights. If you dig that stuff go on ahead you can have my spot. : )"

Other than an Old Chicago and a TGIFridays, you probably have to hit up some random dive bar, and there are quite a few.  Challengers is a place to be. Typical sports bar, nothing fancy. Their food and drinks are outrageously cheap! 20 wings for like $8 you really can&#39;t find that elsewhere, and they aren&#39;t too bad actually. Their deep fried mac and cheese wedges are amazingly delicious! I know what you&#39;re thinking, bar food is bar food, but you simply must try it for yourself. As for the atmosphere here, it gets busy, crazy busy during football games. Good luck trying to find a table during peak hours.  Just simply abide by the rules and they won&#39;t give you a hard time. I&#39;ve seen quite a few incidents where patrons who couldn&#39;t handle their alcohol and being disruptive were physically escorted off the premises, but nothing too crazy. There are tons of TVs, and a large projector screen up front right where you walk in. Billiards, pinball machines, and a foosball table. You might find yourself getting schooled by one of the owners in foosball as you stand there in amazement and disarray. The guy is just that good. The staff are great, treat them with respect and they&#39;ll return the favor.

Did I mention happy hour specials run for cheap drinks?  I enjoy all the bartenders, and from what I hear the owners are former employees of America&#39;s that had a hankering for doing things right!  

The atmosphere is laid back and all around is a great place to enjoy a drink.  I&#39;m not a big fan of bar food, but every time I&#39;ve been here a plate of wings magically appears before me, granted my friends placed the order, but who&#39;s to notice a couple drums missing?

This place gets ridiculously crowded on Friday nights, the weekends and of course, whenever there&#39;s a major sporting event. 

There are a ton of TV&#39;s, a decent amount of pool tables, a nice arrangement of indoor seating and a great patio that makes you feel like you&#39;re just hanging out in your best friends backyard. 

The staff is always terrific; they&#39;re upbeat, funny, friendly and efficient - everything you&#39;d hope to find. 

The prices are average but you can&#39;t beat the cost of the wings and they have some good drink specials as well.

We always get the Bonsai wings and an order of mushrooms. They&#39;re delicious and plentiful! I&#39;ll usually also always have a margarita, which never disappoints. 

The only thing that I dislike is that a lot of people bring their kids. It&#39;s just not my thing and although during the early afternoons, it&#39;s generally calm and quiet, I would never bring my kids here. And, when I do come here, it&#39;s usually for an adult getaway and to take a break from mommy hood - I don&#39;t care for listening to other peoples children scream and cry when I&#39;m trying to enjoy a drink.

I am still paying for it as I am typing this. We ordered some hot wings fries and mac &amp; cheese fritters... I told my husband the first wing that there was something wrong with the chicken that it tasted very weird he brushed it off as saying  worry about it it&#39;s probably just their seasoning... Needless to say both of us have been having major stomach cramps and diarrhea since last night... Did I mention about the cold sweats and shivers??? I called as early as I could today when finally somebody answered they told me that no manager was available... But when one was in they would give them my message and have them call me back... It&#39;s been the most agonizing 24 hours and I have yet to hear back from Management.... I do not wish this place up on my worst enemy stay away!!!!!!

I&#39;ve been here a bunch of times and continue to go back. The wings are worth it and there are a number of sauces to choose from.

As for the pizza: if you like pepperoni, and lots of it, get the pepperoni pizza - unlike most places that put a slice of pepperoni every couple inches, Challengers literally creates a layer of pepperoni under the cheese.

There are also plenty of TVs so there aren&#39;t many bad places to sit for a game.

The bottom line: wings &amp; pizza &amp; beer &amp; more. Challengers is worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area.

Tip: Ask for half the amount of pepperoni if you want more pizza than pepperoni."

They also have a good mix in clientele and have a decent HH with .25 cent wings. I am a old school buffalo hot wing kinda of guy but the Zesty are also tasty, not a fan of the Cajun or Teriaki.

I historically love Challengers but had an experience so bad I just had to let others know in hopes they can avoid the same experience. A friend and I had been talking about going to Challengers for some wings for a month or so since we&#39;d loved them so much several years ago. The problem is that when we got there we were ignored for at least 20 minutes. I finally got the attention of who I thought was our server and she clearly felt our pain and said she&#39;d get our server. Strike one.

We were still ready to just get some wings on and live and let live... Then our 40 &#34;wings&#34; show up. Each wing was TINY. An inch long, two inches tops uniformly. The sauces were good and I thought &#34;hey the recession must be kicking in&#34; but then I see plate after plate of normal sized wings goings out to every other table! Strike Two.

Finally we both realized we were just being nice since we&#39;d independently noticed that the pitcher of &#34;Stella&#34; we ordered was almost undoubtedly MGD and certainly not Stella. The server shrugged and said &#34;well that&#39;s what I asked for&#34; and left it at that. Strike Three!

The menu is misleading at best, and fraudulent at worst.  They show the name of the bar, address, phone number, hours of operation and hours in which the happy hour exists.  Below information is a series of &#34;specials&#34; along with pricing.  None of these items appear inside the rest of the menu.  We ordered some drinks pointing at the menu and received them (they weren&#39;t bad).  We got our bill only to find the price was more than double.  The waiter said that that was the happy hour menu, I explained nowhere did it state that, he offered to get the manager.  This unkempt guy came to our table, and immediately argued with me and my table.  He said that those were happy hour prices and the same items were inside the menu.  I offered him the menu and told him to show me where any single item was inside the menu showing the &#34;true price&#34;.  He could not, items were renamed such as &#34;basket of fries&#34; to &#34;challenger&#39;s fries&#34;.  Supposedly those are the same product, so why 2 names?  Every item had a similar problem with the exception of the very bottom of the menu that was quite specific &#34;check out our happy hour wing special&#34; with no price, as well as &#34;happy hour domestic drafts for &#34; with a price.  Regardless of this confusion (which I believe deliberate, but who knows) he refused to even consider the miscommunication and said to &#34;just pay the bill dude&#34; and walked away.  I told him I would never frequent this establishment.  Two employees agreed this manager was a total jerkoff and was the &#34;owner&#39;s son&#34;.  He was very juvenile and even tried to have the last word by telling us &#34;not to come back&#34;.  He also believes that menus do not have to have the correct price and it was fully acceptable for charges to be higher and if you have a problem, you should check with your waiter how much things cost.  What a joke.

As far as the drinks, they were VERY weak.  As far as the food, the wings were good, but FAR smaller than any wings I have seen.  They were like baby chickens.  I would recommend people to find better locations, such as Old Chicago.  This place will be out of business in no time with management like this."

The best wings they have are the honey hot. When we host games at our house we stop by Challengers and pick up some to serve our friends. 
The rest of the food is bar food and nothing spectacular but ok.
We have gone in a few times on other days of the week. I prefer the weekday crowd to the weekend. The service seems to be really good on Wednesdays but when we came here on a Sunday afternoon during football season it seemed like it took forever to get a drink.

First the good:
- Food wasn&#39;t bad~  I had the ravioli soup, which is not really that soupy, but it still tasted pretty good, and the garlic toasts were awesome.  I just had to order the wings, which were pretty cheap.  The sizes were smaller than I liked but it tasted pretty good.  Can&#39;t say it&#39;s the best wings I&#39;ve ever had, but good enough for the price.  My boyfriend ordered the Reuben sandwich, he wasn&#39;t a huge fan.  I had some of his fries, it tasted good but they were kinda cold and soggy, which to me is like the worst thing that can happen to fries, so no points for the rueben.
- Flat screens.  Nice tv&#39;s with couple of channels going on.  I can see how this place is a decent sports bar.
- I can hear myself.  Sounds silly but I hate it when I can&#39;t even hear myself think at a sports bar.  This place is not too loud, but not too quiet neither.  Good volume.

Then the bad:
- Our waitress was kinda lame.  When we first walked in, she was right up front busing another table.  Didn&#39;t say hi, or tell us to help ourselves, and yes we made eye contact.  She just waited for us to read the sign ourselves to seat.  
- Lucky us, picked a table that belongs to the same waitress.   We ordered a water with lemon and coke.  Waited pretty long for those two things, and guess what&#39;s not there?  Lemon.  That&#39;s fine I&#39;ll ask again...  wait another 10 minutes before she came back to took our order.  We ordered two apps and two entrees.  Everything came at the same time. Duh.....  And while we&#39;re waiting, the table behind us got so tired of waiting for THEIR coke and water, that they just flagged down another waiter (which is, as proven later, a smart decision).  After we finished eating, we waited another like 15 minutes till she came back, so I can ask for more water and the check.  The strange thing is, it wasn&#39;t even that busy, it&#39;s 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon with no local games on.  I noticed that she&#39;ll go into the kitchen like 15 minutes at a time, so when she IS on the floor, she has a short amount of time to accomplish everything she needs to be done, hence lack of attention to her tables.
- One last thing, I don&#39;t get it, it&#39;s a bar, and I don&#39;t think these are some special soda.  But they charge $1.75 for a medium size soda (not those huge plastic cups, just the medium size), and they charge $0.75 for a refill.  Really?  You charge like $1.50 for  a beer and yet you charge $3.50 for a soda and a refill?     

There are quite a few decent bars (decent food, prices, venue) within about 3 miles radius of us.  With the crappy service and strange soda charge policy, I don&#39;t think this made our list."

Some people have mentioned the basement location as a downside, but I didn&#39;t mind. I thought the space was very cool and also (now that I&#39;m a boring mom) kid friendly. We got there almost exactly when they opened and had no problems being seated. On our way out we saw lots of families. But don&#39;t worry, cool people, there were also non-boring people! The couple seated next to us were definitely too cool for school, so you&#39;ll feel right at home!

Okonomiyaki fries are a GREAT idea, and they were definitely the best thing we had. My sister remarked that the fries were like McDonald&#39;s, and if that&#39;s not a compliment, well, I do not know what is. Kara age was good, but nothing to write home about. 

The ramen, though! So super disappointing. I had read about the spicy ramen on the 100 best dishes list in the Westword, so I had high expectations. NOPE. Honestly tasted like they&#39;d just kind of dunked the (average) kimchi in the broth and left it there for a minute. The noodles were perfect, though. My husband&#39;s tonkatsu ramen was similarly rather tasteless, and he didn&#39;t even like his noodles, which were a different kind than mine. He said the pork belly was underdone, as well. 

I won&#39;t be back, unfortunately. There are so many other places to try and frankly, we live near a 100% excellent Japanese/ramen restaurant (Sakana), so there&#39;s no point making a special trip to an area with SUPER ANNOYING parking."

I&#39;d rate it from best to least favorable: tonkatsu, shoyu, and spicy miso. I had the spicy miso but I had to take mine to-go (and I usually never have leftovers at ramen places).

Veggie ramen was good, but curry flavored which wasn&#39;t what I wanted. Would be awesome if they had a savory, regular flavor ramen (a spicy option would also be excellent). We also tried the fries with mayo, bonito flakes and other seasonings. They were pretty good! I would come back...I think. The service was pretty good, too. Just wish they had a different veggie ramen!"

Spicy miso ramen was very disappointing. Broth - the penultimate element in ramen was insipid and pasty - like an afterthought. Noodles were limp, not springy. Kimchee, which I love, was a strange and unwelcome addition here.

I&#39;ve been pretty disappointed in Denver&#39;s ramen scene. Add this place to the long list of mediocre ramen joints here."

Came here for lunch on the later side...it was busy but started clearing out soon after we were seated. We just missed the rush.

The atmosphere is very cool; it&#39;s located in a renovated warehouse next (and attached) to several other restaurants.....and a weed shop right next door (called Sweet Leaf, I believe). So, don&#39;t be surprised if you smell pot as you descend the staircase to the lower lever where Osaka Ramen is. Enjoy. 

Upon entering, there&#39;s super friendly staff and a really nice, clean restaurant with many delicious smells coming from the kitchen.

We asked for some recommendations of our server...so we went (mostly) with what she mentioned:

Appetizers:
-Green beans - served in a sweet and savory sauce covered in sesame seeds. Absolutely delicious.
-Oysters - fried and served with a mayo sauce and a few other ingredients (some kind of slaw and other shredded veggies) on a piece of lettuce. These were also excellent! Be warned...they&#39;re messy. I was informed to eat them like a taco...which I did...but I managed to get sauce all over my face; I was a disaster. Ask for a few extra napkins.

Lunch:
-Korean beef bento box - solid reviews - really nice portions of everything.
-I had the chicken ramen - loved it. Shredded chicken with a soft boiled egg, garlic spinach, piles of ramen noodles and a couple of pieces of seaweed. I couldn&#39;t finish it.

Dessert:
-Mochi donuts served with salted butter. OMG....these were savory, sweet and really unique...can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had the same flavor experience before.

Prices are completely reasonable and again....service was great.

We really enjoyed our experience here. Ramen in Denver!!"

Spicy Miso Ramen and Shoyu Ramen:
Really good broth flavor, especially for the Shoyu Ramen.
However, I was not a fan of the actual ramen noodles. They were a tiny bit too chewy/sticky for me.

Oyster appetizer: A lot of batter, and sauces and extra stuff. Not enough actual oysters."

Go early to avoid a long wait. As you walk in, try not to be dissuaded by the strong smell of marijuana from the dispensary next door - the smell is only strong when you first enter the restaurant and isn&#39;t an issue once you get to the hostess stand downstairs. At first I was put off by their very limited vegetarian ramen options but the waitress highly recommended the (one and only) veggie ramen so I gave it a shot. It had a green curry broth and mushrooms and was so delicious that I&#39;ve been dreaming of it ever since. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fried oyster appetizer but others at my table loved it. The other ramen dishes got mixed reviews from my friends. The mochi doughnut dessert is another must have although you might consider skipping dessert here to grab some ice cream at the Central Market just a few blocks away.

The decor is unique but simple, with creative murals and signs about the restaurant, and gives off a inviting feel once you walk in. The entrance is also heated during the winter, which is especially nice if you&#39;re fighting off the cold air of a chilly night. 

My group was seated immediately and the waitress was attentive and knowledgeable about our various questions about the menu. Still on our quest for the best ramen in town, we all decided on various ramen specials on the menu: spicy miso, shoyu, and the special of the night: blacked fish ramen. We also ordered some onigiri to keep us occupied before the main dishes arrived. The ume (pickled plum) was exceptionally tasty! 

Once the ramen was served, I was excited about the presentation and portion size, but the flavor was slightly lacking (my bowl was the spicy miso). I had to add some extra spices to liven up the broth, but loved the texture of the noodles and the vegetables! Similar experiences were expressed by the rest of the table. 

We ended our meal with the mochi donuts, which was a menu item that I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere, and was delicious. Perfectly crispy with warm butter and reminiscent of churros. 

At $14 a bowl, it&#39;s decently priced, but I will have to try more of their menu to get a better idea of the quality of their ramen."

I&#39;ve been to Osaka twice now, the first time was slightly disappointing but the second time more than made up for it. We ordered the green bean appetizer both times - super yummy both times. 
The first time I came to Osaka, I got the Spicy ramen because the ingredient list was intriguing but I didn&#39;t care for the flavor of everything in the same bowl. Boyfriend and sister got the Shoyu ramen and liked it. 
The second time I came to Osaka, I got the Tonkotstu ramen and loved it. Writing this review is making me crave it again...my only negative is that the pork belly was slightly well done and hard to bite through without grabbing the piece of meat one the other side for leverage. Flavor was spot on though! My boyfriend got the special (green chili and chorizo in a pork and fish broth with pork belly) and he loved it.

Will definitely go back to try more :)"

We&#39;ve been coming to Denver from the Bay Area for the last 7 years to visit our daughter and grandkids and have tried most of the ramen places here.

On our first visit we asked if they had any gluten items on their menu for my wife. The assistant manager came out to our table and told her
what they could make for her. She also brought out a box to show my wife the ingredients that were going into her dish. Great personal attention -- service and ambiance were great as well.

My Tonkatsu Ramen was excellent! Pork belly topped off the tasty broth and the &#34;soft poached egg&#34; was perfect. I really enjoyed  the soft poached egg  more than the cold hard eggs that most ramen places offer.  The noodles in my wife&#39;s chicken ramen was substituted with rice noodles, which were just as delicious. Each bowl came with a hearty amount of noodles, along with the condiments of seaweed, egg, scallions, and greens.

I have put Osaka Ramen as #3 on my all time 40 ramen places in the U.S.
Number #1 is Momofuku, New York / #2 is Lucky Belly, Honolulu."

And second many people don&#39;t like fishy ramen, and this place is one that IS NOT fish based. Sure you get the fish cakes and seaweed, but the ramen itself doesn&#39;t have a fishy taste. I think that&#39;s a good thing....

There is nothing wrong with this place, it is very good in its own right. The oysters I thought we good. I never had heard of the word ongiri I must&#39;ve been living under a rock when I lived in Japan, however all it is is a triangle rice ball with whatever choice of protein in the middle. If you have ever been to Japan it is almost identical to any rice ball that you pick up in any Lawson, Or family mart. I got he shoyu ramen. It was not bad and it&#39;s a typical ramen you could find from a mediocre ramen place in japan, minus the chunks of pulled pork. It&#39;s the most similar to the soy based ramens.

***fore warning **  if you have ever been stationed on Okinawa and have ever been to the hot ramen places there, such as Arashis. This place doesn&#39;t even begin to touch it as far as ramen goes. 

This is good ramen no doubt, just definitely not the best. As far as for being the best in Denver I can&#39;t give an opinion since this is the only ramen I l had in Denver.

On a Related note if you ever make it to Okinawa, Japan, got to Arashi for ramen.. It will change your life... And potentially ruin any ramen stateside for you ever again... Happy hunting ramanians"

Food tasted good for the wrong reasons, RAMEN (the reason you&#39;re there in the first place ) was blah,  and yet the ambiance has you thinking you found the most amazing restaurant in Denver.

My hubby and I stopped in on a Monday night, before an improv show, and the place was surprisingly busy. We sat at the bar facing the open kitchen, which was interesting but also may have made things worse. The cooks/chefs appeared as though they were just going through the motions; cook by numbers if you will. They did not acknowledge us once or look to see if we were enjoying ourselves.I love ramen so much that i feel those lucky enough to be preparing it should take it seriously.

We ordered the bacon fried rice to start, and while it was delicious, in no way did it taste like fried rice. The bacon was cut very thick and had a smoky flavor to it; the texture of the rice was closer to a risotto, but again very flavorful. We then ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen to share and I was SO dissapointed. This seems to be a common issue with their ramen in that the pork belly is not only sliced incorrectly but also over-cooked, the broth lacks flavor and the noodles are also cooked incorrectly creating a starchy, off putting consistency. Considering they are supposed to specialize in ramen, they completely missed the mark. I have had both worse ramen and much better ramen in Denver, so I&#39;d say go here if you are in the area but do not go out of your way."

I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and it was quite good. The noodles were cooked well but I might order extra veggies next time as they were not very generous with those. The portion was large, I took some home for lunch the following day.

Osaka Ramen in the RINO is a great little Japanese restaurant downstairs below Park Burger off Walnut. Claire C and I met for lunch on a cold winter&#39;s day and as we walked up were both worried the place would be packed. Lucky for us everyone was going to Park Burger while we snuck in the door to go into the basement. The place really feels like it could be in Japan. its tiny with a cute decor, it looks like something out of Jiro Dreams of Sushi. 

Claire got the Spicy Miso and I got the Tonkatsu ramen. Both were very good although I think the broth from the Spicy Miso was a little bit better. The Tonkatsu had wonderful pork belly and the egg was cooked so well. Usually the egg kind of grosses me out in Ramen but this was just decadent. So good. Soft and rich. Wow I need to learn how to do that at home!

Three friends and I checked it out for the first time on a cold winter&#39;s night, and, sadly, were let down by it.  

We all got a bowl of Ramen, the Salmon for myself, and while I enjoyed it, I think a bowl of Ramen and a beer for $21 is simply overpriced.  It needs to be truly a spectacle if I&#39;d return.

Of course, I didn&#39;t have high expectations because I heard from a lot of my die hard ramen friends that they did not enjoy it. Maybe because my expectations were low that I actually enjoyed myself more than I thought I would.

First, we went because my friend was trying to go through this Buzzfeed (I think) list of cheap good eats in Denver. One of them was for Osaka, of course it was not for the ramen but for the Kara Age. I can say it was good and juicy but I had better at Katsu Ramen and a more affordable version at Kiki&#39;s. 

The ramen was not bad, but not great. The flavor had more of a depth to it, as in, you had to keep eating it for the flavor to really stand out. Does it mean it was bland? Not necessarily. I thought the Tonkotsu Ramen definitely had more flavor than the curry ramen, which to me was certainly bland. And in a battle between having a place like Tokio over salt my ramen or having a place like Osaka under salt my ramen, I&#39;d go with under salt any day.

I do have to say, I&#39;m not saying Osaka impressed me and the next time I have a ramen craving, I will still probably go to Uncle, but Osaka was not the worst I&#39;ve ever had.

Note: I decided to try the Ume Onigiri since Brett had said it was rare to come by and it is not suitable for my taste pallet and their &#34;homemade&#34; spam....I&#39;d much prefer the real &#34;fake&#34; stuff.  The mochi donuts were excellent though! Just a little too much for three people."

Ryan K. and I went to Osaka Ramen on a Friday evening, which was probably our first mistake: busy restaurant and a rather pretentious crowd. Luckily, we did not have to wait long. 

The environment is reminiscient of my time in Tokyo: lots of people, noise, hustle bustle. Sign placards written in hiragana/katakana are placed across from the entrance of food items that are actually not available on the menu: probably merely there for decoration. 

Service was quick and efficient: lots of servers on hand to make sure we had full glasses of water.

But the two stars really comes down to the food and the presentation, which is the most important part of any Yelp review, right?

We ordered:

- 2 onigiri: ume and spam. Great appetizer with just enough of the ume/spam inside the rice ball to maintain a balanced yet rich flavor. This was probably the BEST part of the meal....

- Tonkatsu ramen: Ryan K. received a huge piece of mostly-fatty pork that was mostly inedible. The broth was bland. 

- Shoyu ramen: I was appalled by the laziness in presentation. My pork was also a huge chunk of meat (but luckily not super-fatty). The fact that ramen is eaten with a soup spoon and chopsticks made the experience quite cumbersome trying to chew the meat into smaller pieces. The bok choi (vegetable) that was in my bowl was also not cut up.

The fact that we both received bowls of ramen with huge chunks of meat and vegetables just showed laziness/lack of preparation. Osaka Ramen is already pretty popular/busy, so .... the kitchen should know to prepare everything in advance! 

Don&#39;t get me wrong: for the price of $14 per bowl, the big chunk of meat is a good deal, but I believe most people don&#39;t want to sit there tearing apart their meat like a barbarian. This takes away from the experience of enjoying the meal!

The only redeeming factor of our entrees was the fact that the ramen had a chewy yet firm texture. 

At one point, we saw Jeff Osaka walking around the restaurant and Ryan K. observed that Jeff had a concerned look on his face. 

I think Osaka Ramen has SO MUCH potential. We want to come back in several more months to see if the quality has improved."

The verdict: decent ramen, although not what I had expected.  I like Shoyu and normally order it wherever I get ramen.  I am going to say that their take on it is just different; not bad, but different.  The broth was good and the pork was shredded.  I like my usual ramen with the sliced pork and salty, savory broth.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer which was melt-in-your mouth delicious.  The ambience was pretty cool-a basement restaurant with simple, chic paint scheme.  The wait staff was very cool.

I don&#39;t care what language they speak, as long as they are cooking up some great food.  The owner was also there working the pass (on the night of the soft opening of his new restaurant).

Ok, the food...  is it truly authentic?  I have no idea, and I don&#39;t care.  It was delicious, made from scratch and creative.  We tried the panko fried oysters, shishito peppers, house made spam onigiri (maybe a little too much rice and not enough spam on this one), salmon miso ramen and pork belly ramen (kind of which the pork belly was broiled/grilled a little for a bit of crispness, it was a little squishy... but otherwise delicious).  Also, a nice little condiment tray to spice things up!

There was also a nice selection of sake and Japanese beers on the menu.

That was something I wouldn&#39;t have ordered on my own but the girlfriend I was with had been before and said it was a must-have, and I&#39;m very glad she did! Including that in the review so you don&#39;t miss out on this dish because it&#39;s something you wouldn&#39;t have ordered on your own, also. Be aware, it is very rich and somewhat filling, so come here with an appetite so you can fully experience it!

Next up, ramen: absolutely delicious, can&#39;t be beat. I got the Shio which was stuffed with vegetables and super tender pork, as well as a soft-boiled egg which was genuinely soft boiled and mixable into the bowl. I will probably come again and again because the taste was so phenomenal. Also, they provide all of the various condiments (chili powder, sriracha, chili oil, etc.) to make the ramen the flavor you really want, which I think is amazing as most ramen places are a little pretentious on this front, believing that their recipes shouldn&#39;t require intervention. If I want my eyes to be watering because it&#39;s so spicy, let me! And Osaka does. 

The downfall of this place are the prices. Of course I don&#39;t mind paying for a nice dinner out, but this place has a very casual vibe to it. Industrial looking, in a basement, never packed, servers wear a t-shirt with the logo on it. It doesn&#39;t have the more formal or just exceptional feeling, and feels like a place you would just pop in to grab a quick dinner with a friend (which for us, it was), not necessarily somewhere you would get done up for and go to on a Friday night. Because of that, the prices of bowls ($14) are a bit much, especially compared with its most similar ramen joint Tengu ($10). Also, the prices of the wine are what really got me squirming a bit. I like to have anywhere from 1-3 glasses of wine with dinner, especially if I&#39;m with my girlfriends, but the only Chardonnay option here was $11 a glass. I understand having nice wine, but there should be an option for half that price, otherwise your dinner just went from casual to $50+ for just yourself. There were less steeply priced wines, but I&#39;m a Chardy girl.

Regardless, I will probably convert this to my new ramen place, because the ramen really was that good. I will have to watch my drinking intake (which is my least favorite thing to do), but it&#39;s so good my leftovers didn&#39;t even make it until the morning, so we&#39;ll call it even."

My 5 yr old had the children&#39;s ramen which is just ramen in chicken broth. Was surprised when her bowl was just as big as ours, which she ate in its entirety. Our portions were great. Just the right amount of seaweed and poached egg. We had the dessert donut which my husband loved and I thought was ok, but that was just a matter of preference.

The sesame seed on them adds that perfect flavor and crunch to them. The French fries are made with Japanese mayo and seasoned well. Finally, the peppers were delicious.

Service was... Friendly, but cold. Like a &#34;I&#39;m better than you, why are you eating here?&#34; feel - This may or may not have had anything to do with some of the friends I was dining with, as they were industry people. Though, I usually have found that industry is more friendly to industry...

The drinks were... From a bottle, so I can&#39;t really fault them for any of that. No mixing, no recipes, just straight into a glass from another glass container.

The atmosphere... The ambiance... Was... Industrial? Almost chic, but not quite there as all the metal and concrete that went around the room were just very... gloomy...

The noodles and soup weren&#39;t really bad - Far more deserving of a 2 star, if this review was based on the noodles only, but there was nothing very exceptional about them. The broth was quite light, and timid, the noodles were soft cooked - I prefer a more al dente texture.  At least it had a soft egg in it, which, again I felt was a little under cooked for my poached-egg-in-ramen preference.

The kaarage was actually pretty good though."

I have noticed some negative reviews about this place, so allow me to help you determine if you should try Osaka Ramen:

1. Are you obsessed with authenticity? You may not be pleased with the level of &#34;authenticity&#34; here. You see, the chefs of the world don&#39;t necessarily want to prepare food exactly the way your host mom made it when you did study abroad in college. Yes, sometimes culinary professionals want to do things their own way, whatever their reasons may be. That does not mean that you have a right to denigrate their food for not being traditional. Insisting that the cuisines of foreign nations be forever prepared &#34;authentically&#34; so that you can continue viewing the rest of the world as an abstract idea unburdened by the realities of constantly-shifting demographics and zeitgeists doesn&#39;t make you &#34;cultured.&#34; It makes you ignorant and a little racist.

2. Are you ordering takeout from a full-service restaurant? That&#39;s probably not a great idea. It takes a special kind of window-licker to order Ramen or Kara Age stuffed into carry-out containers so it can be driven to Highlands Ranch or wherever. Noodles don&#39;t hold well in hot liquid, little buddy. Did you think, for a moment, that perhaps not all &#34;Asian&#34; food comes in little white cartons with metal carrying handles and served with fortune cookies? If you order take-out from a dine-in restaurant, don&#39;t whine when it&#39;s cold and soggy 45 minutes later. That&#39;s on you.

3. Do you think $14 for an entree is too much? May I suggest Noodles and Company at Colorado Mills? They even have free parking! Looking for a prepared-to-order meal in an eclectic, high-demand urban neighborhood? That&#39;s going to cost a bit more. It costs money to cook food, especially to cook it &#34;to order.&#34; The people who make it and the people who serve it don&#39;t exist on your positive opinions of the establishment you&#39;ve graced with your presence. Small, independent restaurants can&#39;t take advantage of massive economies of scale or the highly structured processes that make chain restaurants profitable at low prices. If you don&#39;t feel comfortable spending over $10 for an entree, there are alternatives available.

If you like to eat delicious, fresh, creative and reasonably-priced food, I highly recommend you try Osaka Ramen."

Both had good flavors and the noodles were cooked right. I&#39;m a huge fan of Ramen in general so when I heard about  Osaka, I was really excited. Unfortunately,. My husband and I thought the broth was too salty.  
I think Sushi Den&#39;s Ramen is better (on their good days) but Osaka is better than Uncles, Kikis, &amp; Oshima. I have yet to find a good Ramen place in Denver."
osaka-ramen-denver,Brett S.,n4IyiL5Nf-GLhETjdp-H6Q,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,1,229,117,EHp934CevlpgsmZO8_9vrw,2.0,2015-05-12,"This hurts me as much as it hurts you, Osaka Ramen.

I have been waiting for this restaurant for a good long time. I was there when 100 bowls were cooked for charity last year and I watched as their planned opening date slipped by. Sure, a few other ramen places popped up in the meantime, but none were helmed by a respected local chef whose last name was shared by one of Japan&#39;s most renowned culinary cities. And Denver still needed its &#34;One True Ramen,&#34; an establishment to let Denver natives know just what they&#39;re missing from the west coast.

And we still do.

Osaka Ramen fits in well with the hip RiNo vibe, sporting an unassuming entrance that opens directly to a downward staircase. The restaurant is understated and utilitarian, though the Japan-esque city silhouette along the walls is a nice touch. They had plenty of staff for the soft Saturday opening and operations seems pretty smooth.

My three friends and I ordered a few appetizers, namely the shishito peppers, okonomoyaki fries, and karaage. All three were okay without being too exceptional. I will say it&#39;s an unusual pleasure that ANY place in Denver would have shishito (I used to live in Japan and they were always a BBQ staple there), but they are priced like the luxury they are.

Really, though, we were there for the ramen, and made sure there was variety through our orders: Shio, spicy miso, and tonkotsu. The bowls all came at the same time and we went through a round of shared broth sampling before tucking in.

The broth of all three bowls lacked kick and was too watery. I usually try several spoonfuls before resorting to the shichimi and other available spices, but all four of us were grasping for the condiments after just the first bite.

For tonkotsu, there is one large piece of pork curled in the center of the bowl to replace the usual thinly sliced chashu. I get that they want to try something new, but this thing is a huge hassle to eat. Chashu is usually thin and tender, so you can easily tear up chunks to eat with spoonfuls. Worst-case scenario, one slice can usually be dealt with in one bite. None of this is true for the massive slice of fried pork in Osaka&#39;s ramen, a piece too large to eat in a single bite and too tough to simply separate with chopsticks. You&#39;re left dragging the huge chunk of meat up to your mouth and holding it with chopsticks while you tear away a piece with your teeth, and not without difficulty. Worst of all, the pay-off is hardly even there. The flavor is dull and smokey, far too subtle to stand out in what should be a bowl of potent soup.

Finally, the noodles are just average. Not the springiness I&#39;ve come to love and without any other notable features. 

I wish I could say mine was a singular experience, but the others at the table were universally disappointed.

Very weirdly, the only small saving grace of the experience was a last-second onigiri order. I noticed they have ume onigiri on the menu, another rare item. It&#39;s a sour plum (emphasis on SOUR) that for many is an acquired taste, but pairs well with good rice. We tore it up so all of us could have a sample and discovered that this exploded onigiri was our favorite item of the evening.

Will I go back? I don&#39;t think so. If I did, it wouldn&#39;t be for the ramen, at least. 

Denver&#39;s &#34;One True Ramen&#34; remains an elusive dream."

Walking into the basement this place has a very New York feel to it. The concrete, the long wall lined with tables, the open facing kitchen. 

Stopping in this place is packed with 20 and 30-something friends, couples, &amp; groups at 7pm on a Wednesday so I saddled myself up to the bar and grabbed a seat. Service here was prompt. The hostess handed me the menus and the bartender came over and got my drink order going right away. I ordered a beer as it was much more reasonable than a glass of wine. I believe a glass started at $8 while a Great Divide Collette was a mere $4.

I ended up ordering the shoyu ramen after asking the woman next to me what she was having and the bartender for his recommendations. Food came quick!! The broth was very flavorful and salty just as the server said it would be. The egg was poached perfectly. I loved the huge portions of pork that were in the bowl and were super flavorful, moist and easy to eat. 

Will definitely come back and try more. Would love to branch out and try a Bento box on my next visit. They looked intriguing!"

Chelsey was spot on and never missed a beat. It certainly didn&#39;t feel like it was the first official day of being open.  

Hot Tip - there is complimentary valet parking for some of the businesses on this block. It&#39;s well worth the tip to not have to try and find parking.  Seriously, who wants to drive around looking for a parking spot when they could already be inside eating ramen.

We arrived a bit after 5 pm and didn&#39;t have a problem getting a table. By 6:30 the place was hopping and when we were leaving around 6:50 people were waiting to get in.  

Our first world problem of the meal was that there were so many things that we wanted to try however, didn&#39;t. We decided to leave some for when we return; although we did make a pretty good dent. We ordered 2 apps, 2 bowls of ramen, and two desserts.

Apps consisted of Chicken Kara Age and Okonomiyaki Fries. Chicken Kara Age is basically yummy friend chicken. After reading the Thrillist article that came out yesterday of the best places to eat fried chicken, and Osaka Ramen being on the list, this went right to the top of our ordering list. It was good, we felt it could have used use a minute or two in the fryer to get it a touch more crunch. Okonomiyaki Fries were a new experience for me. It had a cream sauce drizzled over the fries and then tops with dried tuna (or fish) flakes. It was an entirely new fry experience. One I would highly recommend, unless you don&#39;t like the taste of fish, then I would say pass this one over.

Ramen - I ordered the Shoyu and Cyn order the Tonkotsu. The Shoyu was lovely and delightful. The noodles were perfectly chewy and not soggy at all. After reading some of the other reviews I was afraid that the broth was going to be too salty, for me it wasn&#39;t and I was pleasantly surprised.  I adored the whole soft boiled egg that was included. Watching the yellow yolk running into the broth was an experience all by itself. At the end I tried the Tonkotsu broth and I wasn&#39;t fan, but hey that&#39;s exactly why there are different selections - something to please everyone.

Desserts - My favorite part of the meal in this instance. I&#39;m typically not a dessert person however after reading so much about the donuts these were a must order.  We opted for the Tea Cake and the My Wife&#39;s Donuts. The Tea Cake was delicious and served with Earl Gray Ice Cream. The Cake and Ice Cream were the perfect pairing and complimented each other nicely. The donuts were the star of the show for me. They are doughy on the outside and then filled with sweet and creamy goodness.  It&#39;s served with a side of salted butter. Taking a bit of the butter and adding to the donut at first seemed weird to me.  Trust me just do it; the crunch of the salt and creaminess of the butter so hand-in-hand with the sweetness of the doughnut.  

I know others have reported spending an ungodly amount of money for two people; our bill came to $59 and change for two apps, two bowls of ramen and two desserts. We did not drink any booze and opted for dessert instead."

My second time tonight, I had the beef bento. The meat was spot on, cooked perfectly and tastes delicious. I&#39;ve tried two desserts so far. My favorite are the donuts they are delicious.

The donuts are basically fried mochi with butter.  Amazing.

The fries are a huge portion and extremely tasty.

I think the Kara Age Chicken was probably the best item we ordered...so good.

The ramen that the gf ordered looked and tasted really good as well.

Had been highly anticipating their opening since I moved to Denver as I have been looking for a go-to ramen joint since leaving the SF Bay area.  While cute and trendy, and sure to become a new &#34;it&#34; place in town, I found the broth a tad too salty for my palate.  I&#39;ll give &#39;em another try when they open in Cherry Creek, but until then, the search continues.

Food/Beverages: Ordered tonkotsu ramen, shoyu ramen, and an appetizer (fries).  
- The appetizer came out beautifully - think agedashi tofu but with a bed of delicious fries. 
- Now, onto the main course: the ramen.  The shoyu has a good soy sauce flavor (as expected), but it was difficult to finish the broth given the high salt content (my bf usually finishes broth anywhere we go, but he couldn&#39;t this time :( and I kept needing water refills).  The noodles were decent (could be a little chewier), and I appreciated the good veggies.  The soft egg was done very well; tender and just the right amount of runniness.    The tonkatsu (the all-time staple ramen) was less salty (but still too salty) and the pork belly was a good sized piece with a decent hint of garlic in the undertones.  Could have used more vegetables, to help round out the flavors.

Ambiance: Cute place that is downstairs in the RiNo district.  Parking can be kind of a pain in the area, but their FB site mentions free valet parking now, so that could be helpful.  There&#39;s an open, long table area for larger parties and smaller tables as well.  The decor is lovely with hidden gems such as godzilla in the skyline.

Service: Overall, attentive and speedy.  However, they did get our check wrong when we asked to split the bill a certain way, but that&#39;s okay - it was their first day, and I&#39;m sure it will get better.

Pricing: $14 for a bowl of ramen. $6 for appetizers. $7 for desserts.  Average pricing for Denver, but still tad pricey to what I&#39;m used to for ramen.

Hours: For now, limited evening hours."

I thought maybe going opening week during the week a little early might mean little/no wait..but it was still about 30-40min. No worries though since Park Burger is next door for a beer. Once seated the service was fantastic. The staff really knows their stuff and how to explain it to ramen newbs (my friend that joined me). The interior is very simple and reminded me of a few ramen shops I went to in Japan.

For starters we ordered the OKONOMIYAKI Fries..very good and decent sized portion to share. Then the most important moment..choosing my ramen. I was having a tough time deciding but I went with the spicy miso..and it was goooood. Its a toss up between Tengu&#39;s curry ramen and this spicy miso. Very different but both so good. My friend got the Shoyu..it was also really good especially the mushrooms in it.

I know the ramen is the main show here (rightfully so) but the tea cake dessert with earl grey tea ice cream blew my mind. Seriously. I want to buy gallons of that ice cream..its so damn good!!

I ordered the chasu onigiri and tonkatsu. I had problems with the onigiri, as the rice had dampened the seaweed substantially by the time it got to me, and it was served warm, not quite the right style for the dish. 

I had issue with the tonkatsu, as even my incisors had trouble chewing through what should be a tender pork belly. It took some persistent sideways &#34;cutting&#34; with them. The toughest meat I&#39;ve had in years. The broth was not especially interesting, but the egg was well poached.

The establishment did throw in free donuts, which were quite nice, but, still, I cannot recommend Osaka Ramen. I&#39;ve been in Denver a few years and know there are way better places to spend $20 on a meal."

The entrance and location reminds me of being in Tokyo as well. Tokyo has restaurants and shops underground that you access via a staircase from street level all over! 

THE RAMEN: 
I order Tonkatsu every time. 

The broth - super rich, flavorful and creamy. theres not actual cream in this broth, thats just from all the juicy pork goodness! Seasoned to perfection. 

(I really don&#39;t understand reviews that say the broth is bland. I can barely eat it after awhile because its SO RICH. My leftovers formed a solid paste. If this is &#34;bland&#34;, I&#39;d like to taste what they consider &#34;flavorful&#34; broth)

Noodles - firm (but not hard). Just the way I like it. 

Pork Belly - what do I really need to say? Heavenly and amazing

Egg - A PERFECT RUNNY SOFT POACHED EGG. The only way it should be. 

Veggies/garnish - Everything about this ramen is traditional, including the veggies and garnish.
This is literally exactly how they served/prepared Ramen in Japan.

I WISH I COULD COMMENT ON OTHER REVIEWS!!! 
(This is my reply to to 2.0 star rating 5/21/2015 by Helene K.)

Helene gave a poor review of Tonkatsu ramen, with reasons being:

- Bland broth (If this is &#34;bland&#34;, I&#39;d like to taste what she considers &#34;flavorful&#34; broth)

- FATTY INEDIBLE MEAT. da fuq?!?! You ordered PORK BELLY, which is pig stomach aka BACON. Its literally just pork fat. What the f*ck did you expect??

She goes on to say that the chunks of meat were too large was appalled by lazy presentation.

- Meat? Too large? I don&#39;t understand the meaning of these words in the same sentence. 

- Can&#39;t cut your meat with chopsticks? literally billions of people eat with these everyday. Be a little more adventurous/open minded when eating ethnic food. Also you&#39;re in America, ask your waiter for a knife and fork. 

 - I am appalled that Helene is appalled by the lazy presentation. I am appalled by her review."

Well, workers are nice and it is actually a cool place. 

Their karaage (Japanese fried ck) was pretty good. But ramen? Unfortunately, It is not traditional. I wouldn&#39;t mind spending $15 for good ramen like other restaurant in downtown has, but not here. Poached egg in ramen? I don&#39;t think so. It should be marinaded boiled egg. Their shoyu ramen which my wife ordered was just like Udon, not ramen. Tonkotsu ramen broth did not have much taste, it was just salty.

Overall, I was highly disappointed and would not go back.

But if you don&#39;t know anything about ramen, or are open to any kind of Asian noodle, you may like it."

And so filling. it&#39;s definitely my favorite bowl on the menu.  I do like the Spicy Miso, as well.  I agree with some of the other reviews on here in that it would be nice to have the pork belly cut into smaller pieces in the Tonkotsu.    

I really love some of their small plates and they are generous portions so they are great to share.  Try the green beans, chicken kara age or bacon fried rice.  We have also ordered the tamago gohan which was pretty good and interesting. Osaka, you should consider selling the kim chee that comes with that dish by the plateful -- it&#39;s so good and I think my favorite part of that plate!  

I am not a huge fan of the bento boxes.  We had the beef bento which was just so-so.   Ramen and small plates is definitely the way to go!

It only has 3 1/2 stars which I think is a tad under rated. I was a little hungover today and craved a comforting bowl of ramen. Since Uncle is closed on Sunday&#39;s, I figured I would try a new place. We ordered the shishito peppers which were pretty good. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the flakes on top as they were a bit strong and fishy. I ordered the spicy miso and my boyfriend ordered the special which was just miso broth. After spicing it up myself with stirs ha, togarashi and chili oil, the flavor was spot on. The soft egg was cooked perfectly and they give you quite a bit of noodles. When I can&#39;t have uncle, I&#39;ll be coming here. Hopefully the second time is just as good."

I started off with the onigiri with spam. Honestly, I was not impressed. It was dry and the rice was somewhat bland. The seaweed and spam gave it what little flavor. Maybe the other two types of onigiri will be better?

 Then, I tried their spicy miso ramen, again I was not impressed...I&#39;ve tried different ramen joints before and...this is beyond mediocre. The egg was made differently...a soft egg (they really mean soft to the point where it&#39;ll break and slide off the chopsticks) and they used the kimchi as a way to add heat to the entire entree...it just didn&#39;t do it for me esp at that price range. I&#39;ve had better for that price. 

Also, what made the dining experience uncomfortable was when the servers would just stand around looking. I felt uncomfortable. But maybe cause i went on a Monday night and they were waiting on more customers??? I just don&#39;t like getting stared it while I eat."

I have been here several times and am always impressed with the creativity of the menu and the quality of the food/service. Osaka Ramen doesn&#39;t strive to be the most traditional style Japanese food, but embraces a Americanized version of cuisine. 

Usually I will go and split several of the small plates as tapas, this is probably the most affordable and fun way to eat here. The Bacon Fried rice, and Chicken Kara Age are a must try. Would highly recommend the Bass Bento or the Tonkotsu Ramen."

Nothing too good abt my tonkatsu ramen, my buddy liked his spicy miso ramen but had eaten better. 

We also ordered the shishito peppers wich only had like 7-8 peppers to an order which was super small for something they charged like $6 for. And they were just ok.

I actually took the time to read each and every 3 star and lower review and would hazard to guess that less than half of them had actual legit complaints? What I did find on our visit is that someone must be reading these reviews and attempting to address them.
Our party of five ordered
Small plates ~ all of which we enjoyed
green beans - which were seasoned well but may have been slightly over cooked
shishito peppers - again seasoned well with a lot of katsuoboshi on top which I was afraid would be overpowering but was not.
2 orderes of karaage - nice flavor from the marinade and cooked perfectly crisp while still being moist inside. Our favorite app.
bacon fried rice - nice smoky chunks of bacon, poached egg but an inordinate amount of slivered green onion on top. Tasty.
We each ordered a bowl of ramen as well. Three of us had the tonkotsu and two had the shoyu.
I ordered a tonkotsu. For the many that complained about the amount of pork belly in their bowl my bowl had three fairly thick slices of tender pork belly in it. (Although the pieces were long, they were bite through tender. No complaint from me but I haven&#39;t been raised with that being a social impropriety.) There was also sliced clouds ear fungus, bamboo shoot, pickled daikon, a &#34;soft cooked&#34; egg (the egg was very soft cooked and the broth was not hot enough to cause the yolk to congeal or the white to slightly firm up) and once again a large amount of green onion. The broth had depth of flavor but wasn&#39;t as &#34;milky&#34; (and subsequently sticky and rich) as some of my all time favorites that i&#39;ve had but still good. The broth wasn&#39;t overly salty as I noted in a lot of the low star reviews.
The taste I had of my wife&#39;s shoyu ramen was also good (maybe just a touch sweet?).
The Aooni Yo Ho IPA&#39;s we drank there were pretty good but at $9 a 12 oz can I agree with one of the reviews that they are little pricey but imported beers can often be pricey. I&#39;ll be back to check out more menu items for sure."

Everything we had was excellent. We started with the okonomiyaki fries, which were outstanding, and then moved on to ramen. I had the salmon ramen (which was their special), and it was excellent. The broth was flavorful, but not overwhelming to the flavor of the salmon. There was a lot of salmon in the dish and it was perfectly cooked. My sister had the spicy miso ramen, and was similarly happy with her choice. We finished with the mochi doughnuts, which were unbelievable. I&#39;m pretty sure I referred to them as &#34;life-changing.&#34; 

We came back a few days later and brought my husband, who ordered primarily off of the small plates menu. He enjoyed all of the dishes he ordered. I had the tonkatsu ramen and thought it was excellent. We had the fries and the doughnuts again and they were both still delicious. 

I will absolutely be back. Highly recommended!"

After doing a quick search on google for ramen in Denver, we chose Osaka. We were glad to see that it would be open until 11pm. We arrived at 9:49pm and were greeted by a less than thrilled hostess. She sat us at the bar, and quickly informed us with an annoyed look that &#34;just so you know, we close in 15 minutes.&#34; Apparently, the result on Google published a closing time of 11pm, but Yelp has the correct time of 10pm. It was an honest mistake. Our waitress was nice enough, but the food was sub par. We had the spicy miso ramen, bacon fried rice, and the stuffed rice ball. I would have loved to have been delighted, but we will probably not return. 
UPDATE 5/5/16 Decided to give this place another try. This time, the hostess was incredibly friendly (different hostess), and the service was fantastic. We ordered the green beans and fried chicken starters and both were great. I had the beef bento box, which was delicious and fresh. You could tell they really took the time and care to craft this delicious entree. My BF had the bass bento, also yummy! Another friend had the spicy miso and was super impressed--he practically licked the bowl! Thanks, Osaka, for raising your game! We will return to be delighted again."

Fries were good, disappointed in the ramen. The broth needed more flavor, the fatty pork belly was chewy, and worst of all, the noodles were overcooked to shit. It seems like overcooked noodles are a reoccurring thing here, so I suggest management to take notice. I can tell a lot of time was put into making the soup stock but the noodles really just killed it all. The okonomiyaki fries were unique and addicting but ramen needs to be better considering this is their specialty. Service was decent for a somewhat busy Monday lunch.

This subterranean noodle joint is cool, sleek and provides a rich dining experience.  A lot of hard surfaces could make for a high level of noise.

As for the food, a nice selection of small plates, bento boxes and ramen.  The green beans with black and yellow sesame seeds is very good, perhaps a little past al dente on the beautiful still verdant color beans.  Vegi fried rice is outstandingly flavorful and a nice portion that has a soft egg.  The ramen&#39;s are very rich flavored broths, each comes with a soft luxuriously adding richness egg, nice bite to the noodle and surprisingly perhaps a little heavy on pork belly in such a nicely balanced broth.  Also, the three very generous slices of pro belly, measuring some 4&#34; x 2&#34; x .5&#34; could have been chopped up a little more, chopstick and a spoon are not ready for butchering a hog.   Overall the ramen is very flavorful rich and is a good share-with-a-friend selection (they bring 2 bowls) along with a few lighter small plate items for a satisfying meal.  

The prices, $14 for ramen or bento boxes, $4-9 for small plates.  

Service was cool and causal, perhaps a little more personableness would help, but efficient and effective attention with no moments of wanting or needing."

We stopped in one night shortly after opening. We weren&#39;t super hungry so we tried just the small plates. 

None impressed. Not a one.

We tried the fried chicken, fatty dark meat. 
We tried the spam/rice ball. Very little spam, a lot of rice. 
We tried the Bacon fried rice had way too much going on. Very little bacon, and a lot of other things, the flavors were all over the place. 
We tried the OKONOMIYAKI fries were meh, not terrible, but not amazing, and not strong enough to love.
We tried the green beans, also not terrible, but not what i&#39;d go back for.

I honestly wanted it to be something that was going to satisfy my yearning for ramen.  You know the kind where there&#39;s no reason to have to add anything.  It&#39;s ramen, not Pho y&#39;all.

Our actual server Amy, was that &#34;friendly, but cold service&#34; I believe Josh D, was referring too.  Sara, who brought the actual bowls of food was much more pleasant.  

The ramen was OK.  We had the spicy miso, and the tonkotsu ramen.  Spicy Miso, which I&#39;m guessing is supposed to be a version of tan tan ramen was bland in flavor.  Where the hell is the spicy part of this dish?  Is it supposed to come through that lame kimchi you sprinkle on top? Tonkotsu same difference.

We were excited to try a new ramen place that was supposed to compare to another local favorite. Place looked cool perhaps a little minimalist but it&#39;s trendy now, right? 

Took the menu excited to see what different ramens this joint would offer, and that&#39;s where we saw our first clue things may not be all that. A place with ramen in the name you may think would have more than 5 ramen dishes to offer. But not only are there only 5, 4 of them are pork and the other vegetarian. Needless to say it was quite a disappointment. The second thing we noticed was the notice on the bottom of the menu that they do not allow substitutions and ask that patrons refrain from using flash photography, really?

We forged ahead, each selecting a &#39;different&#39; ramen along with an order of the oyster small plate to start. The oyster arrived nicely plated and living up to its display it was really good and we forgot about the small selection of main dishes.

Shortly after we finished the app we received our ramen. Both looked good, ingredients fresh bowls adequately full. Soon we agreed though that this place would not become a destination for us. The dishes while different from each other were both lacking any bit of distinctive taste or kick. Broths were adequate but that&#39;s all and that adequacy was running thin by the end of the bowl. The only reason I finished my bowl is that I was starving when we arrived, my mate ran out of motivation to endure.

So if you haven&#39;t heard of this place before, now you know why and why you can pass by the little unassuming door to the basement and hit up any number of places surrounding it.

While I am amazed that David Chang can make gnocchi out of instant ramen, I remain a ramen snob, due to numerous visits to Tokyo and became determined to cure him of this horrible affliction. Because great ramen is one of the world&#39;s most delectable comfort foods. This is where Osaka Ramen comes in. 

We went to Osaka Ramen the day after he had run his fourth marathon (under four hours, no less) and so noodles were a necessity, along with a whole lot of unfiltered sake to kill the muscle pain. (I use his marathons as an excuse to eat and drink whatever I&#39;d like for about a week).

Chef/Owner Osaka-san is famed for his now-closed Twelve Restaurant, so we brought high expectations along to dinner with us. Those expectations grew and were met with each bite. 

In short: Osaka is as wonderful as any Ramen shop in Tokyo. The menu is lovely, includes a variety of incredible appetizers and ramen, and (perhaps most importantly) great unfiltered sake (served by the glass or bottle) and Japanese whisky. 

We began our meal with the green beans, which prepared simply with salt, sesame seeds and covered in I think was a mirin-based sauce. They were fresh and absolutely delicious. We then shared plates of the shishito peppers (blistered and salted), the okonomiyaki fries, the bacon fried rice, and chicken kara age. I was somewhat disappointed by the okonomiyaki fries, but I think that disappointment arose from my desire for them to be actual okonomiyaki rather than fries, since the rest of our party loved them. I cannot rave enough about the bacon fried rice or the chicken kara age, and particularly the later. I am not really a fan of friend rice in general, but goodness, was this the best friend rice ever. I have no words to describe the chicken aside from yum. Just yum, yum, yum. 

Then, after about two full glasses of sake, came the ramen itself. As I will eat almost anything that includes pork belly, I ordered the Tonkatsu. I am eating the leftovers as I write and this ramen still qualifies among the best I have ever tasted. The egg was cooked perfectly, the broth delicate, the noodles of perfect consistency. For serious, I have been debating making room in my fridge in order to stockpile the stuff. 

And then there was dessert. I ordered a small serving of the Earl Grey ice cream, which normally comes as a side to the tea cake, but my penchant for Earl Grey required that nothing compete with the smoky heaven that is Earl Grey. I was in heaven for about ten minutes. 

Our party also shared a plate of My Wife&#39;s Donuts, which came paired with salted butter and left our table in stunned silence until one friend said, quite accurately: &#34;Jesus Christ is in my mouth right now.&#34; 

As a nod to Bill Murray, we finished our meal with a glass of Santori Whisky. 

Given that Osaka is in the same complex as Little Biju&#39;s Curry Shop (also amazing) and Zephyr Brewing Co. and down the street from Meadowlark and Matchbox, I may have to set up a tent and live outside its doors."

However, real ramen the broth is used to flavor the meat and noodles. It is not meant to be consumed the way you have soup. The one thing I think that Osaka does the best are the small dishes and desserts. The bacon fried rice was perfect, full of veggies, and non greasy. The soup was hot, filling, and full of flavor. And to top it off we had the mochi doughnuts for dessert. 

Overall we had a wonderful time. I went in skeptical and left fat and happy.

I am hoping to go and try everything on the menu! First will try all the varieties of ramen and then on to the bento boxes! I have yet to try any of the desserts as I have been too full both times. 
First time I decided to stay with a more traditional ramen that I am used to eating and ordered the shoyu ramen. The presentation was beautiful and the food was delicious. You can tell the broth is homemade as a lot of places use broth from concentrate and are on the saltier side. The noodles also are homemade and have the perfect texture and they give you a good portion. The meat was also a good portion and was very lean. My favorite was the soft boiled egg.  Usually I do not like soft boiled but it taste delicious in the Shoyu broth. For an appetizer I got the karage chicken. I have never tasted fried chicken like this! Perfect combination of sweet and salty. Probably the most delicious fried chicken I have had. Highly recommend ! It was very hard not to order it the second time I went but I want to try everything!

Second time I went I had the vegetable ramen. Not traditional but the ramen noodles tasted great with the Thai curry broth!! The curry broth was pretty light but flavorful. I loved i! For an appetizer I tried the okonomiyaki fries. I enjoyed watching the fish flakes move. Strange to watch but was very tasty!

Both visits I orders the green tea and enjoyed the free refills of it throughout the meal. I love the atmosphere. it is very simple and clean. Staff was very friendly and attentive.  I can&#39;t wait to come back! I think the spicy miso will be next!"

Quality ingredients and a phenomenal smoke flavor on the burger.  My son and I ordered a Little Beef w/ cheddar and the Colorado along with a premium Bacon Poutine.

The Little Beef was just the right size for me;  again the smoke flavor made the burger for me.  The Colorado was very good but perhaps had a little too much going on with the green chile relish, BBQ sauce and Chipotle mayo.  My son and I are admittedly not big fans of a lot of BBQ sauce on burgers.  The combo of all 3 condiments really made a sweet, overwhelming flavor.

The Bacon Poutine was delicious with lots of crunchy bacon bits.  My son is a big fan of bacon, but I could have probably done just fine with a standard Poutine.

Total bill for the burgers, Poutine and a couple drinks was about $30 so a little on the pricier side;  adding the premium Poutine spiked the price point.  Service was fast and friendly.  Overall, great first visit but I look forward to trying other burgers  on the menu to find my favorite choice."

I ordered the original as I was not really hungry and I had assumed (because of price) that it would be a smaller size. I was wrong. All the burgers (my table ordered a lamb and 2 other specialties) were all the same size...making the original a great value!

* I always said I would not review national chains in my submissions - FAIL

* I always said that chains are pretty much cookie cutter in nature among their outlets - FAIL

* I always said I would provide reviews about companies, services and products that moved me - either in a positive or negative way. - SUCCESS

I was slightly apprehensive about trying our Denver location of Big Smoke Burger. So many of these gourmand burger places have popped up in the last couple years or so that the market has seriously diluted the experience. Being a chain also added to the resistance. One of my all time worst higher end burger experiences was in Vegas - and experience to this day I cannot shake from my memory.

At Big Smoke Burger however.... mmmmmmmm - good burger indeed.

I had the Big Smoke Burger with green chile added and their version of a power greens salad. 

Both were very good, but he experience was pushing the value to $ spent apex. Good ingredients assembled into a good product. 

The 1/3 lb burger was cooked medium. Interesting thing was the burger was still juicy inside and hot throughout. It surprised me since I usually order med-rare temp to make sure is jucy is maintained. Typical stuff inside with traditional LTOP topping and their horseradish mayo. with the greed chile added it was a much better tasting burger than expected.

The power green salad consisted of raw shaved brussels sprouts, raw chopped kale and raw cabbage with a very nice balsamic vinaigrette. Extremely nice to see an good healthy alternative that tasted as good as it was good for you.

I saw onion rings and fries come out too. they all smelled great, but I did not partake this time.

Service was very good and informative for this first timer. Food was out in about 8 mins (yes I do keep track of such details) passed onto my table by a smiling server who was quick to point out if there was anything I ordered I did not like to let him know and he would replace it with something else. That was unexpected but I understand where they are coming from with sites like this making or breaking a business, especially in the short term. Towards the end of my experience, a man whom may or may not have been the owner, or at the least the manager, came by and spent more than 5 seconds asking me how the burger and salad were on this visit. Told him it was my first time there and he gave me details about when they opened and how they have been doing to date. He probably spent a couple minutes with me, and other tables, in the well packed, but fast paced lunch rush.

You could have a lot worse experience less than a stone&#39;s throw away from this place."

This restaurant is pretty small, but they do have some outdoor tables.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table when it&#39;s ready.

I&#39;m pretty boring when it comes to burgers.  I like mine with lettuce, onion, tomato, pickles and yellow mustard.  (And maybe cheese when I&#39;m feeling rowdy!)  The burger was cooked nicely and had good flavor. It was a little drippy with juices, but in a good way.  I &#39;made it a combo&#39; so I also had fries and a fountain drink with it.  The fries were good, but a tad oversalted for my taste (I&#39;ll see if I can get some unsalted next time and add my own at the table).  And the iced tea from the self-serve dispenser tasted like tea (yay!).

The staff were super-friendly and very interested in seeing that everyone liked their food and had everything they needed.  Kudos for that!

I&#39;ve been here once before and recalled having enjoyed the burger and think they even had a bogo promotion during that time. 

It&#39;s a counter service ordering system similar to the other upper fast casual spots. The manager/owner , can&#39;t recall his name, is always upbeat, friendly and offers service that&#39;s definitely above the rest in the segment. 

I ordered the Colorado burger with green chilies and BBQ sauce. 

The bun was toasted nicely, and the burger was cooked to an excellent juicy medium with a good crust and texture. Its an a la carte system  so you&#39;ll have to add on fries or onion rings, which are excellent but kick the price up to the high end for a place like this. 

They also have beer and wine I believe, along with patio seating for the nicer days. 

Due to the location and price it won&#39;t be a regular stop for me, but if you&#39;re in the area it&#39;s a pretty good option, especially if you&#39;re at world of beer nextdoor."

Whenever possible, I try to determine the calorie and macronutrient content of my meals. I realize that might sound completely insane, but this is what allows me to eat as much junk food as possible while maintaining my figure. Priorities. Yeah. Most restaurants don&#39;t provide any sort of nutrition information, and when I contact them, very few are willing to accommodate me. I sent Bug Smoke a message asking about the amount and cut of beef in their burger patties, as well as info on the cheese they use. They were more than happy to answer all of my bizarre questions and responded within minutes. 

After all of that, I wound up getting a chicken sandwich. It was one of the best chicken sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had. Perfectly moist and flavorful chicken. The smoked cheddar was insane. Great bun.

This is a $7-8 chain burger joint (most of their other locations are in Canada) where you order @ the counter &amp; your food&#39;s brought to your table &amp; your plates are cleaned up for you afterward. The burgers are hand crafted &amp; grilled to order so don&#39;t expect a burger to come out immediately. The burgers are made with AAA grade beef &amp; the fries are cut fresh. I got a burger from the &#34;signature burger&#34; section called the big smoke burger. It is listed as &#34;horseradish mayo, caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, tomato + lettuce&#34; but mine came with no tomato or lettuce (hence I have reduced the stars). They didn&#39;t ask how I wanted the meat cooked so I came up to the workers shortly after I ordered to tell them to cook it medium or medium rare. They said OK and it came out well-done. Luckily, the meat was still super juicy and tasty and the smokey flavor was apparent and pretty amazing. I liked the whole-seed mustard and the melted cheese on the burger but thought the burger was so plain with no vegetables (only a small amount of caramelized onions). The fries were okay (better than In-N-Out&#39;s). There&#39;s seating inside &amp; outside &amp; drinks are self serve.

My boyfriend thought his burger was okay and we both agreed that the fries were okay (and okay is being generous) but my blue burger (with a vegetarian patty) was absolutley unedible. I understand this isn&#39;t a vegetarian patty type place but I couldn&#39;t get through 3 bites without having a consistent taste of moth balls .. it was the worst burger I&#39;ve ever had in my life .. anyways, I&#39;d strongly advise to seek other options .. oh and btw, a vegetarian &#39;burger&#39; a beef burger and 2 fries cost $27 .. such a rip off!"

He told us that BSB is a chain out of Canada (hence the Poutine) that only had two stores in the states.  Also, since we lived in Minnesota, we asked him about the &#34;Real Wisconsin Cheese Curds&#34; served with the Poutine (We don&#39;t really care for Poutine, so we didn&#39;t try BSB&#39;s version) and he told us that he&#39;d actually had an eight year old Minnesotan point out that they weren&#39;t really &#34;curds&#34; but more like cheese sticks.

BSB has a similar set up to Five Guys or Fuddruckers: You order at the counter and a waiter/waitress brings your food to your table.  This location (we haven&#39;t seen another one to compare though) was smaller than one of the other places we mentioned.

We really like places that have small menus and really do a good job with those few items.  BSB has about eight burgers to choose from, fries or rings, beer or pop, and Poutine.  Amazing Burgers.  The 1/2 pound patties are made with quality meat, a tasty bun, and fresh veggies.  Great fries too.  If we lived in the area and wanted a burger, this would be our first choice.  If Five Guys, Fuddruckers, and BSB were all next to each other, we&#39;d pick BSB too.  If you are a big fan of Burger King&#39;s, Mcdonalds&#39;, or Wendys&#39; &#34;burgers&#34; then you&#39;ll probably think BSB is too expensive."

So here goes - not sure what to expect when I walked in but was friendily (is that a word?) greeted when I walked in.  Perused the menu on the wall and the word Poutine jumped out at me and out my mouth.  

So I ordered the Blue burger as a combo and the nice lady behind the counter asked if I wanted the poutine as a side - dumb question - uh Yah!  The burgers here are 6 oz.- good size. The Blue Burger has gorgonzola, avocado, rosemary garlic mayo, tomato &amp; lettuce - yes like was said in other reviews these are messy burgers - get plenty of napkins!   Great burger - cooked to order, somewhere between medium and well - just like I like them. Now on to the poutine - I am still savoring 3 hours later - VERY tasty. I usually am not one of those people that takes pictures of their food but this time I did and it is posted.

The only downfall was the parking - City Set is trendy and I came in on a Friday around 5pm - translation: it sux (although they do offer free valet)."

With City Set being the new go to dining hot-spot in Glendale, it needed a good place to get a burger.

Big Smoke Burger is your average fast and casual burger place.  They offer a variety of specialty burgers along with the normal classic cheeseburger options.  The fries are better than normal and the onion rings are okay - I would choose the fries over the rings here.  They offer more cheese options than most burger places in Colorado, including Jalapeno Havarti and Gorgonzola.  They also like flavoring spreads and mayo&#39;s here, I&#39;ve enjoyed the rosemary garlic mayo thus far and look forward to trying the chipotle mayo in the near future.  

The burgers are definitely smoky.  I&#39;m not necessarily a fan of smoky burgers, with that said the burgers are large and have excellent flavor combinations with the ingredients offered.  You can also enjoy chicken, lamb or veggie burgers here.

I&#39;ve only had 1 burger here, which was *messy* (because of the amount of toppings/sauce/mayo...so I&#39;m cool with that, heh)...every time I&#39;ve been here, including that 1 burger time, I&#39;ve had their poutine.  I&#39;m becoming an effete poutine snob.

BSB&#39;s poutine is good...different from Bruxie&#39;s just 6-7 blocks S on Colorado like bananas and pineapples are different, but not as good as a certain Corner Office duck poutine downtown.  This version needs a little more cheese.  Gravy amount is good and it has enough salt in, which is good.  Hardly any meat (if there is any) at all though, which differs from the other locations (and Euclid Hall downtown as well).  Overall it&#39;s a very satisfying dish -- and if you&#39;re waffling between the small and the large, why not throw in for the extra $1 and get the large? It&#39;s a meal unto itself.

So far I&#39;ve only had their Big Smoke Burger - the burger fixins itself were very tasty, but the burger itself seemed to be lacking something.  Not juiciness, but it might have benefited from a little more spice worked into the meat.  It tasted bland to me...I was hoping for something so mouthwatering after the 1st bite it left me howling like a wolf at the sky, ready to lunge for more.  Alas...well, maybe next time I go I&#39;ll forego the poutine and get another burger off their menu.  Staff is always friendly and usually excels at being personable and talkative and accomodating (last time I went I was 20 mins past closing on a Friday night and they took care of me), so that gets em the 4th star along with the poutine.

It&#39;s solidly good.  Give it a try. (Parking is crowded to nightmarish depending on the hour, so be ready to cruise like a cop around the City Set parking area looking for an opening...)"

Having the pleasure of sampling a variation of their burgers, I knew their standard Big Smoke burger wouldn&#39;t deviate from wonderfulness. The  Smoke Burger: stacked with horseradish mayo, caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, tomato &amp; lettuce. I think the horseradish mayo is what adds that special kick and holds it all together.

The assembly line set-up assures each customer that their burgers are fresh and made to order. All the fresh veggies are laid out there right in front of you, so you may watch your burger being made right before your eyes.

Plus - they have poutine. Yes...poutine. The product of Canadian masterminds: french fries smothered in brown gravy and cheese curds. I am sure there are times when poutine could go oh-so wrong, but not here. They get it right and if you aren&#39;t too full after your juicy burger I urge you to order the poutine.

We came in yesterday after a long bike ride, and we were famished. 
I had the namesake Big Smoke Burger, and the bf had the Crazy Burger. 

Mine was full of flavor from the cheese, the caramelized onions, and the horseradish mayo. His was deliciously smoky from the chipotle, and with a kick from the banana pepper.

The fries were also good. 

We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

We arrived at 11 and we were the only ones there. We chose to sit on the patio and like the various seating options inside and out. Ordering is super easy and we got two bleu burgers and a large poutine. The meal came to $26 with two fountain pops and so it was a smidge on the pricier side. 

Our food was brought out to us within 10mins and I like the serving dishes. Portions are quite large and so definitely share where you can. This was our breakfast and we waddled away. The burger was amazing and perfectly seasoned. The rosemary mayo is unique and everything went together well. 

My favorite part of the meal was the poutine. Being a chain from Toronto, I expected quality and definitely got it. The fries were perfect, the gravy was meaty and the curds hold there own. A large is large and so unless it&#39;s your full meal, share. 

I can&#39;t wait for our next visit and our server outlined they should be expanding to the Park Meadows area in a few months. Yippee!"

That being said, Big Smoke Burger absolutely delivers when it comes to fresh ground beef. It doesn&#39;t just stop there either. Their fries are delicious and abundant, their onion rings are fried to perfection and their poutine is the best I&#39;ve had in Colorado (not exaggerating). Any of these sides paired with one of their specialty theme burgers are a guaranteed tummy pleaser. 

I would&#39;ve definitely given them 5 stars, but, the prices are a little high. However, don&#39;t let this discourage you as the food, environment, location and employees are all absolutely delightful.

Both companies benefit, and I benefit even more because I can bring my dog. We decided to order from Big Smoke because we had heard great things about them.  I like spicy food, so I went with the spicy burger. It has spicy chipotle mayo, which was calling my name.  We also got Poutine fries. The delivery was super fast and the girl was extremely friendly. The burger was delish.  I bit into the juicy burger and it began oozing the spicy chipotle mayo. I am a fan. I was not a fan of the Poutine fries, but I think that may be a acquired taste.

I&#39;m all for a delicious burger, but eating a 15$ meal with plastic fork and knife is a bit absurd. The staff seem rather clueless, although welcoming and pleasant. 

I suspect the staff are somewhat sheepish about offering fries since it costs extra...so, unless you are familiar with their menu and wish to read a menu on the wall that stretches over 10 feet, you might come up short.

(I scored an actual Aeron Chair from Craig&#39;s List for next to nothing!  But I digress...)

It was the description of the poutine that drew us in but for some reason we didn&#39;t order it.  The Wife had the Blue Burger and I had the Craft and we loved them both.  They are messy though so forget the opera gloves.  

I&#39;m not usually a fan of onion rings but theirs are great.  Light and crisp and easy to eat.  (Whenever I get them at other places I get a greasy strip of oniony tape worm that comes out of the battered husk on the first bite and makes me immediately regret ordering them.  But I digress...)

Interiors are really cool.  Bathroom super clean (with a changing table in the men&#39;s room.  Nice touch for the dads who pitch in.)

On this night though it was the staff that really stood out.  They could tell we hadn&#39;t been there before and called us over to introduce us to the concept, the menu...they even made sure to point out we were a minute from missing happy hour!  $2 Session beers!.  (I drank a LOT of that at my best friend&#39;s wedding in Portland a few years ago and I have a real fondness for it.  But I digress...) 

The only knock I have is that if your kid isn&#39;t down for a burger (and our little girl wasn&#39;t), there really isn&#39;t a good option.  A kid&#39;s grilled cheese seems like it could be an easy add though and work within the brand.  (Smoked Tillamook maybe?)  Still, that&#39;s more of a &#39;heads up&#39; than a complaint.

It was our first time to City Set.  It&#39;s quite a little oasis and very nice.  Lots of people enjoying the bee-yooteeful Colorado evening.  I&#39;m looking forward to trying World of Beer, and Jax has some lovely outdoor patio seating. (Where we were treated to the rear view of a zaftig woman whose thong appeared to be trying to ride up and escape.  Butt...I digress...)

As far as the drinks go, the menu sports a unique and refreshing mix of designed cocktails and signature drinks. The draft beer list leaves something to be desired. However I am not going to hit them on that because being a 4+ star hotel bar/restaurant, an extension draft beer list is not thief intended forte. The lacking draft list is more than made up for by the domestic and international bottled beer list.

Two stars instead of one because they have good bacon... And it&#39;s included in your build-your-own-bloody-Mary. However... That bloody Mary bar is bleak.

They start you off with this awesome bread and sweet whipped butter. Appetizers were good we got calamari and deviled eggs. Our scallops were the best I&#39;ve ever had. Definitely fresh, not at all chewy. 

I just think the flavors could have been better. The calamari had some cocktail sauce and something like tartar sauce, but they weren&#39;t anything great. The deviled egg flight had bacon, jalapeño, and salmon and lox toppings, but they didn&#39;t have a very strong bacon/jalapeño/salmon flavor. The scallops were fresh, but only tasted buttery.

- Couch Potatoes
- Deviled Egg Flight

For my main course I got the Carnitas Hash which was amazing. Truthfully it may have been one of the best breakfast/brunch items I have ever had and food-wise completely saved my experience here. This is something that you will continue to dream of for at least the next week or two after having.

Even the big bowl of oatmeal she let me try was great (and I swear it was quinoa). I had the smoked salmon benedict. The smoked salmon was delicious, there was spinach on it, and the hollandaise was not too rich or thick. 

Couple of dings on this place... they offer bottomless mimosas for $14 that you can get with a variety of different juices. We all got pineapple, and it was WAY TOO SWEET. So I don&#39;t think I quite drank $14 worth of that extra sweet drink. Also, I swapped breakfast potatoes for fruit, and that was $2 extra. Sheesh.

Good thing is that neither the kitchen nor the server snoozed on the quality of our food and service, respectively. We enjoyed the breakfast pizza the most: the crust was the perfect thickness to hold the toppings and it was crispy and chewy at the same time. The pie was definitely freshly made - the avocado slices were also freshly cut and thrown on top, just beautiful. 

If you like kale, I recommend the Tuscan Kale Salad (skip the grilled chicken as it was too much charred), not only was it toothsome, they threw a lot of marcona almonds into the mix. I already love regular almonds, but these marcona almonds got twice my love!

Crab Cake Benedict with home fries were really photogenic, otherwise they taste like regular crab cake benedicts.

On my first visit, I was bleary-eyed. I wanted a nap more than anything, but since my room wasn&#39;t ready, I had to settle for a meal. I arrived at the late end of breakfast and it wasn&#39;t crowded; unfortunately, I waited a long time for any acknowledgement. That was the tone of service for my first meal, it improved on my second visit.

I had the berry pancackes on my first visit with breakfast potatoes instead of sausage. The pancakes were ok, not great and could&#39;ve used more fruit on them given the portion size. The potatoes, a favorite part of breakfast, were kind of terrible. Paprika was the only flavor emanating from them; they needed a more balanced flavor profile.

My second meal was the morning I checked out. I went with the bagel and lox; no complaints about the dish - plenty of lox and all of the necessary accouterments. Service was more attentive this time around, which was key because I was running late.

While I can only speak for breakfast, the food and service fell a bit short with me. If I had more time, I&#39;d probably explore some of the other options in the vicinity."

We had a bit of a large rowdy group, and we had had a film camera/boom in tow since we were in the midst of filming a video for my job. Despite this, the staff were kind and accommodating and didn&#39;t complain about us filming in their space. So serious bonus points for that.

I ordered and devoured the Challah French Toast, which was so, so good. It was a very generous portion so I had to pawn off a few slices to my dining companions to clear my plate (but they weren&#39;t complaining so we&#39;re good). 

It was surprisingly uncrowded, but that could just be because it was 11 a.m. on a weekday. Still, it was a beautiful setting with excellent food and great service. Would love to return for their Sunday PJ Brunch!"

Our waitress was incredible she had blue hair and was so welcoming and delightful! Great fire pit and area outside too! 

Only bad thing: we had ordered another bottle of Champagne and was finishing it up at the end of the night when the lights came on a guy that was cleaning the bar yelled &#34;time to leave&#34; when we still had half a bottle left. Prob shouldn&#39;t do that if you want repeat customers!"

I was here on a Saturday at noon and it wasn&#39;t even packed. The whole time the manager was walking the floor and did not even check on us. He walled passed us about 15 times and fixed the table next to us. How do I know how many times? We were so hungry and bored that we counted. He only cared to speak to people who were older or in a suit. We waited over 30 minutes for my burger and my boyfriends breakfast ham sandwich. Don&#39;t get me wrong the food was great but not great enough to wait that long. Our waitress was great so it&#39;s not fully her fault her our service sucked. But we did tip well. 

Overall, I would probably never come here again

Our server never brought water, took 10 minutes to bring an orange juice and coke, took our order, and then didn&#39;t come back until it was time for the check!

As for the food:
Biscuits and gravy: Plentiful yet bland

Graceland pancakes: extremely BURNT (unfortunately I didn&#39;t get to tell anyone because our waiter literally came by and dropped off the check and I had my card sitting out so he snatched that up and ran it.)

Sausage: just... Okay.

You would think that being in the JW Marriot that they would at least have more pride in their customer service than to just not check on people.

If you want this type of atmosphere to start your day, I would recommend the Edge at the Four Seasons over this place any day. Their food is always on point and their servers actually give a damn."

It came highly recommended and we are so glad we tried it!  Upon checking in for our reservation we were promptly and warmly welcomed by the Restaurant Manager, Brandon....a nice start.  Both the restaurant and bar were busy - another good sign.  We were seated and promptly greeted by another friendly lad - Sam, our Server. Our group of 4 all ordered drinks, appetizers, dinner and desserts - all of us raved about the recommended selections by Sam.  We tried the Moscow Mule and Grapefruit A Go Go - both deserve 2 thumbs up.  Next recommendation - the Tuna appetizer and Cheese/Charcuterie board - excellent presentation and taste.  For entrees between the 4 of us - we had the warm Kale salad, steak frites, the meatloaf and the Bison - again, we were all raving fans!  Lastly, while there wasn&#39;t much room for dessert - we tried the homemade Strawberry/Rhubarb pie and the flaming &#39;Baked Alaska&#39; dessert - both again....2 thumbs up, though the pie was my absolute favorite - Yum!!!  
The service was attentive and perfectly timed, the atmosphere was nice - lighting, noise and overall ambience - were all great.  When I go back - I&#39;d like to sit in there outdoor area with the firepit for cocktails...looked really nice and inviting.  Overall - it was a 10+.  Give it a try!"

The syrup is a stranahan&#39;s whiskey based syrup which is delicious.   They do have bottomless mimosas and they have several juices you can have with them ranging from orange, cranberry, pineapple.  Side note is you can mix the juices with their mimosas if you want so you can make a orange pineapple or a cranberry orange.  The atmosphere is open so can get a little bit noisy at times.

- we did not order cocktails (I suppose if we were looking to get Schwasty, we might have tolerated the food)
- we did not order the chicken and waffles (we have heard from others it is the dish to dine)

We were not impressed with the service here. As we walked in, we were not greeted. Presumably the manager and hostess were working on something else, no excuses. That paired with the neglect of the server, you&#39;ve lost two stars. Hint: about 1-3 minutes after your table gets served food, you should ask if everything is OK. A half a star off when we were seated. In a mostly empty restaurant, with a reservation made a week in advance, but we were still placed in the back facing a wall. It&#39;s not important enough to ask to be reseated, but good businesses notice the little things. Finally, last star and a half, the food was disappointing and overpriced. The hash had barely any meat in it and the smoked salmon was oversalted."

The bathrooms are actually located inside the JW Marriott Hotel &amp; are impeccably clean. The only downside is beware of ordering a double. In many establishments it&#39;s a few dollars up charge.

I&#39;ve grown acustomed to picking up something on the way home, or cooking for my man on the weekends....all that changes when restuarant week surfaces. i LOVE restaurant week. In fact, i look forward to it every single year. This year, the bf was out of town, so me and the girls decided to treat ourselves to a little night out...and Second Home it was!

I&#39;ve only heard good things about Second Home and this experience did not disappoint. Here&#39;s why:

- Located in the Mariott hotel, this little gem is cozy, clean and oozes a touch of class, while creating a homey atmosphere.
- The service was wonderful. Our server, Elle, was adorable and full of excitement when we ordered a killer bottle of red wine, and ordered everything the 5280 menu had to offer. She made our experience just that much better :)
- Prices are a bit steap if you don&#39;t come during happy hour or restaurant week. $55 bottle of wine? yikes, but so worth it! ha :)
- The food is amazing. We had bison short ribs, deep fried crab rolls, bison chilie, green chilie chicken, fresh scallops in a risoto and the best desserts known to man. mmmm! 
- Free Valet!

Although most restaurants and stores in this part of town are known to be upscale and attract a bit of an entitled crowd, Second home is far from that! I will definitely return to check out that awesome patio :)"

Nice outdoor seating area to people watch the trendy rich crowd that goes to JW Marriott.  Friendly attentive staff and at night a nice fire pit for having a night cap drink before heading back to the room.  I had the Grapefruit Martini (I think called Grapefruit a Go Go) and I liked it a lot, refreshing and not sweet, just how I like my fruity drinks.  We order the tater tots (with chipotle ketchup and Malted Mayo) which while I found the dipping sauces pleasant the tots were not as crispy as I would have liked.  The  Quesadillas were very good though.

While we never did a larger meal here I would love to do one in the future.  It sounded like they had delicious desserts (they had one special of a peanut butter chocolate mousse-drool), it appears they do by the cheese, cheese plates as well, and a pajama Sunday brunch (no wonder why people were walking around in the hotel in their PJ&#39;s, why didn&#39;t we go here or the hotel advertise it more since this is where we should have had our breakfast since we were guests of the hotel (well now I know).

I have to say I was actually impressed with their brunch. I am a super light weight so I was not able to experience the bottomless mimosas, but I think my fellow brunchers ordered 4+ rounds. If that isn&#39;t a sign of tasty mimosas, I don&#39;t know what is! I also believe it is only $13 for bottomless, not bad at all! I was so tempted to order a couple rounds, but I had to remind myself I need to drive (boo to responsibilities). 

We ordered a bag of donuts to share and they were nice and soft. It came with 3 dipping sauces, I think they were nutella, banana and.....raspberry?? All were not too shabby. I had a simple Ham + Egg sandwich and that actually hit the spot. I had seen a Mcdonald&#39;s breakfast commercial the night before and boy was I craving a more healthy alternative, and that was it! Everyone else seemed very happy with their choices. A Couple people ordered the second home rancheros and they both said it was good. The pancakes and french toast looked delicious, I will have to be back for another round of brunch, but next time I won&#39;t be driving!

I always end up here on another persons suggestion and I have yet to leave in anything but a great mood. What more can you ask for from a hotel bar?

The chef pizza is sausage, pepperoni, and &#34;spicy&#34; peppers.  It&#39;s good, but there&#39;s plenty of places that do a much better pizza for much cheaper, so I doubt that I&#39;ll be trying this one again. 

The mule is good (but the mules at Chop Shop are better).

I love the concept of elevated American food, but I&#39;m not sure this was worth the price.  It was definitely good enough for another try, I&#39;d especially like to see what they can do for brunch."

I can&#39;t comment on either of those yet, however, as I&#39;ve only been here for dinner. The ambiance is nice, and the pace was nice and slow, which I like. 

I tried a grapefruit martini-cocktail, my husband had a Colorado Moscow Mule. The drinks were good, but in no danger of eclipsing our favorites. 

I wanted to try the aranchini, but chickened out as I&#39;m trying to watch carbs. I thought the portions were fine, but prices a little high.

While I thought my chicken and waffles were outstanding, I could see how some other menu items could miss the mark. The hubby had the fish fry, which as the waitress warned, is literally a basket of fried food. The mahi mahi in there was really good, but everything else left much to be desired. 

The service here is great as other Yelpers have mentioned, and it is certainly a prime place for people watching. It&#39;s not as busy as you&#39;d expect other Cherry Creek restaurants to be, but when you remember that it&#39;s tucked away inside a hotel - I think that explains it. 

But seriously, the chicken and waffles were really yummy! The syrup they serve with the dish is infused with whiskey and I literally wanted to stash the leftovers in my purse. If you come back for brunch and get anything that has syrup - make sure to ask for the one with whiskey. You won&#39;t be disappointed!

The menu has a good variety of choices to pick from. I decided on the Graceland pancakes. The pancake itself were cooked with banana and then topped with peanut butter, with 4 pieces of bacon on the side. If you order this, make sure you are hungry.  It is a lot of food.

I have ordered many things on the menu and have not once been disappointed. They have the best home made tater tots. Like it&#39;s ridiculous. The thin crusted pizza. OMG. I take friends from out of town here all the time. The Sunday brunch has limited items which does not offer the taters but I asked once if they would make them for me and they did. That&#39;s great service! Ambiance is top notch. Love the large fire pit outside. Comfortable couches for a first date. Wink, wink."

The big winner out of the whole thing was one of our shareable apps, the couch potatoes.  We picked it up because of the catchy name, and boy it was so addictive: crispy sweet potato chips with sour cream and chive dip.  I could&#39;ve had it all by myself but had to keep myself from going for third, or fourth for obvious reasons.  

As a close second was the dessert - caramel apple pie a la mode (with vanilla bean ice-cream). 

The rest of the meal, however, was forgettable.  The soup (some type of a gumbo) was a tad salty and the main course, the rotisserie Colorado chicken, was OK but not outstanding. 

Will go back next time for the couch potatoes and peoplewatching."

Shade was at a premium on this fine day, and I thought the staff should have been more proactive about setting up and moving some umbrellas for our group.  The lunch menu is extensive.  It also has some nice selections.  It is not, however, especially affordable.  Following the lead of some of my fellow diners, I did two of the 1/2 salads for my lunch. 

I had the 1/2 Smoked Duck Breast and Asparagus salad (Poached duck egg, frisée, port braised cherry, hazelnut, sherry vinaigrette).  This was very well prepared, delicious, and elegant.  It was not especially filling.  I also had the 1/2 Watercress and Arugula salad (Almond, aged goat cheese, crispy leek, grape + shallot vinaigrette).  This was also a flavor home-run, but left one wanting more.  I really could have used a bit more protein.  Speaking of that, one of my dining companions asked to get a poached egg on her salad (3 times she asked) but it never materialized.  The food was tasty, but if I want an overpriced salad, why not go to Cucina Colore? (or several other fine establishments in Cherry Creek)"

I cannot vouch for the breakfast/brunch or dinner selections but I can for lunch!  I had the kale salad and you have a choice to add a protein (I got the organic grilled salmon) for a slight up charge. The kale salad is tossed in the right amount of light vinaigrette. It wasn&#39;t dry or drowning in the dressing. This salad also comes with pine nuts and craisins which complimented the salad very well. The grilled organic salmon was very tasty and cooked to perfection. I would recommend this salad and gladly go back to this establishment again. All in all, a very good dining experience!"

This is one of those places that offers unlimited mimosas in order to distract from the bland food. Cornmeal waffles are unique idea but wasn&#39;t mindblowing or anything. Fried chicken was very average. Bread pudding French toast was a huuge regret, not just because carbs.. But carbs that don&#39;t even taste good and aren&#39;t enjoyable. Couldn&#39;t have more than 2 bites despite guilt about waste and paying money and not eating it (usually able to guilt myself into finishing more).

Our daughter gets a kick out of the whole pajama wear at breakfast in a restaurant. Kids also eat free up to age 8 as along as they have their pjs on. They have a separate room for the kiddos to hang out at where they can eat and watch a kids movie.  They have a member of their staff in the room to monitor them which I thought was cool. I saw a tip cup in there so next time we visit, I&#39;ll have to remember to bring some cash. 

My food was good. My husband wasn&#39;t too impressed with what he ordered but but I&#39;d go back time and time again just for the bottomless mimosas. They are really GOOD and totally worth the $13 you spend.  I had the waffle with peanut butter spread and bacon and it was good but you can&#39;t really can&#39;t mess up a waffle.

If you don&#39;t want to sit in the open bar area which may be full when you get there and you have a party of more than two, it&#39;s probably best that you call way ahead of time and make a reservation.

I tend to sit in the bar for drinks or dinner and consistently have had great service and great food.  My business partner and I like this place as an option for afternoon business meetings then dinner afterward. Most recently, I met three colleagues for a business dinner and had a great time, everyone was happy.  What is most disappointing is the valet.  It is the one inconsistent element of the experience.   For example, I had dinner with three other friends and despite all of us staying at Second Home for dinner and drinks and valeting our cars, I was the only one that had to pay for valet.  I understand that if you stay longer than 3 hours, you have to pay for valet.  (we all stayed longer than 3 hours)  The issue I have is the inconsistent implementation of this policy.  Out of the four of us, I was the only one who paid.  That is what is so disappointing.  I&#39;ll pay the valet, I stayed longer than 3 hours but don&#39;t make me pay when everyone else in my party did not.  (I will only briefly mention the several other times I visited Second Home that I am the first to request my car but the last to retrieve it).  

So--the lesson here for readers---Valet is $17 at Second Home--despite what you may have spent inside (couple hundred on spa, few hundred on dinner with business clients) or it may be free, depending on which valet you get.  Roll the dice and see what happens.  Other great option for business dinners in Cherry Creek--HIllstone--also great food and guest service and no valet.  Free parking is in the back of the restaurant."

The deviled egg flight was a great variety of the classic app-the bacon eggs were the best of the three choices. For dinner we ordered the cod dinner and clam linguine. Both dinners were prepared just right. Flavor, freshness, and presentation were all done well. Added a side order of the mac and cheese to share. The picture does it no justice, must order. To end the dinner we ordered the cookie skillet. You can&#39;t get the cookie skillet wrong, but you can make it better with an oatmeal cookie, that&#39;s what Second Kitchen does.

The charcuterie and cheese spread to start was delightful.  Many guests at my table mentioned that they felt it brought them back to their travels throughout Italy, what a nice memory! I am a huge fan of finocchiona (tuscan fennel salami) and really enjoyed it here.

For dinner I enjoyed a Provencal style Salmon cooked perfectly medium accompanied with a pistou broth, squash, zucchini, cherries and cipolini onions, YUM.

They wanted to make sure we were happy so brought little bags of sugary donuts and 3 lovely dips.  How thoughtful was that.  

Most of started with Make your own Bloody Mary&#39;s.  That was kinda over wheeling at least for me but fun and tasty.  I had a Benedict dish and I was almost too full from all the vegetables in my Mary.  I ate half and brought the rest home for my husband.  The potatoes were really good.  The muffin was fat and a bit tough.  

It looked like everyone was pretty happy with their brunch.  Sundays are their pajama mornings.  So wish we would have come in our flannels.  If I go again I am wearing my finest cozy PJ&#39;s and slippers.

At first the waitress said they could not move us but then the hostess came over and did and we were happy. They also have papers on the table which is a nice touch.

 We asked for recommendations from our waitress and she made good ones- crab Benedict for me and chicken and waffles for hubby. She even told us the chicken takes longer as it was made from scratch so we would know there was a wait. We also ordered a side of applewood smoked bacon. The food did take longer because of the chicken and when it arrived everything looked great. 

Crab Benny- nicely poached eggs and the crab was Maryland lump without all the breading - also served with asparagus and very generous helping of very seasoned home fries. I would recommend getting the hollandaise on the side as there was a lot and it drowned it a bit. The crab was flavorful and the plate was filling. 

Chicken and waffles served with Stranahan&#39;s Whiskey maple syrup - waffles were small rounds (4of them) made of cheddar and cornmeal - so unusual and tasty. The chicken was golden- y, crisp goodness and generous in portion - also 4 pieces. The chicken was juicy and hubby was really enjoying it until the  largest piece was cut open and still very pink inside.-he immediately lost his appetite. 

Our waitress was attentive and helpful in the beginning but had seemingly disappeared as it got quite busy. When she came back we were done and ready to go - he showed her the chicken when she asked how everything was and she said oh sorry about that - I will let the chef know. I asked her if she saw what he was talking about and she said yes it is pink and left with the plate and returned with the bill with the chicken on it. We weren&#39;t expecting the whole charge removed but maybe take a bit off for the raw chicken? As a courtesy? Hubby was a bit frustrated but we did not pursue it and still left a 20 % tip because we are not mean people. 

A few other things - the iced tea was not my cup of tea as it was a floral/fruity type of flavor and I was expecting plain tea but if you like that flavor you should enjoy it.

It was the pajama brunch So the waitstaff had on jammies - one gal had on love pink pants that had sparkled letters across her backside and her midriff was bared - I may be old now but I did not think it was appropriate wear for a restaurant inside the JW Marriott. That is just me but there were a lot of families there - the rest of the staff had penguins and other fun pj pants on with t-shirts. One guy had old school grandpa pajamas on and they were great! 

As we were walking out the concierge - I believe his name was Robert- asked how everything was and we nicely told him that the food was tasty except for the pink chicken.  He was not happy about it and asked if we had already paid we said we had and he apologized and said that was not how it should have been handled. We had to leave otherwise I felt that if we had pursued it he definitely would have taken care of the situation. The staff in the lobby was super friendly.

Pricing: $3 iced tea, $3 coffee, chicken and waffles $15, crab Benny - $15 - side of bacon -  3 strips - $3."

I live very close by so it is convenient. I have also been here for dinner as well. They have great food and the service has always been great. I like how they don&#39;t rush you out on the weekend for brunch. My friend was in town and we went for the bottomless mimosas (key). We were there for 4 hours!!! Nothing like some mimosas to start the weekend. Only one time I had mediocre service. Our server was acting weird and disappeared for about 20 minutes. When she came back she informed us she had an emotional breakdown..uhhhh unprofessional much? Then when she got cut from her shift she came over and with a bad attitude annonced she had been cut and that she would be leaving, it was awkward. However, she was very nice and refilled our mimosas and made sure someone was there to take care of us the rest of our time."

Different eggs were topped with different things including salmon and bacon. I ordered the smoked prime rib (the special on Saturday nights). I&#39;m usually a filet girl. Lazy and never wanting to cut away the fat but I really wanted the baked potato that came with it. My date got a chicken dish. His chicken was moist and probably some of the best chicken I&#39;ve had. It also came with delicious whipped potatoes. My steak was amazing! Juicy, cooked perfectly, flavor was on point, and very tender. I was a little bummed with the lack of &#34;loading&#34; my baked potato but at this point, that was the least of my worries. We also got a side of the macaroni and cheese which was also great.
To drink I had a specialty cocktail called Grapefruit A-Go-Go. Delightful cocktail with grapefruit juice ice balls. If you like grapefruit, I&#39;d recommend it. Next time, I will definitely dabble in their large selection of wine. If you order a bottle you can observe them retrieving it through their glass walled above ground cellar. 

Finally for desert we had what was on the board that day. Pumpkin cheesecake which was very good. Just a lot like pumpkin pie. Then we had a chocolate pecan pie. I&#39;m not a huge chocolate fan but this was divine! Not overpowering in the least. 

The service was great, they played good music in the background, and the vibes/ambiance were good. I will be making a trip back to Second Home soon."

  What makes this particular Panera a true five-star experience, tho, is the incredible view.

Our food arrived timely, and was hot and tasty! Panera doesn&#39;t disappoint me and this location certainly did not disappoint. I was very excited when I realized the new location. So close to home! 

The manager and another employee checked in with us to make sure we were satisfied. Both asked if we needed anything else. Our dishes were cleared, yet we were not rushed. 

Importantly, place is clean! No dirty tables, no messy condiment area. It was very nice and clean.

This location is new, so if there is a complaint, speak to someone about it so they can make it right. 

Ps...they are also very accommodating with menu items! For those of us that can&#39;t eat certain things!

I took her on a Monday and I really loathe the parking there first off. It was busy, but not crowded. There was no one in line at the kiosk or the front so we just ordered at the front. I ordered an overpriced chicken ceasar salad. The chicken was in thin slices like lunch meat, not like a chicken breast. And the chicken was cold. That is just gross.

My boyfriend and I wound up here before a show at the Gothic last night, and it was such a fortunate happenstance. The decor is nothing to write home about, but the food was amazing. I ordered the vegetarian plate, and even if you aren&#39;t vegetarian, order this. My boyfriend was jealous of my dinner despite the heaping pile of meat that came with his plate. The pita and hummus are freaking amazing - pita comes out doughy and warm. I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. My boyfriend raved about the lamb pie he had as a starter too (unfortunately, I&#39;m allergic to pine nuts, so I couldn&#39;t partake).

We&#39;ve ordered delivery twice, and eaten in the restaurant once.

I have eaten some very good middle-eastern type food, but Beirut Grill is hands-down the best.

Ingredients were extremely fresh, and they go the extra mile and hand make their pitas.

The baba ganoush is the best I&#39;ve ever had in my life.

We&#39;ve tried their king combo, which contains an incredible amount and variety of food. The portions are very large, to the point that I end up eating half at one meal and half at another. There are quite a few excellent appetizers as well. There are plenty of vegetarian options that are splendid, for the non-omnivores out there, and the meats are out of this world.

And not a complaint at the table as we scarfed down salads, hummus, baba ghanouj, gyros, and various other meats.  The crowd favorite was the chicken kafka.

They also gave us some pita and hummus to get us started which was a nice touch.

I got the chicken kafta &amp; my boyfriend ordered the gyro plate. We were both blown away with how amazing everything was! The meat quality was great, the flavors were out of this world.

The homos sandwich was made up of lettuce, cucumbers, a whole lotta hummus, and a complimentary curly hair on pita bread. I just pulled out the lettuce it was touching; the lettuce wasn&#39;t very fresh anyway. The bread was thick and soft and the hummus was pretty tasty. The sandwich was very filling and tasted decent overall. I didn&#39;t try the falafel sandwich, but it looked like there were three large falafels in the sandwich with a variety of other sandwich-y ingredients.

The portions were quite large; one falafel sandwich could have easily fed two of someone my size. The prices were as follow:

Homos Sandwich: $4.75
Falafel Sandwich: $5.75
Tabbouleh Salad: $4.95

My total came out to around $29, a bit steep for a few decent sandwiches and a salad, but again, the portions were large, so I guess it&#39;s not too bad.

The lady on the phone sounded very nice. When I went to pick up, there was no one In the restaurant. The interior looked clean and very spacious.

If you think Garbanzo is the pinnacle of Middle Eastern cuisine, you might not. For me, Beirut Grill stands at the top of the Lebanese restaurants in Denver - and I&#39;ve eaten A LOT of Middle Eastern food here (and grew up on it).

We arrived at Beirut Grill on a Saturday night and it was quiet (except they definitely seem to do a good takeout business) - it was also Valentine&#39;s day, which might have made them quieter than normal (we don&#39;t do V-Day). The ambiance in the place isn&#39;t why you come here - it looks almost like a Greek diner - the interior is very basic but clean and comfortable enough.

Our waitress came up to us promptly with menus, bringing water shortly thereafter. We ordered a mint tea, the pickle plate (I&#39;m a total sucker for kabees el lift - those beet-pink pickled turnips), a vegetarian combo, and a King combo. The portions were massive - we had plenty of leftovers, and the quality and freshness of the food was excellent.

The hummus and baba ganoush were outstanding, with the hummus easily the best I have had in America - so much tahini, super fluffy and smooth and perfect. The baba ganoush, as someone with a food allergy discovered - was made with walnuts, which is actually somewhat common in Lebanon (an aside - if you&#39;re not familiar with a culture&#39;s food and you have a food allergy - it&#39;s probably best to ask if that food contains it) and was also super delicious.

The fattoush salad was the best I&#39;ve had in America, also - very flavourful with crisp, fresh vegetables.Tabbouleh was also great. The pita were very obviously made in house and they were excellent - I am partial to the thinner, Lebanese-style pita rather than the overly thick ones you find in American grocery stores. I didn&#39;t eat the meat, but my boyfriend seemed very impressed with the quality and preparation. All in all, we had a fantastic meal here for very little money. 

The only thing I was so-so on was the baklawa, but I&#39;m very biased as I&#39;m partial to a specific family recipe - and it was only $2, so not an expensive &#39;mistake&#39;. It wasn&#39;t bad baklawa, it just wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. Service was friendly and attentive - you can tell they really care about what they do here. 

I honestly cannot wait to eat here again, and I&#39;m almost glad that I don&#39;t live closer because I would probably gain ten pounds from eating there. Yislamo!"

I ordered food for delivery.  I received my appetizer and drink, but someone else&#39;s lunch.  I ordered the lamb and beef schwarma, and received a few falafels, a stuffed grape leaf and a salad.  

When I called the restaurant to try and let them know that I received the wrong order, and that I&#39;d like it replaced, the guy answering the phone didn&#39;t speak English, only Spanish, and said no one there spoke English....how could you have someone answering the phones who can&#39;t help customers when they call?

I definitely won&#39;t be ordering from here again.  Food is usually good, but not good enough to deal with what I just did.  Glad I don&#39;t have food allergies, etc., so I&#39;m able to eat this other person&#39;s lunch.  I ordered a meat dish, I received a vegetarian one...hope the other party doesn&#39;t have to order more food."

The amount of food you get especially for the price was great! The hummus is to die for and the all the meats were delicious as well. 

Now we know we can probably order one meal for both of us because we were delivered so much but now we have left overs for lunch.

We ordered the king combo as well as the gyro. We will absolutely order again. The only reason I didn&#39;t give this 5 stars is due because we got no taziki sauce and the falafel left something to be desired."

correctly it was good.
The Restaurant is family run, they were distant but quite pleasant.
I took off a star because the TWO deserts we tried were...how should I say eloquently..
YUCK!
I thought maybe its our taste buds but I am sure now that I would never order them again.

The veggie dishes are definitely their strong suit - fresh, flavorful - especially the tabouleh, hummus, babaganoush, and dolmas. They make their pita bread to order! Fluffy, yeasty, and hot. 

Meat-wise. If you don&#39;t already like lamb, know that their lamb is LAMBY. I couldn&#39;t put it down (I&#39;m not into gamey meats, try as I might) but it was cooked perfectly. Their beef dishes were also so-so, as was the kafta. 

But the chicken! The chicken was where it was at. The chicken kebab was good but the shwarma was the best. I could eat a pound of the stuff on their tasty rice.

Also, if you&#39;re needing a little pick-me-up or digestif, get thee some peppermint tea. 

Service was nice albeit slow (we were there at the end of service and were in no rush, but still). 

Not a bad little joint though I will only stop by if in the hood - not quite mind-blowing enough to make the trek out."

I know they have a $$ ranking, but for the $15 or so you spend on a meal, it is easily enough to feed 2: so bring a friend or be ready to enjoy it again later. 

 Even better, they deliver. So if you are in the Englewood area, do let the one time we had the meat a bit too cooked dissuade you from trying this place out."

The Chicken schwarma sandwhich is delicious and at $5.50 for lunch and dinner a great value for the amount of food you get.

The owner is very nice and the two servers they have are always nice and respectful.

The only issue I have when ordering tale out is that I feel they can be rather disorganized.  Last time I ordered food to go I ordered two chicken schwarma&#39;s to go and they only made one for me.  I live 20 minutes away and the place was packed so I did not want to wait for them to make me a new one.  For this I had to take one star away but this issue is fixable as long as they can be a bit more organized.

Bottom line is that the food is the closest to the middle eastern food I would get back in Michigan which is just like eating it in the middle east."

First off, when my boyfriend walked in they were dead.  There were 3 people in the whole place and it didn&#39;t appear that there were any employees there.  As we walked through, a guy popped up from behind the register.  He had actually been hidden behind the desk talking on his cell phone.  He made us wait while he told the person on the other end of his phone to hold on.

When he sat us, he asked what we would like to drink.  We both chose water.  Personally, I was ready to walk out when he brought us both giant glasses of water...WITH FOAM ON THE TOP.  Against my better judgement we stayed.

The whole time we were there my skin crawled and I couldn&#39;t stop staring at the foamy water, in what I could only assume was a soapy glass.  If he thought it was appropriate for water to have a thick layer of foam that never went away--what else would they do to my food?!

My boyfriend ordered the Kings Combo Plate &amp; I got some other (unmemorable) dish.  After the trauma of being in that building, I still braved a taste.  The food was actually a bit bland.  The hummus was good.  But the pita was SAD.  It was something between a tortilla and fried bread and was still a little doughy in the middle.  I have made pita before and that was not it.

The worst part was the aftermath of the food.  Who knows, maybe they just used soapy plates to go with the soapy glass, but it gave us both some pretty gnarly intestinal issues  for at least 2 days after we ate...

Never, ever going back here."

Ryan K. and I are big fans of Beirut Grill for the delicious cantaloupe juice and entrees. Cantaloupe juice, you ask? Yes: freshly pureed cantaloupe tastes so creamy here, and you get a big glass of the juice. I have yet to see any other place that serves this!

The entrees: there are the classic Middle Eastern dishes such as kabob, falafel, etc. But there&#39;s also the lamb shank dish, which is a huge serving of stewed lamb with steamed vegetables over rice. There&#39;s also the &#34;pies&#34; they have in three flavors: cheese, lamb, and spinach. You can order these as small appetizers or as an entree with two per flavor for a total of six little pies. Might not look filling, but I was full after having this seemingly light meal.

A bonus: you get freshly made hummus with warm (sometimes hot--be careful!) pita bread with each entree you order. Something about the warmed pita bread is just so comforting....

Service is always quick and attentive here. I think we usually go on off-hours/off-days because the place is usually not so busy. I sure hope Beirut Grill gets good business generally, because they have great food!"

Went in on a Monday with friends after reading Yelp reviews.  The place was almost empty, though another group came in while we were there and several people came in to pick up take out.
We decided to just sample a bunch of different appetizers - and they were ALL excellent.  Friends raved about the spinach pie. Hummus and warm pita was super yummy - and they brought us more pita bread because we gobbled up our first stack. Grape leaf wrappy things weren&#39;t too sour, very flavorful. The strawberry juice was wonderful and the cantaloupe juice was also a big hit.
Our server was very very nice.  He apologized for his English but I thought his English was admirable. 
Overall everything was clean, quiet and relaxing.  Friends wanted me to give a thumbs up to the slideshow they ran on the tv in the corner - beautiful pictures in natural settings.

The ambience is a little quirky--crooked pictures, older furniture, etc. We were immediately greeted and told we could sit anywhere we liked. Place was very clean. The server was the only person we saw, he served as host/server/waiter/etc, and was nice.
I ordered the strawberry mango juice and my husband ordered the strawberry juice. The drinks were really fresh and basically just tasted like pureed fruit, which was tasty.
They brought out super fresh pitas (piping hot) and hummus, the hummus was quite thin and smooth, and was yummy (: we ordered the vegetarian combo (myself) and the meat combo (husband). I apologize as this is where the review will get a little bumpy as I don&#39;t know the names of the individual foods that came on my plate. The finely chopped green salad was very tart (surprisingly so), so I couldn&#39;t eat that all at once, but mixed with the rice was good. The grape leaf wrap was good, and so were the little fried balls (2 on the plate total). I really enjoyed the veggie salad type thing that came on the plate, the veggies were crisp and the onion was not overpowering, which I&#39;m usually very sensitive to.
Though I didn&#39;t try it, my husband really enjoyed the meat combo and stated that all of the meat was really tender.
I also ordered a baklava to go, which I haven&#39;t tried just yet (literally just got home from eating here), but it looks beautiful! 
Best part is that it was very inexpensive for the amount of food--you&#39;ll pay more for delivered pizza.

I enjoyed the Vegetarian Combo: a combination of two falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, tabouleh, fatoush salad, a grape leaf, and rice, served with two pieces of what i can only assume is homemade pita. The food was seriously delicious, but unfortunately, it was also really oily. The falafel is perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked but again, fried, so heavy. I had a LOT of hummus and baba ganoush--way more than I could possibly eat alone. The fatoush was refreshing and the vegetables were super fresh. The pita seemed a bit undercooked, but the longer it sat out, the better it was. The only thing I didn&#39;t enjoy was the grape leaf...it was spicy but not flavorful and oddly chewy. 

I&#39;ll likely try Beirut Grill again, both because it was convenient and yummy, but I think I&#39;ll have to share my food with somebody else so that I&#39;m not overloaded with oil."

I had the meat combo and she had the kafta kabobs. The wife is a pretty picky eater, so mediterranean food is a little ambitous for her, but we both really enjoyed our meal.

I also had the mango juice again. Apparently, mangos aren&#39;t in season right now becasue while it was good, it tasted like the mango wasn&#39;t quite ripe, and it wasn&#39;t nearly as sweet or rich as last time.

The pita bread came to our table piping hot and puffy with steam still on the inside. We had to wait a couple of minutes for it to cool off.

It may sound strange, but the fresh, house-made pita bread will keep me coming here. I love how it&#39;s crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.

I think this place may be more popular for take out as I always run into other people picking up their food, but never see many people in the dining room. Regardless, the food is fantastic!

We usually get the King Combo, which is the best of both worlds: a mix of both their meat and veggie combo as well as the Fatoush. The food is very fresh! The falafel is some of the best I&#39;ve had: fried just enough for a crunch outside but fluffy and soft in the middle. Their meats are grilled perfectly and the fatoush is pretty tasty too. 

Finally, the staff is some of the friendliest I&#39;ve met and the service is prompt. My food is usually ready 15-20 minutes after I call in the order.

Thanks to Yelp, when I found myself wandering Broadway and hungry, I found Beirut Grill.  Yay, Yelp!

It was mid-afternoon, and we were the only other table aside from a single man already eating as we walked in.  The solitary server was cleaning up from what looked like their Lunch Rush.  And that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m happy to see cleaning.

The two of us just wanted a &#34;nosh&#34;... So naturally we ordered the largest thing on the menu:  The King Combo.  Basically, a little bit of everything for $15.  Hey, we shared.  Don&#39;t judge me!!

The pitas, while thin (which is not my favorite) are incredibly fresh.  The meal came with two, and a little platter of Hummus (&#34;Homos&#34;) and Baba Ganouj.  Both were amazing. 

The King Combo platter came with:

Salad
Tabouleh
Rice
Chicken Kebab pieces.
Lamb Kebab pieces.
Chicken Shawarma.
Beef Shawarma.
2 Giant Falafel.
A Dolmade.
Kefthedes from a Kebab.
Tsastiki.
Garlic Cream.
Pickled something.  Pink.  Good.

Seriously.  All that, plus the pitas, hummus, and baba ganouj for $15.  Holy COW!

And it was GOOD.  It was pretty darn close to GREAT.

They&#39;re open late (But not ALWAYS &#39;Til 11, even though that&#39;s what the menu says.  The waiter told me on weekdays, it&#39;s usually 9:30-10pm, but that&#39;s still late for Colorado!)  The place was clean, the price is definitely right, and the food straight up ROCKS.

I&#39;m so excited to come back and try more.  (Those pies in the photos look fantastic.)"

It&#39;s my understanding that lamb is a young sheep, perhaps no more than a year or two old. Lamb is more popular than the older mutton because the meat is mild, absent of the gamey flavor the older animal takes on. This seasoned and sautéed beef and lamb dish was basically unpalatable for this guy who is pretty open-minded to different tastes and cuisines.  My conclusion: it was definitely not lamb. It could have been mutton,  goat, or..?  It could have been careless preparation, but my hunch is to the former."

It&#39;s just a few blocks from my place and it&#39;s a staple for those nights when we find ourselves without enough supplies or time on hand to cook dinner. The King Combo with extra pitas and hummus is enough to stuff two people easily. Their falafels are delicious and their tabbouleh is to die for. And the pitas! Yum!

As far as dining in the restaurant - I would not recommend it, the decor is awkward and the lighting is tacky bright fluorescent. Every time that I&#39;m there picking up my food there are only people at 1 or 2 tables and it seems really awkward. Definitely not a fancy &#34;date night&#34;spot by any means, but a great place to mow down on some delicious middle eastern food."

Got take out from here and it was awful.  Chicken shawarma looked like it was scraped off the bone the previous day, left in a warming pan, and allowed to dry out.  The meat also lacked any of the typical seasoning that usually accompanies shawarma.  The rice was neither basmati or saffron but did contain vermicelli which, while not terrible, was disappointing.  The pita on first glance looked good, only for us to discover that it was majorly undercooked and smelled and tasted doughy.  We even threw the pita in a pan to try save it, with no success. The falafel had clearly been cooked in old oil based on the after taste.  The only bright spot was the hummus which was decent.

For the life of me, I cannot understand why this place has received the glowing reviews that it has.  We&#39;ve tried Middle Eastern and Lebanese places all over Denver and Boulder, and this was by far the worst experience we&#39;ve ever had.

Try Damascus grill or better yet House of Kabob and skip Beirut Grill altogether."

I drive (and when I didn&#39;t have a car took a very long scooter trip) down to Englewood just for their deliciousness. King combo- crazy yummy. Veggie combo- omg yes. Specifically they have the best baba ganoush I&#39;ve ever had. It has pomegranate juice in it which somehow just works SO well. I also really love the vibe here. It&#39;s not fancy, it&#39;s in a strip mall tucked away, super mom and pop, and reminds me of the family restaurants back home in the Detroit area which is full of amazing middle eastern cuisine.

So on this particular night in the main strip of Englewood down Broadway, we went to the Beirut Grill.  

The place was empty and a few people filed in here and there and I was like, oh oh.  But the lady was very nice and accommodating.  So for Middle Eastern Cuisine, we started with some hummus, which tasted incredibly fresh and different.  I also had some baba ganoush.  Both were incredible.  

I figured I could not go wrong with the meat combo and man it was probably the best middle Eastern food I have ever had.  Everything tasted fresh.  The only knock on this place is that service was ridiculously slow.  Apart from that, the food is definitely worth it."

We had to wait a few minutes before being greeted, but the waiter was kind and efficient. We placed an order for hummus, a banana shake, and the vegetarian combo. 

The shake came out right away and was super smooth and refreshing. Our hummus arrived a few minutes later and just melted in our mouths! The pita bread was incredibly fresh and the hummus was creamy and flavorful. 

About 15 minutes later our food finally makes its way to our table. It was definitely worth the wait! Everything on our veggie combo was prepared to perfection! The tabbouleh was crisp, light and tangy. The falafel balls were hearty, perfectly crisped and tasted great. From the grape leaves to the baba ganoush, the entire meal was so delicious.

i ordered take out the other day and couldn&#39;t even eat my meal. the pita bread is more like a cross between Mu Shu Pancake &amp; Flour Tortillas. the Chicken Shawarma was dry and lacked seasoning. the rice seemed like it was days old and my little side salad was brown. 

the veggie combo was a huge let down again they couldn&#39;t even eat it. the falafel seemed like a box mix and was over fried. . the baba ghanouj was nasty and the grape leaves are canned for sure.

We had the grilled mushrooms and pickle plate to start (both good, the mushrooms were fantastic). For dinner we had the King Platter  which provided a solid opportunity to sample most of the vrgetarian and meat items. The King platter is definitely enough food for two people so consider the poetion size when ordering.

The lamb and chicken were great, the beef was OK. The recipies used are more authentic so you may need to try different combinations of items to find the flavor that best suits you. They will deliver to the local area as long as the order is $20 or more.

Almost forgot - they have a lunch special until 3pm Mon - Sat,  currently $8.99

There was a vacuum in the middle of the floor as if they were getting ready to close and clean-up (it was a Saturday afternoon).  We seated ourselves and was greeted immediately by a friendly server.

We started with a hummus appetizer, which was delicious - in fact, we placed a second order.  My daughter go a Veggie combo meal, while I went with the meat combo meal.  Overall I enjoyed my meal, although the meat was slightly dry (as if it had been frozen).

The restaurant was pretty empty on a friday night, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the attendane factor seems to have no connection to the food quality at the places. We had our pick of seats and tried a booth, which was marginally comfortable. Our greeting was prompt and polite, but not particularly warm. The decor is weird mix of 90&#39;s breakfast house and mid-east trinket shop. No biggie.

Service was consistent and polite throughout the meal, and our drinks stayed full. There was one waitress, which was appropriate for the low attendance. The place was dead silent when we showed up with the two other tables wispering out of discomfort. About halfway through the meal a few parties showed up and the waitress threw on some standard mid-east tunes, which helped the atmosphere immensely. 

The restrooms are ancient and the urinal was broken, but they were completely immaculate. I don&#39;t think I have ever seen such clean restrooms at restaurant with plates under $30. Clean restrooms are usually a good sign of a clean kitchen and health standards. Kudos.

The pita with hummus and babaganoush came out during the brief 10 minute wait for our food, and it was top notch. The pita was the freshest I have had anywhere, and was hot right out the oven. The hummus was super smooth with a nice kick of tahini, and the babaganoush had good eggplant flavor without any stringy chunks. 

The main dishes were quite reasonable with nothing exceeding $15 and portions being generous. We tried the lamb shank and king&#39;s platter. The shank was extremely tender, well trimmed, and had excellent flavor-the best I have had in a long time. The rice and fatoush I had with it was also well seasoned and very fresh. The king&#39;s platter was varied, but none of it was bad. The tabouli was very good, falafel was fantastic, and both chicken and beef kabobs were very good. The chicken and beef shawarma were just average, and the kefta was a bit dry, but flavor was still decent. The grape leaf was good and tender, especially for this time of year, but was tad over seasoned.  I have had plenty of inedible grape leaves, so this was still pretty good.

The only subpar items are the tea which is bit off in flavor, and the pastries, which had for takeout on seperate visit. The baklava and knaffe are both too syrupy and have an odd chewy texure. It is almost impossible to find a great chef that does great pastries, so I am not too bothered by this.

Overall, Beirut Grill is a great value with a little room for improvement, and I wish I would have given them a try years ago due them being in the neighborhood."

The kimchi ramen is amazing and just the right amount of spice! The gyoza is the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. I live near by and will be bringing all my out of town visitors here!"

Which is essential to any top shelf ramen. Hard boiled eggs aren&#39;t the same. Cheap substitute. Also, they got rid of several of the best appetizer options, including their best item, the sisho gyoza. The new menu is a downgrade. This breaks my heart after my previous 5 star review below:

My girlfriend and I live down the street and have a Sunday tradition of ordering ramen to go. We&#39;ve tried them all (they keep adding new ones) and they are always stellar. They&#39;re excellent at packaging it to go too so that you can go home and mix it together and get it like it was right there straight from Ototo&#39;s kitchen. Love the shiso gyoza as a side too. I love all three of the dens, but for ramen I&#39;m all about the Ototo."

The host wasn&#39;t friendly but was professional and polite. She managed to get us a seat at community table, which we accepted just to avoid waiting longer. While waiting outside for 5 minutes, the friendly manager notified us that our seats are ready.
My husband ordered a old fashioned special, which is actually a punch with whiskey, St Germaine and orange juice. I loved it while he wanted something stronger. I ordered a flight of 3 sake and later ordered a bottle of one that we really liked, Taisetsu Junmai Ginjo, not realizing that it&#39;s $20 for a glass and $38 for a bottle. But it didn&#39;t matter because 2 small glasses equal $40 but a bottle (or 6 glasses) is $38 so it&#39;s a better deal. 
We ordered a full squid, pork steamed buns, ribeye and Buta kimchi. All very delicious! We will order them again at our next visit. 
The manager came to our table, asking how we are doing and we complimented about the food. The reviews warned about slow service, so we came prepared. We ordered our drinks and a nigiri dish at the same time. When our waitress came back, we ordered all the dishes that we wanted to try. She brought one dish at a time, so we were never waiting or starving. We just enjoyed dining and talking. :)"

As soon as you walk in, you smell the hickory smoke. They share some of the same Sakes and dishes, i.e. miso butter eggplant, but Ototo&#39;s atmosphere is much more casual, and you pay less $$$ for the same sake. Our fave was the organic Kikusui Junmai Ginjo. Light, fruity, not too sweet. Goes down like honeysuckle flavored water. 

Even though the menu is largely  focused on grilled meats and seafood, there are plenty of veg options. The Agedashi Tofu with tempura fried yams was excellent, as were the smoky grilled asparagus and shiitakes. Who needs steak when you can have a meaty grilled mushroom? The flash fried brussels sprouts with grapefruit sections were amazing. Each grilled dish comes with house made pickles, a very Japanese thing, which I appreciated. 

For the adventurous or curious, they have a seaweed dish or burdock &amp; carrots sautéed kinpira style, both very typical in Japanese home-cooking and healthy to boot. Lots of gluten-free options as well. Also expect to see lots of fatty meats and seafood, like salmon collar.  They even snuck in some non-Japanese menu items, like French fries and steamed pork buns. 

Do yourself a favor and order the Unagi- grilled eel. This is the real deal, like they prepare it in Japan. Grilled eel basted in its own marinade and fat. Usually, when you have this at a sushi joint, it&#39;s canned and doused in fake eel sauce. You can taste the difference. It melts on your tongue. 

I was a little disappointed in the dessert options, the mochi ice cream being the only gluten-free item and also the most Japanese. A little more creativity and authenticity would be nice here. But I get it, it&#39;s not a dessert kind of place. The fact they even serve them is a bonus."

They specialize in tapas (or, small plates) and serve items you could consume as meals too.

I came with two others and we all had ramen. We immediately all agreed that the ramen here wasn&#39;t as good as the ramen in the Bay Area or in Japan. But, it was pretty good for what it was. I had the vegetable ramen. The noodles looked like instant ramen noodles and the broth didn&#39;t taste all that spectacular, but the veggies were good!

The service was friendly and helpful, and the ambience was actually really great. The interior was really clean and modern. The garages was open the night I went, so there was a nice breeze AND there was no wait. Woohoo!

A tip: The key to making this place work is to bring good company."

Three of us went to their sake pairing dinner event, which happens once a month, and had an amazing time. It was clear that Yasu, one of the owners, was focused on his guests having an informative and immensely enjoyable experience. 

Over the course of the evening we learned a lot about sake. We had a chance to try six varietals and an additional two that were rare, surprise picks. There&#39;s a wide range of sake out there far better than the hot stuff offered at your average sushi joint! The servers&#39; pours were generous, and they were happy to offer an extra pour or two of your favorites as well. (Be careful, though, sake is strong...)

Our food was delicious and each course was well matched to a sake. The sashimi was of the highest quality, of course. Everything on the menu (which I&#39;ve included in this review) was fantastic. Our friend doesn&#39;t eat lamb, and Yasu had a completely separate dish made for her on the spot, which was also phenomenal.

William Greene, their sake sommelier among other duties, spent half an hour discussing Japanese whiskeys with our group after the dinner was over. We were quite impressed by his knowledge and appreciated the time that he, and everyone hosting the event, were willing to spend with guests. 

$100/person including tax and tip is an amazing deal for this experience! I&#39;ll be buying tickets for my parents&#39; anniversary next month."

Ototo has been on our list for awhile, and the dining experience we had elevated that average Sunday to being one of the most memorable meals I have engaged in.

As Sushi Den and Izakaya Den fans, we were surprised and excited to see menu is incredibly different than its sister restaurants. Fairly large, we opted to try one or two things from each section: ramen, seafood, skewers, etc. The plates are all small--think tapas here--so the bill can add up pretty quickly.

The first round of dishes we ordered were the grilled pork belly, the whole squid, and sashimi. The pork belly is a tad bit dry because it was grilled, but you have to try it with the Yuzu-Kosho that it&#39;s served with. The flavors really complement one another. The whole squid was good and the sashimi was nothing special if you&#39;ve had sushi at Sushi Den before. 

The second round we ordered Garlic Sautéed Oysters and TanTan Men ramen. The ramen was delicious, but definitely not a traditional ramen. The garlic oysters were HANDS DOWN my favorite dish. Four gigantic oysters so meaty they had to be sliced in half, served delectably warm and coated in a delicious sauce--it warmed by belly and my heart. 

Will definitely have to come back here for happy hour and for those garlic oysters. Great pick if you love Japanese food but want something other than sushi!"

This is a place you go to snack on things, not necessarily to get full off of.  We did go elsewhere to eat afterwards, but that was because our tab was adding up.  We had miso soups, tuna sliders, agedashi tofu and the grilled squid.  Very flavorful, but again it leaves you wanting more.  I don&#39;t think I need to go back for a while because I know we get very similar things at a cheaper place."

This place is a wonderful hidden gem that still hasn&#39;t drawn the masses. I have been to Ototo on multiple occasions and ordered a variety of things and not once have I been disappointed.

First and foremost, the small ramen bowls are HUGE. My husband and I have split one in addition to other items and have had tons left over. I would definitely recommend ordering either that or the rice bowls - they are both delish and a fun thing to share!

Secondly - if you are into seafood, I would definitely recommend the prawns and/or the bacon wrapped scallops! They are both amazing (and I am definitely a seafood snob hailing from SoCal). The pork belly is also to die for - the hubs ordered two plates last time we were there/

Quick tip - this is a small plates place and I would definitely recommend coming with an appetite. Also - valet is free in front of sushi den and is included for Ototo. I have definitely driven around looking for parking and the complimentary valet makes things so much better. 

We will definitely be back here soon! Both the hubs and I love this place and can&#39;t wait to come again."

The dinner event started at 6:00pm and we were seated right away at a great table and were able to mingle for about 15~20 minutes and then had a 15~20 minutes of Short Sake Talk given by the Sake Specialist, Melanie. Yasu and his team chose the sakes just for this event (it is because these are often &#34;go-to sake&#34; for the sake drinkers in Japan, therefore restaurant owners tend to carry these sakes on the sake list in Japan).

We went ahead and ordered Kirin Beers when we were seated. The dinner started with Passed Appetizers (Monkfish Kara-age and Shrimp &amp; Brussel Sprouts Seasoned with Salt &amp; Truffle Oil). Absolutely Delicious!!

We then went to the first of 6 Courses:

1. Sashimi (Fresh Catch of the Day) and Oyster on the Half Shell with Ponzu and Cocktail Sauce paired with the Junmai Daiginjo Sake called Takasago Divine Droplets. Again, perfect pairing and the sake just made the food taste even better!!
2. Miso Marinated Grilled Cod, Canadian Karobuta Pork Belly with Aguri Style, and Kinpira Vegetable paired with a Tokubetsu Junmai Sake called Ama no To Heaven&#39;s Door. This was just Heavenly!!
3. Pan Seared Jumbo Diver Scallop with Lime Basil Garlic Butter Sauce paired with a Junmai Daiginjo Sake called Konteki Pearls of Simplicity. This dinner just kept getting better and better!!
4. Sushi/6 pieces - Catch of the Day Fish from the Market (Aburi Toro, Aburi Salmon Belly, Kobe Beef, Sawara, Tuna Roll and BBQ Unagi Roll paired with a Daiginjo Sake made in Kyoto called Konteki Tears of Dawn. Absolutely Fabulous!!
5. Seared Medallion of Young Colorado Lamb drizzled with Basil Aioli paired with a Nanbu Bijin Ancient Pillars Sake. Another explosion of flavor!!
6. Green Tea Soy Milk Panna Cotta paired with the Tozai Snow Maiden Sake. Absolutely a great end to a perfect sake pairing dinner!!

My favorite Sake was the Takasago Divine Droplets (went down so smooth!). The fish was flown in that day from Japan and you could definitely tell everything was high quality and the Sake was Premium. 

The OTOTO Restaurant was the perfect setting for this wonderful feast. Service was top-notch and loved learning about the different Sake varieties.

Make sure you sign up to receive the Sushi Den/Izakaya Den/OTOTO Newsletter because the Sake Pairing Dinners are definitely a must to try--next one is on 19 April 2016!!

The concept is that OTOTO will offer a traditional Japanese Izakaya menu including Robata-yaki, and will not be serving sushi and rolls here. In Japanese cuisine, robatayaki (literally &#34;fireside-cooking&#34;), often shortened to just robata, refers to a method of cooking, similar to barbecue, in which items of food on skewers are slow-grilled over hot charcoal. You may know it as yakitori. Traditionally, the food consists of a combination of morsels of seafood and vegetables, but other kinds of food that are suitable for grilling such as chicken, pork belly, Wagyu beef will also be offered.

Well, our group was starved so we had 12 dishes.  12.  and about 6 pitchers of sake. I was so in the moment, I forgot to take photos!

 Everything, everything was delicious but the stand out highlights of this menu via me and the British Boyfriend are:

1. TONKOTSU RAMEN
2. GRILLED PORK BELLY
3. Little Fried Chicken starters!
4. WATER OF GOD SAKE

The restaurant is impeccably designed in true Sushi Den style, but has a more casual &#34;beer and Sake&#34;, Happy Hour &amp; Tapas feel.  The price point is significantly more casual than Sushi Den too! I will come again and again. Can&#39;t wait for a cold day and another bowl of Ramen!"

I have tried Yakitori in California, New York, and over Japan so I can tell you this yakitori is mediocre. They are not  tasty at all. We tried to order a few plates to share:  grilled squid, chicken wings, chicken liver, gizzard, waygu beef, chicken yakitori, beef tongue- they are pretty bland and not very flavorful - Beef Tongue was very chewy, almost like chewing on leather. 
My friend ordered at Tonkatsu rice bowl and that was decent. Dessert was not bad . We enjoyed the pinnaple upside down cake . Our server was very friendly but other than that, food wasn&#39;t excellent. Don&#39;t think I would come back here."

I love eating tapas style (small bites, lots of flavors), and this is , in my terms, a Japanese tapas restaurant. We tried a bunch of things and can say that everything was very good or excellent. The tuna carpaccio was our favorite. For a real unique flavor try the brussel sprouts with grapefruit. Who&#39;d guess this would work?

Tuna Carpaccio***
Spicy Edamame
Agedashi Tofu
Vegetable Tempura
Sautéed Gyoza Dumpling
Grilled Beef Short Ribs
Steamed Lobster Wonton
Brussels Sprouts

We were there for father&#39;s day dinner and surprisingly, the place wasn&#39;t full. Across the street there was the usual crowd waiting outside Sushi Den. So, if you don&#39;t want to wait, but have excellent Japanese food head across the street.

There are some not so great tables, We sat at one of them. They&#39;re in the hallway connecting the front to the back and face the wait stations. Try to avoid those. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful in navigating the menu. You won&#39;t find a robust cocktail menu, but there are loads of sakes and beers.

Parking is always a challenge on Pearl. There is valet in front of Sushi Den if you don&#39;t want the hassle.

You can easily over order, so go slow and absorb each round. We pushed ourselves to the limit and, for four people, got out for a little under $200 before tip. That included 4 cocktails and 2 desserts."

Unfortunately it turn out to be a little disappointing. First, there was too much smell of food coming from the kitchen, I could tell I was going to leave smelling like stir fry. Second, despite I love the &#34;small plates&#34; type of food, they were delivered in a really slow pace, one every 10 min, and in a weird order (grilled veggies at the end?).

My son and I eat a lot of Asian food, my parents, not so much, but everyone left more than satisfied.

For vegetarians, the menu is limited. My son, who is a vegetarian, ordered the vegetable ramen, which had an unusually good broth. 

Aside from the ramen, the menu is largely based on small plates. 2-3 plates per person is enough for people with average appetites. This doesn&#39;t make for a cheap meal, but it&#39;s quite reasonable for a special night.

We started with chicken hearts, gizzards, and liver skewers, which were delicious. (I&#39;m going from the online menu--the in-house menu had another name. Someone probably suggested that a list of innards wasn&#39;t all that appetizing, even though the actual thing is.) Agedashi tofu (with vegetables) was a standout. The eggplant in particular had a rich flavor and a great consistency--firm but not chewy, almost like a pate. The tuna belly sliders were also delicious--a little like Peking duck in bao (rather than the pancake)--and a good way to go if you want to pay a little less for something filling. Hamachi Kama and vegetable tempura were what you would expect, but done perfectly."

The first time we came the service was not so great but we chalked it up to valentine&#39;s day.  We came back this weekend hoping for a better service  but I was very disappointed.  We tried to make rsvp the same day which can&#39;t happen cause of their policy.  Okay that&#39;s fine  but if ur gonna tell us it will be 15 minutes ish for wait time but took 45 minutes, it&#39;s kindna bad estimation.  The hostess finally got to us but it wasn&#39;t a table, it was a seats at the window, umm that&#39;s not a table, but fine, we asked her for the seats by the chefs cause my brother wanted to see the chefs cook, umm.. that can&#39;t happen because the hostess told us the waiter was way behind..and it would be another 15 minutes even though there were 2 people in that entire section that&#39;s not really a good enough excuse for us, we settled for the window seats.  I just don&#39;t know why theyre so behind when the resturant is not even that big with so many waiters.  Our waitress was fine, forgot our straws.. fine.  We asked for some extra peppers since we had 3 people and I knew the plates only came with one.. we got an amazing 2 extra  peppers.. are these peppers really that expensive for a dinner of $150..  by the time we got our food.. it was last call  and we had to order our dessert while we still had two plates of food coming... our dessert sat there melting away while we rush to finish our food(we got there at 730pm and last call was at 845).  And whoever is in charge of ordering supplies needs to do a better, the resturant was once again out of food on the main menu..all collars, a bunch if other stuff.  food once again was great but the service, mainly hostesses were crappy.  I guess I&#39;ve been spoiled with the service provided by both dens next door.  I want to love this place cause their food is awesome, even if they&#39;re over priced, but they need to improve their service and raise their level to their other resturants.  Ototo is stands for little brother but their service  makes them look like the red headed step child."

I was traveling alone for work and stopped by Root Down for dinner before my flight back home.  I got TEATULIA Hibiscus Berry Iced Tea and the Colorado Lamb Sliders (Colorado Lamb, Bacon, TILLAMOOK Cheddar, Harissa Aioli, Arugula, Mint-Garlic Yogurt &amp; Sweet Potato Waffle Fries).  Everything was delicious.  The lamb was perfect and the sweet potato waffle fries were the crispiest sweet potato fries I&#39;ve ever had.  I also liked that the fries came with 3 yummy dipping sauces - ketchup and 2 unique flavors (not sure what was exactly in these sauces but I think one was like a curry flavor and the other was like a basil flavor...).  

The service was excellent from start to finish as well.  I also liked that I got a nice little dining area that was designed just for solo travelers.  I felt very comfortable dining by myself in the desk-type setup.  The decor at this restaurant is really nice too!  

Best dining experience at an airport.  Definitely eating here again if I ever go back to Denver!"

Apparently the other locations are VERY hard to get into.  Luckily, we had plenty of time to wait for our plane home and it wasn&#39;t busy, so we sat down with a nice view of the tarmac and ordered some food.

I would definitely suggest that you go with the creative stuff here.  I got the turkey bahn mi burger.  Husband got the regular bacon cheese.  I loved mine.  He was just kinda... meh on his.

I must have been feeling spontaneous because, vacation, because it wasn&#39;t something I normally would do.  I am super picky about turkey burgers, I&#39;d normally have just about anything besides them, if they&#39;re not seasoned right they taste gross.  This was perfect.  It had all the wonderful flavors of a bahn mi sandwich.  I&#39;d get it again!  

I&#39;m also not a sweet potato fan normally, but the sweet potato fries were perfectly salty which helps, and they came with a curry sauce.  Maybe that&#39;s how I start eating sweet potatoes more regularly (bleh)... dunk it in curry... hmmm...

Either way, it was worth the price (considering everything is at a premium at the airport), and we were in and out with plenty of time to catch our plane!"

I&#39;ve had both breakfast and dinner here and have never been disappointed. Food is excellent and the service is quick. The almond buttermilk pancakes were really good, but I probably preferred the breakfast burrito.

I had some time to kill before my flight home to Phoenix and Yelp pointed me to here for a good lunch. It&#39;s definitely got quirky vibes with the decor and menu. If you happen to sit towards the window or facing it, you&#39;ll get a good view of the airport and surrounding area. Only adds to the restaurant setting!

The hostesses take down your flight info before even sitting you down to make sure there&#39;s time to dine. That is a first for me in airport dining, and much appreciated. At each table they also provide you a large carafe of water.

The menu is fairly straightforward but with some twists. I couldn&#39;t decide what to order, so the waitress ordered the lamb sliders for me. So elated she did! The sliders definitely have a kick, but the yogurt on the side tames it down. With the plating the meal appears small [just 2 sliders + fries], but those are big sliders! The fries were nothing spectacular, but still good, with and without the curry dipping sauce. 

I was somewhat hungry after and thought about ordering dessert but my waitress told me they are just boxed desserts that they cut and serve. Delicious but nothing special, she advised, so I opted against them."

Staff are nice and friendly. I definitely recommend this place.

Update: I decided to stay here for a few hours and order launch as well. They never gave a bad inpression to me that I&#39;m staying too long.

I got the beef burger + sweet potato fries.  Both were delish.  The burger was really tender, thanks to the pork belly and the sweet potato fries were perfect.  The fries came with ketchup and curry sauce.  The curry sauce was good, but I didn&#39;t think it actually went with any of the food I got...  Also kind of thought $16 was expensive for a burger and fries.

Actually you could say that everything at Root Down is highly addictive and somewhat healthy.  Also, I get the feeling that is almost impossible to have a bad meal or experience because all the menu items are perfectly curated and the service is amazing.

The Banh Mi Turkey Burger tastes just like actual Banh Mi.  Thin turkey patty with actual lemongrass flavor, similar to nem nuong.  The waitress had no idea what I was saying when I told her that, she just smiled.  That happens often to me.

As many others have mentioned, the sweet potato waffle fries are noteworthy.
The quality of ingredients and overall friendly local-feeling atmosphere will bring me back every time.  Don&#39;t care if I have to walk a mile hauling a hundred pound suitcase and possibly late for my connecting flight.  If I step foot in Denver airport, I will make time for a meal at Root Down.

A short connection is what we originally had so I was a bit anxious we&#39;d be able to have dinner and make our flight. After arriving and going through customs to find out our hour connection is now three hours I knew we&#39;d have plenty of time.

We arrived to Root Down, luggage in tow and were offered seating in one of their lounge spaces until a larger table was available.

The décor of this place is probably one of the coolest I&#39;ve seen for airport dining.

I enjoyed a glass of wine and ordered the veggie burger. My son had a regular burger and my boyfriend had the turkey burger. The burgers on pretzel buns are really large. I could only finish about half. If you aren&#39;t too hungry, sharing would probably work best. My boyfriends on ciabatta appeared slightly smaller.

Our food was nicely done and enjoyable. The sweet potato fries weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had but the sriracha mayo was outstanding!

This is really a very nice option for the airport. I loved the individual tables for single diners.

and their post cards! If you know me, you know I&#39;m a big dork with a super massive post card collection - adding Root Downs from DIA is definitely a nice addition ;)

Stupidly, I was all bummed because my typical restaurant was in another terminal.  At a loss at where to eat, I &#34;yelped it&#34; (trademark that), and found Root Down.  

Coming in, I was asked how long until my flight.  I had a few hours, and I was alone, so the hostess seated me in this cool little grotto desk sorta seating.  It sat up high, stadium seating like, and faced the runway, so I could camp there for as long as I needed to, and watch the planes take off.  Fancy.  Decor was awesome, and kept me looking around to check the place out.  Super fun, super boho, super colorful and tasteful.

Now the food.  Tons of stuff on the menu, but I noticed my neighbors and I all ordering the same meal.  We were like triplets, from another mother.  The food was FANTASTIC.  There wasn&#39;t a thing that wasn&#39;t totally tasty.

Colorado Lamb Sliders: I love lamb and when in Colorado one must eat Colorado Lamb right?! The sliders were on the small side but they were packed with flavor. I loved the gaminess of the lamb. It was so juicy and it was perfectly cooked. The sweet potato waffle fries were pretyt good too.

Definitely one of the better airport meals I&#39;ve had if not the best. On the pricier side but good food ain&#39;t always cheap!"

The only reason why I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars is because I have only eaten there once, and I would need to try other items on the menu to be sure of its 5-star status.

I got the cobb salad, which came with deliciously crispy yet thick bacon, pickled red beets, and all the other standard fixins. The green goddess dressing is tangy - I got it on the side. Really friendly service too!"

We arrived at the Denver airport headed to Salt Lake City with a 4 1/2 hour layover ahead of us. Luckily, each of us were able to get a couple hours of work done, but then needed some lunch. We scanned the directory and looked up a couple places. Root Down had a great rating a ton of reviews so we made our way over to the C Concourse.

Definitely glad we made an effort to come here. It was pretty packed when we arrived but the staff was able to seat us immediately at a comfy table that wasn&#39;t too close to other nearby tables. I ordered the 1/2 pound beef burger with sweet potato fries. It was excellent. The service was also very attentive and made us feel welcome during our short visit. 

There were quite a few things on the menu that I wanted to try so next time I&#39;m back in Denver I&#39;ll definitely be stopping here for another meal!"

The salad I had was pretty lackluster ($14 for garden salad with chicken) + $16 for a 9 oz pour of cheap wine= $32 meal. I won&#39;t be coming back.

I&#39;m surprised by the quality and flavor of their food. For all us frequent travelers out there, you know good food is hard to find at airports. I seriously thought it was simply impossible. I just thought I had to find a place that didn&#39;t suck as bad as another place. That was my airport dining mentality but this place is just great. 

The service was excellent. We were seated quickly by the hostess, greeted promptly by the server and food was brought out amazingly fast. Plus I loved the decor of this place and the large windows to watch the planes rolling by. 

We started with the burrata and it was simply yummy. The burrata was creamy and perfectly paired with a balsamic arugula salad with roasted cherry tomatoes, dried mango, and crunchy toasted bread. Yum!

Then there was the super delicious Banh Mi Turkey burger. What a flavor explosion!! Loved the cucumber, daikon and carrot salad within and the tender and juicy turkey burger. I&#39;m not a big burger eater but if they all tasted like this I will probably have to change my ways."

Totally not what you think in terms of &#34;airport food.&#34; They definitely offer no-fuss, upscale and healthy options to appeal to anyone.
My husband loved his turkey burger with sweet potato waffle fries. I really enjoyed my smokey turkey on croissant with lettuce, tomato, avacado and a tangy aoili. Came with some house made chips, which were nice. Bloody Mary was a yummy, house-made mix which had the perfect amount of spice. They also offer local sodas on tap. The salads looked amazing here.

We had a four hour layover - plenty of time and empty stomachs. I looked on Yelp to find the highest rated airport food and this place with its burgers and waffle cut sweet potato fries was totally calling to me. So we made the journey from Concourse C to Concourse A. When we arrived we were told there would be a slight wait due to not having water (that whole chunk of the concourse was effected, even the bathrooms were closed). But the woman assured me that they were simply taking people in more slowly to avoid any problems. 

A few minutes later, we were seated! We even had glasses of water waiting for us! But there were plastic utensils due to not being able to wash anything. No problem for me!

We ordered almost immediately as there was one star on the menu (and on Yelp&#39;s page) - the Lamb Sliders!! It didn&#39;t take long for them to come out and we dug right in! The patty itself is made from lamb and bacon and it was bursting with flavor! And the curry sauce was perfect with the waffle fries!!

By the end of the meal, they had to close the restaurant. I felt bad for the people who would miss out. And grateful that we arrived just in time!

When our awesome server brought he check, he also brought a bottle of water for each of us! All in all, a great experience!"

It&#39;s definitely fun to have a quality restaurant on the concourse as options tend to be fast food or mediocre  sit down options. Hooray Root Down DIA.

You have to have enough time to actually sit down for a meal as service is quick but they are busy all the time. 

On my recent visit in late June my wife and I shared an appetizer of beet salad with burrata cheese. It was very good and full of flavor. We split two entrees of spicy lamb sliders (a little too much for both of our liking) and a croque madame sandwich. Both were available with gluten free bread, which is great as my wife is GF.

I&#39;ve been to the RD location in the Highlands, but have never visited this one in DIA. It was a great experience from start to finish - I was immediately greeted by the hostess, showed to a table, and had my drink order taken. For an entrée, I went with the Farm to Table salad, and this was honestly the best salad I&#39;ve ever had in my life... and I&#39;m not much of a salad lover.

The vibe is very chill, though the attention to detail in the aesthetic is still there, like the winding ramp up to the bar and the cute vintage travel displays built into the bar itself.

The beer selection is definitely awesome. I was excited to have some local CO beers, and the bartender was nice about giving me a taste of a few before I settled on one.

Then I found myself hungry and looked at the food menu. Root Down has a following outside of the airport, and they commit themselves to farm-to-table, organic, and unique cuisine. And I have to say, I would have eaten pretty much everything on their menu. I went for the Banh Mi Turkey Burger; I&#39;ve had some failed attempts of a combo like this elsewhere, but Root Down does it right. It was scrumptious and had all the right flavors.

Root Down has an incredible location downtown Denver, and when they opened up shop in the airport they did something no other airport restaurant has ever done - kept their integrity!

Using your airport restaurant as a platform to showcase all that your city has to offer, instead an opportunity to rip off stranded travellers? It doesn&#39;t seem like such a strange concept, does it? Root Down is pioneering a new path for local businesses.

I went with the Chilaquiles Benedict, as a suggestion from other reviewers and because I&#39;d get to try my Canadian tongue at saying &#34;chilaquiles&#34; for the first time in its life. &#34;Chilaquiles..

Very lucky that this place is located right in the heart of the Southwest Airlines terminal, since that is the airline we always seem to fly to Denver.  

First, they had a fantastic craft beer selection; I enjoyed a double IPA from Odell Brewing (based in Fort Collins, CO).   No better way to relax before a flight than a nice double IPA ...they had a triple as well, but that would have been gluttony. :)

My wife and I each opted for a different large salad.   She went for the Faro salad, while I went for the Cobb salad.   I added the honey salmon to mine, while she added a different type of salmon to hers.   I loved my salad, and she felt the same about hers.

Despite being packed to the gills we were seated within 5 minutes of giving our name.   The only downside, and this was our fault, was because we did not ask how long it would take to for the salads to come out.... we were on a tight schedule and we should have either mentioned that or asked how long the salads would take (it seemed to take about 15 - 20 minutes, which caused us to have to rush to eat this delicious food and also get to-go boxes to finish them).

I spent a night at O&#39;Hare about 15 years ago after I missed my flight to the UK due to tornado related delays, so I usually take a few hours here and there in stride. 

As I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m comfortably sitting out a 3-hour delay on a sofa at Denver International Airport, a big grin on my face, having just had a wonderful meal at Root Down. I was drawn here by the stellar Yelp reviews, and they richly deserve their 4-5 star rating. 

Root Down is designed to mimic an airplane, with decor including ailerons and instrumentation from actual airplanes (circa 1980s). There is nothing 1980s about the food and service though, it is 100% contemporary farm to table. 

I ordered the Colorado Lamb Sliders - two for $16 - and they were served with sweet potato waffle fries and three condiments:
- the first looked like an aioli but was a mint garlic yogurt - I enjoyed it tremendously. 
- the second looked like mustard, but tasted surprisingly sweet. When I asked, the waiter said it was a &#34;curry lime sauce&#34; - didn&#39;t matter what it was, it was DELISH! 
- the third looked like ketchup. And yes, it was ketchup. 

The sliders were excellent - the lamb was cooked medium and still retained its juices, and it was paired with arugula, bacon, Tillamook cheddar, and a harissa aioli - the flavors worked wonderfully, so kudos to chef Justin Cucci for this masterpiece. While perfectly good by themselves, my curiosity drove me to dip the sliders in the three sauces - they worked best with the yellow-curry-lime-sauce-that-looked-like-mustard. 

So if you find yourself stuck in Terminal 3 at Denver - don&#39;t despair. Head to Root Down and enjoy a wonderful meal. Bon appetit."

I got the turkey banh mi and it was SO GOOD! Really flavourful and super juicy. I only wish that the jalapenos on top were cut up inside too, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m a spice freak!

The best thing about Root Down is their fresh ingredients. They have a line every morning before they open at 7am and there&#39;s a reason for this. The food is wonderful.

Today I had the breakfast tacos and they were awesome. You get 3 of them and it comes with an arugula salad and crispy hot breakfast potatoes. This is a new item and ask for cholula hot sauce on the side. Another favorite is the cheeseburger. It comes with sweet potato fries, but guess what, they have regular fries all you have to do is ask for them. All the salads are great too. Super fresh. I get a turkey club often and it&#39;s like no other club you&#39;ve had before. I think it&#39;s the siracha mayo that makes it so good.

They have a lot of Colorado beers to choose from as well. Get to the airport early and enjoy breakfast, lunch or dinner here. Don&#39;t rush it here. The bar is super cool with suitcases embedded into the bar. The staff is friendly and if they have a window seat it&#39;s a bonus."

This place has a well deserved 5 stars not just for being an amazing airport restaurant, but for being an amazing restaurant in general. Here&#39;s why:

1. Atmosphere - the atmosphere is cool, hip, earthy..kind of what you would expect from a tendy new age restaurant. Someone clearly thought hard about style when they designed this restaurant, and it shows in everything from the unique arrangement of the tables to the design of the water pitchers to look like organic milk bottles.

2. Service - the staff were extremely friendly, despite the fact that I walked in 40 min prior to closing time. I did not feel rushed at all (although I rushed myself because I felt bad). I asked my waitress&#39;s for recommendations for beer and she was able to speak knowledgeably about several ipa styles before I finally decided on a milk stout (lol) because I felt like something creamy rather than hoppy. Her attitude was superb and I really appreciated it.

3. Food - of course, the most important. I got the lamb sliders and substituted the waffle fries for arugula salad, which they were happy to do. The lamb slider flavor was /amazing/. The spice combination they used really brought out a kick in the lamb, and highlighted its freshness as well. Someone clearly spent a long time seasoning that thing, because it&#39;s packed with flavor that blew me away. 

4. Beer - this place also has a great beer selection full of (what you might expect) west coast style ipas with a few Belgian styles scattered throughout and a few dark beers such as their milk stout (which was creamy and delicious) and porter. I was not disappointed.

I would come again if I come through Denver again. Actually, if this is representative of Denver food I would make a specific trip to Denver just for the food."

What made it so great was the service although everything else was just as good. This place rivaled my favorite restaurant Hillstone in service and hopefully it continues to do so. 

When seeing the restaurant it looks like a hip regular airport restaurant. The server quickly seated us to a high top table which my hubby hates. So she quickly accommodated us to a two seater in the front. We reviewed the menu and of course I reviewed Yelp. I saw that everyone talked about the lamb burger so that was my to go food. We weren&#39;t really that hungry so we decided we would share the meal. 

Ridha quickly came to our table and thoroughly explained the menu. I love it when you meet people that love their job. You can instantly tell because they are so into it.  We stuck to the lamb burger because of the recommendation and fellow yelpers. 

The lamb burger had a nice kick to it.  It also came with waffle fries and three sauces. Sauce=love. I love sauce. The more sauces you give me the happier I am. He brought out this curry mustard, this mint yogurt sauce, and organic ketchup which is my hubbys favorite. The mint sauce went well with the burger although I ate it without sauce. It really didn&#39;t need it. 

After telling Ridha about how awesome he was he recommended an apple pie dessert. 

Apple pie dessert was delicious. If you come here for just drinks and desserts you&#39;ll be pleased.

Other highlights: they have a small lounge table where you can sit drink and watch tv. They have a bar area, an outside area where to watch people pass, and a more quiet area in the back. 

Recommendation: lamb burger and apple pie dessert

I saw someone nearby order the bento box. Looked pretty filling and appetizing. Just an FYI.

I specifically went to the airport early to eat here after a recommendation from a friend. There was no wait at 11:45am for table of 2 on a Monday! :)

Colorado green chili (vegetarian): Good as an appetizer but definitely not filling on its own. 

Colorado lamb sliders: Comes with two ~3&#34;sliders with dense lamb patties along with sweet potato fries. They look small but they&#39;re quite filling! Perfect for sharing with another person. TIP: The harissa aioli is SPICY (we asked for it on the side and ended up using it as a dip for the fries)

Tofu scramble (breakfast/brunch - ends at 2pm): Relatively healthy (although a bit salty), filling and quite unique with the variety of potatoes used for their &#34;home fries&#34; including sweet and purple potatoes! 

Tip: Order a burger or sandwich because it comes with a side of their sweet potato waffle fries instead of ordering the fries separately! The curry-lime yogurt dip is amazing!"

If flight time is within an hours difference and the plane transfer is between Denver and some other city, I am picking Denver, every time. Transfer at Chicago, Dallas, or Phoenix? Screw that, I am going Denver all the way and that&#39;s all because of Root Down.

Root Down down offers rotating seasonal craft cocktails, wine, 25 craft beers on tap, and a cutting edge menu that had me wanting to try just about everything on it.

Edamame Hummus (w/Sesame Seeds, Medjool Dates, Olives, Radish, Naan - $11) - A bright green hummus that exudes edamame. Loved the gently gritty texture, fresh and prominent edamame taste that pairs well with the olives and dates, especially the dates. Not a must get, but if you are in a spread and dip mood, get this. I would easily order again.

Cranberry-Chipotle Buffalo Wings (Duck Wings, Scallions, Salted Cucumber, House Ranch - $12). Large duck wings, fried and coated with a heavenly red glaze of their secret cranberry-chipotle. It&#39;s a little like the sauce for Peking Beef at Chinese restaurants but more complex and less overwhelmingly sweet. Duck wings are bigger than chicken wings so it&#39;s a very satisfying portion size. Highly recommended.

Colorado Lamb Sliders &amp; Sweet Potato Waffle Fries (Colorado Lamb, Bacon, Tillamook Cheddar, Harissa Aioli, Arugula, Mint-Garlic Yogurt - $15) - Holy S**t! This one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s so good that it can convert lamb skeptics into fans. A toasted bun, lightly charred but juicy lamb patty with a thick cut piece of Tillamook melted on top. The mint garlic yogurt that comes on the side adds another layer of wonderfulness to the slider.  I&#39;m usually not big on waffle fries, but love, love how Root Down does theirs. They are mini waffle fries, nice and crispy and made for dipping into their Curry Lime Yogurt. I usually don&#39;t like how soft and doughy full size waffle fries from other places are, but here, it&#39;s perfect. If you are vegan and won&#39;t eat lamb, at least order yourself a side of waffle fries. Both the lamb slider and waffle fries are a must get.

Blackberry Caipirinha (Cachaca, Leopold Bros. Blackberry, Lime) - Well balanced, sweet, bold. Very good.

Palisade Peach Smash - (Bourbon, Leopold Bros. Peach, Lemon, Mint) - Like a sophisticated iced tea, this should be consumed out in the sun on a porch facing an acre of freshly mowed grass in your backyard. So relaxing, so good. Sweet, fruity, minty, without overdoing too much of any of it. So good.

Root Down is located at the hub between the 30s and 40s gates, near most of the Southwest Airlines gates. Sometimes there is a line, but usually the wait isn&#39;t more than 10 minutes.

There is beauty to life and sometimes you can even experience that sitting in an airport. There I was, all by myself, all smiles, eating my lamb slider and sweet potato waffle fries, reading the sports page while watching planes land from my window seat. 90 minutes until my transfer flight took off and I stayed here for 80 minutes of that. No other place I&#39;d rather be while at Denver International."

If you&#39;re in a hurry, stop at the Root Down take-out bar and grab yourself a smoked turkey sandwich.  It&#39;s the only type of sandwich that they sell &#34;on the go,&#34; and there&#39;s a reason for that - it&#39;s AWESOME!

I stop here every time I need some food before/after my flight.  Hand&#39;s down, this is the best place to stop at within the terminal - it&#39;s quick, delicious, and centrally located to all of the gates and tram.  Do yourself a favor and try the sandwich.

Sit down and grab a bite if you have at least 30 minutes to kill.  Great food and drinks here."

Even if youre not vegan, vegi, super whole foods shopper you will appreciate the dynamic and whimsical menu (yes even you meat eaters) Their &#34;meat&#34; options are tasty.

Definitely not typical the typical fast food grease ball joint that you find in all airports.

Service is usually very pleasant and efficient. 

-Beet salad with goat cheese is delish..
-salmon bento box is a fun dish with all sorts of small sides
-sweet potato fries (fresh cut not mass produced) yummers.

All around a great joint in terminal c. Much better than the other sit down or to go joints.

Note: their to go counter is nice also for a order and run.  Kudos for the h2o filling station also by the to go counter. No more 6.00 bottles of water that pollute mother earth."

By far I think a true asset to this establishment. 
Thank you sir, you are the reason for me wanting to come back here. 

My spouse and I ordered the lamb sliders with sweet potato waffle fries. They were great, the flavor was right on the money! And to drink I had the &#34;Red Sky at Night&#34;. I definitely recommend this drink to anyone !

I had a house salad and Lamb sliders.  The salad even had some nice purple colors to add interest.  The lamb sliders were nicely prepared and tasted good.

With mostly local ingredients and a menu of unique and out of the box options, I was instantly in love with this place!

I opted for the Bahn Mi Turkey Burger and it was unlike any burger I&#39;ve had before! The toppings were bursting with flavor and the sweet potato fries were the perfect side item.

Last time I grabbed Colorado lamb sliders to go, I was so impressed and could not wait to get back to Root Down again. On a recent trip, going through Denver again we had too short of a stop to dine in, so grabbed a turkey club to go. It was served on a croissant with a light sauce and lettuce and tomato. It was okay, but just a typical grab and go pre-made sandwich. On the trip home, finally enough time to dine in. The lamb sliders this time were almost too spicy to me to enjoy so not as impressed as the first time. The sweet potato fries were pretty good with the sauces, but I could have used a refresher what the sauces were. My travel companion had the fish tacos and found them bland and unremarkable. However the lemon aid was delicious. We also grabbed a dessert &#34;chocolate bomb&#34; to go, which sounded way better than it was. Perhaps it was because they packed it to go so we did not get to enjoy the presentation, but just seemed like a chocolate cream pie with some chocolate crumbs and a nice little sauce on the side. I will still make Root Down my choice in the Denver airport, but my expectations will not be as high next time."
root-down-denver-international-airport-denver,Devin A.,vWLHqiJu5Z2tRghSH8ammw,"Phoenix, AZ",1,1,1,136,104,-lR8nVHVJMBrFdWl8z1oQQ,5.0,2015-11-30,"Hands down - Best restaurant at DIA...

As a business traveler, I go through a lot of different airports on a regular basis. I&#39;ve grabbed my share of quick bites at airport food courts and watched hours tick by at lazy terminal bars. When reviewing these establishments, there is a tendency to compare them to other airport eateries with the disclaimer of how good or bad they are &#34;...for an airport restaurant...&#34; setting the bar of expectations relatively low.

Not the case with Root Down at DIA. Root Down is one of my favorite restaurants in the Denver area, airport or not. Serving up a great selection of locally-sourced, organic fare, Root Down is a fresh alternative that really delivers. If you are trying to avoid meat or gluten, making choices here is easy. There have even been times when I have selected flights with long enough layovers in Denver to allow me to grab lunch there!

I&#39;ve had the pleasure of dining at Root Down on a number of occasions. They have a diverse menu, from avocado crab cakes and bison meatballs to bahn mi turkey burgers and their own cubano. But my go-to favorite is their Roasted Beet Salad.

The roasted beet salad features luscious chunks of red and gold beets, fresh arugula, a creamy slab of goat cheese, all tossed in light vinaigrette. The bold flavor of the beets, mixed with the tart acidity of the dressing, smoothed out by the chevre makes for a culinary treat. It is heavenly!

TIP: If you order this to-go (which I often do on my way to my next flight), make sure you keep the box horizontal. If tipped to the side, the dressing can leak out, making a mess.

If you are at the C gates at DIA, there really is nothing that compares - Root Down stands on it&#39;s own as THE place to dine!

Enjoy!!"

We grabbed some lunch to go and ate it at our gate. From beat to worst: 

My friend got a burger with sweet potato fries. I didn&#39;t try the burger, but given that he inhaled it, I&#39;d say it was pretty good. I got to try the sweet potato waffle fries and they were damn good. No dipping sauces necessary. 

I ordered the farro salad. A+ for flavor. The beans were the best part. I loved the combination of interesting flavors and textures. Sweet golden raisins, crunchy pistachios, salty olives, hearty farro. The drawback was the dry ass chicken. Like...hard to eat dry, bland chicken. I was kind of surprised to get dry, nasty chicken breast from Root Down. The other issue was that it was absolutely drenched in oil. DRENCHED. I had a good solid tablespoon of oil left in the bottom of the box when I was finished eating, and I didn&#39;t even use any dressing. I felt it was a bit overpriced at $20, but it&#39;s airport food, and I suppose it was worth it because I intend to make it at home.

My boyfriend got a chicken croissant sandwich from the case. It was typical soggy airport food. Avoid that one. It&#39;s worth the wait for freshly prepared food if you have the time."

There are outlets around seating seating for charging up.  The waitstaff is attentive.  Food wise, my go-to no matter time if day is the Bahn Mi Turkey Burger!

While ROOT DOWN IS AWESOME in Denver, at the airport is not worth the train ride.

They were out of at least two items that we wanted. The soups we got were rather bland and boring. Not up to Justin Cucci&#39;s usual impeccable standards (see my reviews of his other restaurants in Denver). Even for airport food this was uninspiring. 
The service was also mediocre and slow. Not great when you&#39;re waiting for a flight.

Finally they put the wrong bill (i.e. someone else&#39;s!) on my credit card.

The food was nothing to write home about and again I am surprised based on all the reviews. We had the edamame hummus and fish tacos.

This is a very popular place so expect a little bit of a wait. Dining solo, I was led to an intimate table which was just enough room for me and my bags. They also have wifi in their restaurant which is a plus.

Now to the most important part, my meal. With a strong recommendation from my waitress, I decided upon the turkey bahn mi burger. That thing was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Never have I had a turkey burger more delicious than this one. The unique combination of pickled daikon and carrots, mint, cilantro and jalapeños which u would normally find on your traditional bahn mi all came together magnificently to create this delicious burger.

I got the Classic Benedict with Poached Eggs, Berkshire Canadian Bacon, Croissant &amp; Hollandaise. The plating and presentation made me think I was in a high class restaurant, not an airport! The taste was dynamite, the eggs mixed with the croissant was exactly what I needed that morning. An excellent start to anyone&#39;s day!

I ended up ordering the Bloody Mary and the breakfast burrito.  The cocktail left me a little underwhelmed and had two ice cubes that quickly melted. It was ok, but not the best I&#39;ve had.

The burrito and home fries were delicious, and the burrito didn&#39;t leave me feeling gross before my flight like I was worried about, since it wasn&#39;t doused in cheese and salsa! Even so, it was super flavorful, and hit the spot before a long travel day.

---lamb sliders: YUM, juicy with a good spice. i love how you can order just one (the plate usually comes with 2), i also subbed out the fries for an arugula salad
---1/2 pound beef burger with sweet potato criss cut fries: the burger was a bit over done, fries were okay (i&#39;d stick to the lamb sliders)

i guess there can be a wait so arrive for your flight early if you must dine here"

The drink list is great, and the staff attentive. I love that they warn you about how long the kitchen is taking before you&#39;re seated because it takes the stress away of wondering if you can eat and still make your flight. The highlight here is definitely the food. This is worlds away of what would normally consider airport food. The veggie burger is one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, the salads are always fresh, and more than enough food.

The only downside is the prices, but based on how much Root Down normally costs and compounded about being in an airport, they aren&#39;t surprising. It&#39;s just definitely not a budget restaurant!"

They&#39;ve got a nice spot at the airport, it&#39;s definitely got more of the sit down and eat vibe than the grab and go feel.  We appreciated that the host asked us what time our flight was before she sat us so that they could ensure there was ample time for us to eat.

I ordered the turkey burger bahn mi and my wife got the fried egg breakfast sandwich, which she had heard good things about.  The first bite of the turkey burger wasn&#39;t so good for me, as it had a little too much spicy kick for me, but as I ate it, the sandwich really grew on me.  I loved the creamy texture, the turkey patty was tasty, and the flavors blended well together.  Not to mention the sweet potato fries were awesome!  My wife actually liked my sandwich better and I&#39;d have to agree.  Who wouldn&#39;t love egg, bacon, cheese, and avocado on a croissant?  Solid sandwich, but it didn&#39;t really stand out.

Good experience overall, good place for a nice meal in the airport!"

I didn&#39;t have time to stop during that layover but my husband and I made it a point to stop for brunch on our layover on the way back to Chicago from Park City.  We landed at 8:30am and were seated immediately as the restaurant was half empty.  By 9:15am it was getting pretty full so this is a place you should only target if you have a decent amount of time.  They&#39;re also kind enough to ask you when your flight leaves before seating you to make sure you have enough time to dine.

Service was friendly and prompt.  The ambiance is very casual - decor is different from the LoHi original location - a bit more casual but the same modern and eclectic vibe.  We were easily in and out in 40 minutes and the food was just about the same top notch quality you&#39;d expect from the original Root Down location.  They&#39;ve done a great job of limiting their airport menu to the items that they know they can keep on hand and successfully prepare at top quality and in a timely fashion. 

My husband went with the chilaquiles eggs benedict, which was very tasty and delightfully crispy.  They happily substituted the house potatoes out for sweet potato waffle fries (which are pure heaven).  I chose the tofu scramble, which was also flavorful and fresh.  

My only complaint - no veggie burger sliders on the daytime menu.  Root Down - you have the best veggie sliders in the world and they should be available at any location and at any time of day for all the DIA travelers to be able to experience."

First of all, I absolutely love this space.  I love the panel instruments on the walls, the suitcases on the bar, and the globes suspended from the ceiling.  
My first experience had me seated right in the from by the hostess station.  Not bad but a very busy area for sure.  I had a lovely glass of Rosé, the sweet potato fries, and the gluten free fish tacos.  Amazingly delicious. I haven&#39;t had fish tacos in a while because they also seem to miss the mark on being a great taco.  These were perfect.  The service was also really great.
My second meal here I was seated on the interior of the space at some super cool tables that are designed for just one person...  And there&#39;s and outlet to plug stuff in...  And it overlooks the tarmac...  Pretty cool. 
This time I got the Coconut Gin Fizz cocktail and the Farm to Table Cobb.  Huuuuuuuge salad. I&#39;ve never had a Cobb with dates but they paired so well with the blue cheese...  I&#39;d love to see more Cobb salads with dates. Super yum. The cocktail was great too.  Super light with a little bite from the ginger. 
Definitely a spot to come back to again and again and again!"

The only reason they have two stars instead of one is due to the manager being friendly and apologetic, and actually refunding my money.  I do appreciate that, but the experience itself was a failure of great proportions.

First of all, these folks really, really, *REALLY* need to work on their carryout operation&#39;s time estimates. I inquired at the hostess stand about getting a carryout and was told to order at their carryout stand adjacent to the restaurant. Fine, will do. I had plenty of time, or so I thought. Root Down was in the C concourse, and my flight gate was in the A concourse. No big deal: I&#39;d already gotten through the hard part of the TSA security checkpoint, and I&#39;d like to thank Rainsux from the Detroit board here for recommending to me to leave *plenty* of time at Denver&#39;s airport, as the TSA was terribly inefficient. He was right: they were. That being said, contrary to normal behavior, I accounted for this, and had gobs of time.

Or so I thought.

By the time I got to Root Down, it was 25 minutes before my plane started boarding, which is gobs of time once security is out of the way. Unless, that is, Root Down tells you that it&#39;ll be a 10-15 minute wait for your food. That was fine with me! Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s closer to 10 minutes, but if it&#39;s 15, that&#39;s cool.

@!*#$@$!!!!!! Why can&#39;t they just say, &#34;It&#39;s going to be 25 minutes for your order!&#34;, in which case, I&#39;d have left without a problem right then. Nope! So I ordered right then. Found Chinese Take-Out Ribs on the menu at $20.52 (!!!!), and waited. If you like waiting, dude: THIS IS YOUR KIND OF PLACE. At the 15 minutes point, I inquired. The guy checked: &#34;They&#39;re just coming up.&#34; Okay, cool. Five minutes later, no food. Um, where are they? &#34;I&#39;ll check.&#34; My cousin, who I&#39;m traveling with, has given up and gone to the gate...and I understood where he was coming from.

After 25 minutes, no food. I inform them: refund my money. Now. My plane is now *boarding*. I&#39;ve gotta go. &#34;They&#39;re just boxing it up now!&#34; I DON&#39;T FREAKING CARE. Money now. They do refund my money...and they basically give me the ribs because now, after half an hour, here they are. The manager was apologetic and nice, but this is *not* how to do things anywhere, much less an airport, where time is of greater importance.

I ended up making my plane with about 2 minutes to spare. The food, eaten on the plane, was functional, even decent, but hardly remarkable, and quite small, considering the price. I certainly wouldn&#39;t do it again.  The time stress *alone* wouldn&#39;t be worth it, much less the (what I would consider to be) overrated food.  Then again:  I did eat it quite a bit after it was &#34;fresh&#34;.

Look, folks, in this particular setting, you need to be a lot (and I mean *a lot*) more time-sensitive.  When you give an estimate in an airport, it needs to be relatively close.  Double the estimate, and you need to take a good look in the mirror about how you&#39;re estimating carryout time.  Half an hour when I&#39;m told fifteen minutes is not acceptable.  Needs improvement."

We stopped eating and informed the server. 10 minutes later she drops the check with a &#34;friends and family discount whatever that is&#34; according to the server. 

It amounted to $2.75 and don&#39;t get me wrong all we wanted was a new grilled cheese or to not pay for an app that was off. Either the people running this place are not genuine restauranteurs as advertised on the menu or they are clueless."

Another lady (older, white lady) was seated next to me and the server appeared immediately and asked if she needed anything.  In the interim, the host brought the jug of water and filled my cup.  I looked closely as he poured the water, a tornado effect occurred.  In my mind head I wondered why I could see the tornado so well.   I noticed lots of tiny bubbles and other small debris swirling.  As I took an even closer look, I noticed a short strand of hair.

This the point where I got up and took my business elsewhere.  No one seemed to notice nor care that I left.  Ironically, the lady sitting next to me was right behind me leaving."

I had such a great layover because of Root Down. So my flight from wherever to wherever actually got cancelled so I had to get it rerouted and it happened through DIA. I had a couple hours there. I just checked on Yelp to see what was around and I saw a restaurant IN the airport that had hundreds of great reviews so I was like, gotta check this out! I checked the menu out, GOTTA GO GET DUCK WINGS! So I went there, sat at the bar, ordered the duck wings and an arugula beet salad and a jalapeno something cocktail. Every single thing I had was delicious and flavors just kept exploding in my mouth. And it was the first time in a long time that I had a good conversation with a stranger at the bar. Anyways, since then I&#39;ve been looking for ways to route my trip through DIA but alas, no opportunities have come my way. But I will be back in 2017 FOSHO.

I decided to start with the hot chocolate and we ordered the croque madame benedict and the half pound burger with an added egg on top. The croque madame benedict was unique as it was on a croissant piece of bread with two eggs, but it was pretty good! It comes with regular and sweet potato chunks. The burger I really enjoyed as the meat was succulent and it came on a pretzel bun, and the toppings were delicious! Loved the sweet potato fries that came with it. 

For airport food, the price is reasonable and the food is pretty damn good. Service was also very quick and efficient which is necessary as you are in an airport, and she was very attentive to our needs! Guess I&#39;ll have to try Root Down&#39;s original location when I return to Denver!"

Naturally, I decide that a cocktail and a dessert will vastly improve my emotional state, so I stop in at Root Down. 

The wait is short, only about 5 minutes, and we opt for a table in their &#39;lounge area&#39;. It&#39;s cool but the seats look rough (think countless drinks/food items spilled on them). But it&#39;s comfortable and the atmosphere is hip and fun so we&#39;re off to a good start. 

I order an extra-dirty vodka martini (wasn&#39;t feeling the gin today) and decide &#34;what the heck, I&#39;m on vacation&#34; so I ask for it with Grey Goose vodka. We also order a slice of the chocolate silk cream pie to really get the party started. 

The pie was phenomenal. It was thick, creamy, and had that perfect chocolate cream taste. Not too sweet, but still indulgently rich. The crust was buttery, flaky perfection. The slice was also accompanied by something Root Down calls &#39;chocolate cereal milk crumble&#39;. It was an interesting mound of crunchy chocolate shavings in a creamy sauce pooled beside the pie. I thought the crumbles had an almost coffee-like flavor. It was a unique addition that worked very well with the pie. We were tempted to order another slice. 

The martini was an utter disappointment. It was bland and had no olive flavor whatsoever. My request for extra-dirty was unfulfilled. In fact, I&#39;ll go so far as to say it simply tasted like water with an alcoholic aftertaste. Even the sad, bottom-of-the-barrel olives lacked flavor. For $16, I expected MUCH better.

The staff was a bit odd. They were all friendly enough, but seemed to have that &#39;I&#39;m late for a flight and in a hurry&#39; attitude. Perhaps working at the airport has started to rub off on them.

Despite the martini mishap, the overall experience was pleasant. Root Down provides a fun, funky environment and it&#39;s a great place to pass the time before a flight. The pie was great, but I&#39;d steer clear of the bar unless you feel like taking a gamble. Hopefully the drinks will be on-point next time."

Root Down is definitely on the Mount Rushmore of airport restaurants. I am very excited that Tampa is in the process of adopting a similar concept - take your best *local* restaurant treasures, and put them in the airport to showcase your city to visitors. And this doesn&#39;t include the tourist traps, but the honest-to-goodness gems of the city.

When I&#39;ve visited Denver, the original Root Down has been high on my to-do list, but I just haven&#39;t quite scored enough free time to make it happen. When I saw that there was a location at the airport, it made me two hour layover oh-so much more pleasurable, and it lived up the hype.

The only negative about this experience is that I wasn&#39;t very hungry! But I *really* wanted to try the famous sweet potato fries. I know there&#39;s not a lot of variance in sweet potato fries, but they were possibly the best I&#39;ve ever had. They provided two sauces - ketchup and a curry-lime yogurt, which sounds odd, but it was wonderful with the fries. I enjoyed them so much, that I wanted to order something else.

I added on a thai carrot curry, and it was perfection. I love every second.

The bartender was great. The beer selection was vast. And I got out of there very efficiently, with plenty of time to transfer to my gate. A 100% perfect experience."

The customer service was really good, the menu was lacking and that&#39;s a good thing because I would be writing about a crappy calzone Instead of asking how can you fuck up a Pastrami sandwich? It was bland! two bites I thought I had gotten cloned meat. which might be the case since the McDonalds next door serves the same food, they may be in co-hoots 

It&#39;s rumored that this is the same type of food as Fazolli&#39;s and Olive Garden. Not for one looking for real Italian.

I absolutely love the Duke City! So so tasty!! The only thing I wish is that they would have more selection of pizza sauce. I am not a fan of red sauce so my choices with that are limited. Subs are also amazing and salads too! You can never go wrong with the cheese toast! I order mine with ranch (since I don&#39;t like red sauce). 

Being in Colorado, I really do wish they would serve some local brew. Pizza and beer are like peas and carrots. Even a selection from a local brewer would be great!

-Turkey and swiss sub - with greek dressing (dip your chips in this!!)

I ordered a lemonade, slice of pepperoni pizza with pineapple and an Italian sandwich that came with chips and Greek dressing on the side. My husband wasn&#39;t able to meet us for lunch so I wanted to bring some leftovers back so he could try it as well. I thought the slice of pizza was ok, definitely not better than Papa John&#39;s like another yelp review mentioned. I had never had pizza were the pineapple was just thrown on top, usually they add the toppings you want and bake it, maybe this place doesn&#39;t do that. My Italian sandwich was very good and I would order that again. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean."

We ordered a roast beef and provolone sandwich, turkey and Swiss sandwich, a small order of garlic cheese bread and a large chicken Caesar salad. Their sandwiches were wonderful--crunchy bread with a soft inside, good quality meats and cheeses, and Greek dressing on the side. The employees were helpful and the restaurant was very clean! We also loved the salad and took home about half or our food for another meal today.
We will definitely try the pizza on our next visit! A bonus is that their prices are really quite reasonable."

My husband ordered his &#34;usual&#34; which is The Napoli, sub bell peppers for green chile and I got my go to which is the turkey sub, no onions or tomatoes. We also split a Greek Salad which is the only time my fella will eat cucumbers. 

The bread for the turkey sandwich, the way the smokey turkey is sliced and piled on, and most importantly, the ever so incredible Greek Dressing (heavens open, the choirs start singing, and fountains of greek dressing start pouring down) create the perfect bite over and over again. 

For being a casual spot, I really can&#39;t find a place that does both pizza and subs that we both enjoy, it&#39;s normally one or the other. 

The only complaint I have is how stinkin&#39; far away it is (45 min. to 1 hour) and I wish they sold booze because there&#39;s not much better than pizza and beer. Hopefully as they gain more recognition in the CO market, they can branch out closer to North Denver but in the meantime, we will make the trek from time to time when our cravings get even stronger. 

Needless to say, it wasn&#39;t just a good memory from our past, they genuinely produce a consistently great product."

I&#39;m reading poor reviews regarding the obvious lack of beer here. I get it, I love beer with my pizza too. But Dion&#39;s recipe for success these last 40-something years doesn&#39;t include beer. And even though I now consider myself a Coloradan - a beer lovin&#39; Coloradan at that - I can handle a meal without it. I have beer at home. They also don&#39;t serve weed here. Enjoy your pizza!"

The lemonade is great as well, matched with their tea= killer Arnold Palmer. The staff here was awesome, super friendly and quick. What more could anyone ask for in a pizza place?

The last time I went there, I had a medium pepperoni with green chile, onions, and mushrooms.  I have to tell you, it doesn&#39;t get any better...unless you feel like a sub, in which case, the turkey and swiss with green chile just is the best damn sub in town.  

Strangely, a New Mexico pizza place is one of the best pizza chains in Colorado."

I&#39;ve also had the Tuscany pizza and added bacon to it which ended up being my favorite so far. AND I love the ranch dipping sauce, I don&#39;t care if it has MSG in it! 
The gourmet pizza is perfect for 1 person since its 10&#34; and is done is 10 minutes...I highly suggest getting it vs the regular crust which is much thicker.

We went and had two pizzas (meat for me and pep and jalapeños for her) and a salad.

It was very good. My only issue with this was that I ord er ed extra sauce (I like sauce) and when I got the pizza it really didn&#39;t look like extra sauce. We got a side of the sauce and found that it was very thin. So most likely it was extra but got absorbed in the cooking process.

Emily, who took our orders was VERY bubbly and welcoming. Perfect attentiveness and a true pleasure to talk to. We will be back.  

They DID try to charge us $.40 for a tiny side of sauce, but when  we explained the lack of sauce on the pizza when we ordered extra, they were happy to give the side.

Thus would be a 5 star review if the sauce were a bit more robust in consistency as the taste was good."

First, the good stuff: 
1.  The restaurant is clean and well-lit: nice casual atmosphere.
2.  The girl who took our order was extremely polite and knew how to explain the options to first-timers (like us).
3.  Substitutions are accepted, even on their gourmet pizzas.


Next, the not-so-good stuff:

1.  The Caesar salad was mediocre at best.  But let&#39;s face it: you really can&#39;t mess up a Caesar salad when you throw pieces of chicken on top of Romaine lettuce and give the customer a container with dressing to pour over the salad.

2.  The pizza left a lot to be desired: the sauce didn&#39;t have much flavor and (this is the worst part) the pieces were sliced so small that you can&#39;t &#34;fold&#34; up the slice so that it can properly be eaten!

Overall, Dion&#39;s gets a solid 3 stars, largely due to our ordering experience.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a 2-star pizza joint based on the food.  There are plenty of marginal pizza places wherever you go, so if you just want some so-so pizza, Dion&#39;s is the place. I think this is a &#34;one and done&#34; for me though."

Cons- I&#39;ve NEVER been to a pizza place and they don&#39;t have beer!!! What??
 Also I had some issues with things that I&#39;m guessing being a chain restaurant they have little control of-
    Their &#34;fresh&#34; lemonade either isn&#39;t fresh or it is so loaded with pounds of sugar that I couldn&#39;t hardly taste any lemon. It was pretty gross...
Sauce- watery, greasy and very little flavor, pizza dough very bland -I was let down by the pizza with how much people talk it up on here. 
Very odd &#34;cafeteria&#34; feel. The music was just awful too. I understand companies need to keep things family friendly but this was polar over the top safe. Ace of base, the theme song from the movie flashdance- my whole group was very uncomfortable with the ambiance. I will definately be back for the subs and take it to go though!"

We split the turkey sub with Greek dressing and the 505 pizza that has pepperoni and green chili. We ordered ranch dressing on the side which is something they are famous for. The portions are large. Our favorite was the sub. The bread was perfectly toasted and yummy. In fact, I just got home and I may be craving another. You have to have get the Greek dressing for that. It really ups the flavor. The pizza had good flavor but the crust was a little soggy near the center of the pizza. I would give the pizza a 4 but will come back and try again. The service was great and friendly. You can get fruit as a side instead of chips with the sub. The prices are reasonable for the size. Our pizza was the 12 inch and pretty filling. You can order ahead and pick up at the drive through. I thank my friend Jordan, their biggest fan, for getting them to build near us. My 2 HS kids are excited for the location and pizza by the slice."

While we loved Dion&#39;s in NM, our 2 visits to this location were not up to par. The pastrami last night was inedible grizzle. They did make things right, but when you drive an hour out of town for a less than satisfying meal it is frustrating as hell!

Given the Kansas location of this store, we will be waiting for visits to the 505 for our fix.....unless we run out of Greek dressing again. It makes much more sense for us to add our own green chile to the plethora of better pizza joints closer to Denver.

Sorry our expectations were beyond the capabilities of this location...."

We grabbed a booth while we waited for our food--the whole place was really clean and bright and the wait was short. 
Our subs were so tasty! The bread was perfectly crisp and crusty on the outside, but soft on the inside. Each sub comes with a choice of dipping sauce--go for the ranch. The chips on the side were just Ruffles, nothing wrong with that, but you could also get a fruit cup side that looked good. 
While we ate, a staff member came around and chatted with us about our food and experience. He was definitely not a manager, and we were impressed that he was checking in on everyone and trying to ensure we were enjoying our meals.

If I had to offer a constructive comment, it would be to watch the front of house more closely. I went at an off time and stood out front for a few minutes ready to order before anyone noticed me. 

Will be back!!"

Went in for a breakfast sandwich and to be fair the only person working tried really hard to make sure I was taken care of, but..... They had no traditional bread and the person working seemed a bit lost. It took me few minutes to realize that the other customer in the store eating was actually the manager I think but didn&#39;t seemed concerned much about what as going on. 
I ordered a soft drink and went to machine and it had no ice. While making my sandwich the person working rushed around to put ice in the machine. One thing I found strange was that the only napkins in the place was on the other side of the store on a table from the drink area making me search for them.
The food was just ok, I saw the sausage taken out of the freezer and it was some standard frozen patty that you can buy at Safeway. I had to settle for the sesame and sea salt bagel and but it seemed a ok, just not what I wanted. It got pretty busy after I got my food so I wasn&#39;t able to voice my concerns."

It was a delightful visit.  I had the white albacore tuna salad on the sun dried tomato and cheese bread.  The flavors were fresh and delicious.  All of the staff are super friendly and prepare your food right in front of you.  They are super attentive to detail too as while we were eating our sandwiches one of the workers came out and realized that a sandwich he had given out was made incorrectly and promptly offered to rectify the situation and make the sandwich correctly.  Superb service!  We will definitely be back.

Don&#39;t know if we came in on an off day, but wasn&#39;t very impressed with the food even though the service was great. Got the potato bacon soup with a salad combo. The soup was only warm and the size of both the soup and salad was a little small for the price. Also, the bread on the side was a little stale. 

My daughter ordered the roasted tomato and chicken sandwich with a bag of fries. The sandwich was just ok.

The location was clean and organized. Will have to give them a try next time we are in the area."

They bake their bread fresh throughout the day and if they run out, you just have to wait for the next batch to be ready. It&#39;s that fresh. The bread options were cheddar cheese with sea salt, jalapeno cheddar cheese, sun dried tomato and cheddar, and classic sea salt and sesame. Though - not not my first choice, I went with jalapeno cheddar and was not disappointed. They did, however, bring me a straight-out-of-the oven cheddar and sea salt (my first choice) to try!

The various sandwiches are delightful and they certainly don&#39;t skimp on the sandwich fixings. With sauces like horseradish mayo, there&#39;s also a lot great variety in making the sandwich of your dreams. The bread is really what makes the sandwiches pop, however, as it&#39;s a hybrid between sourdough and rye. Not too heavy, like a bagel, but too tangy, like sourdough. Perfectly light and tasty!"

There were no vegan options other than the bread with hummus (which is cool by me, I love toasted bread and hummus). The shop is super well put together, and I think they have a great flow to the operation. Customer service was great too, and pretty fast (we were the only customers at the time) BUT (and it&#39;s a big &#34;but&#34;) the bread is not great, I wouldn&#39;t even call it good. If you decorated it with a ton of sandwich ingredients you might overlook it, but if you&#39;re going to run a place that makes &#34;fresh bread daily&#34;. That bread should be top notch! 

I love the concept of this place. I hope they improve their bread recipes, id like to see it stick around. 

Add a vegan sammich maybe? ;)"

I got the Portablella Reuben on a classic sea salt and cheddar Twisted Sammie. Delicious! All the ingredients were super fresh and just unique all around. The staff there were super helpful, kind and took time to artfully craft the sandwich. In addition, they give you plenty of pickle slices, which is a plus.

Not sure if I would go completely out of my way (45min) just to eat here, but if you are in the area, I would definitely check it out. Seems like they are pretty new and still trying to solidify their ambience/menu, but definitely doing a great job. Love their twisted pretzel/bread concept."

The BEST part about this place, however, starts where it should..the bun. An assortment of different pretzel rolls, baked daily, lend an addictively delectable element to your Sammy. Sun dried tomato and cheddar pretzel roll was on point. I plan to visit again for the caprese Sammy next time.

The coffee is also amazing! We talked to the manager about it and he said they actually buy better coffee although not many people get it. Fools!

They have printed menus but no prices so you will be unpleasantly surprised to find a sandwich is $9.00 and does not include chips. I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to paying that if it was a quality product but I ordered the turkey Reuben which had 2 slices of pressed, processed meat. The kind you get at the grocery store next to the bologna. The sandwich was smothered in cole slaw and that&#39;s all I could taste. They also topped it with gray/black caramelized onions and cheese but all you could taste was the cole slaw. In addition, the staff was just lost and confused. They struggled even make the sandwiches and they were unfamiliar with their own prices. I&#39;m sorry but they really have to improve if they expect to stay in business."

I can say that the food that we ate was 5 star.

Since the restaurant had just opened for the first time that day there were some kinks that needed to be worked out like pricing on menu&#39;s, and on the wall board...but hey, its there first day and you have to cut them a little slack.

That being said, my wife and 2 kids happened to stop by this past Saturday.

We had a portabello, carmelized onion, roasted red pepper and artichoke on a sun dried tomato and cheddar pretzel roll.   The kids had a ham and cheese sandwich on the sun dried tomato roll.  Two sandwiches,  one iced tea and 3 bags of chips for $19 and some change.

Our sandwiches were awesome! The pretzel bread was unique and incredibly tasty.  The kids ate every bit of there sandwiches. 

The staff was friendly and the bathrooms were spotless.

All in all a good experience and we will go back soon!"

Last time, we went when the owner was there, and she gave us great recommendations on what to order:

Mantoo - Afghan-style dumplings with a creamy tomato and yogurt sauce--so good! I love dumplings from every culture, and just love seeing all the different cultural variations.

Qabuli Palau - The menu says &#34;tender chunks of lamb&#34; and isn&#39;t joking! The lamb is tender and moist and is served with a generous amount of rice, carrots, raisins, and spinach. 

Super Kabob Combo - If you love meat and rice, definitely order this dish! This entree could easily serve two people. Ryan K. had to get the rice to go since the kabobs were so filling.

We also had some fresh-from-the-oven Afghan Naan. 

So delicious! We&#39;ll be back :)"

 Growing up in a Bangladeshi house hold I had tried food similar to this place, and yet this somehow has enough differences in it to make it new again at least flavor wise, the food was great and the portion I received was so big I had to eat it over two days!

How does it compare? For your average American I would say it is better. Better mainly because the lamb is more tender and less gamy tasting than what you would typically encounter in Afghanistan. Other differences include fewer raisins, but given most Americans aren&#39;t used to eating raisins in a salty dish, this is likely also a plus for most. But the fundamental flavor of the dish is still there, and so worth a trip to Ariana to try for both those that have enjoyed the authentic thing in the past, and especially for those looking to try something that is new, unique, and very delicious.

The naan is some of the best I have had in the US, but it still doesn&#39;t match the naan from the street vendors in Kabul. I suspect it is because the type of cooking surface used isn&#39;t the same as the traditional one used. Still, it is a great compliment to the Qabuli Palau."

You don&#39;t have to trek across the Khyber Pass to try the cuisine of Afghanistan. Instead, head over to Aurora and let the folks from Ariana Kabob Cafe thrill you with a full slate of delightful dishes worth traveling any distance for!

Thinking holistically about Ariana&#39;s array of awesome appetizers, I&#39;d have to say my favorite are the potato/chive-filled pastry envelopes known as Bolani Kachalu. Oh, and that reminds me... folks, the Bolani and many of the items at Ariana are served with a vividly green cilantro/chili sauce known as Chatni. Although very tasty, it is also rather spicy, so I would advise caution when sampling it the first couple times. Other introductory ideas for you are the homey, yogurt-dappled noodle soup called Aush, the sturdy beef dumplings known as Mantu, and the mixed-vegetable fritters who introduce themselves at parties as Pakawra. (And yes, I know that last dish is technically on the &#34;Side Orders&#34; section of the menu, but really, it&#39;s so yummy that no-one in their right mind would chide you for eating it first).

To continue, I&#39;m sure you probably have your heart set on a chicken, lamb, or ground-beef [Koobideh] kabob for your main course - and who could blame you? After all, the restaurant isn&#39;t called Ariana Peanutbutter Cafe. But the Pashto dish Qabuli Palaw (named for Afghanistan&#39;s capital city) won&#39;t let you down either, with its juicy lamb chunks perched atop a mound of carrot-and-raisin-bejeweled rice. And veggie fans, I&#39;m not leaving you out by any means - why not create a super sampler from their potato, spinach and cauliflower curries? But whatever you do, don&#39;t forget to leave a little room for some Firni (milk pudding with pistachios and just a hint of rosewater) at the end of your meal, along with a nice hot cup of sweetened cardamom tea [Chai] to help wash it all down nicely."

We had the lamb kabob and the kobedeh.  They were both excellent but we did like the lamb better! Loved how it was spiced, and loved the little hint of cinnamon in both the lamb and the Palau.

The chai was also wonderful!

Food took about 10 minutes even though the restaurant was empty (there was one pickup order).

The chicken kabob &#34;sandwich&#34; (it&#39;s actually in a tortilla) was tasty and cooked just about right. The tortilla was nice and fluffy. It is on the small side, and pricey at $8.75. The french fries were cooked just right, though it&#39;d be nice to have different sides. It comes with tzatziki and chutney sauces. The latter has nice spice to it.

The Afghan yogurt drink has diced cucumber in it and it is interesting but not something I&#39;d consider a favorite. It&#39;s quite drinkable, unlike some varieties of Lassi."

Anyway, we settled in for Chicken and Lamb kababs. After waiting for 30 minutes, the waitress came and told us that they ran out of all the Lamb dishes! That was really frustrating. On asking she started giving lame excuses. Later on we did get our Lamb kababs but were not able to understand what was the fuss all about.

I ordered the buranee banjohn for appetizer, a lamb kabob entree, and baklava for dessert. They were all delicious, but the appetizer and entree were deliciously different from what I&#39;ve tried before. The spice profile is unique (particularly in regard to that awesome cilantro flavored spicy green chutney, best chutney ever), but I would say it&#39;s probably closest to Lebanese food. When I was done with the pieces of eggplant in the burnanee banjohn, I used the rest of the yogurt to mix it with the long grained rice (of which you get plenty with the kabob). It was so good. It&#39;s hard not to imagine ordering that appetizer again, but I know that there has got to be a dozen other treasures here, so I&#39;ll have to try it all. 

The only downside I can think of is that it takes a very long time for your food to come. I ordered it on eat24 and it came after an hour and a half, but to be fair, the estimate was 1.5-2 hours. This is much slower than most places, but I don&#39;t see this as a problem, as I find that generally things turn out better if you spend the time to &#39;do it right&#39;. 

Oh, another thing: the baklava was quite good, but didn&#39;t taste any different from the baklava you would get at any other middle eastern restaurant. That&#39;s not at all bad, but worth noting, I figure."

The food was excellent with big portions. We had lamb and koobideh kababs with the pulao. The lamb was succulent and the koobideh was delicious as well. We liked the food so much that we had take out the next day. I wanted chapli kabab which on the menu is listed as an appetizer but I asked if they could just give to me as an entree. This is where I was a little turned off by them. The servers kept saying that they use the same meat mix for chapli and koobideh. That is not how authentic chapli kababs are. Also, that&#39;s a bad thing for a restaurant to confess to. Why are you selling one thing as two separate items?"

ariana kabob is good. greasey. authentic. love that eggplant with tomato and yogurt and a side of meat. boom! lunch. bring a zantac tho, you will be needing it.

Thursday April 4th 2013, brought 7 of my friends to have a feast at Ariana Kabob Café for Dinner.  Time was at 18:30hrs.  I have called Ariana Kabob Café, one week earlier before this date to make a reservation.  When I arrived at about 18:10hrs, our table were all set ready for my friends and I.

YES, the menu are Simple.  The Appetizer plates are enough to be shared among 2 to 3 people.  Appetizers and Salads are between $6.00 to $8.50.  Main Entrees are between $8.50 to $14.75, while the Sandwiches are between $6.00 to $8.50.

Once everyone was there, from what I could recall my friends ordered these items :

*  Mantoo
*  Lamb Kabob
*  Several orders of Buranee Banjohn
*  Qabuli Palau
*  Gyro Sandwiches
*  Chicken Kabob
*  Combo Kabob
*  Super Kabob Combo
*  Baklava

I opt to have these items as part of my Dinner that evening :

*  Mantoo ($7.50)
*  Chalau Kabob ($10.75)

Our server was indeed friendly, helpful and so accommodating to all our needs that evening.  Two of my friends have food allergies, and our server noted the Chef, so everyone can enjoy their meal.

The complimentary fritters of some kind was a HIT with everyone.  It came out piping hot and everyone like the Spicy Cilantro Chutney.  All my friends like their order that evening.  They said the food is flavorful, yummy and it was indeed an intimate gathering of 8 friends enjoying Afghani cuisine here in Colorful Colorado.

Hubs also like the Leftovers of what I had ordered of the Mantoo and Chalau Kabob.  The Mantoo consisted of  Dumplings stuffed with Ground Beef and Onions, topped with Mixed Vegetables, Tomato Sauce and Yogurt.  This item is served with the Afghan Naan.  Slightly different from the norm Naan you ate in other establishment.

While the Chalau Kabob, I opt to have the Lamb Kabob, and it comes with White Rice and Meat Sauce, that consisted of Lamb with Bones.  Its flavorful and I don&#39;t mind returning when needed.  Left the establishment about 20:10hrs Tummy Filled Belly Happy Indeed!

After going back a few times and experiencing lacking service, I unfortunately have to change my review. My family and I went with a few out of town guests. The food we good, but while eating my dad found a long strand of hair in one of the dishes. He told her waitress, and she said, &#34;Oh I don&#39;t know where that came from. My hair is tied! (Although it wasn&#39;t all tied). Maybe it came from the ceiling?&#34;  And she was not even apologetic and walked away!  
Really!?? There&#39;s hair in the food! She wasn&#39;t even embarrassed. We&#39;ve been to this restaurant many times and the owner and wait staff know us. Instead of arguing about it. We paid the bill and vowed to never come back. This was a below par response for a restaurant. This kind of customer service, alone, just lost a few customers. In order to stay in the restaurant business, not just the food, but the staff have to be up to par. Consistency and customer service matter!"

It is a culturally unique restaurant in Denver (so far as I know), so even if one goes in with certain assumptions, those assumptions might not be exactly accurate. What I do have to write a review about is my personal experience, which was overwhelmingly positive. The food that I ate was delicious, the staff were friendly even if not overwhelmingly attentive.

This is one of those times that I completely agree with other Yelp reviewers.  We stopped in for a to-go order tonight, and our order was prepared promptly and accurately.  I had the chicken kabobs and my husband had the combo, and we shared the eggplant appetizer.  I&#39;m pleased to report that the only spicy parts of our dishes were the optional green sauce cups on the side, which I wouldn&#39;t recommend only because I don&#39;t care for hot/spicy food.  This sauce probably appeals to most people, but I&#39;d rather drown my chicken in the yogurt sauce!

I&#39;m new to delicious Afghan cuisine, but if this is what I can expect I&#39;ll be having it quite often!  I was so impressed with tonight&#39;s dinner that I almost forgot to mention the outstanding service.  Service can be hit or miss in an Aurora strip mall location.

Located in the same shopping center as the giant H-Mart, it&#39;s pretty easy to miss, even though it&#39;s tucked in the side directly facing Parker Road.  For those wondering what Afghani food is, it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d think from the geography of the region - part Middle Eastern, part Indian.  They specialize here in rice dishes with meat as well as kabobs, and both are excellent.  The chicken kabobs in particular remind me of the Indian tandoori style and were the best of the three meats I&#39;ve tried.  The house specialty Qabuli Palau is outstanding, and last time I tried the bolani appetizer, which was a large quesadilla-shaped turnover filled with potatoes and chives, and it was also quite good.  The main dishes come with Afghan naan bread, a small salad and a grilled tomato, so it&#39;s a nice meal.  Don&#39;t be intimidated by Afghan food - you&#39;ve probably had something similar to it at some point, and it&#39;s served here by very friendly people who want you to experience their food and a bit of their heritage.  I hope more people support them!"

The gyros aren&#39;t the same as others but full of flavor (I always get 2xs meat). The yogurt sauce isn&#39;t like others, but perfect for dipping, pairs well with the spicy chutney and is super yummy! The flat bread is delicious! It&#39;s not like naan or pita, and not like a tortilla like others have said, it&#39;s light and fluffy and wraps easily. My husband always gets the Kabuli Palau (sp?) and craves it all the time. I love the lamb kabob with a size of the curry spinach, perfect for the paleo meal! The side of spinach is amazing.... Ah-maz-ing. The potato appetizer is a favorite! And the kids love it too. Sometimes you have to wait a bit for water, but they don&#39;t care if you&#39;re nice about it and ask them for more too. The rice is always perfect! Everything is full of flavor and we haven&#39;t been disappointed yet. We&#39;ve been coming here for 2 years and have been about 15 times. Never had an issue with take out either...

The music and the venue itself were kind of weird to me, as was the old 15&#34; box TV they had in the corner with the hooka pipe, but I got used to it... All in all, this was definitely a good experience.

as i travel the country i make it a point to go to the afghan restaurant in the region and when i first came to colorado i was sad when i realized there wasn&#39;t any in the entire state!  That changed a few months later when the one in ft collins opened up (did a review for them as well).  

The food here is really good - i went a few times earlier in late 2012  and early 2013 when they had first opened up and the service was actually pretty slow at that point (they literally had 2 employees at the time - the cook and the waitress)

The food is great, do check them out!

also they&#39;re halal!"

The naan is thinner and crispier than Indian naan and we enjoyed the variation. For an appetizer, we got the dumplings filled with ground meat. The sauce that comes with it is delicious, but too spicy for the kids (more for us). I think the all-around favorite is the chicken kabob. The rice pilaf that comes with the meal has raisins and carrots and I found it quite tasty. It is a lot like tandoori chicken in appearance and flavor. It was delicious, hot and fresh. Another plus for kids is that if they don&#39;t care for rice, French fries are an option. I thought the service was attentive and friendly and it was really enjoyable to try something just a little different."

It&#39;s right next to H-Mart. Keep in mind that lots of places make kebab, but they all tastes different, use different spice, cook in different way. So if you are used to the Greek style, Indian style, or any other kinds of kebab, the Afghan style is going to be very different. It&#39;s a smallish place, about 8-10 tables. So if you are going with a large group, it may overwhelm the cook (who was just working by himself in the kitchen). I went there for a lunch takeout, there were about 3-4 guests inside of the restaurant, and my food took about 15 minutes to be ready. But the wait is worth it. Everything is prepared fresh, no overcooked meat or stale rice. For first time goers, I highly recommend the super combo plate (which has 3 types of meat and raisin rice, yogurt sauce, a small salad, for about $15). It&#39;s big enough that you can share with another person (but why would you? :D)

Give it a try, but keep an open mind,"

It&#39;s a unique taste experience and is much needed here in the Denver Metro area. I implore and encourage everyone to taste this food at least once. You will not be dissapointed. 

I have been here twice since they opened with some of my  co-workers(non-afghans). They were and are still raving about how delicous and unique the food is. I get a call every week now asking me to go with them to the &#34;new afghan restaurant&#34;. 

With regards to the restaurant itself;

The service is efficient and with a smile. 
The owner is friendly and takes pride in his food. 
The ambiance is  similar to your dining room and very comfortable.
The kabobs are cooked to perfection and seasoned with the right amount of spices(not too overwhelming or bland).
The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.
The portions will leave you with enough food for lunch tomorrow.

What else do you want from a restaurant? 

The Denve Metro area hasnt had an Afghan restaurant for a few years now. I consider Ariana Kabob Cafe as the &#34;rebirth&#34; of Afghan cuisine in Denver. I cant stress enough the importance of this restaurant for our community. Again, please give them your business - your taste buds will thank you."

So we were excited to see this place pop up. We visited here for the first time at lunch on a Saturday. There were quite a few other customers there and one server. 
We were greeted, seated and our order taken in a timely and friendly manner. 

We tried the combination plate. Meats were all cooked just right! Everything was hot and delicious. We especially loved the naan, yummy! I recommend the brown rice......true Afghani style, Don&#39;t forget the chutney!

I can&#39;t remember the name of the meal I got, but it is the first item on the specialties section (Number 13 I think was the associated number). It featured delicious combinations of rice, raisins, carrots, lamb, and buttery spinach. Pro-tip: just mix it all together and then eat it to get a canvas of delicious flavors painting a masterpiece with every bite. The food is served quickly so I was able to get my take-out in less than 2 minutes from ordering and got out the door. I will be dining in sometime for sure when I am not eating alone."

I do not know how it is suppose to taste but my taste buds loved it all.  My friend said the flavors were right on, she should know.

We arrived at 1pm and they did not have mantoo and arashk, which means they did not prep before they opened the restaurant. Pitty because after reading so many reviews we had great expectation. We started with bolani for appetizer, it was soaked in oil and needed more flavor. For the entree we ordered lamb kabob sandwich and qabuli Palau. Qabuli had watery spinach and missing white beans, as for the lamb it was pretty blend and lacked any taste. The lamb kabob sandwich was a sleeper, so 80% of the sandwich was lettuce with only a few chunks of lamb. Every bite in my sandwich was lettuce I barely felt I was eating a lamb sandwich. The lamb sandwich was $9 and it was full of lettuce!!! This place is cheap on the meat!!! I DO NOT RECOMEND this place at all. The whole mean was $34.

Anyone who likes to explore Ethnic Food should check it out.      It is a quiet setting with a neutral relaxed decor.  The service is really good, but be aware that this is a family run restaurant and at times they are functioning as a two man shop, so plan to spend a little extra time.  The extra time is definitely worth the tasty treat!  I have read a couple of reviews that said that that portion sizes were too small.  My husband and I do not concur.  There is enough portion to become reasonably full and even overstuffed.  If you want to pig out, find a buffet.  If you want an above normal portion size they will take care of you very well.  It&#39;s a reasonable price to experience a new cuisine and I am so glad that we tried it out!  It will probably be one of our preferred restaurants."

The rice is exceptional, each grain  chewy and separate, and the rice with carrots and raisins is out of this world.  Each dish is clearly prepared to order, but arrives quickly.  Service is understated but attentive and pleasant.   It&#39;s a bit tucked away on the east side of HMart but well worth seeking out.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, there will always be a soft spot in my heart for die hard Denver establishments like My Brother&#39;s Bar and The Brown Palace&#39;s Shipyard Tavern. But Rebel Restaurant makes this city even cooler in a different way.

I&#39;ll be the first to admit it: Rebel Restaurant is a little intimidating. Am I cool enough to go here for a drink, let alone a meal? I&#39;ve definitely driven by with the intention of visiting, only to chicken out like a wussy.

Finally wrangling up the nerve to go on in there and give &#39;er a try, it just so happened to be a non-crowded Saturday evening: &#34;Let&#39;s just go for a drink. If they&#39;re dicks, we can go somewhere else&#34; was the mindset. 

Of course they&#39;re not dicks! Denver people are generally pretty nice, Rebel Restaurant&#39;s staff included. Yeah, it&#39;s totally hip inside with pinball machines, water jugs shaped like animals (so it looks like an alligator is barfing water into your glass), and an American/Asian fusion menu. But rest assured that you&#39;ll have a good meal and kind people helping you along the way.

If Rebel Restaurant were in San Francisco, the staff would be pouty, rude and everyone would line up to take the abuse at a pretty penny. Don&#39;t ask me why, I don&#39;t live there anymore. Good news for me? Rebel Restaurant is in Denver where prices are reasonable and people are nice. #Winning"
rebel-restaurant-denver,Brian J.,d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,38,8,8Fn1yTQtjbmLALWNS7r_lg,4.0,2016-11-18,"We heard about this place because I was searching for a restaurant that served pig&#39;s head. Rebel popped up, so we finally gave Rebel a try last week.  We had to call ahead for the pig&#39;s head but as soon as we got there we were seated right away.  As soon as you walk in to this place you are greeted by the bartender, and that is rare nowadays.  The lighting was dim, and the place is pretty small.  We were waiting for more friends to arrive so we started with drinks.  I had the Dilinger and my wife had beer.  The Dilinger was very good. Just the right amount of alcohol and not overpowering.  
When our friends arrived, the pig&#39;s head still wasn&#39;t ready so we ordered more food.  We got the Pig&#39;s Part Of The Day, which was pig&#39;s skin made as noodles, topped with egg and crispy chicken bacon.  We also got the Mexican Chex-Mix, which is chili-limon glaze, peanuts, pinwheels, and grasshoppers.  Last, we ordered the Rocky Mountain Oysters.  The Pig&#39;s skin noodles was real rich in flavor, and you can hardly know by the texture of the noodles that it was actually skin. But this is definitely for the pig lovers because it has a real porky flavor to it.  it is real rich too so it is good to share this dish. The crispy chicken bacon in it is also delicious. You can hardly tell it is chicken and not pork.  The grasshoppers were also good.  Although I would have loved to have more grasshoppers in the bowl.  That was the best part of the bowl.  The rocky mountain oyster was the least favorite of the 3, although I still loved it.  My only gripe was that it had too much breading.  But the flavor was delicious.  
After eating these dishes we were still waiting for our pig&#39;s head.  So while we waited, we ordered shots of the snork juice.  This is their take on a cinnamon whiskey shot, which is poured from an alligator skin flask.  This was the drink the drink of the night and a must have when you come here.  It was so smooth, unlike the Fireball.  
Finally our pig&#39;s head arrived and this was worth the wait.  It was so flavorful! The skin was also crispy, which I loved.  The vegetables around it works perfectly with each bite because it cuts off a lot of the richness of the head.  I kind of wish that they had some sort of bread or rice that comes with it.  That would make the dish much less rich.  
I am looking forward to coming back here again and trying their other dishes.  Maybe the whole duck is next.  I would have given this place a 5 star, but the pig&#39;s head took a long time to come out, even after we called ahead.  But that is easily forgiven with the nice people that work here and the top notch quality products they have."

Small hipster portions at giant hipster prices. I was hoping for the fried tripe the other reviews mentioned, but it wasn&#39;t on the menu.  I got something claiming to be a quesadilla and a pierogi. Alas, twas neither. For $8 I got 2 soggy potstickers with pork tamale filling. And I can grab a dozen tamales for $12 at many places.  The green chili and other sauces were good, but this didn&#39;t have the cheese of a quesadilla or the crispy doughiness of a pierogi. 
The pickle selection was mediocre, you&#39;ll find much better pickles when ordering at a Korean restaurant and they&#39;d be free side dishes. 
My drink was pretty good and included a Thundercats reference, The eye of thundera.
Everyone in our group was left hungry despite all ordering  entrees.  This was the closest open food place near 13th floor.

That was my first impression of the Rebel upon walking in. It&#39;s spacious, clean, uncluttered and definitely different! So unlike the food they serve their decor is sparse. Self explanatory. Simple. 

To me their dishes were disturbing, thought provoking, different and definitely elicited a lot of questions from our group. About 7 questions just from me. 

The above description is all good. No complains on the creativity of the chef. Some of the dishes were superlative in preparation. Secretly I long to watch the chef prepare their very unique offerings!

The interior was pleasant and slick with vibrant red chairs throughout.  The waiter was nice as well. Foreshadowing, I&#39;m glad he was knowledgeable about their menu. After all, the decision and ordering process was nothing but typical. The menu is full of dishes that require some serious creativity and bravery. Maybe I lack culinary knowledge, but let&#39;s say that we all had several questions each.

Expect the unexpected, the Asian take on the Cracker Jack popcorn was surprisingly delicious, smothered with gochujang caramel goodness.  We also had Mexican inspired pierogies of the day, probably the least favorite of all. Raised on Polish cuisine, I prefer the traditional approach.  We also shared the warm octopus terrine, which was too chaotic for my palate.  Another atypical dish was the fried tripe poutine, the tripe wasn&#39;t battered resulting in a rich fatty tripe flavor with a crunchy exterior. This was just a few of their specialties.

Overall I would recommend that you simply go with it and be surprised. Just decide on the main ingredient of each dish perusing the menu, many delicious surprises await you."

I was disappointed with the actual food though. It was good, but not great... With how interesting and varied the menu is, I was hoping for more.

It&#39;s one of the most original restaurants in Denver, and the food is some of the best and most memorable I&#39;ve had in my five years of living here. 
The menu is genre-bending. Is it Eastern European? Asian? Comfort food? It&#39;s elements of them all, yet nothing you&#39;ve ever had before. I&#39;ve ordered vegetarian dishes that blew me away, then gorged on the most obscenely delicious and decadent pig-skin pasta dish (that possibly also involved foie gras? Not sure, I may have blacked out momentarily.) 
The beer list is well-curated, and the cocktails are as creative as the food. I dig the atmosphere because it&#39;s not too overdone--just comfortable, nice, cool without being self-conscious. Trendy dining scenes in Denver (and every big/growing city) have a tendency to grate on me, with their obsession with aesthetic and &#34;concepts&#34; that not only distract from the food itself, but can feel contrived or smotheringly hip. Rebel simply exists. And makes great food. (Although, one pet peeve: community tables. Introverts of the world, stand with me in solidarity against this unnecessary and inescapable trend!)
In summary: just eat here. You might be tempted to swipe one of their awesome animal-shaped water pitchers, but don&#39;t do it, because then you couldn&#39;t go back. And think of all the delicious pierogi specials you&#39;d miss out on."

Easily the most innovative restaurant to open in Denver over the past several years, it was at Rebel Restaurant that I sat down to dinner Thursday evening, and although perhaps a bit out of the way by some accounts the Dive Bar turned culinary concept built by Kickstarter is firing on all cylinders, not one of seven plates failing to induce excitement through its combination of textures and flavors.

Toqued by Dan Lasily and loosely described as Ukranian cuisine, though Asian and Western European concepts clearly come into play in terms of plating, seasoning and style, sitting down at the bar is a good bet for solo diners as the rest of the space includes communal tables topped with stylish pitchers, the Dark Metal soundtrack loud enough to be heard though equally easy to ignore.

Decorated inside and out by local artists, the Street-style sensibilities entirely in line with food that even the barmen can describe in great detail, any meal at Rebel should begin with housemade jerky sold by the ounce and no less so the daily Pierogi which was offered here tinged in Squid Ink atop a bed of Babaganoush with a pad of herb butter slowly melting and every bit worth the bargain basement cost.

Benefitted by Happy Hour discounts, though menu prices themselves are exceedingly affordable considering the ingredient quality and detail involved in each plate, dinner continued with a large bowl of crispy fried tripe topped in squeaky curds plus spiced gravy fortified by creamy duck liver, the tender cornmeal hushpuppies consisting of nearly half crustacean with the bright gastrique playing well off briny bacon and buttery cabbage.

Acknowledging a second dinner to follow, but unable to pass up an entrée or desserts, savory seafood Panna Cotta proved every bit as elegant as its constituents would indicate, and far less stiffened by gelatin than some versions the custard reminisced of Bisque in a good way beneath spicy Diavolo Sauce and earthy chips that contrasted sweet lobster meat, the PB&amp;J presenting every bit as much intrigue with a soft, spongy base and &#34;Wonderbread&#34; whipped topping while the upside down cake was actually quite traditional but delicious just the same."

We really wanted to like it but I think overall - it wasn&#39;t what we expected. There were some good things about this place. We really enjoyed the variety of pickled veggies we ordered as an appetizer. The food had great flavor! We ordered the Pig Part of the Day, which was ham, egg, goat cheese on a bun and an order of the squab. Like I said all the food had great flavor. I really liked the plates and water pitchers in this place. They were very homelike and unique. I think the chef (possibly the owner - not sure) is very passionate about the food. I like the concept of having a new menu every week. We ordered a couple drinks and I really liked mine - Gin and Tonic. My husband had a play on a mule (he liked it). I personally didn&#39;t like it because of the rose flavoring. I think rose flavored anything is nasty and I don&#39;t understand why chefs and mixologists insist of using rose flavors - but that&#39;s just my opinion. 

Our biggest complaint - well complaints - 1) It&#39;s over priced for what you get.  The plates seem small (even the entrées). With the Pig Part of the Day we basically got a breakfast sandwich for $10 and nothing else. When the waiter told our table what the dish was it sounded more elegant than what it was. He could have simply said a breakfast sandwich with ham. 2) We were concerned with the hygienic practices of the establishment. We observed the bartender and a food runner with beers in a glasses that were not covered. In the Food Establishment Rules and Regulations for Denver, page 18, 2-502C - it states that &#34;an employee may drink from a close beverage container...&#34; I&#39;m not a restaurant inspector but I know food safety coming from a family who was in the food business for 25+ years. I know many places don&#39;t have perfect inspection reports but customers do notice stuff like that. 

I think this restaurant has really great potential. I enjoy the &#34;trendy&#34;, &#34;hipster&#34; type places but I think the price point is too high for what you get.  I&#39;m glad I was able to experience this restaurant but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back for dinner anyway. This is a great place to have drinks and appetizers before going out for dinner."

The food was decent, but I didn&#39;t vibe with the atmosphere. I guess I was expecting more of a restaurant vibe and less of a bar vibe. I&#39;m never a fan of communal seating either. We started with the crab/avocado pierogi. It was pretty good, but the real winners were the khachapuri and cubano-yaki doughballs. We decided to split the whole fried fish of the day (striped bass). It was cooked well but neither of us were a huge fan of the lettuce purée. Ended the meal with the Kobe cookie, which was to die for.

It is in an industrial area which meant that I automatically liked it from the get go.  The space was really casual inside and I felt like I was transported back to Germany and their awesome beer gardens.

For an app we went for the pig part of the day which was the tail.  Having never eaten pig tail before we ordered that.  You wouldn&#39;t know it was the tail unless you were told.  The pieces of tail had a little bone surrounded by meat, then some fat and then crispy skin.  In other words, the perfect bite (minus the bone natch).  The pieces of tail were coated in a soy glaze and tossed with mushrooms and greens.  Really good!

We also shared a pierogi of the day which was goat cheese and blueberry.  Both of us were a bit trepidatious with the flavor profile but went for it and oh man was it incredible.  

For our main we decided on the 1/2 of a pigs head.  It takes about 40 minutes to cook which isn&#39;t a biggie as we were chatting with friends.  When it came out it didn&#39;t really look like what you would expect a pig&#39;s head to look like.  Once you dig in to the succulent meat, crispy skin and fat then more of the face becomes apparent.  With that being said, this is some of the most tender pork I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They give you a pair of tongs to really get in there but the meat just falls away from the bone.  Also incredible was home made grilled flatbread.  I&#39;ve never had bread like that before and simply put, it was divine.  Also included were grilled spring onions, blood oranges, pickles and onions.  In retrospect, I could have also really enjoyed a stout mustard to cut through the fat.  We were so full from the head that we gave extras to friends and barely stayed awake the rest of the night.

We really like the philosophy that the whole animal should be used and the dedication of the staff to bring this to the general public.  The food was very well prepared, customer service was excellent and we will definitely be back."

We started with the Thom Ka Gai popcorn and received a Japanese rice seasoning popcorn instead. I realize it&#39;s just popcorn, but it&#39;s $5 for the tiniest plate/barely-a-bowl of popcorn and not even served from the Asian nation it claims. Lame. I informed the waitress and she said she gave the wrong menu but still charged us for it. The fried chicken sandwich was bomb but I had to share from my friend&#39;s sandwich because the waitress never came around for me to order one. She did come ask if I ended up wanting one about ten minutes after some dude that popped out of the kitchen yelled at me about making a big mistake if I didn&#39;t order one (maybe since he saw me eating from my friend&#39;s plate). I have no idea who this guy was, or who he thought he was to tell patrons what mistakes they are making in life but I didn&#39;t really appreciate it. How about come over to the table and introduce yourself before you start passing out advice in an off putting tone, or ask us if we need anything? Yes, a flippin sandwich before I eff up my life?!
For dessert, some frozen cantaloupe that we had to ask for a steak knife. It tasted like they had leftover cantaloupe they didn&#39;t know what else to do with except pulp and freeze it. Let&#39;s just throw some mint and whole pink peppercorns (is that ever a good idea with anything?) and charge people to eat it. 
Best part was that it was my birthday and the waitress did absolutely nothing. I know it&#39;s not right to have expectations but there are plenty of other restaurants that would have comped a dessert, or maybe the popcorn they fudged on. 
Just not really sure what&#39;s up with the 4 1/2 stars here on Yelp. If you&#39;re charging $7 for a pint of craft beer you really need to step up your customer service is all I&#39;m real sayin&#39; and I doubt the kitschiness they thrive on will keep them going for too long unless they put more thought and detail into things."

Sure, I&#39;m from Chicago. And I&#39;ve only eaten at four restaurants in Denver. And my buddies own the place. But seriously, go here! 

It&#39;s always nice to walk into a joint where the people working are having a genuinely good time. Wu Tang was blasting as I walked in. That&#39;s the kind of environment Dan and Bo present for their guests, and it shows in the experience. I dined solo for dinner before embarking on a tour of Colorado to visit friends across the state, and they couldn&#39;t have been more accommodating. 

I started with a local brew from 4 Hands brewery. Fantastic IPA. Obviously Colorado knows beer. Another solid offering was a Black Ale from TRVE, a heavy metal themed brewery in town. The drink list is simple and balanced, whether you&#39;re in the mood for beer or liquor. 

Food kicks ass here. Obviously. While I was going to be ambitious and order the whole octopus or pigs head, I ended up opting against it. The boys gave me a plethora of small plate offerings, every single one of which rocked my world. I&#39;m Ukrainian, so are they, so naturally I had to get the ham on rye bread with deviled eggs and horseradish/beet sauce. Even better than baba makes it. The pierogi of the day featured gruyere cheese and dill (?), If I recall - these guys could run a successful restaurant on assorted pierogis alone if they wanted to. My favorite were the more complex dishes that you legitimately would not find at any other restaurant. Specifically, the curried snails (compared to your escargot, which is hard to find outside of a French restaurant in and of itself) and deep fried chicken liver mousse (delectably savory) with an unorthodox, yet delicious sauce pairing were the stars of the show. The chefs dare you to try more obscure food and then blow your mind with how amazing the flavors are. These seriously radical flavors challenge even the most complex of palates. Double shot of Kentucky bourbon was a nice ending to the meal. 

Even compared to some of Chicago&#39;s heavyweight standards, this place does some incredible work with their food. Menus rotate often and are constantly evolving. When I come back to Denver, I&#39;ll certainly be back to try an entire new batch of brilliant concoctions. I suggest y&#39;all check this place out immediately if you&#39;re a more daring eater; you won&#39;t be disappointed."

I understand what they are attempting to accomplish, and I applaud them for that. However, I feel that they have yet to hit their mark. 

Service was great and the drinks were delicious. Yet, with such a courageous and daring menu, I expected more from the cuisine. The jerky was way too salty and difficult to get through a 2oz order. The pierogis were decent, but nothing special. The &#34;lasagna&#34; was not what we were expecting, and mediocre. And the pork belly, although cooked well, was part of an overall underwhelming entree. Additionally, doom and death metal does nothing positive for your atmosphere.

As I said, I understand what rebel is doing, and I welcome adventurous Culinary pioneers such as this. However, as imaginatively involved this project is, I feel there quite isn&#39;t enough direction from the back of the house to warrant a return visit. All in all, we felt underwhelmed.

We wish them luck in the future, Though."

After visiting Rebel this past weekend, we have definitely found THE SPOT. 

From the outside, you would never guess the gourmet food and drinks, eclectic decor, and relaxing atmosphere that awaits inside. We were warmly greeted by not only server, but the chef and bartender as well. We were treated like regulars on our first visit! If there is anything to take away from my experience... GET THE STUFFED PEPPER SMALL PLATE."

Sometimes you go out to eat for a good tasting dinner, sometimes you go out for something quick, and sometimes you go out for a dinner that tastes amazing, is unique and fun, entertaining, and leaves you with lasting memories.

Rebel Restaurant is the latter - every dish we had was incredible, even the creme brûlée was the best I&#39;ve ever had. The place is different, and the vibe is &#34;we don&#39;t necessarily care for your judgement, but we&#39;re going to deliver something that we put a lot of time, passion and effort into. Let us show you what we love.&#34; And I&#39;m down with that. I&#39;m kind of sick of the cater-to-every-need, the-customer-is-always-right places... because they end up trying to please everyone and so leave their original passion to the wind. Not here... when you step into this place, you&#39;re getting Rebel through and through. They&#39;re passionate yet humble, and that&#39;s not always easy to do. I especially appreciated the emphasis on local and in-season foods.

Go check it out, walk in with an open mind - and do yourself a favor, let the chef pick your dishes with no modifications. Yum!"

Upon walking in to the restaurant I was immediately grumpy. It was extremely loud due to a full rowdy bar (especially for 6 pm) and almost every table was communal or reserved. 
We were seated at a communal table with another couple who left during the middle of our meal and were replaced with a party of 4, one of whom kept kicking and jiggling the bench we were on. 
Service was EXTREMELY slow, although I think to a lack of staffing not our servers abilities. I was seated with a direct view of the kitchen and saw several people (employees and non employees) in the kitchen with hair not pulled back, dishwasher and chef drinking beer, chef on his cell phone not washing hands after.  I get that this stuff happens, I&#39;ve worked in food for years, but if it&#39;s going to happen i don&#39;t want to see it. 
Food was hit or miss. The foie dish was overly sweet, yet balanced with the mustard, the pierogies, while tasty, definitely overpriced at $4 for one small one, the squid &#34;noodle&#34; dish was by far the least favorite and not finished. The star of the dinner was actually the dessert. The pb&amp;j-peanut butter marshmallow with wonder bread mousse and grape jelly ice cream, yum. 
Cocktails, while good, were served over small ice cubes. These days if I pay $12 for a cocktail I would like it served over a large ice cube, so it&#39;s not watered down, I know, high maintenance. 
Rebel does has a good happy hour-all small plates were $2 off until 6:30, but I think unless I go for happy hour I won&#39;t be back."

I was always a little questionable about the location, entrance, parking etc.  BUT finally tried and had a wonderful meal. Delicious food, great cocktails(many interesting ones on the menu), wonderful wine.  And eclectic menu that changes seasonally; boudin balls, pierogis, pork heavy menu.  It was winter, so a comfort food menu in small plate portion. 
Perfect place for drinks, a semi casual meal with friends(shared plates), solo dining at the bar. Just all in all a really enjoyable experience.  Many community tables FYI."

I love this place like a cat loves ripping the spine out of a rabbit. It is so, so good! I can&#39;t think of another restaurant in Denver exploring the mouth landscape like Rebel does. They take chances, use more of the animal than most, and make you say &#34;goddamn&#34; again and again. Do not miss a chance to try this spot, you will not be disappointed.

Intimate, warm and welcoming space coupled with a lively and caring energy that started with the bartenders and chefs - and spreading like wildfire to other guests in the restaurant - us included!  Duroc bone-in pork chop was succulent.  The beet perogies were top-notch and the banana bread desert alone is worth going for...thought about that slice many of times this week.

-LOUD heavy metal music. Increased my blood pressure, didn&#39;t make for an atmosphere conducive to any conversation

-Cocktail menu tries too hard to be hipster and is unnecessarily confusing. Had a &#34;i might explode&#34;, which is some sort of margarita. Light on booze, tasted like a wet sock. Bartender made me a &#34;bourbon forward&#34; cocktail, which ended up being their &#34;housemate&#34; root beer with rye whiskey. Well, he told me there was whiskey in it. Couldn&#39;t taste any. Just an overly sweet root beer with too much anise. 

-Menu seems appropriate if you are trying to prove your masculinity with an oddity of menu choice and challenge. Or if organ meats are your jam."

We had a heard some great things, But could not be prepared for what this little spot had to offer. First off, I&#39;d say that this is an American eatery with some Ukrainian undertones, all of which are executed perfectly (my wife come from a Ukrainian family, so I&#39;ve had the homemade, passed down recipes). The flavors and style are top notch and the decor is comfortable and homey. But let me put it into the best words I can describe: it&#39;s worth driving into Denver to check out. We live about 20 minutes out, and we plan on making Rebel a regular spot. Check it out and enjoy."

I hadn&#39;t seen the menu beforehand and would say that if you go, be adventurous, as the menu has some unusual, but tasty items (I saw, but did not sample half pig&#39;s head, fried entrails, to name a few). I went with a group of four, and we tried about 6-7 items off the menu. Very good, fresh food - each plate is served as soon as it is prepared. Definitely worth trying for something different.

But be careful, the menu turns over REALLY quickly. These dishes may not still be there. 

While the food is untraditional and not what I would have picked, everything was excellent. 

The pigs head, or Wilbur, was a little intimidating to get into, but the meat was tender and delicious. Don&#39;t be afraid to dig into every crevice for all the succulent morsels. 

Sweetbreads were also good, but not quite. 

Tripe poutine was amazing. 

The banana bread with dulce de leche and frozen whipped butter is the best dessert I&#39;ve had in a long time. 

Focused but excellent beer selection. Unsure about the wine."

That&#39;s awesome in the RiNo neighborhood. The interior is pretty sparse, low budget. It gets very loud as the night goes on---lots of hard surfaces. The sound system is lower end and muddy. The seats are all hard as well. Most just stool type seating even at tables. Four of us had a variety of small plates, which were very tasty: buffalo pig skin popcorn, baked sourdough, and smoked crab hush puppies. We had a few large plates as well: lobster panna cotta, and the 2 lb. pork chop. The panna cotta was warm around the edge with chilled sesame puree spread on bread in the middle. The temp and texture of the center was really off-putting to all 4 of us. The pork chop was a thing of beauty. Perfectly cooked, terrific flavor. We really wanted to try the dessert, but just couldn&#39;t hear each other across the table at that point. They looked delicious. One other comment worth noting. We enjoyed our cocktails but they took a long, long time to get to the table. I&#39;d guesstimate 10-15 minutes. So put your order in when you&#39;re halfway through the first drink. A nice touch; the bartenders were delivering the drinks at one point. Can&#39;t be too efficient, but it was like the chef delivering the food. So, we liked the food but the atmosphere would probably cause us to think hard next time we&#39;re looking at our go-to restaurant list. We spent about $200 including tip for 4. For that we don&#39;t want many drawbacks."

Had the pirogues which were overpriced and had too much cheese and sauteed onions. The fried oysters had good flavor but the portions were so small-one or two fried oysters on a crusty piece of bread. It didn&#39;t justify the price especially considering it was more of a dive bar than a restaurant. And last let down, I received my entree less than three minutes after ordering it which is not always a bad thing but my date received his dish fifteen minutes later, after I was already finished with mine.

It&#39;s an old school diner set-up so I sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly server. I asked him what they were known for and he quickly recommended the Smackdown Burrito -- I didn&#39;t argue -- I didn&#39;t even ask what it was. I just said, &#34;sounds good&#34; and off he went.

A few minutes later he returned with a giant smothered burrito, BUT not just any burrito - this thing was loaded with eggs, chorizo sausage, crispy tater tots, creamy mac-and-cheese and smothered in thier famous pork chili verde sauce. That&#39;s right. Insane. 

Despite how crazy it sounds, every ingridient worked! It was spicy, sweet, salty, crunchy and ridiculously creamy. The house branded hot sauce gave it an extra kick and I woofed it down... every last bite. Woke up the next morning feeling great too, haha. Just what the doctor ordered. 

Come to find out, Sam&#39;s was featured on &#34;Diners, Drive In&#39;s and Dives&#34; on the Food Network. Makes perfect sense... I can see Guy raving about this joint and all of thier crazy menu items.

We ate breakfast here and really enjoyed it. Surprised that a diner didn&#39;t open till 7 on a Saturday, but Starbucks was around the corner to satisfy the need for a warm coffee.

I chose Sam&#39;s because they featured Honey Smoked Fish and that intrigued me. I had the Honey Smoked Salmon Benny. WHOA - it was amazing. The fish is smoky, moist and salmon-y. There was also a slew of bacon strips under the nicely poached eggs and okay Hollandaise sauce. And -  some excellent home fries. Honestly, I am fussy about eggs benedict and when the hollandaise isn&#39;t on point, I can get grumpy. But the salmon and eggs won me over. I would do this again and again. Of course, it was too much and my husband had half.

It was nice he could share my breakfast. He had a side order of biscuits and gravy. As a side, it was huge - 2 split biscuits awash in sausage gravy. I think Denver is too citified for b&amp;g. The biscuits did not seem housemade and the gravy needed more flavor. If he didn&#39;t have to finish my meal, he would have been OK with his breakfast, but then the review would have been a 2 or 3 star.

We looked at other meals being served. Omelets looked great. Eggs seemed to be treated with respect, not matter how they were ordered. Potatoes - yum. Waffles, pancakes and French toast all looked good.

Holy cow - the bloody Mary&#39;s looked amazing. I am not sure if I could function after one - lots of vodka and a nice bacon strip. But, if you can start your day that way - go for it!!

All in all, I think the 4 star says it all. I am a fan. So much to choose from. If you are my age - consider ordering one meal and sharing. Good eats!"

I had been tracking Sam&#39;s for a while now since I had first seen it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. I looked at the menu online before my trip and kind of had in mind what I wanted, it wasn&#39;t until I sat down and was given one of the huge menus that I felt a little lost.

You could seriously order pretty much anything here. The menu is quite vast and covers breakfast, lunch and dinner quite well. I had my eye originally on the &#34;Shamrock Burger&#34; which is essentially a Reuben Sandwich on top of a beef patty. Reuben sandwiches are my favorite sandwich in the world, and this one was a great compliment to them. I subbed the beef patty for a buffalo patty and hit the jackpot. I had never had buffalo before so it was a pleasant experience for my taste buds.  If you have never had buffalo before... let me tell you that it tastes like steak, super meaty and is pretty good.

I am going to go out on a limb and say that the Shamrock with a buffalo patty might be in the top 3 burgers I have ever had all time. That is quite a statement as I love me burgers of all kinds! Also sub Tater Tots for the fries (you can thank me later!)

The wife ordered breakfast (of course) even though it was like 8pm. She ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. Everything is quite oversized here so she got full fast off the single waffle. Overall we were both very satisfied and wished we had came one more time before we left Denver, but next time we will be back for sure!"

I ordered a vegetarian burrito to go, staff is super friendly and enthusiastic.  The decoration inside is bright and has lots of signs and newspaper clippings everywhere about how highly rated the restaurant is. 

My vegetarian burrito was huge, I mean I could only eat 1/5 of it. It was also not that tasty without the addition of a sh*tload of Cholula or tapatio sauce. 
Next time i will probably order a meat burrito because that will probably have more flavor. The price was very good, which is why they get an extra star."

Went on a Sunday night and it was pretty crowded even for so close to closing time, which is always a good sign. The place is big so you can bring larger groups and/or pull up a two top and order your favorite kitchen sink burrito which is massive, take your pick from breakfast favorites, or even a Greek gyro. They have it all.

The staff was energetic, the decor was cute, and there&#39;s a business card with a piece of candy for you to take for 10% off your next time. 

Talked to some of the locals and they all say that same thing; tourist trap.  Not that I&#39;m complaining though! It&#39;s good to have a local place who can cater to everyone. 

Kitchen sink burrito was massive! I wish there was more flavor instead of being overwhelmed by all the melted cheese and tortilla. 

Scratch corned beef hash was  really good but there were a couple of really burnt pieces. 

They have two hot sauces that are labeled with their namesake which is a good souvenir if you want to memorialize your experience here. A good option for those picky eaters who don&#39;t do well with new flavors."

For breakfast I recommend one of the breakfast burritos with green chili. Lunch or dinner their burgers are great, they have a variety of sides to choose from (fries, onion rings, salad, etc)and you cannot go wrong with their green chili fries. If you are looking for something on the more healthy spectrum I would recommend the buffalo chicken salad it is HUGE and you probably won&#39;t be able to finish the whole thing.

* Friendly service
* Huge restaurant = plenty of seating = shorter waiting times (although it was Saturday morning and it was very busy, there was a 40 minute wait) We did see people drinking coffee while they waited, I don&#39;t know if it was complimentary.
* Extensive menu
* Large portions = bang for your buck!
* Clean bathrooms which is a plus!

You can pretty much find everything on this menu. We ordered the Breakfast Quesadilla, Folded flour tortilla w/ melted cheddar, diced bacon &amp; 2 scrambled eggs. Served with homefries, lettuce &amp; tomato, Kickin&#39; Green Chili &amp; sour cream on the side. We substituted the flour tortilla for the corn tortillas to make Gluten free (8.99). We also ordered the Chorizo Tacos, 3 warm corn tortillas stacked with crispy homefries, chorizo-egg scrambler &amp; topped w/ jack &amp; cheddar cheeses. Side of tomatillo salsa ($9.99). We ate this between 3 people and we had leftovers. You must get the crispy homefries, they were delicious.

One thing to go for if you&#39;re a fan of Corn Beef Hash. Like me. This place takes the cake! The. Best! It&#39;s crunchy on the outside and darn delicious. It&#39;s not the canned kind. That&#39;s true and I agree. It&#39;s the one made lovingly by someone I want to take home with me :) Don&#39;t make a mistake and order the other one. There&#39;s two kinds. Order the one that says Scratch Corn Beef hash. It&#39;s made with onions and bell peppers and is a dollar more than the canned one. Be a baller. Spend that extra buck. ;)

Being native to the Midwest, when I read the words &#39;diner&#39; I associate the establishment for a grease pit feeding me in the middle of the night.  If this vision resonates with you as well, still try Sam&#39;s No. 3!!  It is nothing but opposite to the above description. 

As we approached the diner, we saw two booths available on the half-covered patio.  We went in and there was no line.  I believe we were the second table to request a booth on the patio because the host giggled a bit and said we&#39;d be sat shortly.  Within the two minutes we waited while the kind bussers prepared our curbside booth, another three guests requested patio seating!   We must have arrived at the right time to score such a hot commodity!

I want to say Kelly was our server, but we heard &#34;Judy&#34; so much I can&#39;t recall! Hahah! (PS... is Judy the owner? She seemed loved as can be!)  As I mentioned above, I&#39;ve known all along that Sam&#39;s is much more than a traditional diner, but I still never gave it a try. Don&#39;t ask me why, but if I had to guess it&#39;s likely because I could eat the entire menu!  It&#39;s massive and took me 20 minutes to read, weigh options, and finally decide on my meal. Lol. While I appreciate many options, I can&#39;t say it&#39;s best for my dining experiences! #indecisiveatheart Even so, Kelly did an outstanding job!  She kept our water filled and bellies FULL.  She also answered all of my silly questions and requests!

This place has ginormous serving sizes, and again, options are endless!  I ordered the Wedge Salad and Mac &amp; Cheese Dip.  I feel like most could define a wedge, but this one was garnished with huge, crispy Onion Rings!  And for the dip, what&#39;s that you ask? Yep!  Creamy, cheesy mac with Ground Chorizo &amp; Green Chili served with Tortilla Chips (its spicy if curious). We couldn&#39;t believe the speed our meal came out!  So quick!!! 

I&#39;m fairly certain Kelly was impressed and/or disgusted when we ordered dessert!  How could we not?  Their &#34;Flauntas&#34; are a must!  Sam&#39;s offers three filling options and three sauce options allowing you to customize the sweetly fried tortilla exactly how your heart desires!  We of course ordered it Fried Cheesecake Style with Chocolate Sauce &amp; Vanilla Ice Cream!  

I woke today wanting to return tomorrow... Which, I might (my tummy needs a break!). Thanks for making our Saturday a tasty one!"

The restaurant is always busy, sometimes to the point of being not worth the wait. Average table time is about 5 minutes, but when it&#39;s 1 hour plus I usually find a place nearby to go instead. 

I had their BBQ burger in the past which was AMAZING--juicy, delicious and smothered in a savory sauce. This time, I tried the Eggs Benedict. It came in a very generous portion with a serving of home fries. The Benedicts themselves were delicious with perfectly cooked eggs and delicious hollandaise.

My dinner Kitchen Sink Skillet lasted me dinner, morning breakfast, and then a snack. The food came pretty fast for a group of 10 I suppose. Wait time isn&#39;t too bad either.

The food here is like a nice blend of American and Mexican fusion food. The burritos are FILLED with meat. Very hearty meal. One of my friend&#39;s burritos didn&#39;t come with black beans accidentally but she got extra ground beef in hers. Any complaining? I think not. The fajitas and burritos are covered with lot of lettuce/tomato/cheese. The burgers are really hefty as well. The toast is also soft, but also crusty too. And the pancakes are soft, sweet and giant!

Though beware there is green chili in some of the dishes. I didn&#39;t mind it, but to some of my friends it came a little too strong. The waitress and service was very nice. There&#39;s an automatic 20% gratuity tip for parties if 8 and more.

Overall, I loved eating here. If you are starving and have a giant stomach, I would definitely come by."

Just a few minutes later our server brought menus &amp; said &#34;you know the kitchen is closing at 2 today?&#34; (For Thanksgiving...?) of course we didn&#39;t know that. If we knew that we would not have walked in at 1:55pm! But she promised they&#39;d take great care of us, so we ordered like normal. Our food came out fast, but it was mostly disappointing: one of my biscuits was stale - hard as a rock (the server tried to tell me that was impossible cause they are fresh delivered every morning. Tap tap lady, hard as a rock!); my friend ordered the pecan waffle sandwich, which was NOT a sandwich. The waffle came on a separate plate; one of her poached eggs was broken; and the pecans were raw chopped nuts strewn all over this soft waffle that had obviously been heated in a microwave.

I ordered one of the burritos (the Havana I think, it&#39;s been 2 weeks...), which was partly so I could save 1/2 for my son. That was a mistake because it was pretty heavy on the sausage and I would have preferred more veggies. The rest of my group enjoyed their food. 

The server was uber-chill, to the point of being too chill to remember to bring us anything we asked for.... Coffee refill, hot sauce, etc. But he was nice enough and so who wants to be the cranky customer that can&#39;t be chill along with him and take your coffee refill whenever it may come?

As for the food, they have a decent breakfast selection. Of particular interest is that they have teamed up with the Honey Smoked Fish Company to give you some honey smoked salmon delight! This means they have a few menu items that really are bursting with that sweet fish flavor we all love!

While my table-side comrades seemed satisfied with their selections (or at least moderated by the beers) the first bite of Coney #1 on my plate was so dismally lukewarm that I didn&#39;t even attempt to swallow the chew (apologies for the display to my peers at the table). The gentleman in the Blue Shirt (I assumed to be the manager on duty) attempted to ease the tension with the rapid deployment of a second Coney, and while I appreciate the meager attempt at correction, after the severely underwhelming taste of old ground beef atop the Macho Nachos, I simply could take another bite of food spewed from this kitchen. Call me cray cray, but I&#39;m probably not the only person in the world whom avoids eating second attempts from the kitchen, following customer complaints. Charge me for the beers, sure, since I drank and did dutifully enjoy them; however, the house had to eat the food...so you should likewise win the privilege of paying for it. 

Arguably this is my fault and not theirs, since I seem to carry a burdensome expectation that food marketed as &#34;hot&#34; be delivered to my presence temperate, but then again, the whole situation could&#39;ve been avoided by simply serving reasonably warm food in the first place! Upon my initial inquiry with the server, I was led to believe that a Coney would leave the kitchen with some evidence of having once dwelt upon a &#34;griddle,&#34; but alas I led astray by the beer server in the red company shirt. The Coney with a light splash of Chili#3 resembles a cheap build frank of the Bar-S variety, served in a lackluster bun, peppered with chili, mustard and un-godly large chunks of diced onion. Seriously folks, I hereby invite you to my kitchen for a &#34;Coney,&#34; and would be certain not to disappoint you. 

While it makes little difference in the grand scheme whether I visit one restaurant or another during my travels, I like to think that the dollars spent have bought me something more meaningful than simply a meal or an act of service: in this case, the meager wages spent on a now-empty belly and a full-trashcan have purchased for me the right and duty to stand upon on a moral high-ground and denounce this treasonous menu, that claims to offer something for anyone, while delivering mediocrity to everyone.

The scrambled eggs looked like the cook forgot to stir the pan and actually scramble the eggs. And my over hard eggs were extra hard.

That was quite interesting thankfully no one was hurt. Our server was friendly although not very attentive. I ordered the chile relleno , it was okay I would probably not ever order it there again.

I ordered the Country Skillet, but I think I ended up getting the Kitchen Sink Skillet instead.

After eating this for at least 10-15 minutes, it looked like I hadn&#39;t even touched anything at all.  This dish was greasy and unfortunately, not super flavorful.  And thennn, Cholula saved the day!

The boyfriend got the Chorizo and Onion burrito covered in the green chili.  My goodness, that thing was HUUUUUUUGE.  The flavors were good, but I felt like something was missing.

We showed up early on this Saturday, probably 7:45am, and were seated right way.  When we left around 8:30 there was a wait with people both inside and out.  The coffee is good, the service is great, the food is blah.  My over-medium eggs had set yolks, which is quite annoying, and my choice of the homemade corned beef hash brought me a pretty tasty mix of potatoes, beef, and peppers swimming in a bunch of oil.  Blech.  I&#39;m an idiot from the south so I thought their sausage gravy (sticky, too thick) and biscuit (dense, tasteless) would be good.  You&#39;d think I&#39;d know better.

She Said:

Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast food that I won&#39;t make myself, so I was excited to see it on the menu here--and so many options! I ordered the avocado and tomato benedict with bacon on the side. So disappointing. The english muffin wasn&#39;t toasted. Heck, the thing wasn&#39;t warmed in any way at all. The avocado and tomato were both okay, but the egg was cold. The hollandaise sauce was also cold and too citrusy. And the bacon was cold. Fortunately, it was bacon, and even when cold, bacon is tasty. But still.

It was nice to be able to sit and watch a morning college football game on one of the TVs, and the tea was fine. Other than that, I don&#39;t have much good to say about the restaurant except, as He said, the service is fantastic. For overall food, there is better to be had--and nearby!

Our server was really nice and a great conversationalist! I totally get that the place is all about food being huge and heavy, but just ONE healthy dish would&#39;ve been great. :( everything was either pork or beef, it was kind of frustrating. 

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was SO GOOD. Much better than I assumed after seeing it. The cheese was just...ugh so good. Such good cheese! And the sandwich really wasn&#39;t bad either, just sooo heavy. I didn&#39;t even finish all of it! But we had a good time eating on the patio. Will definitely go again when I&#39;m not planning on walking 16th street mall that day!"

I saw that this place was close by so I took the free tram to get here.  Sam&#39;s No. 3 is a diner that gives you a home feeling.  They were polite to everyone that came in for a table and everyone who was waiting for their food to go.  Their menu can be overwhelming. There&#39;s so much to choose from but too bad I only have one stomach.  I ended up ordering the Avocado and Tomato benedict.   It was only 10.00 (before tax), that&#39;s such a good deal!    I waited a couple of mins for my order and walked back to my hotel to eat it.  The eggs were perfectly running and the ingredients were super fresh.

Hot turkey sandwich was just plain awful. Dry turkey smothered in salty, sticky gravy laid over totally average white bread served with a side of gummy mashed potatoes. Side salad was uninspired. 

Dining companion had something Mexican. It was unidentifiable under a mass of cheese and sauce. He didn&#39;t finish it.

The serving size can be a bit wily (typical of diners) so sharing is always recommended, even if you first arrive starving. Breakfast skillets are a favorite, along with biscuits and gravy. I recently tried their salmon sandwich for a change and to my delight they had pumpernickel bread! Salmon was a bit salty but a good alternative. Their chicken souvlaki and chili are tasty as well.

It was ok, and would be good to bring visitors to because of the Triple D notoriety, but as far as quality food, I&#39;m not really sure.  The French toast was just that. I got a little excited when I poured the syrup and it FLOWED out of the jar. I thought to myself, &#34;oh, cool, real maple syrup&#34;. Ha! Was more like watered down Sysco brand maple syrup flavored liquid. 

A review I read said to get the scratch made corned beef hash, it was worth the extra dollar. I think the extra dollar was to account for the extra grease. The grease was sadly the most notable thing about them. I didn&#39;t even eat half of them. 

The Kitchen Sink Omelet and cup of Green Chili that comes on the side were both very good! The chili has great flavor, and the flat top omelet was put together very well. The place has an old neighborhood diner feel, even the silverware. My 20 year old butter knife wouldn&#39;t cut the crust on the French toast, lol. 

Hindsight being 20/20, I should have went to Syrup."

I ordered the Honey Smoked Salmon CRE-B.L.A.T.S. which is:
Choice of toast with Cream cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, Tomato &amp; Salmon (no mayo). Served with a side

For the choice of toast, I picked a croissant and for the side, the homefries.  (see pic)
The breakfast sandwich came out way bigger than I had anticipated.  The salmon was light yet meaty and perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Not fishy tasting at all.  Thank goodness. 

My husband ordered the usual cheesy scrambled eggs and bacon which came out on a massive plate. Large portions indeed!

You can get breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks....Mexican or American...something for everyone.  I was tempted to get the New England Clam Chowder, but it&#39;s 50 degrees in Denver (yeh, not cold at all!!! And I was prepared for cold) and I didn&#39;t feel like soup.

Love greasy spoon places cause you know exactly what you&#39;re getting - good food, not the best quality, but still pretty tasty and cheap. 

I come here quite often actually cause I study a lot and sometimes just need something tasty and cheap to go. I&#39;m a fan of their burgers a breakfast burritos. I haven&#39;t tried anything else here yet. The 1/4 burger with fries and a drink is $5.25 and it&#39;s a good sized burger. Price is on par with fast food locations but you&#39;re getting better quality and it&#39;s cooked fresh when you order it. The burgers do come with a &#34;special sauce&#34; much like McDonald&#39;s Big Mac, so it&#39;s probably just thousand island dressing. They also have other burgers that have avocado, bacon, etc on it.

The breakfast burrito is pretty good! It&#39;s much better than some of my favorite brunch places around Denver. Probably cause of the simplicity of their burrito. I&#39;m Hispanic and grew up on the border of Mexico so having burritos that are &#34;smothered&#34; is still weird to me but I&#39;ve gotten more used to it and their&#39;s is a pretty good green chili. 

The woman and man (I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re married) who own the place are very nice. They usually cook when their other cook aren&#39;t there. 

I don&#39;t usually see that many people in the place, which is a shame cause I think they deserve more attention than a lot of other places around here that cost an arm and a leg for mediocre food. If you haven&#39;t tried them yet, I definitely recommend!"

See, the restaurant itself seems like it has fairly great food - the breakfast burrito is massive, the gyro special looks alright, the steak special is also appealing. All of the Mexican dishes and sandwiches look awesome. But it&#39;s called &#34;NGL Burgers&#34;. If you entered a place called &#34;NGL Burgers&#34;, wouldn&#39;t you expect a place that specializes in, well, burgers?

I ordered the burger special today, and it is with a weary heart that I say it did not live up to my standards. The patties were McDonald&#39;s-style thin, which led to them being overcooked. The burger fell apart as I picked it up because while the patties were thin, the whole burger was large in diameter. The bun was slightly burned on the top, and they didn&#39;t dry the lettuce before putting it on the burger, resulting in wet, soggy sauce dripping all over the container. &#34;The works&#34; on the burger included tomatoes, lettuce, regular American cheese, and uncooked onions - very generic and boring. Bite for bite, it tasted exactly the same as a Carl&#39;s Jr. Big Carl, but without the same look or quality. I think it might be because the sauce is almost an exact replica of the Carl&#39;s Jr. classic sauce, which is something of a mayo, relish, and ketchup blend. At first it was fine because I was hungry, but by the time I had consumed about 1/2 of the burger, it just got old. In fact, I was almost starting to regret the purchase. Why would anyone go out and pay $8 for a taste they could have surpassed at home?

The fries are somewhere in-between steak and shoe string, so they were neither crunchy nor soggy. Nothing special. 

The restaurant itself looks a little old and worn down. The colors are somewhat ugly, and it wasn&#39;t a place I wanted to sit down in, so I stood as I waited for my to-go order.

As I said before, all of the other menu items looked rather tasty and intriguing, but I came in looking for an awesome burger, which I didn&#39;t get. I will say though that the price is more reasonable here than at some other places I have eaten at.

I will come back again and order something else next time to see how they fare in their other dishes. But if you&#39;re looking for a burger joint in Aurora, CO, you&#39;re better off hitting Fatburger just a block to the west near the SuperTarget. Now THAT was a tasty burger."

The food was ready in 5 minutes (no other customers there) but neither employee could run the register so it sat for 20 minutes for someone else to get there.  If my kids weren&#39;t that hungry, I would have left.  That poor cook had to call twice for someone to come back and ring us up.  Unfortunately the Owner didn&#39;t turn the experience around.  When he arrived he was more interested in taking my money than making it right.  He quickly apologized and took his time to make sure he tallied up the order and didn&#39;t miss any additions (he made sure to point out that the cheese and bacon was an extra charge).  Even his employee jokingly said, &#34;he&#39;ll give you something for free to make up for it.&#34;  NOPE!  I led the kids to the car and went back in to express my disappointment from businessman to businessman and he just said, &#34;OK&#34;.  No offer to make it right, no offer of empathy that his customers waited and paid full price for cold food.

The Hispanic husband and wife owners are friendly and the breakfast/lunch menu items are priced fairly cheep. I ordered bacon and eggs with hash browns and toast. I also had coffee. The restaurant wasn&#39;t busy at all the entire time I was there. In fact there were only 4 other people seated (at the same table). This restaurant was once owned by an elderly Greek couple and it was a quaint little dive where you could get a good tasting meal at a cheep price. The current owners purchased it from them (more than 10 years ago). The inside layout is exactly the same as when it was owned by the Greek couple. It sorely needs to be gutted and completely remodeled. It&#39;s partitioned with old looking lumber and some of the seating areas are elevated, so you have to step up to get to your table. The coffee was very bitter and they didn&#39;t have cream available. The eggs were cooked correctly (over medium), the bacon was crisp but dry like maybe it was microwaved. The hash browns were crisp but they put margarine on my toast. My table had 2 squeeze bottles of cheep pancake syrup and a salt shaker. So I reached over to another table for the pepper shaker. The floor was not clean, food, napkins and trash under some of the tables. The ceiling tiles are stained with water damage. The decor is just disjointed and it gives the impression that they don&#39;t care. I took a picture of a wall towards the front. There&#39;s a large American flag on the wall and below it is a cheap map of Mexico. On another wall is a poster picture of a Mexican man ( maybe an important person) but the poster was loose and falling off the wall. The menu looks like it needs to be updated. They still have gyros on the menu for example. They also have a few simple Mexican items as well. I think the owners need to decide what kind of food they want to be known for. I could say more negative things about this place than positive. I don&#39;t think I will go back."

maandeeq-east-african-cafe-aurora,Mark T.,RYIhfaNekKLDuqmwqkVi3g,"Aurora, CO",1,1,0,200,3,GCTBJb1r_0I3H-nklPMRYw,4.0,2010-01-04,"This Somali eatery located in an Aurora strip-mall offers a peek into a rare (for Denver) culinary dimension. 

Maandeeq is a word used particularly in Somaliland (the semi-autonomous region in the north of Somalia) for a type of female camel, and the restaurant serves as a meeting-point for expatriates from Somalia, Somaliland and Djibouti. 

Eagle-eyed visitors will notice that the space was formerly occupied by the Empress of China restaurant, and to that end, the current owners have kept many of the internal accoutrements, right down to the bottles of soy sauce on each table. 

There is no menu at Maandeeq - they serve what they have available each day. If you come by early in the morning (beginning at about 10 am) you may be able to partake in a meal of Suqaar (sliced beef cooked with onions and peppers) served with Canjeero (a pancake-like bread which is indeed vaguely similar to the Injera of Ethiopia and the Taita of Eritrea). 

At lunch and dinner times, the choices become quite a bit more varied and, in addition to Suqaar, may include Hilib Ari (succulent roasted goat), thin-pounded marinated beef steak, or a vividly yellow rendition of the Middle Eastern favorite, Chicken Shawarma. 

Lunch and dinner meals come with a choice of accompaniments. For example, Bariis is a cardamom and clove-kissed rice pilaf. Or how about Baasto (spaghetti with tomato sauce, a nod to the former Italian presence in much of Somalia)? Jabati/Sabayad (a chewy flatbread which hints at Somali cuisine&#39;s South Asian influence) is another possibility, or even Ugali [Soor] and Sukuma, a dish originating across the border in Kenya and consisting of white cornmeal porridge and a puree of leafy greens. 

I have tried each dish listed above and can personally vouch for its toothsomeness (I know that&#39;s not really a word, but humor me, OK?). 

All meals come with a banana (Moos) which is meant to be mixed in with your meal (per Somali custom) and a peppery soup called Maraq, and for a dollar extra you can try the soothing, comforting spiced tea called Shaah. 

Other possible beverages include mango (Cambe) and guava (Seytuun) juices, or Vimto (the English mixed-berry soda which is *very* popular in much of East Africa and across the Middle East as a whole). 

Most Somalis are devout Muslims and do not drink alcohol - thus Maandeeq does not have a liquor license. Please do not ask. In Somali, the word Beer in fact means Liver. 

I (or as the folks at Maandeeq know me, &#34;that weird white guy who shows up from time to time&#34;) highly recommend Maandeeq to those who are seeking something a little different in the culinary canon."

Yelp reviews seemed to indicate I would not be disappointed. I was not turned off by the strip mall storefront location of the place. Neither was I turned off by the  restaurant layout, unkempt look of the tables and booths and an entire room of overturned chairs on top of tables. My boyfriend and I seated ourselves (I was the only woman in the entire place) at a booth, whose seats were entirely too far away from the table to be comfortable. A man approached us and practically threw a single menu in front of us both, turned around and left. No greeting, no welcome, no &#34;What would you like to drink?&#34;. Ignoring the bad service, I picked up the menu, which was a folded, laminated single page menu. The menu itself felt dirty and grimy when in hand. There are only a few dishes on the menu in several meat variations. Combined with the atmosphere and the service, nothing looked appetizing. We got up and left within 3 minutes of sitting down. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Drive a little bit down the street and experience great food, service and atmosphere at Hacienda Camino Real."

It is Somali instead of Ethopian. When I walked into the place, it seemed kind of odd as the decorations on the wall were all Chinese. Anyway, a sign said seat yourself so I sat down and there was a colorful menu on every table. The funny thing was the menu had pictures but no price list. 

A waiter came by to take my order, he was quite friendly. I ordered the fish of the day lunch and a chai. A couple minutes later a small bowl of lentil soup and a banana were brought to my table. I was not quite sure what to make of the banana. The fish of the day was fried tilapia with a red sauce on top, a side salad and plate of basmati rice.  

The food was okay. The lentil soup was a little watery. The fish was slightly overcooked and therefore a little dry and the sauce also made it a a bit less crispy. The rice was good and tasted kind of similar to Indian spices. Anyway, all that including the chai was exactly $12, quite a good deal.

This restaurant must be authentic because all the customers except me were African although I cannot say if they were from Somali."

We decided to eat here because one of my friends was really craving goat (very random). For whatever reason, this place came up early in our search. Before I even got out of my car to go into the restaurant, I witnessed a few young people standing outside of the restaurant around a black town car. As I was parking, one of the boys/men got into the car and sped off. I&#39;m normally a pretty fast driver, but even for me this seemed dangerous. Not a minute later, that same car sped right back into the spot it was parked (blocking other cars and not a real parking spot) in front of the restaurant. 

I made my way in where I met up with some friends. The table they originally sat us at was a booth right in front of the register. One booth seat had a giant hole in it where the seat cover was ripped and there was no padding. I think we looked really uncomfortable because someone came out and offered us a different table in what looked like the main dining area. As we walked through the restaurant, I realized that the patrons that come here seem to be VERY regular and from a single demographic. My friends and I got a lot of stares and I did feel a little uncomfortable. Once we sat down, I looked over the menu and ended up ordering the chicken shwarma with a side of rice. One of my friends ordered the goat with a side of spaghetti (kinda random? I&#39;d say so). The person who took our order was VERY nice, but he really pushed that spaghetti on my friend. When he brought out our food, my friend&#39;s &#34;side&#34; of spaghetti was the biggest plate of spaghetti I&#39;ve ever seen. We were pretty convinced that they made too much for the day and needed to get rid of it. 

The goat dish was pretty good, and surprisingly the spaghetti wasn&#39;t bad. While it wasn&#39;t exactly like the spaghetti with tomato sauce that I&#39;m used to at Italian restaurants, it was a close cousin. My side of rice was also very good. It was seasoned pretty well and had a little bit of sweetness to it that I really enjoyed. The worst part of everything was the chicken shwarma. I&#39;m not sure if Mediterranean shwarma and East African shwarma are supposed to be the same thing, but what I experienced was not the same. The chicken was in super thin strips, which dried it out. The seasoning was also a little off; more tangy that what I usually enjoy. And most of my plate was bell peppers and onions. A couple friends ordered sandwiches and they got a lot more bread than they bargained for.

If you do come here, I would recommend the goat and definitely get the chai tea. The chai is super authentic and really good. The only reason I&#39;d probably come back is for some chai tea TO GO."

I walked in and immediately was reminded of the little restaurants that I would sometimes come across in parts of Kenya and Tanzania during my travels a few years ago (never been to Ethiopia or Somalia, though I think that is what this restaurant&#39;s ethnic focus is on).  So that means, every single customer was a man; some spoke English, others not.  My guess would be that every single customer was either from Ethiopia or Somalia, which made me even more confident with the whole experience and the food I was about to order.  You can tell the crowd was a little thrown off with a white women in business causal clothing being there, but nobody stared or made me feel uncomfortable.  The owner/cashier there helped guide me in an order that would satisfy my lunch craving....ended up getting a fried fish sandwich that was wrapped in a deliciously thick Chapatti, served with a green salsa.  Also came with a small bowl of soup and a bottle of water, all for $8.  I was very satisfied."

You can get mild, hot or half and half. Mild is perfect for me - I heard the hot is pretty killer! 

Veggie breakfast burrito had egg potato and sauce. So good.

Oh, and did I mention that additional chips and salsa was priced at nearly $3 a basket?
We both ordered the daily special (green chile smothered chimichanga with beans and rice), which was not very enjoyable. The beans were very dry, the green chile was bland (but it was very spicy, which was a plus!), the chicken in the chimichanga had good flavor, but was very dry, and the cheese that topped the beans and chimichanga tasted like (and looked like) Kraft American cheese.
The worse parts of our experience were that the waitress was not attentive at all (there were 3 other tables), we heard their microwave (Chef Mic) beeping and heating up food throughout most of our meal, and upon walking up to the counter to pay for the meal, we discovered that a lot of the food was already prepared and shooting under lights (EW!!!!).

I&#39;m the old big Japanese guy, sweating balls from eating hot chile and smiling &#39;til my eyes disappear &#39;cause yeah, that&#39;s how I roll."

But it&#39;s flavorful and delicious. If you&#39;re not sure if you can take the heat, ask for a sample or order the chile cheese fries.

The rest of their fair is pretty standard New Mexican food, and I enjoyed it.  The portions are quite large, so consider sharing."

I&#39;m very picky about Mexican food, since I grew up with it.  They are really sweet people.  However, I do think since it is family owned they don&#39;t really have great customer service.  It seems to be the norm with family-owned restaurants.   I wish they didn&#39;t have all the pictures up, and the &#34;homie&#34; toys.  This is an instance where less is more.   The food, I can&#39;t complain.    This is where I get my hot green chili and beans fix.  This is not a healthy choice people.  If you know real Mexican food, everything is fried in lard.  My mom still cooks this way.   Not healthy, but really good!!  To me, their &#34;hot&#34; isn&#39;t like Chubby&#39;s where it is so hot you can&#39;t enjoy the food.   I will continue to eat here .

Still spicy as hell (yes!) but still just OK in flavor.  Service is meh... appears to be a family run business.  A high school girl was waiting tables and otherwise gossiping in the back with whomever is back there (loud and clear I might add... lol).  It appeared that we were lucky to get our waters re-filled.

At any rate, Senior Miguel&#39;s is nothing special.  But, it&#39;s cheap, spicy and it&#39;s just down the street so I&#39;m sure there will be more repeat visits in the future.  It&#39;s just one of those neighborhood places that is nice to have around but you&#39;d never go out of your way to eat here if you didn&#39;t live in the area.

We chose a gyro plate, gyro sandwich and vegetarian combination. 

The food was flavorful, well seasoned and fresh. Plus, it was made in the time he quoted us. Is it just me or is that becoming a thing of the past?

This place is definitely a gem, hidden away in a dilapidated strip mall that you normally wouldn&#39;t give two looks at. I had driven by this place a thousand times and never knew it was here! Absolutely fantastic lamb and beef gyros here, and at a stellar price. The pitas were soft, warm, fresh and delicious. The tzatziki sauce was rich and smooth and the fries were pretty good. Be sure to sprinkle on a bit of Greek seasoning, it makes it extra tasty. The place was completely empty on the middle of Saturday afternoon, but the waiter was friendly and very attentive.

Might want to avoid the Baklava unless you like really strong flavors. The rose flavor they add to it, while appealing was so strong that I can still taste it on my tongue hours later. Perhaps a softer honey flavor would be better.

I&#39;m glad to know about this place. It is a great, cheap place to grab a Gyro that is made just about perfectly! Definitely will be coming back!"

The owner is helpful and super friendly.  He obviously has some very regular customers, and I can see why.  Plus, entrees are under $12 for a very generous portion of food, so it&#39;s economical as well as delicious.

The place is small and uncomfortable. The decor has nothing to do with the cuisine, and the background music is a bit random. 

Now let&#39;s go to the food quality, service, and price!
They call their place &#34;tzatzikis&#34; which is the name of the Greek spread that normally accompanies a gyro wrap. They use the cheapest ingredients to make tzatziki, so it obviously tastes bad.
 I got the meat platter and a glass of iced tea and was charged $18.65!!!
The platter included 3 pieces of processed gyro, 3 pieces of really bad cooked beef, 2 pieces of chicken (that was actually good), some salad, and half of the plate was covered with hummus. Now the hummus was spread as a thin layer on the plate. 

Let&#39;s be honest and start rating restaurants properly. This place does not deserve more than 2 stars."

The tabbouleh was amazing, just what it should be but rarely is: a burst of fresh flavor, the parsley and the tangy dressing balancing perfectly. Hummus and baba ganoush were nice, the rice and stuffed grape leaves good as well. The falafel were the only disappointment: while freshly made and fried with a great crunchy exterior, the inside had no texture beyond being like mashed potatoes, and worse, little flavor of the beans or of spicing.

My son and I really like the flavors of food from the eastern Med - we frequently go to Shawarma&#39;s further south on University (great place, by the way), to Falafel King when in Boulder visiting my older son, and to Garbanzo&#39;s when we&#39;re driving past and hungry. My wife, however, is generally not fond of this kind of food - she&#39;s nice enough to join us at Falafel King, but other than that would rather give this kind of food a miss.

Tzatziki&#39;s is a little hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall - nothing special in decor on the inside or out. We sat down as a thunderstorm moved in, ordered our beverages, and waited for our meal to arrive.

I ordered the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) for starters. These delectable little gems are served cold in some places and hot in others - the ones here are almost too hot to pick up when the plate arrives, and served with yogurt-cucumber sauce for dipping. I didn&#39;t ask, but my guess is they&#39;re made fresh in-house, as the flavors are a bit different and more prominent than you find at other local places.

Our main course arrived, and I was quite impressed. I had the falafel plate, which came with 5 very large and properly cooked falafels. I don&#39;t like dried out falafels, and these were moist, and chewy, and had a bit more pronounced spices in them than is customary. The meal came with a  garlic hummus that was creamy and delicious, rice, a tabbouli salad, and the required and ubiquitous pita bread. 

My wife had the Kallayah, cubed braised beef with parsley, onions and green pepper, served with rice, Fatouche salad, and the same scrumptious garlic hummus, She loved it, and said we can come back here again - a big accomplishment for someone who generally dislikes this kind of food.

The piece de resistance was my son&#39;s meal, however - beautifully braised lamb shank served piping hot on a bed of rice, with a full plate of green salad on the side. It looked and smelled absolutely wonderful, and he said it tasted better than it looked.

I&#39;ve given Tzatziki&#39;s five stars because it is as good as it gets for Mediterranean food in Denver. I really enjoyed it and will be coming back often."

It&#39;s a little place tucked into a strip mall, but don&#39;t let that stop you from trying the food.  I ordered the meat combo plate so I could sample a few things, and it was good.  It was a lot of food and I couldn&#39;t finish it, so that&#39;s always good.  The platter included gyro meat along with beef, kefta, and chicken kabobs.  It also had some hummus, rice and fatouche.  It comes with a little serving of their name sake, the Tzatziki sauce.  I ordered one falafel as an afterthough, as well, and I&#39;m so very glad I did.  The combo platter was good, but the falafel was the best part of the meal.  The only downer about the meal was the pita-it was just the run of the mill store bought stuff that added nothing.

Their new $7.50 lunch special is a pretty good deal: choose between lamb/chicken gyro/shawarma or falafel + hummus or baba g with pita + tabbouleh or fattoush + rice or fries + tahini sauce or tzatziki. The falafel is better value for money (four good-sized pieces versus a somewhat skimpy serving of gyro) but everything is fresh, and tastes great.

Service is always really friendly and your food is brought out quickly. It&#39;s a shame this place never seems to be terribly busy - I&#39;d hate to see them go out of business."

Then we saw the lunch special. $7.50 and you get a choice of a meat, side, salad, starch, sauce (chicken shwarma, hummus, rice, light salad, tzatziki). The value of the meal allowed me to overlook the fact I was sitting on tape holding the booth seat together. We had baklava, which is not my fave, but flaky and different (he uses a little rose and that is not my ideal food additive).

For dessert we had coconut cookies and baklava. The baklava was unlike any other I&#39;ve had before. We were told it was vegan and made with rosewater. It was very sweet, and almost burst with flavor and juices when you bit into it. It was a lot softer than any other kind of baklava I&#39;ve ever had, but still very good.

We told Cal we were surprised there was no tzatziki sauce on the menu or our plates given the name, and he said we should have asked- he assumed we were vegan since we had the veggie options.

We contemplated Damascus Grill, but ended up here instead. The interior isn&#39;t much to look at as it doesn&#39;t appear to have had anything done to it since the early 90&#39;s - complete with holes in the seats covered with tape....classy; but it totally adds to the atmosphere.

With that being said, the food and service were excellent! The wait staff was polite and very accommodating.  The menu doesn&#39;t look like much and there aren&#39;t tons of options -- just traditional Mediterranean. I had the Beef Shawarma and the Mrs. had the Gyro plate. Our daughter, not to thrilled about the experience was opting for the Chicken Fingers (thumbs up to Tzatziki&#39;s for having fare that was geared toward kids). We encouraged her to try the Gyro, but having never had it she wasn&#39;t going for it. That all changed though when our waiter brought out a sample of Gyro meat for her to try and then she was sold. I love the fact that they brought a sample so she could make a choice!

Portions -- they are MASSIVE! I had enough beef on my plate for two people easily. The beef was tender and flavorful with not an ounce of fat to be seen. I tried some of the Gyro and it was also excellent. Try the Falafel - they are awesome!

I&#39;m still very partial to Saj, but this is definitely one to add to the list of Mediterranean places to visit."

The hummus at this place was by and far the best hummus I&#39;ve ever had. Creamy, not too heavy, but plenty flavorful. I had a falafel plate, and while the falafel didn&#39;t have too much flavor inside, the texture of both the inside and outside made up for it -- not to mention, the portions were generous. The tabbouleh was fantastic, nice and tangy  and bright and colorful.

By and large, the fresh, warm, buttery, crumbly coconut cookie was the greatest thing about this meal. I would go back there again and again for the cookie and the hummus alone.

Tzatziki&#39;s is small - like eight tables small, and located in a strip mall in Greenwood Village.  It definitely qualifies as a dive.  The staff are obviously first or second generation greeks or israelis and that makes for fantastic food.

I got a gyro with fatouche (which is a salad with lettuce, tomato, parsley and cucumber), hummus and spanish rice.  My wife got the sandwich version of the same.  The sandwich version comes with fries.

Let&#39;s start with the Gyro.  The Gyro was among the best gyros I have ever eaten.  The fatouche dressing was light, the the hummus had a drizzle of olive oil and a shake of paprika - very lightly flavored.  

The let downs were the rice and fries.  Seriously - give them a skip.  You will be disappointed.  Bagged crinkle cut fries just don&#39;t do it for me.  The pita that came with the hummus was cold - just ask them to heat it up.

I decided to try their Baklava for dessert.  The Baklava was less sweet than is normal in the US, but certainly more traditional.  it was most excellent.

In the end, this wasn&#39;t a place I&#39;d seek out - it&#39;s a bit out of the way for me, but the service and food was top notch, and I will definitely be returning if I am in the area."

My husband had a chicken gyro and I had chicken kabobs. I think they were made with the same chicken, but I&#39;m not sure. 

Anyways, everything was tasty and the pitas were soft. I really wanted to try the baklava but I didn&#39;t have room in my stomach. The hummus was nice and smooth. I tried the rice and had some fries; the fries are nothing out of the ordinary. The rice has a slightly sweet hint to it, which I wasn&#39;t expecting. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I&#39;m not one for sweet flavor in my meals (unless it&#39;s dessert or breakfast). 

After it all, I must say that I do prefer the kabobs at the place closer to home as well as their fries more which is why I haven&#39;t given Tzatziki&#39;s a 5 star review. If this were my first experience with Greek however, I&#39;m sure they would get 5 from me, the service was good and the food is solid."

Their hummus will ruin you from eating it anywhere else because you can taste their good quality olive oil in it along with better quality garbanzos. Get the lentil soup, it&#39;s vegetarian and full of flavor. I&#39;m also a fan of his tabouli and fattoush also drizzled the same yummy olive oil and made with fresh ingredients made that same day.

I&#39;ve eaten here twice and got a take-out order on one occasion, and I liked everything they served.

I&#39;ve have tried the Chicken Shawarma and Gyro sandwich on pita on loved them both. The French fries that came with the Gyro were very hot (temperature-wise) too - not sitting under a heat lamp. One night they had a lamb shank special which cost a little more, but was worth it. The meat was tender, lightly spicy, and hot.

The atmosphere may be tuning away some potential customers. The tables are comfortable but a bit old looking. Also, you can hear every word coming from the kitchen and one night we overheard an argument going on. It made us all a bit uncomfortable. But the waiters have always been friendly and helpful.

I recommend Tzatziki&#39;s without hesitation if you are out with friends or a casual date. The food is quite good and most meals are in the $9-$12 range for dinner. It&#39;s on the west side of University just south of Orchard. There&#39;s plenty of parking out back too."

Yanni&#39;s needs to take a lesson from Tzatziki&#39;s.  All the food I&#39;ve eaten here has been delicious and very fresh.  The owner and wait staff are very friendly and attentive.

It&#39;s a small place but so far I&#39;ve always gotten a table.  I doubt that once word gets out about this place a table will be so easy to get.  Don&#39;t be fooled if there aren&#39;t too many other people.  Just sit down and have yourself an excellent meal."

It&#39;s one of the few restaurants within walking distance of my house where I can get vegan food that&#39;s not an iceberg lettuce salad. Their hummus is the best I&#39;ve ever eaten. The prices are really reasonable and the portions are pretty gigantic. The staff is always really friendly and food always comes out very quickly. The owner (at least I think he&#39;s the owner) figured out I was vegan and informed me that their baklava contains no animal products. It&#39;s made with rosewater and it is delicious.

Really attractive place with views of downtown skyscrapers, nice. 

Happy hour is all day Sunday and Tuesday so we had drinks and bites. Nice beer selection, good cocktails too but the best part was great service and a very nice dog loving crowd. 

We had chips/ dip - homemade but a little disappointing, didn&#39;t seem super fresh, definitely not warm. But for $3, ok. 

But the sliders, yum. The Kim Chee BBQ ones deeeelicicious, would go back for that. The meatball slider, good not memorable but again, only $3. Decent. Wings were very good and crispy. 

Food did take a while but still, great friendly staff and service was great overall.

It was always a safe option; consistently good service and food, a nice variety on the menu, gluten free options, nice assortment of cocktails, and a patio perfect for people watching. But Central Bistro has definitely grown on me, and I don&#39;t simply &#34;end up there&#34; anymore, I plan on going and I recommend it to others!

Their customer service is fantastic and that always means the most to me. Not only is everyone so nice, but every time I order something gluten free they ask me if I have a true intolerance and then they take that information to their kitchen. It&#39;s nice to be asked and to be taken seriously. 

Recently I had the cauliflower almond soup which has great flavor, although the gritty texture was a little off-putting to me. The Tuscan salad is also delicious with apples and goat cheese. I added grilled shrimp (an additional $7, yikes), but there were shrimp-a-plenty and they were goooooood. 

Comfy atmosphere, small restaurant and indoor seating area, a nice little bar, and a cozy patio. Sit outside!"

- onion dip is cold and hard. Don&#39;t bother digging that chip into it straight. You&#39;ll need a secondary utensil to spread. And - is that cream cheese I taste? Ugh. 
- oysters: not super cold and I might have had a bad one, but holy stank. 
- oyster mignonette: meh? Probably using regular white vinegar? It had a strong, bitter aftertaste

Other list that made those things seem whatever:
- at least 30 minutes between ordering anything and receiving it, including drinks
- booze drinks sat empty mostly; possible that server avoided us because kitchen &amp; bar was taking too long for everything? Sucks but I waited tables for a long time. I get it. 
- water not refilled with a quickness. No excuse for this one. 

They took the oysters off because it took so long to get them, and then when another food item never came and we just decided to bounce, they took the $3 chips and dip off. So - thanks? But no thanks. 

The server was actually pretty nice and the drinks were delightful (thus 2 stars) but there&#39;s no way to tell what mistakes were back or front of house, and that it doesn&#39;t matter if it impacted a table. The whole operation seems a mess if they can&#39;t time out multiple appetizers and rounds of drinks correctly."

The cocktails were fantastic! We ordered the Bees Knees and the Daisy Pusher...both delicious and beautiful! For dinner, we ordered a variety of small plates to share.

Brussels sprouts:  good, though a bit too sweet for me
Short ribs: perfection!!!!
Mushroom flatbread: great variety of flavors and super crispy crust
Speck and burrata: yummy!

We had a great evening last night and really (really) enjoyed our meals (four of us).  Nicely crafted drinks (I have the black manhattan) and a great selection of wines and local beers.    

Started with small plates including Huitachoche Croquettes (great), Pesto flat bread and the brussel sprouts - which were standout (glazed in a sweet almond toffee glace?  Holy sh*t - amazing).  

Our entrees included the Pork Belly Carbonara (classic carbonara-style heavy, but full smoky flavor with thick pieces of pork belly), Central Boxcar Burger, Roasted Spaghetti Squash w/chicken and Steelhead Trout (freaking great - smokey trout with the sharpness of kimchi added).  We felt we received a great value for our experience - no, it&#39;s not a cheap joint, but you could easily pay way more elsewhere for what we received.

Part of our positive experience was the ambiance and service level - we sat on the porch (nice view of the Denver skyline), it was about 75 degrees all night and we were attended to with no delays.  We received quality, educated recommendations and advice on the menu - which really sets a place apart today.  The food was well executed and felt cutting edge without any of the stuffiness that sometimes comes with a place playing outside its comfort zone - this place is right in the sweet spot.

Thanks for the great experience!"

The food is great, they have a sweet patio with misters for a hot morning, and the service has been great.

Bottomless mimosas are $12, and they leave you a carafe so you aren&#39;t waiting too long for refills and the staff is able to concentrate on helping their tables instead of running around with a pitcher in their hands all the time.

Both times I had the brisket breakfast sandwich.  It&#39;s excellent.  That&#39;s why I keep getting it.  Jess has had the breakfast quesadilla and the chiliquilies.   Was a big fan of hers as well.  I think our favorite part is the portion size.  It&#39;s actually a normal serving size, not unlike what we have at home, so we don&#39;t leave stuffed and sluggish.  Just the right amount instead of overloading plates like a lot of other restaurants do.

We will be putting this on a regular rotation for brunch spots.  I&#39;m also excited to come and try lunch or dinner sometime.

Cheers!!"

What we had: Happy hour burger with bacon and cheese with AMAZING fires, huge portion and included the price of one Happy Hour drink.  Flat bread pizza with pesto &amp; tomato - terrific crust.  Dessert: warm waffle with salted caramel ice cream and Nutella PLUS tres leches  cake - superb. It feels like the restaurant section is a little fancier, great place for a date, business, special occasion, yet still chill enough that we didn&#39;t feel out of place that we let our Happy Hour extend to a lingering meal.  (Service was fantastic, by the way, thoughtful and attentive with a lot of knowledge about the menu.)

Love the modern decor - a lot of thought went into this space. There was such a great vibe in the bar area and I&#39;m excited to go back and have a meal in that part of the restaurant."

OK, it&#39;s really not by the gallon, more like by the one-liter carafe. Which is much prettier and classier than a plastic jug. Begs a customer to keep drinking and not feel guilty, that&#39;s for sure.

What else should one expect at Central Bistro &amp; Bar brunch? Standard American (new) fare, including omelettes, salads, French toast - pretty much what one might expect in Denver. One dish stood out - Chicken Fried Brie &amp; Waffle, with fried chicken as an upgrade. Decadent for sure!

Delightful and impressive happy hour menu from 2-6pm with plentiful drink and food specials. The oysters were flawless, they were willing to cater the shrimp tacos to my needs (gluten free), and my husband is enamored with the oyster po boy.

It must be the attention to detail when it comes to the tastiness of their dishes, the amazing cocktails and the genuinely caring concern of how everything is by the service staff. A few qualities that are hard to find anymore.

We came for lunch and sat at the bar. I started with an aperol spritzer and he had the black manhattan. I had the tomato salad with heirloom tomatoes, avocados, spaghetti squash, onions, capers, corn and I added chicken. I never would have thought about serving spaghetti squash cold in a salad, but this salad was awesome! The best salad I&#39;ve ever had. 

He had the charcuterie flatbread. It was definitely a flatbread, thin and crispy. The sauce was delicious and the meats were very well curated and yummy. 

The bartender was super nice and accommodating. She was mixing up house-made simple syrups and let us sample them. They were to die for. She made me an aperol spritzer since I didn&#39;t see one on the menu, but saw other cocktails with aperol.  The bartender sounded like she could pretty much mix up anything you wanted. 

We will definitley return here for dinner or brunch soon. Pumped a place like this is in the highlands. Quality for sure!"

We got the cheese plate, which only had one cheese on it, and I think only about an ounce. At $10 we thought that was a bit steep. That was really our only complaint.
I got the lamb ragu, which fortunately was a reasonable portion, otherwise I would have eaten myself sick on it. My girlfriends enjoyed their entrees as well.
For dessert we got the tres leches cake and the almond joy something er other. That coconut ice cream in the almond joy dessert was SO good. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. Yet another reasonable portion for my own safety."

Central is yet another restaurant that has 2 out of the 3.  It&#39;s always the last part that Denver restaurants can&#39;t handle - giving good service.  This is another restaurant I wanted to love, but, the bad service ruined it again.  

Sitting at the bar, which was not busy, I waited about 10 minutes before receiving a menu being asked if I wanted to order a drink.  After being served the drink, I guess the bartender realized he served me the wrong drink that was meant for someone else.  Ever so gracious, he yelled out, &#34;Fuck!&#34; and grabbed my drink without a word to me.  I had been drinking it and he pulled it away so fast, he spilled the drink on me, which he did not apologize for doing.  He gave me the drink I was supposed to have, but, he decided I didn&#39;t need a straw or garnish.  He finally let me order food, though.  I really don&#39;t understand the practice of making the customer ask the bartender for help and not having the bartender ask if the customer wants anything.  It&#39;s just plain rude and lazy.  

The food was really good - I had a delicious, simple salad and a pork belly slider.  The bun on the slider wasn&#39;t fresh - pretty sure it was microwaved - but, overall, it was good, which is why I&#39;m giving them 2 stars instead of the 1 star the bartender deserves.  

I did have a lovely conversation with another patron and I liked the menu at Central.  It&#39;s the same old story in Denver--great food, great ambience, but, terrible, arrogant and unprofessional service.  

Is there any restaurant in this town with behavioral standards for their employees?"

This place is a happy little surprise tucked away on Central on the edge of the Highlands. We were again thumbing through the Denver Dining Passbook to find places that accepted the book for brunch, and decided Central Bistro sounded like just the ticket.

Made a quick reservation on Open Table, arrived on time and were greeted/seated right away. The servers were really friendly and I really liked the vibe in there. Since we had the first seating, the restaurant was admittedly pretty quiet, but I could see this being a fun HH place!

I settled on the open faced omelette which was like a frittata...yum!..., and hubby had the smoked brisket sandwich. Both were really yummy, and we of course indulged with a little bit of coffee cake (du jour was a dulce de leche cheesecake coffee cake) which was amazeballs. I could&#39;ve eaten 3 more slices of that by myself.

Oh, and I thought they had great coffee! It&#39;s always such a disappointment when the coffee is a let down. But not at Central!"

Our waitress was amazing so funny and sweet. The food is pretty good, not amazing but not bad either.

This was on a Sunday night around 6PM.

Colt &amp; Gray - denied (even though they were visibly dead at dinner time)
Ale House At Amato&#39;s - denied
Central Bistro &amp; Bar - approved!

I moved to Denver from San Diego two years ago, and I continuously hear how &#39;dog friendly&#39; Denver is. San Diego is dog friendly, Denver... not so much. I&#39;d say in San Diego 9 out 10 places allow dogs &#39;on the patio&#39;, and in Denver its 1 out 10. Foolish business decision in my opinion. The silver lining is we end up finding places like Central Bistro &amp; Bar.

The service was on point, super attentive and very friendly. The happy hour on Sunday evening ended up being 2pm to close, with oysters for $1.50; surprising and awesome. The oysters were good and prepared well. The fish tacos were tasty, not amazing, but went nicely with a dozen oysters and some wine. The Sauvignon Blanc was actually pretty good for happy hour wine, and nice poors. The people sitting next to us said the cab was also good, for a happy hour cab. My fiancee had the &#39;burger and a bevie&#39;, which ended up being a burger, fries, and a happy hour drink for $14. She like her burger, and I liked her free drink.

We&#39;ll definitely be back to this really awesome happy hour spot, and I have to try the pork belly and oyster po boy sliders. Brunch also looks like it might be a home run.

Good job on the enlightened approach to allowing well behaved dogs on the patio, more businesses in Denver need to get it together in this regard..."

After being turned away at the door at the over-rated speakeasy up the block (90 minute wait at 5:45PM?) we showed up early for our dinner reservations.  Several yummy cocktails in the bar later, we went to our table for the prix fixe dinner.

Our server was attentive and funny.  Her attitude and banter really enhanced our enjoyment of what was a great set of courses.

I had the Lamb PHO course - I am a PHO connoisseur, and I&#39;ve never had pho this good outside of a dive on Havana or Federal. Amazing that a &#34;regular&#34; restaurant could get this right.

The scallop and clam main course was excellent.

In the middle of the dinner the bartender came back with a free drink, apparently someone had ordered a gimlet, and the bartender thought it was mine (very tart), and it was not supposed to be very tart. So, even on a very busy evening they thought of me and brought me a free drink.

We did not feel rushed, even on a busy New Year&#39;s Eve.  I&#39;ll be back."

We sat on the patio, which was pretty nice and had lunch and drinks. 

The service was solid, we got our drinks and water as expected, placed our order, and then (insert music here) we got our food! Although the food took longer than expected when it did arrive, it was VERY good. I had the Greek salad and I added grilled chicken to it. The salad was fresh, light, and full of flavor. As well, I had the opportunity to taste the shrimp po-boy (gasp) that thing was AWESOME. It had just the right amount of spice, fresh greens and tomatoes. I was definitely impressed. 

During the meal the manager (I am assuming that is who he was) came by and asked how everything was, we mentioned the food was a little slow getting out, but the food was excellent. First off, he apologized and then he brought out a taco appetizer platter for us to try, which I heard was excellent as well. 

Although I don&#39;t live close to Central Bistro, I would definitely give it as a solid recommendation for anyone to go to, as well, if I was in the area, I would more than happy and willing to try other items on the menu. 

YUM!"

This is why it&#39;s taken me so long to make it in to Central Bistro &amp; Bar.  That and the first I heard of it was through a misplaced and wildly hilarious Yelp review intended to rail Le Central (which I&#39;m pretty sure is no longer in business, but I digress).

Central screams Denver without being overbearing.  Warm (or should I say HOT as the bright red re-purposed hotel sign letters displayed over the kitchen say)  customized decor, spacious bar and dining room, and a patio with a view of downtown, the location is fantastic.  Parking can be problematic, but that&#39;s the Highlands.  

My husband and I both started with coffee and spicy bloody marys.  I thought the drinks were plenty spicy, and although my husband could have used more heat we both thought theywere delicious nonetheless. The coffee is good and they leave a bottle of water on the table (love that).

The entrees, a breakfast burrito and chilaquiles, were both moderate in size but very flavorful and satisfying. I really cannot think of anything to complain about, or anything constructive to say to the restaurant, I just didn&#39;t get a wow factor.  Maybe if I come back during patio season I&#39;ll feel differently.  Until then, Central is a solid option if you&#39;re in the area, especially if you&#39;re in the mood for a spicy cocktail."

We ordered a few small plates to start:

The bacon Brussel sprouts were so crispy and yummy. (BTW I didn&#39;t even like Brussel sprouts before I has these!)

The pepperoncini poppers didn&#39;t have the heat I was hoping for but were crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.

The ceviche was good but must have been on the extra small list. The plate was huge and the seafood was in a tiny hole in the center.

For the entrees:

The boys got the kobe strip plate and they loved it. The portion wasn&#39;t overall huge but was filling enough for them.

The other girls in our group were happy with their salads. One added grilled shrimp and they were a large shrimp and cooked perfectly. 

I had the pork belly pasta. This wasn&#39;t exactly my favorite. The pasta was dry and didn&#39;t really have a sauce.  The few pieces of pork belly in the dish were also on the dryer side. I am used to pork belly being very moist, to the point it melts in my mouth. I had high hopes for this dish but they fell flat. (When I am eating that many carbs, I better enjoy them!)

Overall I enjoyed the drinks, ambiance and the service! I just wished my food was better prepared !"

First &amp; foremost - our server was awesome. She gave us some wonderful recommendations and knew the menu inside and out. I also loved that she didn&#39;t try to upsell us on a bunch of stuff - definitely one of my biggest pet peeves.

The location is unique - it faces east away from the mountains and overlooks downtown. There weren&#39;t any seats available on the patio so we sat inside but the view was pretty cool from the outside. I could see how it would be awesome to sit outside and relax while overlooking the skyline.

Now for the food - the best part of the experience. We started with the brussel sprouts &amp; johnny cakes. Do yourself a favor if you like meat and/or cornbread and order the johnny cakes - they are divine and if I could have had multiple for dinner I would have. These are definitely a house speciality and absolutely fabulous. I ended up having the tomato salad with grilled chicken for dinner and it was delish. The tomatoes were fresh and crisp (not mushy at all - another pet peeve). The blend of flavors was absolutely fabulous - i loved the sweet corn with the tart of the tomato. The hubs had the carbonara and it was fabulous as well.

This is definitely a great place to go if you&#39;re looking for an intimate locale. It is extremely cozy and perfect for date night or that special occasion."

Little kink as their draft system was down, so we opted for ordering bottles. Issue was that it seemed as though everything we wanted was out and instead of quickly saying the selection is very limited the waitress made us play a bit of a guessing game only to quickly hear &#34;out of that too.&#34; 

Food was delicious- speck &amp; burrata, grilled calamari, ceviche, pesto flat bread, and the cheese plate were all ordered. I loved the ceviche, great kick and plenty of fresh seafood. The calamari was a bit small, but it has to be a labor intensive dish to make, and all the cheeses especially the burrata were delicious. 

Ryan the GM stopped by at the start of the night and was welcoming and kind. Our waitress may have had an off night, drinks were hard to come by, and she never stopped to check if we liked the food, but she must have recognized her performance and took care of us at the end of the night. 

Will for sure be back. Great food and staff to accompany an even better ambiance and atmosphere."

I am so happy I found Central Bistro instead. It wasn&#39;t overly busy, they have endless mimosas, and their food is delicious!

I&#39;m drooling just remembering every bite of the smoked brisket sandwich and the braised skirt steak tostada we had last weekend. Both the smoked brisket and the braised steak were seasoned just right. I love a good brisket and am somewhat disappointed when all I can taste is BBQ sauce. However, the brisket at Central was probably hands down one of my favorite as it was cooked to perfection and the flavor was just right. The fries were also great. 

The waitress told us that the braised skirt steak tostada was a hit during Mother&#39;s day brunch. I&#39;m super glad that she recommended not only the dish, but to add the avocados. 
This crispy tostada with the tangy charred green tomato salsa, crema, soft braised steak, avocado, and sunny egg needs to stay on their brunch menu because I definitely will be coming back for this as well as the brisket sandwhich. Both dishes had a great balance of flavors and textures."

The place was PACKED! I would recommend making reservations, luckily they take Opentable reservations too so it makes it easier. The reason why I can&#39;t give it five stars is because the place was seriously so loud. I couldn&#39;t hear the people I was sitting across from the whole time. They do have an outside area too which would be better to sit at in the summer. I couldn&#39;t figure out why it was so loud until I realized they had unlimited mimosas for $12. Now anyone who knows me will tell you unlimited mimosas is the only way to my heart so I shed a tear of happiness. If I had got that I would probably be that drunk girl contributing to the noise. For the food I got the eggs Benedict which was AMAZING! Tip: you can add avocado on it which is heaven.

We braved the snowstorm to come and enjoy dinner since I had a Groupon I needed to use. We were greeted and seated right away in a very comfortable and inviting dining area. Seats were comfortable and I liked the natural wooden tables. At first I thought we would be the only one&#39;s there, but in about an hour a good number of folks also braved the snow to come and enjoy dinner. The bar area was very vibrant and Tuesday&#39;s is All Day Happy Hour with great drink specials.

Our server, Dave Mountain (love his last name) was Great! He was very professional, very knowledgeable and gave us really good recommendations. He recommended we start off with the Berkshire Pork Ribs (Dry Rubbed &amp; Smoked, Central Bbq Sauce, Green Onion) and Caramelized Brussel Sprouts (Housemade Bacon, Pickled Shallots, Toffee, Whole-Grain Mustard Vinaigrette) to share. OMG, OMG, OMG!! We were in Heaven and the song, At Last, came on just when we were biting into the very tender, come right off the bone ribs-the song was so appropriate because I fell in love with the ribs! The Brussel sprouts were amazingly flavorful and so yummy-I wanted more of both! 

For the main entree, I ordered the Orange Glazed Scallops that came with a crispy rice cake, ginger-mushroom broth, garlic chips, oyster mushrooms and scallions. I paired it with the Stags&#39; Leap Chardonnay and it was perfect! My daughter ordered the Braised Lamb Shank with apple parsnip puree, butter poached turnips &amp; carrots, tarragon, fennel and lamb jus. Calina paired it with the Saintsbury Pinot Noir. Of course we had to try each others entrees and they were both very tasty.

For dessert, we split the chocolate espresso cake that came with Mascarpone ice cream, cherry syrup, caramel crunch and coffee beans (all the flavors meshed very well with each other). We had regular drip coffee which didn&#39;t seem at all regular-it was strong and flavorful-not at all bitter. Dave made sure he made a fresh pot-that was so nice. They get the coffee from the Metropolis two doors down (Herkimer coffee from Seattle).

Seth, the Manager, came by our table a few times to check on us and he is so nice and personable. It was great to be able to let him know about our great experience.

Central Bistro is conveniently located across from I-25 (Exit 212C). It has to be great to eat at the patio during warm weather. The music they piped in were great oldies that complimented the meal. Plenty of street parking.

While I tend not to judge a restaurant based on RW I&#39;m going to this time. This is a place and a chef that loves and embraces RW.  The menu was stellar and it looked like a lot of love and thought went into the choices.  It highlights the skills and the ingenious mind of Chef Matt Selby.

When I first saw them menu I knew I must go.  Crispy Skin Chicken, who can pass that up.  I was sold, no need to look further.  

First Course - Heirloom Tomato Salad, with fresh mozzarella, basil and grilled corn vinaigrette.  It was the perfect start to summer meal.  All of the flavors stood alone and worked well together at the same time.  One of the other diners ordered the shrimp salad - it was delightful and not like any other shrimp salad I&#39;ve ever had.  Delicious!

Second Course - Crispy Skin Chicken, accompanied by Olive Panzanella, summer squash salad and roasted artichoke puree.  At first I thought the chicken was a little under-seasoned until I took a bite of chicken with a bite of olive panzanella.  The saltiness and bite of the olives gave the chicken an unbelievable flavor.  Not something that I would have thought about putting together but it worked and made my taste-buds sing.  The summer squash salad was raw and lightly dressed.  Nice addition to the plate.

Third Course - Colorado Peach with in-house made vanilla ice cream and brown sugar crumble.  The peaches were simple - fresh and cut and placed on the plate.  The ice cream was wonderful.  This course came with a complimentary glass of Mia Dolcea Moscato d&#39;Asti - tasting it alone it seemed to have a peach note to it.  Then taking a bite of the fresh peach and then a sip of the Moscato - it was like fairies dancing at midnight in a moonlit forest kind of feeling.  

Our server, Eric, did an excellent job, along with the rest of the crew and staff at Central.  We were made to feel welcome and not at all rushed.  I plan to be back again, again and again."

So we were already parked across from this place and decided to try it.

We didn&#39;t get any grub, but the live music and chatty staff kept us entertained. Tasty drinks (I just had some bourbon on the rocks from their great bourbon/whiskey list) and good company was about all I needed for this to be a great experience.

The resto actually closed, and we slowly noticed as more and more servers were bellying up to the bar to get a post-shift drink, but they didn&#39;t once try to usher us out the door or hurry us along as we hung out roughly 45 minutes after their dinner service technically stopped. That alone was awesome, and we appreciated it. 

I didn&#39;t get a peek at the food menu, but the great bar experience was enough to get me back for what are probably pretty tasty vittles. See you again soon, Central!"

Try the burger.

The burger is thick, juicy, swimming in semi-melted blue cheese, and topped with caramelized onions and bacon, and served on a house made roll.  Even writing about that burger makes me drool.

Up until near the very end, we were enjoying ourselves as we tried the root vegetable croquettes and chicken sweetbreads. They also split the duck breast plate we were going to share (thanks for the gesture). I enjoyed my duck breast, my dining companion did not. Why? Because her duck breast was pinker and chewier while mine was effortlessly savored. This seemed unusual for a split plate.

Soon after finishing the hostess swung by and we asked for a dessert menu. We received nothing and had to wait minutes more for our waitress to return. Up until that time, service had been well-timed and attentive. Starting there, it seemed that we were waiting long to receive the dessert menu and the eventual check. 

Uneven."

On a particularly lovely 5280 Week evening, I dined with some wonderful company only to be matched with wonderful service and food. We were seated at one of their high tables by the bar and perfect access to bar and view of the restaurant. If you are a martini sipper, I highly suggest! They strong but controlled and served in not-so-typical martini glass. 

The first positive sign was how packed the adorable, Highlands restaurant was. Despite the busy night, the service was still attentive and polite. Of the 5280 options, I went with the cream of asparagus soup, the paperdelle, and the apple crumble. It was one delicious dish after another. The mouth-watering cream of asparagus set the perfect for the meal. I only wish the portion was larger.

Next up, the paperdelle was rich, savory, and just the right amount of food. At first glance, the dish seemed small, but the pasta strips fill your stomach fast. This dish is dense and oh so buttery. I couldn&#39;t imagine a better dish to follow than the apple crumble. Flaky, candied granola crisps adorning some baked apples: insanely good and also not big enough for my ravenous appetite. I will be back to satisfy my caveman hunger soon."

I had a LivingSocial voucher so we decided to try dinner. We selected a variety of small plates and we were not disappointed. From the ABC (albacore tuna, bacon &amp; cucumber) to the cheese plate, it was all very tasty! As an added bonus, the MOD (not 100% certain he was the MOD) offered us a taste of a wonderful California white to pair with the cheese plate.

The space is very modern. Our table by the bar was a tad uncomfortable, but I was just happy to be there during restaurant week and with good company. Despite that, it was easy to converse and even though it was busy, we were able to talk easily. I liked the highlighted bottles of spirits around the top of the bar area - very cool and artistic touch to showcase their adult beverages.

Service was very warm and attentive, and did a great job dealing with my indecisiveness on pretty much everything that night.

The food was all excellent. I started with olive oil toasted ciabatta with house goat cheese, spring onion, and pickled pepper relish. The goat cheese was strong and delicious, while the pepper relish added some very deeply flavored spice - both paired excellent together. That said, I wish I had the asparagus soup - it looked so creamy delicious.

For the main dish I had roasted berkshire pork loin with herbed grits, ham &amp; pea ragu, and mustard jus. I couldn&#39;t get enough of all those additions. The grits were perfectly, well, gritty with the perfect herb combo. The pork was cooked to a perfect barely noticeable pink and very flavorful, with the fat along the edges like caramelized sugar candy.

And lastly for dessert, the chocolate pot de creme was certainly tasty, with the crunchy hazelnut tuille being the highlight, but I wish I had the apple crumble - that looked like something my mom would have made.

Overall a great experience that will have me back if I have the chance. I really need to come back and try the duck and/or scallops sometime. A good place to treat someone or go on a date."

I went in yesterday for brunch. The service was flat out poor. It took over 20 minutes to get the mimosas that we ordered. We also put in an order for coffee that took longer than that. When we finally ordered our food, it must have been lost in the mix because it took another hour to be served. The reason I am not giving it 1 star is that the food was pretty good, but over-priced. 

This was an over-priced brunch that took an hour too long. The service was bad and they mixed up the credit card payments which led to even more frustration after a long Sunday brunch."

The gal who called to confirm my res was enthusiastic and polite and our waitress was really personable.  These things are important to me.  Minor detail that I will point out though, is that the girl walking around with the bread basket NEVER came to our table and I was so hungry for that bread!  Anyways...

I let our waitress talk me into the soft-shell crab because it was the more rare Colorado menu offering and when it came out as... a crab I was kind of turned off.  I don&#39;t know why I thought it would be anything different so I&#39;m not docking stars for my own stupidity.  That being said, I kind of wish the squid ink drizzle had been mentioned in the dish description... I ended up trading Accommodating Fiancé for his steak dish and it was mega scrumptious!  That succotash is the best.  I guess I should also give the rest of the crab dish it&#39;s due.  The kale underneath and the chorizo was so yum.  

Though I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ll go back some other time, I&#39;m not sure how often.  It&#39;s on the pricey side for what I consider to be smaller portions.  I think the prices might be more palatable during brunch hours and I&#39;m not sure I can resist that kale Caesar."

I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the dinner location was Central Bistro &amp; Bar.

Central is definitely upscale and very modern. Crisp white furniture, and big neon letters over the kitchen spelling &#34;HOT&#34;.  Ask them the story of how that came to be and I think you&#39;ll crack a smile.

First and foremost I want to mention Lennie, our wonderful server.  Such a wonderful personality that shines through with every conversation or comment.  Found it amazing that we were both from the same area of PA, go figure, now that&#39;s a small world.  She was a highlight of the evening.

Enjoying some great conversation created a long evening since it took us a sold 30-45 minutes to decide on our items from the menu.  We decided on a great bottle of red wine for the evening that was strong in body and taste.  Our appetizer choices were the Goat Cheese and Kale Dumplings and the Seared Scallops with ham hock.  The appetizers were by far the best dishes of the evening.  The Goat Cheese and Kale Dumplings were little purses that exploded with bursts of flavor.  Anything with Goat Cheese is a favorite of mine, I&#39;m willing to admit it.  The Scallops may have been the best seared scallops I&#39;ve ever had.  Two hard seared Scallops with the perfect doneness on the inside, not an easy thing to do.  And who thought ham hock would go with Scallops, I never thought I&#39;d say this but they compliment each other so well.  Talk about creative genius.  

Time for the entrees and we picked the Duck and the Bass.  I enjoyed the Duck a bit more than my companion.  Well cooked, medium rare as duck should be with Confit Duck thigh, and a root Vegetable Hash.  A solid dish but not as exceptional as the appetizers.  The Striped Bass was served with a herb pesto, and a bacon and leek ragu.  The tarragon in the herb pesto was a bit aggressive for both or tastes, good, but tarragon is not one of those herbs that you need to be aggressive with, I would have enjoyed the dish better with a bit less tarragon.

Dessert was a heavenly way to end the evening with the Chocolate PB Bar.  Devil&#39;s Food Cake with a Peanut butter mousse and marshmallow fluff.  Every bite was decadent, moist, and filled with peanut butter goodness.  I never want to be without the classic combination of peanut butter and chocolate, life would never be the same.  

Closing restaurants is becoming a trend for me and this was no exception.  We never felt rushed by anyone and we were allowed to leisurely enjoy the evening.  Lennie even packaged the bottle for me to take home since I enjoyed the picture and the quote on the bottle."

I already want to return to sample more of the food at this stylish, urbane, and exciting restaurant.

All meals must be accompanied by great conversation and good wine, thus as we absentmindedly scanned the dinner menu, we were far more into discussing the vicissitudes of dating and relationships as well as being fully engrossed in a robust red, Four Vines &#34;Monarchy&#34; ($69), a blend of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Tempranillo. This wine has balls - it is full bodied and assertive at first, and then as it opens up, it becomes smooth and elegant with just the right amount of tickle on the palate. Tremendous! We also loved the label, an etched Moliere with the following quote &#34;I prefer an interesting vice to an annoying virtue.&#34;  You got that right. 

What were also spot-on were the goat cheese dumplings ($12).  Four dumplings are stuffed with kale and goat cheese and are drizzled with just the right amount of the classic combination of sage and brown butter, and then topped with crushed walnuts and even more goat cheese. What makes this dish thrilling and unique is the vivid lemon flavor which acts as the perfect foil to this rich starter. Wonderful. 

Next up, sea scallops ($13). These two, big, fat, juicy beauties arrived PERFCTLY cooked with plenty of that wonderful char on the outside and were not at all overdone.  The scallops were served atop a &#39;hash&#39; of cauliflower, ham hock, and celery root with an interesting and not too sweet cranberry puree to the side.  Each bite had distinct textures and flavors which I wanted to savor, yet this combination was so mind-blowing that I shoveled instead. These may have been the best scallops I have ever had. I&#39;m not sharing next time.

This meal was already noteworthy and was on track to becoming one of the best dining experiences that I&#39;ve had in a while.  And then the entrees arrived. We selected the Striped Bass ($24) and the Duck Breast ($23).

The fresh Colorado Bass was flawlessly cooked with perfectly crispy skin and moist flesh. It was served atop a ragout of cannellini beans, leeks, bacon, and a bright herbed pistou. This classic Provençal combination has been reinvented here by using tarragon instead of basil.  You either love or hate that herb, and I&#39;m definitely a hater.  This should be mentioned on the menu because it definitely distracted me from fully appreciating this entrée.  The showering of olive oil atop the fish, which ended up pooling atop the ragout, detracted rather than enhanced; a more judicious approach to finishing the dish is warranted in my opinion.

Sadly, the biggest miss however of the evening was the Indiana duck. A confit of thigh meat was served along with a very generous portion of duck breast.  The duck was prepared rare, but the skin was not seared long enough which left the fatty layer underdone.  The meat was paired with a puree of butternut squash and a fall hash.  The puree was glue-y and the hash uninspired.  The whole was rather lackluster and a muddled mess considering the genius of our starters. Dissapointing.

Of course we had to have dessert, since there was celebrating, so we chose the Peanut Butter Chocolate Bar ($8).  Alongside the bar was served a superb salted toffee ice cream and a homemade marshmallow fluff. The bar was layered like a torte and covered with chocolate; it was sufficiently chocolaty and the peanut butter flavor was subtle.  A nice way to finish.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the service, which was the best I&#39;ve experienced in a long time.  Lennie is incredible.  She paced our meal perfectly, which allowed us to enjoy our conversation, was gracious and not at all stuffy; I felt as if I was a guest in her own home. She has set a new standard. Thank you!

I don&#39;t care how sexy the setting is or accommodating the service is, what matters most to me in a restaurant is the ability of the chefs to deliver; and they mostly do at Central.  The kitchen is headed up by Lance Barto and I look forward to sampling more of his creative food.  All the oomph and exuberance is already present and with a little more focus this may just become my new favorite.  Bravo!

*******Note*******
I found out on 1/3/2013 that Chef Barto is no longer associated with Central.  Since he was the opening chef it would be a disservice if I did not edit this review to reflect that information.

The sashimi (Ahi) was fantastic. The portions could have been slightly bigger but we had a really great meal! We also had the Kobe sliders and they were to die for!! Are waiter was in training and seemed a bit nervous at first but he ended up being very friendly and gave awesome service! I definitely recommend a visit!!

The first two were in the bar area and I like the open air atmosphere and the nice space to hang out or mingle with people. The alcohol selection is ok. I didn&#39;t eat either time.

For brunch, we sat in the dining area where it had a modern, somewhat Scandinavian feel to it. I thought the food selection was good. For the most part, I liked the food that I tried. However, I didn&#39;t walk out of there with a &#39;wow&#39; factor (maybe I&#39;ve been in Vegas too many times!). I will say that my bottomless mimosa was exactly that not to mention they were good. 

I think this is a place you have to be in the mood for. It&#39;s not a place I would normally go out of my way for but, given the right situation, this could absolutely be the perfect spot."

No food (I do not count the chip rack ad food), but you can bring your own, or choose from a variety of restaurants to deliver to the bar (Blackjack Pizza is a couple of doors down).  The place is small but has a couple of pool tables and a few dart boards to boot.  A TV and lottery machines.
If you ride a motorcycle, park under the awning and there are to camera monitors to kerp an eye on your bike (No Colors allowed though).  The drinks are cheap and the bartenders will take good care of you.
There is one downside, the mens bathroom is a little scary...ok really scary,  but if you are a dive bar fan, belly up to the bar and get a beer and a shot."

The last time i went the Gyro was awful to be honest ( very dry gyro meet) and the time before they forgot the salad dressings for a to go order. 

The reason for four stars and not less is due to the great service I have the majority of the time and the fact they gave me a $15 credit for the salad dressing mix up."

I grew up in Aurora and this was our staple in high school and is still one of my staples for breakfast.  I have come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but breakfast is my favorite by them. Luckily for me, they serve breakfast all day.  

I usually get the Kitchen Sink burrito, which is smothered in their green chile that I absolutely cannot get enough of. The burrito is so delicious and has eggs, potatoes, ham, bacon, gyro, and other goodness that I can&#39;t remember right now. And the burrito is HUGE! I usually can only finish half and take the rest home as another meal, which works for me.

Personally, because I&#39;m boring and get overwhelmed by the amount of choices, I choose to stick to a couple of my favorite &#34;usuals&#34;. 

If you&#39;re coming in on a weekend, expect a wait like you would at any other brunch location (30-60mins), but once you&#39;re seated the food comes out pretty quick (sometimes a little toooo quickly- like who did they have working in the kitchen? Santa&#39;s elves?!). The service is also always on point; Sam&#39;s has a working system that is efficient and accommodating at the same time--way to go !

On to the menu...the mimosas are DELISH; I get mine with grapefruit juice to make up for my mundane food ordering. The Greek skillet is seriously amazing, as are the giant cinnamon rolls, the biscuits &amp; gravy, the burritos...and anything else on the menu--you seriously can&#39;t go wrong. Granted, this isn&#39;t a 5-start restaurant so don&#39;t expect a gourmet meal, but for the type of establishment this is, I&#39;m always more than pleased. 

Side note: apparently they have the best green chili around (as seen on &#34;Diners, Drive-ins and dives&#34;)...I&#39;m not a big green chili person so can&#39;t speak to that."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWvctm2Wxl8

Every time I come to Denver, I have to stop by this place. The only issue is the wait time. it is ALWAYS busy! I guess that&#39;s good for their business, because there&#39;s no way my salary alone could keep this place going. 

They have a wide array of different diner food, but they are known for their burritos muy grande! My favorite one is their SMACdown burrito - smothered in green or red chile, filled with mac&amp;cheese, and completed with tater tots. I&#39;ve eaten it three times already and I&#39;m still not tired of it. 

Last time, I did have their Vienna french toast with a strawberry puree. The french toast itself was not too sweet and the puree complimented it perfectly. 

This restaurant was featured on the Food Network several times and is a staple to the Denver area. 

If you&#39;re new to town, just visiting, or living it up in the Colorado mountains, you HAVE to try this place. I guarantee you&#39;ll leave with your belly full and a smile on your face."

He was so kind on the phone that i ended up ordering food togo and pick up anyway. I didn&#39;t know that he was the owner but he was very kind. 

He graciously split my burrito into two orders because it&#39;s so big. He gave us extra green chili and condiments. When I walked in, I was greeted by one of the 5 ladies at the hostess stand. They were all very helpful. I think the pricing was reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food you get. I would love to go back and actually have a sit down meal there. They have TV&#39;s all over so it probably is great for sports. It just is a great little diner."

Little did I know, this place was on the Food Network show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! Seeing this as I walked in automatically raised  my expectations.  

The menu is huge, so be sure of what you want before coming in (breakfast, lunch or dinner). I decided to try the burrito that was featured on Triple D (menu items shown on tv are labeled), it&#39;s called The Kitchen Sink. This burrito is huge! It&#39;s easily 12 to 14-inches long and about 6-inches wide, it&#39;s more of a big taco than rolled like a burrito. The meat and home potatoes are delicious, plus it&#39;s smothered in awesome pork green chili (I even asked for extra on the side and ate it all). I thought it was a little pricey ($13-ish), but it&#39;s not enough to stop me from getting it again. 

I live nearby and see my myself coming back when I need a carby fix! Saw other Yelpers post pictures of the smothered green chili fries, so that&#39;s next to try! And of course, more burritos!

The inside has the feel that&#39;s slightly cooler than the average diner. I was here way too early, so I doubt it&#39;s representative of the day atmosphere."

We walked in about 15 minutes till 9PM and were surprised to learn they were closing soon, even on a Friday night. Honey, we&#39;re not in Vegas anymore! 

2LB POUND VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($8.99): Sam&#39;s is famous for its green chili and breakfast. I went the green chili route (although it was the veggie version, so not the original famed chili). The burrito was huge but fell flat taste wise. The burrito had black AND pinto beans, an odd mix, The green chili had lots of corn in it, which was also an ill fitting mix. I should&#39;ve got the breakfast. 2/5

RED NO. 3 CHILIBURGER ($10.99): Husband devoured it. The fries were delicious and I couldn&#39;t keep my hands off his plate. 4/5

BACON CHEESEBURGER ($10.99): Brother-in-law killed it. Disappeared before my eyes. 4/5

BEST COOKIE EVER ($1.75?): That&#39;s a bold claim to make. I wouldn&#39;t say it was the best ever, but pretty damn good. I hardly shared this sizable cookie at all. 4/5

VIBE: Straight up traditional diner, very casual and quiet. 3/5

SERVICE: The host and server were energetic and nice. When trying to decide between a red chili burger of a green chili burger, the server was nice enough to get my husband samples. 4/5

Worth a Return Visit?
I didn&#39;t really enjoy my burrito, but the two other people I was dining with loved their burgers. I will say I liked my cookie and the fries. If you&#39;re a fan of the show (DDD) and like burgers, give this place a try! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have better luck than me.

But now that I&#39;ve been here once, I&#39;m totally hooked. Here&#39;s the rundown. 

Food = 10/10. Best green chili I&#39;ve ever tasted, enormous portions (honestly they could tone it down a bit because nobody eats that much), and everything is made fresh and tasty. No complaints here. 

Atmosphere = 7/10. It&#39;s not super clean, it&#39;s loud, it&#39;s kind of crowded...and it&#39;s a diner, so what do you expect? That&#39;s why I say the atmosphere could be better, but it doesn&#39;t change my overall assessment. 

Price = 8/10. Not the most affordable, not the most outrageous. Honestly, I pay more at almost all of the local &#34;must-have&#34; breakfast places, and they aren&#39;t half as good. 

Service = 7/10. I&#39;ve never had amazing service at Sam&#39;s. And I&#39;ve never had bad service here. The place is always packed and it&#39;s a diner, so the servers are busy...but they get the job done and are pleasant, even if they don&#39;t have time to chit chat.

1. You get treated like family
2. Waitress actually talk to you and see how you are doing. Based off your answer they might just make a suggestion on what you should get and it won&#39;t be disappointing. 
3. The 15 min wait if there even is one is well worth it. 
4. The screw drivers are very strong but good.
5. The prices are reasonable. 

This is the place to take your whole family to! Yes even the picky eaters will find somethings. They have Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten Free and Healthy options.

Always always always. Especially for brunch. Gah! Perfectly delectable. We were lucky enough to snag a seat a the bar around 1030 on Sunday, which is a magical feat in and of itself. Because their menu is so expansive, I&#39;m always trying to order something different, to give everything at least one try. This time I went with the classic Eggs Benedict with an avocado on the side. YUM! I am SUPER picky about hollandaise sauce (long story) so when I do order this dish, I usually brace myself for disappointment. So far? Best hollandaise I&#39;ve found in this state, and I&#39;ve tried a lot. 

The bartenders here are the best in the biz, I would put money on it. They are friendly, a bit flirty, and work better as a team and smoother than any well-oiled machine I&#39;ve ever seen. These chicks crushed it! Super impressed, and I&#39;m loving the long-pour Screwdrivers. After three hours of brunching, mimosas, screwdrivers, and football, we had to call Uber to get home!

How big are they?

They are so big that I literally saw a man changing out of a pair of soiled pants in the parking lot, as his thoroughly unamused lady friend packed his &#34;used&#34; pants in a plastic bag to throw away. For those of you keeping score at home, the new pants were a dark grey yet shiny pair of sweats.

And after dinner all I have to say is there but by the grace of God go I.  Like a total noob i ordered an appetizer...chili cheese fries with a red chili.  It was absolutely divine, but so very unnecessary.  Why unnecessary?  Because the meatloaf melt I ordered, a sandwich fit for a good-sized man or one and a half regular sized women would have been more than plenty, especially with the mountain of fries that came with it.

I&#39;m glad I did! I ordered number 1 breakfast burrito with their green chili smothered on top. I&#39;m a sucker for good breakfast burritos and this one has to be to one of my favorites. I think it might be a tie between this one and the one I had at petes kitchen! The green chili definitely made this burrito it is bomb!! For 8 bucks and big it is it is well worth the money. Everyone I talked had the same complaint...the wait time for a table. However, I went before 11am on a Monday and had no trouble getting a table. I would wait a hour to eat here again though!

I give it 4 out of 5 stars since there was no personality in our server and it was very monotone.

Today was a little different, I was in the area and wanted to grab some breakfast and thought it would be a good idea to spark the flame back up. 

If you have been to Sam&#39;s before (or if you havent) one thing that they pride themselves on is the quality of their food and their service. Fortunately, today, I received both of them. I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast which came with hash browns and toast and it was pretty damn good. Was it the BEST chicken fried steak I have ever had, no, not by any means. But I tell you what, the portions were plentiful and it hit the spot!!! 

The reason why I am giving four stars is because of the service. Everyone on the wait staff was super attentive and made sure if you needed something, you got it - PRONTO! To me, this is what separates the average restaurants from the stellar restaurants - service.

We waited (it&#39;s Saturday morning, so ok) and then I ordered the high maintenance, potatoes on the side. Not only were there extra potatoes on my plate, and under the vegetables, there was another plate of potatoes brought although my skillet itself was missing ingredients from the menu.  Instead of taking the time to read back the order on my or my companion&#39;s meal, there were cheese curds instead of cheese grits. Mistakes happen, but the server seemed...nonchalant? Irritated. I asked for Heinz 57 which didn&#39;t come. I asked for my eggs to be over medium and he said &#34;Over medium well?&#34; I don&#39;t know what that means. I thought we were on the same page (again, he&#39;s busy so I&#39;m trying not to waste our time). What that means is that the eggs will be rubbery. I ate the rubbery eggs because did I mention we&#39;d waited an hour already and it was busy and they took the rest of my food to remake it so it was eggs or nothing. My re-made plate didn&#39;t look appetizing and the server seemed less than interested in my happiness so I went to pay and when asked the customary question, &#34;How was your meal?&#34; I said I didn&#39;t enjoy it. The cashier said, &#34;Ok, great&#34; ( I think he just heard &#39;enjoy&#39;). I repeated myself and he said he was sorry to hear that and took my money. It is loud in there and it&#39;s busy but one of the great things about Sam&#39;s is that they seemed to be a place that could handle loud and busy. Perhaps it&#39;s time to start taking reservations.
 I&#39;ve been to Sam&#39;s once earlier this year and stayed away for similar reasons until now. Maybe I&#39;ll try again next year."

I think last year around this time I had their pumpkin pancakes and they were bomb! Definitely share though since the portions are so big and I can guarantee you will have food envy and want to try someone else&#39;s food at your table. 

Their Country Fried Chicken/Pork is one of the best I&#39;ve had ever. It&#39;s fried to perfection and definitely worth a try. 

Tip: There is usually a wait, especially in the mornings on the weekend! You can call ahead and ask how long the wait is or to be put on the list if you are already heading there! While you wait, grab a mimosa or bloody mary! I loved their loaded Bloody Mary! The bacon was a great addition, along with the pepper, olive and pickle. :)"

Sams #3!! This was my first time at the Aurora location and it didn&#39;t disappoint. I settled on a cheeseburger with green chili cheese fries. I thought I would be more excited about the fries, until the burger arrived. It was beautiful. It looked almost magical. I took one bite, and I was in love.  It was one of the best burgers I had eaten in a long time. I devoured the whole thing in just a few minutes.  Messy face and all. My family were using napkins and wiping my face.  Normally a person would be embarrassed by this, but the cheeseburger was so good, I didn&#39;t care. It was juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and dripping all of the plate. I think I have found something that I cannot stray from on the menu. I will probably always get the cheeseburger every time I go to Sams. The chili cheese fries were really good too, but I was too full from the burger so even make a dent in the fries. I can&#39;t wait to go back and have another one."

I like that there&#39;s a garlic serrano sauce and a chipotle sauce on the table, they were both delicious (slight edge to the chipotle sauce). 

...I just don&#39;t like the food.  We tried a &#34;cinnamonster&#34; roll, and it was a sad little thing.  Not quite rubbery, but not exactly what a cinnamon roll should be (admittedly, we have been spoiled by the biscuit company.  So anyplace else that thinks it has a good cinnamon roll had best come correct!).  The &#34;supreme&#34; breakfast burrito was filling, but it was also one of the most boring breakfast burritos I have ever eaten... too much potato, too little meat, no seasoning, and smothered in bland green chile (admittedly, we have been spoiled by ALMOST EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT IN DENVER.

Judging by the fullness of the parking lot and that they&#39;ve been featured on the Food Network I was expecting the cuisine would have something to do with the obvious customer loyalty. Then when I saw the rating on Yelp with so many reviews I was sure it had to be good. Not kidding at all, there was a local news station in the parking lot, filming off Havana. Not sure if they were there for Sam&#39;s or not, but I didn&#39;t see anything newsworthy in the area and they seemed excited.

Anyway, having read a few reviews, I was prepared for the extensive menu. Several sections of items to choose from, and there&#39;s even early bird specials. I&#39;d read there was a cinnamon roll, and knew I&#39;d have to try it. Also favorably mentioned is the breakfast burrito, my husband and veteran burrito connoisseur ordered one of them. 

I didn&#39;t have the highest hopes, but I was expecting better. The veggie omelette was overcooked, and looked like strips of swiss were melted on top in the microwave. It also seemed to be completely unseasoned. My husband was not impressed with the burrito either. Sadly, even the cinnamon roll couldn&#39;t save this. It was served with a mini country crock tub.

We were able to nab seats immediately at the bar in front of the kitchen, which was perfect. That being said, the bar stools are the lowest chairs I think I&#39;ve ever sat on and our knees pressed in to the padded backing. Not the best choice if you&#39;re a taller person.

The menu is huge and amazingly still has &#39;new&#39; offerings. We came for breakfast options vs dinner and had tons to choose from. I love their cinnamon buns and so made sure that was on my order. I don&#39;t eat pork and appreciate that they offer turkey sausage and you can sub it when pork is listed. My husband and I both had omelettes and in no way left hungry.

My favorite part about the visit though, was sitting in front of the kitchen. We got to watch all of the action and were amazed and the volume of food that goes out and how quickly. We watched our order pop up on the screen and we were fed within 10 minutes of the order being placed. If seats are available at the bar, definitely ask to sit there are is will provide you with some entertainment."

My husband said the chili dog was the best he&#39;s ever had. I&#39;m not a hot dog connoisseur but my Greek omelette was yummy. 6 people with a bill under $60 and we had doggy bags!

The place was packed and had a fun and lively atmosphere. But the food is just plain diner food and huge servings of it. The food tastes frozen and canned. My burger had a partially stale bun, kind of gross when you really think about it. Now that I&#39;ve eaten there a couple times, I don&#39;t get the appeal and will never wait 40 minutes again. My opinion is just step it up a bit and not just live off the triple D shout out."

I loved the grilled chicken and their ceasar dressing. I like that the menu has healthy options available for those who are trying to be health conscious. My husband however ordered the Greek breakfast burrito. He said he loved it and it was very tasty. The only thing lacking was that there wasn&#39;t very much gyro meat like the dish advertised. We finished off with the homemade blueberry pie and ice cream. It was my favorite part of the meal and most definitely worth getting a salad as an entree. I would go back."

Good thing it was just me, the wait was an hour and a half. I opted to sit at the bar and met the greatest new buddy! (Shout out to Daron!) 

I ordered the Denver Skillet with wheat toast. The portion was huge, but was completely under seasoned. I expected to taste the onions, peppers and ham...nada. Very disappointed. After all the hoopla about this place, I would have been more satisfied with a pop tart. 

The POS system went down for about 20 minutes, so I sat and chatted with my new found buddy, and she told me that the food wasn&#39;t all that great either. It&#39;s sad that people&#39;s taste buds don&#39;t function that well anymore. I can&#39;t just settle for bland...my chefs at my culinary school would flip!

My girlfriend and I sat at the bar because there was a long wait and we were really hungry. We knew the food would be great and quick as per usual so we sat down and waited. 

We had to wait a significant amount of time to even order something to drink. When I asked for a fork she handed me a cup full of silverware and when I tried to find a fork she very shortly told me to take the whole thing so she could go. When we were finally ready to order it was only after the waitresses had spoken with everyone else twice and our menus had been down at least 5 minutes. 

At the end of the meal I asked for two boxes and the waitress barely listened and promptly forgot my request, avoiding eye contact with me and my partner so I could not get her attention. I eventually went over to the server station myself and asked a different server if I could have some. She very nicely helped me. Overall, it was just the two bartenders who were rude. They were inattentive and made us both feel very unwelcome. I live in Denver because it is usually an accepting atmosphere but I should have known not to step outside the city limits into Aurora; the suburbs have never been friendly to anyone different.

It was not super busy, more consistent than a huge crush of people. It was also pretty laid back so it was easy for us to gab for a while without feeling like we were holding up a table. They also bring carafes of water so you don&#39;t end up with empty glasses or constantly looking for someone with a pitcher.

We had the green chili cheese fries as an appetizer for the table. The green chili wasn&#39;t spicy but it had decent flavor. There was a generous amount of chili, cheese and fries (you know how sometimes it seems like only have the fries got any cheese and you run out of the toppings and then just have a sad plate of fries/chips that are a little soggy but mostly bare). Everyone was a big fan. 

I had chili rellenos. They were smothered in green chili. Again not spicy but there were big chunks of pork which sometimes seem to be missing in restaurant chili. The rellenos were decent. The crust was so crispy on one side and the chili so bitty on the inside that I felt like I just had a chunk of over fried crust. They came with rice (eh) and beans (good), plus sides of salsa, guacamole and sour cream. I thought it was nice that the guac came with it as a lot of restaurants will charge extra for a side of quac (and sometimes even the sour cream!). The salsa definitely raised the rice from eh to good, but I generally like a lot of stuff in my mexican rice. Overall, I would think about having it again, but I would probably go with something else. 

I definitely would go to Sam&#39;s again. Especially if I was with another group, they seem to be well equipped for us, even with crazy orders and separate checks."

The only reason I give it four out of five stars is that the wait for a table can be quite long at any point throughout the day. I&#39;ve been at several different times and the only time I haven&#39;t had to wait for at least 15 minutes was right when they opened in the morning. Obviously that means it&#39;s a great place so don&#39;t let it deter you; just be sure to plan for it before you go.

They have one hell of a menu, and it&#39;s a place you have to go to a lot to get the full experience with the menu.  

We had a friendly waitress (nicole s) who catered to our every hang over and breakfast need.  She did up-sell a bit, but I didn&#39;t eel akward from it.  This may bother some patrons though.  

We sat on the outdoor patio, and the morning  sun was beating down on us pretty hard, so I would suggest a shade be installed of some sort. Otherwise, the outdoor patio is a good bet if you&#39;re looking for a quick seat.  Most people wanted to sit inside; I&#39;m assuming that locals want a place that&#39;s a little more comfortable.     

I had a GIANT mimosa, chili cheese tater tots, and a kitchen sink burrito.  The mimosa was great, but the taters didn&#39;t spark my wow reaction like the kitchen sink burrito.  If this is your first time here, then you have to try the burrito and smother them in Sam&#39;s homemade hot sauces.  

This is a great place to bring a kid on a Saturday morning; they have a balloon guy that was even entertaining to the adults.  He had us laughing a bit while he made various creations for the kids like Spiderman.  I thought it was a unique aspect that no other place can or has delivered."

The waiter switched it out with a margarita but charged me the more expensive price of the Bloody Mary. I get it but that&#39;s not the best way to go. The margarita was very good though. 

I ordered a black bean burger and fries and my gf ordered the gyro with a side salad. My burger wasn&#39;t horrible but it was pretty bland. The fries tasted stale.

I ordered the American burger - medium with fries with the green chili topping. The burger was cooked well done. The fries were good the green chili was not. It was bland. I was shocked and disappointed. For the national recognition this place has gotten, I was expecting more.

The hostesses were very friendly and accommodating since we didn&#39;t have much time to get back to the hospital, so we got our food to go.

I had been craving some hot wings for a few days so I got a dozen of their wings. First of all, they&#39;re GIGANTIC. An order of 6 would&#39;ve been good enough to fill me up. But, the bad is that whatever breading they had on the outside was burned and there was hardly any sauce on my wings. All I could taste was burnt breading. I was extremely disappointed. Since they are so big and high quality, I hope they make an option for regular ole deep fried wings with no breading on them.

Ordered a Bloody Mary and it was OK, but the FYIPA is awesome (and their top seller). After that we ordered 8 buffalo wings and these guys don&#39;t mess around. The wings were large, tasteful, and a good price. Lastly, we ordered the breakfast burritos and it was awesome as well."

They have a good selection of beer to choose from and our bartender let us try a bunch of samples before we finally settled on the ones we wanted. The bf and I weren&#39;t too hungry when we came, but split a bowl of their farro soup, which was really good. If I had been hungrier, I would have ordered more stuff of their menu as they all looked pretty appealing. 

The only point of complaint is that they only take cash. For a modern day restaurant/brewery that is fairly big, you guys gotta be able to take card. I know you have an ATM onsite, but those ATM fees discourage someone like me from coming here as I never carry cash. Luckily the bf had some cash on hand and the beers were relatively cheap (compared to California anyway), so we were set."

NOTHING.

With Ben&#39;s uncle, visiting from Wisconsin we decided a lunch out (with craft beer) was a must before seeing the  chocolate exhibit at the museum of nature and science. All three of us fell in love with this gem and here&#39;s why:

FOOD: so good! everything here is super unique and delish. I ordered the steak sandwich, which was filled with fresh grilled steak, arugula, peppers and onions on killer bread. MMM! Ben ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which was fried to perfection, while Pete ordered the Jerusalem plate, featuring all kinds of Mediterranean food. Fresh hummus and pita bread, perfect chicken and more. the plate was heaping and so delicious.

ATMOSPHERE: very unique, full of artwork and cozy. we were seated at a booth and felt right at home. Artwork hangs on the walls, floral paintings on the ceiling and the smell of beer! mmm! both Ben and Pete loved it and could easily return.

SERVICE: beyond friendly and nice. our  server was super patient with us, brought ALL the samples we wanted and suggested some great dishes to try. we sat for over 1.5 hours and didn&#39;t feel rushed one bit. 

PRICES: great for all you get! after 2 rounds of beer samplers, 4 big beers and 3 meals!

The only downside?
Parking is kind of a pain and the restaurant is CASH only. no need to fret though, they have an atm that only charges $1 :)"

It was nice that our waitress also gave us the heads up that the servers kind of all help each other out, so we never felt like we were being ignored. We got a bowl of chili for an appetizer and it came out pretty quick. I got a regular cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the bison burger....and I&#39;m not sure if it was just because we&#39;d been hiking for the past few days and we&#39;re starving, but both burgers made our all-time top 5 lists.

Simply awesome food. Huge buffalo wings! My fav is the buffalo chicken sandwich. This place knows how to cook fires perfectly. They cut them fresh and cook them to the point of being nice and crisp but not overdone. Pair a sandwich and fries with their own raspberry wheat and you have a hell of a meal!

I consider the fact that they don&#39;t take credit cards to be a huge pain and would definitely deter me from going there spontaneously when there are so many other delicious places that do!

The beer list is unique and delicious, and I love the Blackberry Wheat and the Basil Saison (so different!).  I had the burrito with green chili, which, once again was good but not anything special.  Good service, neat atmosphere.  I expected it to be much more divey, and not so much a cool restaurant where a lot of families would be having dinner.

Among the 4-5 IPAs, one was over 100 IBUs and 8%, and was a cold, refreshing punch in the face.  Food was good.  I had the steak sandwich, wife had the black bean burger, kids hossed random cheese-oriented, carb-backed grease bombs.  Played a game while the food came, in and out very quick.  And please know: while Vine Street was very kid-friendly, our kids were pleasantly outnumbered by 20ish kids on dates with wool hats on.

I can bring any one of the members of the tribe in here and they&#39;ll find a beverage they like. Next, food options are awesome here. As a vegetarian I love their Reuben and the boom boom sandwich, and not just because it&#39;s fun to say boom boom at the dinner table. Next, the staff here absolutely rock. They do it all, will have no problem helping you with it all, and they are just a good group of folks - have known a few workers from here and they all are big softies and down to earth...love &#39;em!

We are hoping our experience was a fluke because we really did hear such positive things about the pub. Looking forward to trying it out again in the future! 

This place was sadly just ok. Bummertown. We were super excited to try, and underwhelmed by the experience. Besides the fact that it&#39;s &#34;cash only&#34;, which is silly and the set up of the restaurant is nothing special, the food is good but nothing to write home about.

Honestly, this place is really good if you can&#39;t decide what you want and just want food and a good beer. They offer $2.5 half pints on the beers which is really appreciated. One thing that I thought was a little suspect were the wings. Oh. My. God. They were giant. I was mildly concerned about the sourcing of those chickens. A dozen could suffice for two hungry people to share and be fairly full. Most of their portions are pretty giant. 
We were seated in the back section which I must preferred to the front. It was must quieter and kind of cozy feeling, especially considering the crap weather we were experiencing. We were told it was a wait of 20 minutes for a table for 7 and were seated within about 10. Much appreciated :) We will be back."

Fries are less crispy and more &#34;hand-cut.&#34; Beers are delightful (four stars there)!

That&#39;s what Vine street has going on here. I have stopped her various times to meet friends and get a quick bite and I absolutely love this place. 

I&#39;ll mention from the jump that it is a cash-only establishment, so make sure you hit your ATM before moseying over. The second to the last time I was here I ordered the buffalo chicken wings. What I loved is that they weren&#39;t too salty or too greasy. The flavor was good and they were of good size. I think the ranch that they make is home made. They have a great selection of beers as well.

What I also love is that every time I go the service is always great from the servers and bar staff. The hostess can be hit or miss. The one we had the last time my friend and I went didn&#39;t greet us or bother moving from the hostess stand when we arrived. We ended up walking to the bar in the back just to be told we couldn&#39;t sit there because there was no server. So we had to walk back to the same bland hostess. By this time, there were 2 more parties ahead of ours. But it&#39;s cool. I love that they have plenty of seating and in the center of the main room they have some large tables that can seat people community style. You can make some new friends with your neighbors. :)

One of my friends and I&#39;s favorite things about Vine is the cute gypsy Jazz band, La Pompe Jazz. They play there often and add a nice feel to the environment. I&#39;d say they definitely add class to a hippy place. But the hippy-feel is great too. I will keep coming back to Vine, if not for the good beer, for the music alone.

Food: 4 Stars
Service: 4 for the servers, 2 for the hostess
Atmosphere: 5 Stars
La Pompe Jazz: 5 Stars :)"

We have eaten in restaurant about three times and have had take-out twice. The service has been fine, but each time there have been issues with the food. Either overcooked, or undercooked. For takeout, the burger is never medium (always well). 
The worst part have been the wings! They are breaded and the coating is incredibly thick and overwhelms the entire wing. They are my least favorite wings and I love wings!

What I do remember though are their hot wings. Unlike most other hot wings their&#39;s are lightly breaded.

Went on a Sunday evening and enjoyed the people watching from the patio. The place seemed very family friendly. The beers were local (Boulder). I split a flight with my friend and had a hard time narrowing down to my 3 choices. I thought the beer was pretty good. The servers started to hover a bit after we&#39;d been there around 30 minutes. I got the feeling they were either preparing to shut down or just wanted us to be on our way, even though it was only about 9 PM and there were plenty of empty tables.

I used to live three blocks away from here the past year, so its convenience in location has definitely been a deciding factor in that sense. Each time I&#39;ve come to visit is better than the next.

I absolutely love their rotating beer selection. They do a great job of keeping the favorites as well as incorporating new, seasonal beers. I enjoy the Raspberry Wheat in the summertime since its the perfect, crispy beer. I also have a place in my heart for the Big Krane Kolsch, which is also a very light and delicious beer.

I&#39;ve only had their burgers as far as substance goes. The bison burger is delicious as well as the regular cheeseburger. They always come out exactly as ordered, sometimes even better. Its the perfect compliment to whatever beer your little heart desires!

The service staff is always friendly and accommodating. I&#39;ve never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table on a pretty steady evening. They&#39;re also very good about making sure that you get exactly the table and location your looking for in case you need something specific. The outdoor patio as well as the side outdoor location are perfect in the summertime. They even let you take games (such as Jenga) outside to play if you choose to do so. I also believe they usually have a game or two of corn hole available in the summertime, which is always a favorite of mine.

The only thing that isn&#39;t even a huge deal is that they do NOT accept cards at all. ONLY CASH. It&#39;s great for the servers (Woohoo! ALL and only cash tips each shift!) but kind of an inconvenience if you forget to bring cash.

There is a great brunch on the weekends but man o&#39; man all the families come out at that time. Babies and strollers everywhere - too bad cuz this would have been a 5 star joint. Still, it&#39;s worth trying if you&#39;re in the mood for a nice patio seat.

The menu is decent, good quality with some local spunk. The beer options are always changing which is nice because you can try new taps. Local Colorado stuff and some good classic brews are never a bad thing.

All in all I&#39;d say it&#39;s a cool place with lots of room for good times. They have two patios, long community tables and more intimate seating options if you so need. Cool place. Easy squeezy."

I knew that if my local friends were bringing us here that it was destined to be something special, no surprise it definitely was. Vine street pub looks like... well it looks almost like a cross between a neighbourhood pub/irish bar and an all day diner that serves standard fare.

Well it&#39;s a brewery (yep they brew their own beers) so it&#39;s so much more than &#39;just a pub&#39; and their food... well it&#39;s most definitely anything but standard!

Everything is super gourmet and über delicious. You can tell they take great pride in everything they do here, whether that be brewing delicious stouts that taste more like a bourbon infused desserts than a beer OR making fresh foods like my date night burger which might have been tiny to the naked eye but with a thick patty, a mound of goat cheese and date spread under the buns, there was nothing diminutive about this dynamo sandwich! Heck even their fresh cut fries were a cut above!

Now on a personal note I think Harry Nilsson version is better, and Van Dyke Parks try at it was pretty good too! 

Now I bet somebody decorating Vine Street Pub has probably listened to a Van Dyke Parks record or two cause this place is dressed up like a CLASSIC ROCK HANG OUT.. Old psychedelic posters, hippie gear, and dead head stuff!  I dig it, but it was probably kinda done in a mediocre way, either go all in or don&#39;t in my book.   

Anyway maybe it was just my mood I was a bit tired and needing to be rejuvenated at this point in my day.. And I got to say.. The light Vine Street beer I ordered helped, also the baskets of fries the table ordered really helped... but the thing that put me back into the groove like a Jerry Garcia solo was my VEGAN RUEBEN, with a side a vegan Chili, chips, and a pickle! 
The food here is awesome! I loved it, and I really dug how they make you feel special with a little United States flag with your name on it.. I thought it was ultra patriotic and cool. We did have some Canadians at our table as well, and I think it made them feel special about visiting our little country to the south! 

I think this is a perfect location for a big group to visit. The menu is huge and everyone can easily find something they fancy. The beer was great, the service was top notch and the bathrooms were clean!

For dinner I had the blackened chicken sandwich with a side of French fries. You have to ask for French fries because all meals originally come with chips. The fries are WORTH the extra dollar you have to pay for them. They are made fresh and they are homemade! The chicken sandwich was also very tasty! The service was great.

I didn&#39;t come in here to eat. I came here to drink some beers I can&#39;t get back in Texas.

I sat at the bar and had a some terrific suggestions from the barkeep for my taster flight. Annapurna Amber - loved it. CLEVELAND BROWN ALE - YES! The pulls change seasonally. And they were doing stouts right now that were really great. I won&#39;t tell you which beers to order because my favs may not be there when you get there or you may be a cider drinker, I don&#39;t know. The pours in the flight were nearly a full beer. So I left with a buzz and grabbed a Lift ride back to the hotel. 

I liked that their selections weren&#39;t all IPAs. It seems every place is in love with IPAs. Makes this stout and pils drinker very happy to have other choices besides all those damn IPAs.

Folks were parked in the tables on the patio having burgers and beers. I saw some tasty looking grub come out of the kitchen. I opted for some fries to soak up the brews I was drinking. They were some of the best fries I ever had. Seriously. If the fries are that good, I can&#39;t imagine the food would be bad.

Bright and friendly. Clean and terrific service. I wish they had my size in the t-shirt I wanted. And I wish I could get some of these terrific beers back in Texas."

We had to park a few blocks down in a neighborhood, but the Denver weather made it a pleasant walk. 

Vine Street Pub isn&#39;t large, but it does have patio seating and tailgate games on two sides of the restaurant for added space. Our server was prompt and very patient with our multiple tastings of beer. That&#39;s right, they give you free tastings of any of the beers on their lengthy menu. I selected a light German beer and my boyfriend an IPA.

Between beer tastings, we managed to select a meal. A burger for my boyfriend and a new choice of a crab cake sandwich for me. Land-locked and mile high Denver may be, but this crab was succullent and flavorful! My boyfriend was too busy making yummy noises into his burger to notice my joy. Our beers complemented our food and we left very full and happy.

Why not 5 stars? Vine Street Pub is cash only, and while they do provide an ATM, this was a little upsetting since we rarely carry cash and had to pay the ATM fee to withdraw. But we still gave a generous tip!"

It is my favorite brewery and restaurant in Denver! I thought I had written a review ages ago, but I guess not.

For beer, my favorite is the Hop Vivant, which only comes around every so often. But I also love the FYIPA, which is always on. Also the Java Porter is excellent. 

As far as food goes, they have a ton of options for vegetarians. My favorites are the quesadilla (I add black beans because they are so good!), nachos, and tempeh--the only tempeh sandwich on the menu is the reuben (and I don&#39;t care for reubens) BUT someone clued me in a while back that you can actually substitute tempeh for the meat on pretty much any sandwich. Try the buffalo chicken--sub tempeh! Amazing! I really appreciate this option. And they often have delicious soups too; they change daily.

They don&#39;t have any tv&#39;s here! HUGE plus!

The only negative is that they won&#39;t split the bill. We sometimes go with other people, and it&#39;s just so much easier to have your own bill rather than trying to figure out what everyone had, plus tax, plus tip. It&#39;s not a big deal though; just a minor inconvenience. Oh--and people hate that they don&#39;t take cards. Doesn&#39;t anyone have a checkbook any more?! I guess I&#39;m unusual, but I always have mine in my purse...so I don&#39;t have to get charged by their ATM as well as my bank just to pay my bill. Works for me!"

I ordered a Black &amp;   Blue burger with thier &#34;world famous fries &#34;.

I&#39;ve seen more meat in a Happy Meal. The meat was over cooked and super dry. If it wasn&#39;t for the beer I wouldn&#39;t have been able to swallow it.

Vine Street has unique burgers (the blue cheese and basil is a winner), awesome fries, and a great selection of beer, their own and local.  My hubby really likes the Annapurna, and I think the raspberry wheat is refreshing.  They also have unique, ever-changing specials.  Last week the special was a apple-manchego burger with apple butter spread... probably the best burger I have ever had.  I would come here every week if that was on their regular menu.
Another cool thing about Vine Street is their teamwork philosophy.  Everyone who works there does every job, and they are all really friendly and welcoming.  If you come on a weekend evening there will be a wait, but that just shows you how good this place is."

Had what was probably the best Bison burger in years. Cooked to perfection--no small feat for bison--while delectably topped and seasoned.

The house kölsch and Annapurna amber ale were tops while the Cut Copy cocktail was just delightful (and respectably sized.)

The service was spot on: the bartender was wicked fast, attentive, and perfectly professionally-friendly without an ounce of insincerity. Frankly, it&#39;s been some time since receiving such satisfying bar service, especially with a food order AND with a packed house.

One minor quibble was the slice of red velvet cake which, while entirely edible, was only just beginning to show its age and clearly had been well-refrigerated. To be fair, it probably was ill-advised to bother with it.

Another lesson which holds no marks against this establishment is the parking situation, which is lamentably terrible. I&#39;d ventured nearby too long ago apparently to have recalled that fact.

The beer, the burger, and the service made for an experience that one could only hope to repeat and yet would seem almost unfair to expect it."

Not to mention, it&#39;s the kind of neighborhood hangout that I would love to live by if I were a Denverite. 

Their menu is stacked like The Rock&#39;s delts, which consists of a slew of burgers, sandwiches, soups, and salads to accommodate palates of all kind. (Vegans, I&#39;m looking at you!) They also have a robust beer list that mainly has in-house brews.

I. FOOD AND DRINK
*Girl-Scout Milk Stout: Not too sweet, and it&#39;s a great adult take on thin mints. Plus, how could one ever go wrong with a milk stout?

*Date Night Burger: With roasted pablano peppers, hickory smoked bacon, melted goat cheese, and date puree, this burger rocked. It&#39;s sloppy, and I didn&#39;t mind licking my fingers when my colleagues weren&#39;t looking. *Note: My initial order was well done and not rare plus, and they graciously brought it back to the kitchen. I appreciate that.

*Fresh Cut Fries: Nomnomonomnomnom.

I was getting comfortable suggesting this place with my friend and it had become a new favorite. This favoritism was mainly due to the hummus for me. The hummus is also why I still give Vine Street Pub &amp; Brewery 2 stars instead of 1. 

The service concept of the servers all sharing the same duties or whatever is a cool thought, but the execution there is poor. For instance I like balsamic vinegar on my salad, not balsamic vinaigrette. I stress this often at restaurants. Vine Street Pub is not the first person to not quite get it the first time but considering I had gotten Balsamic Vinegar there in the prior two times for my spinach salad I knew it was not accurate when they said they didn&#39;t have balsamic vinegar. Plus, what the hell kind of kitchen wouldn&#39;t have balsamic vinegar? If we could just have gotten one person to understand we would not have had three different servers come at our table with Balsamic Vinaigrette. The worst vinegar server was definitely the first girl who claimed she was new working there, very rude and adamant that balsamic vinegar and vinaigrette were the same thing. The second vinegar server came out with a tray of red wine vinegar and olive oil, which is close but still not balsamic vinegar. I started laughing out of nervousness and she literally asked me if I was okay. It was becoming so absurd how terrible this was by the time everyone walked away and I had a dry salad. My lunch partner was so agitated he boxed up my salad, paid the bill, left his food and that is when someone walked out with a dish of balsamic vinegar. Really? 20 minutes to get that right? 

But that isn&#39;t all.

This was all after we had ordered a lemonade. A lemonade, you know made with water, lemons, and sugar? The drink that kids make and sell on a corner. Please tell me how when I sipped the lemonade I gagged. That type of reaction does not come from good old classic lemonade. I was served a margarita. I do not drink alcohol for very serious health reasons. It is actually even illegal to serve alcohol to someone without carding them, right? I reckon at 22 years old I should still be getting carded, aye? Anyway, the explanation was &#34;They are in the same containers&#34;. Well don&#39;t you think you should be labelling your lemonade container as separate from your margarita container if you cannot tell the difference? Are you unknowingly serving children tequila on a regular basis? This was pure negligence I had tried to look over but all in all the service as a whole was totally dissatisfying and upsetting to me. Poor organizational skills are not serving this place right. Get organized, accept credit cards, educate your staff on salad dressings and the seriousness of handing out spiked drinks.

I will not be coming back, I will miss the hummus though."

I had their Java beer (f&#39;in good!), Oatimus prime #niceName, and Lord Outmeal stout and they were absolutely fantastic.  If I didn&#39;t have to drive or have work the next day, I wouldn&#39;t mind staying here the whole day and indulge.

For food, I tried their Bison bleu cheese burger and it was a solid burger.  The bacon was good, bleu cheese added a nice flavor, vinegared onions added a nice contrast, and the sweet smoky bbq-like sauce was good.  Too bad my medium-rare bison meat was a bit overcooked.  The buns could also use a little upgrade, but that&#39;s just my burger snobbery taking over.  Solid burger.  I also had their soup of the day, which was a Leek Tomato bisque.  While the ingredients tasted fresh, it needed a little bit more oomph.  

I sat at the bar and service was extremely fast (like on-crack fast) and the staff was running all over the place, so don&#39;t expect your neighborhood cheers bar.  Even then, everyone was friendly and the staff seemed to enjoy their job.

We were also a bit surprised that parties of 6 or more get charged 18% gratuity which we were unaware of till the bill came. Here&#39;s me thinking that gratuity was based on performance of service, not forced. 

Anyway, I had the tempeh Rubén sandwich, luckily I noticed as I was ordering it that it didn&#39;t say beef, also lucky I asked what Tempeh was, it&#39;s nuts. Take off the cheese and it&#39;s a vegan sandwich. It was ok, the sauerkraut was good but would have liked beef on it.

We had a party of 6 on a Friday night and only waited 10 minutes for a table. There were lots of beers on tap to get and they all sounded great, my amber ale was delicious. I got the black bean burger because all the sandwiches and burgers sounded so good. The burger came with chips and an option of salsa or guacamole and the server asked everyone their name so they could put your name on your meal. All the servers and waitstaff were super friendly and everyone at my table loved their food! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes good food and beer!"

Great (and plentiful) beers on tap (most of which are brewed on premises; those that aren&#39;t are brought in a short jaunt away from Mountain Sun in Boulder). The food is consistently delicious and fairly priced.

They operate differently than most pubs. You will not have (most likely) the same waiter or waitress all night long; they all serve everyone and pool tips. I could go either way in terms of preference on this, but it&#39;s fine by me. It might even be awesome for keeping one waiter from being completely overwhelmed while others are holding up walls... or terrible for the opposite reason since nobody&#39;s incentivized... regardless, I&#39;ve never had bad service, so it&#39;s working well for them.

I would eat here again and recommend to friends; been here at least a dozen times... but there&#39;s this one thing.

Any place other than Galt&#39;s Gulch that won&#39;t take my plastic since the last decade will never qualify for 5 stars from me. Get with the program, and I&#39;ll happily update my review to perfect and elaborate on your killer food and beer."

Now that I got that out of my system.... 

This is one of my favorite places to get a solid happy hour! They have a great selection of beer and many options for food including pub food (nachos/burgers) and they include healthier choices like vegetarian wraps-- which makes it easy for a group with a wide variety of meal preferences. 

My absolute favorite thing to order are the nachos. It&#39;s around $11 for a HUGE delicious pile of amazing goodness. I split them with my boyfriend, and afterwards we agreed that our gluttonous desire to finish them could have easily been distributed to another person and then we wouldn&#39;t have felt like stuffed pigs afterward. Long story short-- they&#39;re big and can easily be split between 3-4 people. 

The beer is delicious and I am a fan of the stouts that they have! I think it&#39;s $3ish dollars for a beer during happy hour with isn&#39;t bad at all for the quality that you get. They also have flights if you want to sample the variety that they offer. 

I love the patio in the summer months--they even have games to play if you&#39;re waiting for a seat. Speaking of that-- I would get there before 5 if you&#39;re not looking for a wait! Service has always been friendly and prompt.

Beer and burger Mondays are a good reason to have both. The service is too much, if anything. They share tables, which means you&#39;ll never have to wait to ask for what you need. Ask, because they&#39;ll offer tastes of pretty much any beef you&#39;d like. Highly recommended, unless you&#39;re closer to one of their other 4 locations."

So we gave it a shot.

 We show up and immediately liked the atmosphere. Nothing fancy and It had a local flavor which was what we were looking for. While we waited they had a basket of French fries for us to nibble on while we waited to be seated. We waited for about 15-20 min to be seated, but once we sat down we were greeted by a friendly waiter that explained the menu to us. He was a new waiter, so he had help.

It shares many similarities including craft beer brewed on site, a wide selection of visiting beers, delicious food, and being a cash only establishment.

I typically get the wings while my girlfriend prefers the wraps and burritos here. The wings are larger than your average wing and breaded. Depending on the night, they can be a tad bit undercooked but that&#39;s mainly because of how large they are. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a bad meal here. Lots of inventive dishes that aren&#39;t quite farm to table but still a step of the traditional brewpub path.

Most places these days accept some form of credit card payment. Not here. Vine street is completely content remaining cash only, and they still use hand written bills - no indication of any computer based order management. They have an ATM over by the bathrooms but otherwise bring cash.

Also worth noting, in the event that you forget cash, your wallet, or just find yourself in an awkward situation, they also offer the &#34;karma envelope&#34;. They&#39;ll send you home with your bill and an envelope and then you can send cash/check back in the envelope. Pretty cool although I tend to settle up on premise."

Yes, the fact that they are cash/check only is a pain but I am also happy to support a local business without them having to deal with Credit Card companies and their processing fees, I am happy to encounter this inconvenience for the good of a local business and their staff.

I&#39;m completely in love with the aesthetic in this bar--gorgeous wallpaper, velvet couches, and plants aplenty.

No passwords, no secret handshake, no bartenders in suspenders or &#34;Newsies&#34; outfits. Just a cool, 1930&#39;s bar with classic cocktails and no pretension. 

A friend of mine tipped me off about Fort Greene and I&#39;m so glad she looped me in on what a cool new spot this was in Denver. Yeah, the neighborhood isn&#39;t so great, but compared to other rougher cities (St. Louis, San Francisco), this ain&#39;t bad at all. I even waited outside for my Uber to arrive in the dark and it was fine. 

What&#39;s inside? A swanky, green/black/white art deco hangout when you first walk inside. Beautiful mahogany bar and with plenty of booze. Grab a seat on a velvet couch and start your night with a stiff drink. If you feel inclined to stick around later, there&#39;s a back room with a disco ball and either a DJ or live music. 

There&#39;s a limited food menu but I didn&#39;t go there this visit. Just a New York sour and some fun company. Fort Greene is good for drinks, ambiance and making friends. It&#39;s like a fancy Cheers!"

It&#39;s quiet, tucked away, completely hidden, no signage. It&#39;s half dive bar half antique/thrift store. If anyone saw the DCPA production of Sweet &amp; Lucky then you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;ve stepped back into that show. It&#39;s kitschy and homey, it&#39;s friendly and welcome, it&#39;s also thrift-store-otherworldy (which is my new band name, check us out at an open mic night nowhere near you). In the end it&#39;s fun and weird. I want their main room to have a little more in-the-middle-of-the-room-seating and other things with lots of hyphens. 

Glasses are mismatched, cocktails are funnily named, the server was awesome, cocktails were tasty, there was an art show being set up for the next night.

The only thing I really know for sure is that I&#39;m not cool enough to go here. I&#39;m not skinny enough, I don&#39;t have nearly enough piercings or tattoos (which is to say: any) and I definitely haven&#39;t read enough David Foster Wallace or spent enough time evaluating the qualitative differences between Parliaments and American Spirits.

The bartender greeted us right away and took our order as soon as we were ready.

Hubs grabbed a beer &amp; I grabbed a cocktail. The beer itself was a tasty local out of Boulder. The cocktail was the warmer special which seemed a little off balance. One mixer/alcohol was far more prominent that another. 

The overall ambiance and look for the bar are cool and cozy. The place was a little chilly, as another commenter mentioned, almost as though they forgot it was January! We sat in the back room which was a little chillier, but had a nice seating area. The patio looks amazing- can&#39;t wait for the warmer months to roll around!

They have only been open 3 weeks, so the drink menu and spirits are simple, but creative! Our bartender made a kick-a Old Fashioned &amp; the Sheboygan Old Fashioned (on the menu) was equally delicious!

We didn&#39;t get to try any food, but the head chef did come and chat with us. The plan is to keep the menu simple;1/2 chicken, oysters, etc AND...cheese curds!! The food I did see come out of the kitchen looked beautiful &amp; smelled tasty.

Very quickly, we discovered two more rooms in the back and a patio.

We had the attention of the owner, Aaron, so we got some history on the place. We had a good conversation with Eleanor, who bartended at the previous bar at this location. And later Aaron&#39;s brother, Bretton, introduced himself. He is the chef and apparently the food is amazing but we didn&#39;t have any. We did, however, have two drinks and both were pretty spot on.

Cocktails are good, and that&#39;s really the reason togo. The space is small and reminds me of old East Coast bars in old buildings. There&#39;s a patio for good weather. But if you visit in winter, bundle up. The heat hasn&#39;t been on when I&#39;ve gone, and it wasn&#39;t crowded enough to generate a lot of body heat.

I would have likely given another star if we had been able to eat as we were super disappointed that they wouldn&#39;t serve us. If the kitchen closes at 10, then you should be able to order food until 10, not 9:55 (I can&#39;t remember what time the kitchen closed and their website doesn&#39;t give a time, which I find odd. It just says open 5pm-closed.)  We didn&#39;t even want anything that would have needed to be cooked.

- Very cold (think 55℉) in the main area when we arrived. It did not get warmer. Two other couples came in and left quickly while we were sitting there. I wore my fleece during the entire time.
- No Wi-Fi.
- The &#34;napkins&#34; were those brown paper towels you use to dry your hands in the bathroom. And, I did see the same ones in the WC.
- Over priced food. $9 for asparagus.
- Dim lighting. Yes, I am an old fart, but this is very close to dark. My cats would have liked it though."

My hubby and I arrive around 6pm on a Friday evening. The temperature outside was around 50 degrees and it didn&#39;t feel much warmer inside. Honestly, if it was 60 degrees inside I would be surprised. When asked if it would warm up inside we were told that &#34;it&#39;s a really old building and it takes a while...&#34; So okay we will need to find a warm corner and leave our coats on because based on the fabulous Yelp reviews, we really want to stay. There are only two other patrons in the place, sitting at the bar. Meanwhile, two other couples come in, sit down, then get up and leave. 

The food and drink menu is very small - too small in my opinion. $7 for a small pour of an okay wine. Hubby enjoys a drink and a cheap beer. We try the fried cheese curds and the prosciutto wrapped asparagus - both very good but very overpriced at $10 and $9 - $6 would be acceptable. 

We leave because it&#39;s too dark inside, it&#39;s too cold inside and the food and drinks are overpriced. 

I really wanted to love Fort Greene but was so disappointed."

charcoal-restaurant-denver,David M.,9KPEd4l0S-dlWiXWtthtrA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,376,666,29069e-7uWQqpsXwdUl70w,5.0,2016-09-17,"Seems to me that restaurants that offer Groupon / TravelZoo / Living Social / etc. coupon deals tend not to be high-end 5 star kinds of places. So I don&#39;t get how come I can usually grab a tasting menu coupon for Charcoal that is a very good deal when the food there is so rockin&#39;. I shouldn&#39;t complain though, and neither should you. We should all take advantage of a great deal and hit them up for a special dinner. 

For $99 on TravelZoo my honey and I had a couple of glasses of stellar wine served with a complimentary amuse bouche of chef-made coriander hummus that was $8 on the regular menu (the wines were around $12-$15 by the glass). Next came 2 appies that were absolutely worth the $12-$16 price tag each would have cost without the coupon (an excellent buffalo mozzarella salad and an order of amazingly delicious grilled garlic shrimp). The hanger steak I had ($27 a la carte) and the wild mushroom agnolotti my sweetheart had ($22 on the menu) were so rich in flavor and so perfectly prepared we were as happy as could be that they included them as choices on the deal. We both had house-made fresh Palisade peach ice cream for dessert (regularly $8 each).   

We amped the meal up with a couple more glasses of wine but had we not done that and simply tipped on the meal value (which really was worth $130) and left a generous $30 gratuity the total cost would have been the TravelZoo $99 plus the $30 tip for $129 on a meal truly worth $160 tip included. A $30 discount at such an excellent restaurant is a nice thing indeed.

So someone needs to educate me about Charcoal. We were there at 8 p.m. on a Friday night and seats were still available. Did we catch the cooties? Is the place haunted? Why aren&#39;t y&#39;all there jamming this wonderful Denver restaurant servin&#39; excellent food in a cool setting with cheap deals goin&#39; on? Guess I shouldn&#39;t complain. We were able to get a great table by making a last-minute rezzie so sign me . . .

The hubs and I came a little after 1 on a Saturday. We started with drinks and I asked what iced tea flavors they had. Our waitress (who was awesome) explained it was black tea but they could add passion fruit concentrate. What? Mind. Blown. I love passion fruit and that they had that ready to go. It was so good I slurped down two big glasses. 

For nosh, the hubs chose the angus beef burger with cave aged Gruyere and horseradish aioli. It was hands down the best burger we have both tried in a very very long time. The fries on the side were perfectly crunchy and silky on the inside. 

My dish was the smoked salmon Benedict with mustard hollandaise. It also came with a perfectly dressed side salad. They smoke their salmon in house and it was as good as it gets. I also loved that the hollandaise wasn&#39;t drenching everything on the plate as all too often happens. 

And a highlight above and beyond the already mentioned food gasms are the latkes. Again, some of the best latkes I&#39;ve had. Thick yet creamy soft and very crunchy as it should be on the outside. The lingonberry jam was spot on. 

Service was exceptional and we cannot wait to explore more of this culinary genius."
charcoal-restaurant-denver,Sarah H.,AsGMmQtUKokJ8Qhan6jEOw,"Aurora, CO",1,1,1,77,2122,R4Jjng7ycZk8UoPifkoNpQ,3.0,2016-08-14,"We came here with a Travel Zoo voucher which entitled us to a five course meal plus wine for $99.  That was about twice the amount I&#39;m comfortable paying for a non-special-event dinner, but I just couldn&#39;t resist because it was a very good deal and for a restaurant that&#39;s been getting a lot of rave reviews.

From the start, I was underwhelmed.  Nothing about Charcoal was bad, it just didn&#39;t meet my expectations when being labeled &#34;one of the best restaurants in Denver&#34;.  The décor was cute and modern, but there were quite a few light bulbs out all over the dining area, which seemed like the kind of detail a high end restaurant would pay attention to.  The Travel Zoo voucher specifies that we needed to inform the host of our deal, so I made sure to mention this when I made my reservation.  We were promptly seated and then greeted by our server, but he then disappeared for quite a long time while we looked over the menus, no water or drink orders offered yet.  When he reappeared, I pointed out the Travel Zoo voucher to make sure there were no restrictions on what we ordered and he said that we&#39;d actually been given an entirely wrong menu in that case.  Dang.  There went the entrée I&#39;d selected off the regular menu.

The food was good but nothing really blew us away.  I was confused by the amuse offering, which was a giant mason jar filled with feta cheese dip and bread.  Seemed like more of a appetizer than an amuse.  We were then brought out the Spanish shrimp appetizer.  It only came with three shrimp, which seemed a bit meager compared to the giant amuse we&#39;d been served, but it was a five course meal so we weren&#39;t overly concerned with the portion size.  This was decidedly the best part of the dinner. The seasoning was smoky and savory and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Next came the salad, which was, ya know, a salad.  We both selected the same entrée - a lemon ricotta filled pasta.  Again, there was nothing wrong with the dish - it was good.  It just didn&#39;t blow us away.  For dinner, my partner ordered the cheese plate (which was, ya know, a cheese plate) and I ordered a raspberry sorbet.  This turned out to be a laughably small portion.  I joked that this should have been the amuse.  I was surprised to find myself still hungry after a five course meal and ended up ordering the chicken liver mousse appetizer to finish off the night.

So overall, we left feeling really ambivalent about our experience at Charcoal.  We couldn&#39;t put our finger on anything that was particularly bad or wrong about the meal we&#39;d shared, but we felt like at $150 after tip, we&#39;d paid entirely too much and would have REALLY felt ripped off if we&#39;d paid full price.  It&#39;s not that Charcoal doesn&#39;t do a good job, it&#39;s just that there are too many competitors for fine dining that outshine them."

First impression was the staff were so nice. Very warm but professional. The ambience was to me subdued elegance. Just enough to make you feel like your date actually put some thoughts into his or her choice of destination. 

We ordered their Beet Salad, Crab Beignet, Meatballs, rack of lamb and their special that day the steak. The Beet Salad stood out. The Crab Beignet was nothing to rave about. It was crunchy outside and soft inside. That was the best part. There wasn&#39;t anything special about this at all. This to me was a let down. I was looking forward to sampling this particular dish. It was just blah.

I will still go back and try the rest of their dishes. Although I will say the rest of their dishes are not bad. The steak was very tender. I wanted to be wowed. I don&#39;t know why I was far from it. I&#39;m not giving up I will be back ."

It seemed like the smaller and simpler the dish, the better it was. Efforts to put forward bold flavors in the mains ended up with a number of different flavors that were fighting with each other.

We had a venison carpaccio that was great. Real simple, straightforward, tasty. Same with the latke side; well-cooked, with some acidic lingonberry to cut the heaviness, they were also great. 

On to the burrata, which was pretty good, but over-seasoned with herbs, which got in the way of the excellent cheese.

Neither main did much for us. The hanger steak with vegetable ash wasn&#39;t just touched with vegetable ash, it was dredged in it, which left a bitter graininess on the tongue and got in the way of what was otherwise a nice piece of meat. It was accompanied by  tzatziki, for no reason I could fathom. And the meatballs had the opposite problem; they were pretty bland, and accompanied by an equally bland tomato sauce.

I had high hopes for this restaurant, particularly since we can walk to it from our house, but I couldn&#39;t find any real reason to go back."

The hostess was very accommodating who gave us a seat at a table in the bar area that was closest to the tv. The bartender, a very handsome gentleman, came over and took our drink order quickly. We went with the $15 bottomless mimosas. 

We started our meal with the Chicken Liver Mousse. It was delicious. It came with some pickled vegetables and some toasted bread that had an oil and vinaigrette dressing. This was probably my favorite thing of the many things we ate that day.

We stayed pretty much all day since our drinks kept being refilled. Throughout the day we became friends with the rest of the bar, the servers, and the manager. All were very friendly. 
For brunch we ordered the Quiche and the Salmon Benedict. Both were delicious. The quiche was hearty and flavorful. The benedict was delicious. I loved the hollandaise sauce with the amount of mustard they put in it. The salmon was cooked perfectly. I wish my salad came with tomatoes like my friend&#39;s did with the quiche. 

The staff was accommodating with us during our watching the football game. Even though brunch was over, they let us order a meat and cheese plate to snack on while watching. I loved the spicy sausage and mustard that came on that plate. 

All in all my experience was great. I want to go back and eat there again. I rate this place 4.5 stars."

We started with a glass of wine and a beer, and soon decided on the charcuterie plate to start us off. Soon after, we got the mussels, followed by another round of drinks. To finish, we got the grilled shrimp and Brussels sprouts to split. Everything was delicious, but the show stealer was definitely the Brussels sprouts. I mean holy crap. Perfectly seasoned, crispy and juicy in all the right ways, and the egg on top added delicious texture and taste. We ravenously enjoyed every last bite. Our meal had such a nice flow to it, and we left extremely satisfied. Our waitress was amazing as well and was very attentive!

We started with delicious blueberry scones with butter and blueberry jam. For course two I got the yogurt with fresh fruit and granola (the guy chose the Swedish pancakes), and for the third course I went with the Gluten-Free Potato Pancakes. I didn&#39;t care about them being gluten free, I cared about what they came with and that was smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, sour cream, lemon, chives. The potato pancakes were ridiculously tasty and crispy. And everything that accompanied them was fresh and delicious. I couldn&#39;t finish it all but believe me, I wanted to.
Add in bottomless breakfast cocktails and no one could have been happier. Delicious Poinsettias and screwdrivers - these guys don&#39;t mess around. They also offer bottomless Bloody Marys, Beermosas, mimosas, etc. 

Our server, Ben, couldn&#39;t have been more helpful and friendly - nicely done. The manager (owner? Chef? IDK) also stopped by to make sure everything was great - really nice touch.

Charcoal Restaurant serves sumptuous, luxurious cuisines of the nouvelle variety.  Nouvelle, French for, &#34;new cuisine,&#34; is an approach to cooking and presentation whereby dishes are exceptionally small.  Great emphasis is placed on presentation and the overall quality of the food items.  Nouvelle cuisine had it&#39;s heyday in the 60&#39;s, and again in the 80&#39;s when shoulder pads and big hair were boss.  I love the 80&#39;s, but I have never been a big fan of delicate, expensive dishes.  The tired cliché of grabbing a burger from a fast food joint after eating here rings true.  That said, I must point out that the food is phenomenal!  Charcoal also offers an extensive wine list and a toothsome array of desserts.  The service is topnotch, as well.   

Don&#39;t come here to eat if you are starving, unless you plan on ordering one of each item on the menu.  Seriously though, this is a fantastic place to eat.  Keep your eyes on the restaurant&#39;s Facebook page; Charcoal often posts solid offers.  I recently saw one that read, &#34;Join us for our $35 build your own 3 course meal tonight!&#34;

There was salad, fingerling potatoes, cheesy gratin potatoes, asparagus, pork belly, steak, salmon, chicken, and more.

Service is impeccable and the food simply perfect. Our waiter was attentive and always ready to answer our questions or the ask his manager if needed (my husband had a specific question about a drink and the waiter double checked with his manager).  
We started cocktails and promptly some yummy bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was delivered to our table to enjoy while we looked at the menu. 
I ordered the fish for dinner and it was cooked to perfection, with a crunchy skin that offered a nice contrast against the tender white flesh.  My husband had the duck confit, also very tasty.
During dinner, a manager came to each table to ask if we were satisfied with our dinner.   Charcoal restaurant seems to care about it&#39;s clients, and it shows in the details.
Once again, we had a wonderful dinner."

The bread was a little bit dry, but the entree (flat iron steak, med rare) was great, with plenty of flavor in the kale side.

The brunch menu consists of French toasts, benedicts, and etc. they even have a $15 dollar tasting menu for breakfast where you can sample 4-5 bites of the day. 

Did I mention bottomless mimosas? What I loved about charcoal was that it wasn&#39;t a loud brunch establishment. Seems like a ton of restaurants are opting for live music on sat and sun brunches. No thanks. 

I got the smoked salmon and potato pancakes. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t wowed by the flavor.  My husbands breakfast sandwich was yummy and huge. But once again I wasn&#39;t floored by unique tastes.

I loved the quiet and polite atmosphere though. Ill try dinner here next time."

We saw the great reviews of Charcoal and decided to have dinner there. We were not disappointed by any means.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the general manager, I believe that was him came out to speak to us about the restaurant. You could sense his love for the restaurant and his love for great food. We ordered the mussels and the cheese appetizers and shared. I have never had such a plate of mussels in my life. Better than anything I had in San Francisco. The cheese appetizer was amazing with the roasted lemon to squeeze on top served with pita bread. We also ordered the ravioli with mushroom Ragu. It was outstanding. And for dessert we shared their frozen coffee cheesecake. And it was so delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant is a gem in the city!"

I had a couple of friends tell me about this place and how great it was and after my parents told me to pick a nice place for a birthday dinner, I looked over the menu and decided this would be a great spot. I wasn&#39;t wrong.

It&#39;s a darkly lit open room with lots of tables and a few booths. On a Wednesday evening when we came in around 7 the place only had a few parties there so we got to sit in one of the large comfortable booths. Our server immediately tended to us and was warm and inviting and happy to explain anything about the menu.

We started with an order of the truffle fries, probably some of the best in town. Served hot with that light truffle taste. We also had the crispy brussel sprouts. They could have been a little crispier but wiht the duck breast and a poached egg mixed in I&#39;m really not allowed to complain. We gobbled them up.

For dinner I enjoyed the Atlantic char, a fish with a taste similar to Salmon over a white puree. It was cooked perfectly and again I was part of the clean plate club. My mom had the PEI mussels which I tried a couple bites of, the broth was delicious. Would love to have ordered bread to sop it all up. Best broth I&#39;ve tried in quite a while. My dad ordered the Salmon with Gravlax which was beautifully presented. My dad gobbled it up.

For dessert the server brought out this delicious chocolate mousse which was so rich.  A couple bites was all I needed to put a perfect end to my meal.

For a dinner on a nice occasion at a restaurant where you can hear the people across the table talking with great service I would recommend taking a look and trying out this place."

However, although I came during RW, I feel like I received the level of food and service that I would have on a regular visit.  That is to say, a high level for both.  Our service was great from start to finish.  One little touch that really stood out, was when a random person (busboy? expediter?) proactively offered to grab some bread so that one of my dining companions could sop up the yummy liquid on her plate.

My starter was Local Duroc Pork Belly (with watermelon, fennel, arugula, and honey ginger vinaigrette).  Good, but not that memorable.  My entree was Duck Leg Confit 
with charred frisée, polenta &#34;fries&#34;, palisade plum jam, and toasted pecans.  This was truly wonderful.  The duck was so, so delicious. The cheese plate for dessert was quite substantial.  Indeed, it would easily have fed two diners.  It had a great variety of bits and pieces, and was a flavor and texture adventure. This included: brillat-savarin, date almond cracker, spice nuts, and strawberries.

I would gladly visit Charcoal again."

We were starving so decided to order the Duck Fat Fries and Blueberry scones to start off and they were both just delicious!!!! We also got an order of the Swedish Pancakes which were served with homemade whipped cream and were equally amazing! To eat, I had the breakfast burrito and while it was a good size, I did manage to eat the whole thing :) Among the other meals at our table were the Swedish Meatballs, Potato Pancakes, and the Eggs Benedict - there wasn&#39;t a crumb left! (And not because we were drunk-hungry from the mimosas either) the food was just damn good! 

They also brought out fresh homemade banana bread while we waited for our food and it was divine. Our server was just amazing ensuring a glass was never empty and we had an amazing time!

I have yet to go to dinner as this was my first experience here but I certainly look forward to returning and trying their other menus. 

What a wonderful experience!!!"

I had a wonderful experience at the bar with Tom, the bartender, and the bottomless mimosas.  A local was having a cheese &amp; meat platter not on the menu and I love local&#39;s knowledge.  I had such a great experience six months ago so when I found myself in Denver again I made an effort to locate Charcoal again.  I couldn&#39;t remember exactly where it was but recalled the neighborhood enough that I drove around until I found it.  I wasn&#39;t disappointed.

Kevin has taken over Tom&#39;s Sunday shift and he was a delight.  He possesses a wealth on knowledge on not only Charcoal&#39;s menu but the food &amp; beverage industry in general.  I have some food intolerance issues but he was able to answer all of my questions.  I love the unique brunch menu, while some standards are on there I appreciated the variety and novel items such as the Swedish meatballs.  My companion and I started with a 1/2 order of the French toast and it was delightful, like a dessert.  Then we split a 1/2 order of the meatballs and the burrito.  The breakfast burrito crushes burritos I&#39;ve had at Mexican and Tex Mex establishments.  It was full of the good, tasty stuff and had minimal filler, like potatoes.  

This place is the bomb.  If I didn&#39;t live in Boulder I&#39;d be here every weekend for brunch."

It was my first time eating out on Thanksgiving and I have been utterly converted to the novelty.  Charcoal provided a perfectly portioned and paced meal, which was far superior to the usual Thanksgiving induced food coma.  Not having to clean up afterward was worth every cent of the bill.

Charcoal&#39;s interior has a pleasing, open layout, with minimalist wood finishing and a relaxed yet sophisticated layout.  The Thanksgiving day meal offered four courses with three options for the entree.  Everything was fresh, searing hot and beautifully presented.  The wine list seemed mildly overpriced at $15 for a glass for a Colorado cabernet, but still well suited to the menu options.  I&#39;m looking forward to my next trip."

Our server was wonderful, we were gifted with treats from the chef, and the food was delicious. I didn&#39;t hear a complaint the entire dinner, which with 8 ladies is an achievement in itself. 

I personally tasted the Bacon Wrapped Dates (always a good choice), Greek Feta Cheese Mousse (absolutely delicious), Chicken Liver Mousse (well made!), oysters on the half shelf (nice and fresh and an amazing mignonette), Truffle fries (crispy and light), and parts of the the Charcuterie Board for appetizers, and they did not disappoint. 

For me entree I ordered the Grilled Pork Chop which came with a seriously good challerhocker biscuit, brussel leaves, apple butter, and an onion jus. It was tender and juicy, but a hearty portion, so I could not finish it all. (That also may have had something to do with all trying all the apps!)

At first glace, it appears that you are walking into an abandoned brick building. But again, move past your judgment and open the door to a huge space. The bar is tucked away on the right for your romantic types, and the dining room is wide open for you to discover how your dinner neighbor removed that pesky wart. Even so, the tables are well spaced apart so you may only catch a small taste of someone&#39;s conversation.

Be sure to check out the wine list, which is large but not overwhelming. Any of the meat-oriented dishes are great, and the appetizers are excellent as well. My only complaint is the lack of parking (street only, from what I can tell) and that the prices are a bit high for the location. This isn&#39;t the Highlands after all.

Our other lunch companion went with the trout plancha and I got to sample it.  Balanced flavor and really tasty gribiche (like a tartar sauce but lighter). 

We did opt to try out the two desserts (chocolate caramel crème and pineapple upside down cheesecake).  Both were outstanding though I give the edge to the cheesecake as it was much lighter (it&#39;s made with mascarpone) than expected.

My friend and I shared the charcoal brunch (toast, scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and a side of fruit) and the pork green chile (served with sour cream and a sopapilla). 

Bloodies: Not bad. Spicy, but not very... thick. I wish it felt fuller in my mouth, but it was kind of thin. BUT THEY ARE BOTTOMLESS.

Food: Charcoal platter was not bad, but not great. Bacon was crispy, but not very special. Eggs were cooked well, as were the potatoes. It&#39;s an $11 plate, so I guess it was fine.

Pork green chile, with a sunny side up egg, sour cream, and sopapilla. DELICIOUS. I&#39;d get this one again, no question. Pork was tender, green chile was delicious, and when you mix the runny yolk and sour cream in, it&#39;s a bowl of yummy deliciousness."

I don&#39;t get charging 15 bucks for meatballs and some mashed potatoes, and a small portion size at that. I mean, small portion sizes are expected in a &#34;European&#34; restaurant, but it just didn&#39;t do it for me.  No draft system, even for selling shitty European beer. Service was good, but the place was dead, and we won&#39;t likely be back. I think Charcoal takes itself a little too seriously. And that&#39;s hard to do when you don&#39;t have a draft beer system and you&#39;re basically selling glorified meat and potatoes.  Total tab for two including one bloody Mary and 2 bottled beers: $63.  Fail."

We got driven outside into the rain by a neighboring business and their errant fire alarm, and my visiting parents and I couldn&#39;t care less after the stellar treatment we received.

I dislike brussels sprouts, but I&#39;d recommend theirs, and the cucumber gimlet is fantastic. The prices are actually very reasonable, and I&#39;d suggest hitting their happy hour first for some of the tasty &#34;bites,&#34; like the bacon-wrapped dates. 

I&#39;m not sure how often their menu changes, so I&#39;d hurry down for this one... And come back for others!"

We sat at our table for 10 minutes and had water glasses filled twice before we had to literally call out to a member of the wait staff to take a drink and appetizer order.  The bacon wrapped dates came overlooked, too dry and far too hot to eat when they arrived.  Prawns were a better choice.  The salmon entree was undercooked.  The NY strip steak was perfectly cooked but came with a rather uninspiring and colorless salad-like side dish.  In addition, I had told the restaurant in advance we were there for my wife&#39;s birthday, but they forgot and by the time the meal was ending we just wanted to leave. If you want to try this place do do soon.  With food that is passable but not stellar and such horrible service-- especially in a town with new restaurant choices everyday-- the doors will be closed in six months."

I walk past it nearly every morning on my way to work, and was glad to finally be able to try it a couple weeks past.

We went on a Friday night before a show at Curious theater - this was the night of the biiig storm, ooooooh. They were open and actually had a pretty decent crowd in the restaurant, considering the weather had most people holed up in front of their TV&#39;s. 

Anyway, I arrived about half an hour before our dinner reservation to join a couple friends at the bar for drinks - one of the bartenders was rude, but the second was cool. We were seated as soon as most of our party had arrived, and enjoyed a couple of the Charcuterie boards. Really, everything on it was great - highly recommended. 

I got the duck (pictured) which wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had in Denver, but was very good. They cook the food over Bincho charcoal, which heats to an extremely high temperature but has almost no smoke. The supposed out come is that meat will be crispy on the outside, but very tender on the inside - I think next time I go (and I&#39;ll definitely be back) I&#39;ll try a steak. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place, and hope they continue to do well - the location probably isn&#39;t the best, but hey - I&#39;d imagine the rent here is much cheaper than it is in LoDo. Give Charcoal a try!"

I&#39;ve been 3 times now - the most recent just last week - and each times it&#39;s just been OK.  For the prices they charge I am really looking for more than OK.

First, the ambiance is charming.  The waiting area is large and inviting, and the dining room is well-spaced so that you never feel too close to another table.  It would be easy to have an intimate, romantic dinner here and feel like you were the only two in the room.

On my first visit, I went with my mom and grandma when I had just moved to Colorado.  We splurged.  For appetizers we ordered bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with cream cheese and an almond with a balsamic reduction drizzled on top.  AMAZING.  We also got truffle fries which were nice and crispy.  For the main course, I ordered a chicken breast that came with artichoke and a delicious, zingy sauce atop.  We paired the chicken with a glass of the Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc.  It was so crisp and citrusy and paired perfectly with the meal.

My second venture to Charcoal is what put it at five star for me because the food continued to be delicious.  I visited for Denver Restaurant Week.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates again (and was so delighted to see that they were part of the 5280 menu).  But this time they came with goat cheese and a concord grape reduction.  A very nicely balanced taste that my friends and I would call &#34;shut-up&#34; good.  Which means it tastes to good that you have to ask your dining partner to stop talking so you can savor the food.  For the main course I ordered the gnocci in pesto sauce with brussel sprouts.  The brussel sprouts were cooked so well and the gnocci was light and crisp on the outside from a brief sautee.  For dessert, a scoop of blood orange sorbet with blackberries and blueberries.  All in all, a fantastic meal.  And the service was great too!"

Bryan and Lacey M invited me to dinner last Saturday night when one of our friends was in from out of town.  They had been here for brunch and raved about it, so I couldn&#39;t wait to try the place.  

We had reservations at 6:45, got here a bit early and I went to the bar to order a round for us.  It took some time to get the bartender to notice me, just long enough for me to become slightly perturbed.  I became a little more when I waited for over ten minutes for him to make three Manhattans, and then he took forever trying to find 3 matching glasses even after I told him three times that we didn&#39;t care about the size variation.  By the time they were almost ready I noticed he was making them with a different whiskey than I had ordered.  By this time I was irritated and everyone was already sitting at the table and waiting for me, so I just gave up.

Once we sat down, however, everything was peaches and cream.  Courtney was our waitress, and she provided flawless service.  She got our drinks quickly, kept the water glasses full and the table clean, and was very pleasant in her interactions with us.  

Our first course consisted of bacon wrapped dates, brussel sprouts, tuna tartar, and the charcuterie platter.  I didn&#39;t partake of the tuna, but everything else was mouth watering good.  The charcuterie was my favorite by far, I highly recommend trying this.

For dinner, two of us had the skirt steak, one the salmon, and one the lamb shank.  I loved the steak beyond most things I&#39;ve tried, but found myself wishing I had gone with the lamb, which came with the most delicious piece of lamb sausage I&#39;ve ever had.  I even enjoyed the bite of salmon I tried (which I normally don&#39;t care for at all).

For dessert, we had glasses of ice wine, port, and a couple of scotches.  Their drink menu is very impressive, with something for every ones tastes.  A pretty small selection when it comes to beer, but they do have a good IPA which goes well with their menu.

Honestly, the only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star experience was the bar issue, which was just too much of a mess to blow off.  Maybe the bartender was inexperienced, but hopefully that will be ironed out.  Other than that, I loved the evening, loved the food, and loved Courtney, and I can&#39;t wait to come back!

Cheers!"

IT&#39;s unfortunate because one of the girls who booked the reservation based it solely on the rave reviews... which is why I&#39;m writing this. Their specials that evening were shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque. We had to re-order the shrimp cocktail numerous times because it wasn&#39;t cooked fully through. Although the chef guaranteed it on the second or third time... we were diligent in saying that it was translucent which it shouldn&#39;t be. It FINALLY came out fully cooked and there were double the shrimp, I suppose to make up for the mistake. Most of us are from the East Coast and were all in agreement that shrimp cocktail is a simple thing to make and that this shouldn&#39;t have been so difficult for a chef to cook. Also, two of the girls ordered the lobster bisque and it came out cold. A good bit of the meal was comped to make up for how awful it went, but we were all in agreement that we won&#39;t be back."

From there we had one outstanding dish after another.  Seriously could not say anything bad.  But the show stopper for me was the Branzino. Wow!

They are just thin hard wooden chairs. We moved to a table where my wife (at least, wish it could have been both of us) had a cushioned back in her side of the booth.

BUT, besides that, it was an excellent experience. Marycourtney (Yes, all one word) is a FANTASTIC server/somollier/fountain of knowledge and enthusiasm. Go to Charcoal, ask for her, and allow her to pair 1/2 pours of wine with each dish. Just trust her to it, and you will have an amazing experience. She is currently studying to become 1 of like 10 (is that right?) Master Somolliers in the entire country. For us, it&#39;s all about the knowledge of the staff just as much as it is about the quality of the food and wine list. You need someone to bring it together for you so you can leverage their experience, and Marycourtney can do just that. It&#39;s hard to find that level of expertise."

Curious Theatre on Acoma so perfect for a pre-theatre dinner, which is what I and many of the other diners were doing. Excellent wine list, including many nice wines by the glass. To start I had a spinach and arugula salad that was very nice - with pine nuts and sun-dried tomatoes. For main course had entree sized portion of fresh pasta (a rigatoni-like shape) with a wild boar ragu. Fell in love with pasta with wild boar ragu after I had it a few times in Tuscany where it is pretty common so I am a sucker for it when it is offered. It was truly delicious!

Came here for a girls&#39; night on Saturday because we wanted something tasty and trendy. It definitely qualified for both.

Great bar- wine on tap!! I love that. You know that the glass you get will be fresh. Of course there were 4 of us so we went with the bottle.

We started with the bacon wrapped dates. Delicious! I could have had another plate of those. Sadly, when they say &#34;small bites&#34; they are not lying. There were just 4 little plump goodies on the plate. But so good. 

We also got the mussels. These were  good- not great. I loved the seasoning of chiles and wine but it could have used more sauce- and they were a bit luke warm when they arrived at our table. I felt they could have  been served hotter.

Dinners all around were fantastic. Two of us (including me) had the lamb shank with lentils which was a special that night. So delicous. The meat fell off the bone and the wine/vinegar sauce was just yummy. The other two had the scallops and salmon. I tried the scallops and risotto and it was awesome lemony-goodness. None of us were disappointed.

We went with dessert...2 pot de cremes and 1 apple tart. The pot de creme was fantastic!! I didn&#39;t taste the apple tart but heard it was a bit too sweet and it was not finished. I think it was the only thing that did not get completely demolished. 

Loved this place and I bragged about my meal to my husband so much that I had to promise to take him."

Holy expensive.

But, more importantly, holy ridiculously delicious ohmygod in my mouth.

I got a glass of white wine (me? white? WTF?) called Conundrum, and a conundrum it was; I enjoyed it. A lot.

For appetizers, we had the toasted sourdough bread which came with mushrooms and egg on top (phe-nom-en-al) and mussels.

After a long debate between the chicken and pork chop entrees (I hold pork chops to the insanely high standards of my dad&#39;s cookin&#39;), I ended up opting for the latter because a friend was ordering it, and I knew I&#39;d be drooling over her plate if I didn&#39;t get it, too.

Best decision I have made in a long time.

It was so delicious, I cannot even begin to explain. The pork was perfectly cooked -- tender, not chewy, and flavourful. There were apple slices mixed in with potatoes, carrots, and brusel sprouts, and it all amounted to a plate full of heaven.

The ultimate proof of its fabulousness was that I took some to go and snacked on it at 4am (woken up by neighbors, hungry, why not?) and then had some as an &#34;appetizer&#34; with lunch the next day. Still good!

I also tried some of the dessert -- peach cobbler a la mode -- and it was great. Side note: I&#39;m not a dessert girl at all. I&#39;d be happiest if birthday cakes were made out of grilled cheese or BBQ chicken haha.

Bottom line, go! It&#39;ll nibble away at your bank account, but it&#39;s the most worthwhile splurge, if I, &#34;Picky Nicky,&#34; dare say so myself."

Though I was hoping for more festive specials, the dinners we chose were excellent. We started with two shared plates: The PEI Mussels and the Smoked Salmon &amp; Gravlax. The mussels were in a green chili broth which was flavorful and delicately spicy. It was truly an original take on mussels that did not disappoint. The salmon dish was plated perfectly offering a variety of options for dressing up the perfectly cooked smoked salmon and melt-in-your-mouth gravlax. I had the Grilled Gold Canyon Flat Iron and my boyfriend had the Half Duck entrée for dinner. Now, I&#39;m the kind of girl that likes my meat well-done which, in the world of fine dining, is a Cardinal Sin. I am usually disappointed with how the meat is prepared (either pink or tough as leather) but, at Charcoal, I was happily surprised with the flavor and texture of the Flat Iron. It was divine. The Chanterelle gravy is not be ignored, either, with a light consistency and bold flavor. As for the duck, I can only speak on the loveliness of the presentation as my boyfriend ate it all without sharing. We finished the evening with a wonderful dessert of warm apple crisp. The only smudge on the night came when a frustrated hostess had to bus several tables around our own. It was very clear how unhappy she was and, being a former hostess myself, I completely understood. The MOD, however, was not as sympathetic barely picking up even one glass while she ran around bussing and seating which left the hostess loudly sighing and muttering under her breath about the lack of assistance. It made us more than a little uncomfortable. All in all, Charcoal is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful, well-made food. We will return."

The restaurant is nice and the foot is good but I don&#39;t think it shines like a star for the price. Service was very very slow but it was a busy night but again for a higher price point is seems a bit much to wait 10 minutes for a drink. Had a shared plate and an appetizer.

And I&#39;ve eaten at A LOT of places! My mom, my daughter, and I dined here together, and we all agree that the entire experience was top-notch.  The restaurant advertises itself as &#34;modern European&#34;.  I&#39;m not sure what that means, but it is obviously something good.  

For starters, the ambiance is hip, with spare, modern furniture and fixtures; low, well placed &#34;mood&#34; lighting, and tons of fashionable patrons.  

Secondly, the service is impeccable.  Water is refilled when it should be (no empty glasses, but also no one reaching over one&#39;s shoulder every two minutes), drinks are served in the appropriate glassware, and servers are knowledgeable and friendly without being intrusive. And, oh, by the way, the wine list is expansive and wait staff know what to recommend to go with each dish.

Finally, and most importantly, there&#39;s the food.  My appetizer - bacon wrapped dates - was probably the most delicious single piece of food that I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth.  Seriously!  No, really, SERIOUSLY!!  My daughter also tried this app and had the same reaction.  She ordered truffle fries, which were also good.  The fries portion was huge, so order it to share.

For an entree, I ordered the grilled cast iron halibut, which came atop a bed of stuffed lump crab gnocchi and wilted greens.  The gnocchi were among the best I&#39;ve ever had, light as a feather and freshly made.  And the wilted greens were perfectly done, with a light, lemony dressing that popped the flavor.  But the star of the show was the halibut itself, which was so fresh it must have been swimming that morning, and which was cooked to perfection.  

My mom and daughter both ordered the pan roasted redbird chicken breast, which was also delicious.  It came with a relish that was smoky and a bit spicy and that complimented the chicken perfectly.

They tried to seat the 6 of us at one of their booths - which are very small. We walked past several tables so I requested that we be moved. I was told that they were reserved for other parties. If I had known that you had to request a table that would accommodate 6 people then I would have. They ended up pushing two 2-top tables together. Though it was still tight, it was better than the booth. The hostess - 1 star. The service was okay. We stumped our server with simple questions, the water glasses were often empty and it took about 30 minutes before our order was taken. Server - 2 stars. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates which were good and the Brussel sprouts which were excellent. For the main course I had the lamb which was very good. Portion estimate about 3.5 oz so in the small side but well prepared. Food - 4 stars. Even though the food was good, I likely won&#39;t return."

Sometimes I love the non-brunch places that offer brunch....far less crowded and often very surprising given the quality and creativity of the food.

We met friends Lane and Will here for a brunch patio double date a few weekends ago.  I went for a spinach and mushroom omelette and had fontina cheese subbed for feta (it just sounded better).  Will ordered a side of home fries and was served a bowl of regular fries, much to his dismay.  But a &#34;crisitunity&#34; came a knockin&#39;.  These were (dare I say?) the best fries I&#39;ve ever had.  I usually love the overly browned, super crispy fries that you find a few of in a batch.  Well, this was a whole bowl of them.  They were seasoned perfectly with large chunks of salt.  Yum.  My egg dish was great too with a side of nicely dressed greens.

They offer bottomless mimosas and our server was great at offering the next one before I finished the first one, making them truly bottomless.

I&#39;ll have to try dinner before I come to a final verdict on whether I really, really like this place, but brunch was a great start!"

I&#39;m sorry to slam the place, but dinner last night was not good.  Here&#39;s specifically what I thought of what I had:

Tomato Bisque -- not any better than Campbell&#39;s tomato soup out of a can and not as good as Pacific&#39;s roasted red pepper and tomato soup out of a box.

Panzanella Salad -- probably the worst panzanella salad I&#39;ve ever had.

Maine Lobster Cannelloni -- I ate it, but it wasn&#39;t very good -- a bit fishy, and all the ricotta cheese really just didn&#39;t work with the lobster.  I can make better lobster dishes at home.

Chocolate Chili Truffle -- the chili overwhelmed the chocolate.  It wasn&#39;t worth eating, and I came home and ate something good.

My husband and two friends were equally unimpressed with the exception that my husband thought his grilled pork was good.

This was an expensive dinner, and we could have had much better elsewhere.  I won&#39;t go back and risk another mediocre meal which is a shame because until last night I LOVED the place!"

True to its name, the burnt ends were delicious, as was almost everything I tasted. The smoked turkey was perfectly seasoned and a great addition to my meal. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is their free pickle/pepper bar and their array of BBQ sauces; I highly suggest you take advantage of both of these features and try as many things as you can.

There are six different sauces to choose from. I liked the Traditional Thick and Bold. The Spicy Southwest was also really good.

So- get yourself some tasty bbq and possibly a date too!
I had to try the name sake so went with the Burnt End Platter (which comes with 2 sides and on Mondays, also a drink for $9.99). I chose the spicy slaw and the pit beans. Hubs went with the 2- meat platter and had the ends as well as the brisket and chose the grits and the fries for sides. (We like to share.) The meat was fantastic. I really am no burnt end expert, but I loved them and they were juicy with crispy ends that were just perfect. The brisket was tender and with wonderful flavor as well. 
For the sides, we really loved the beans and the grits and I would definitely get the spicy slaw again too. We will definitely return for these reasons alone. 
The fries were a big disappointment. Not crispy at all and lacked flavor. Boo.
I enjoyed the Fire BBQ sauce, but it was pretty hot. However, the rest of the sauces were way too sweet. The honey bbq sauce had great flavor and I enjoyed the thick bbq sauce and southwestern as well, but the sweetness was overwhelming with no underlying kick. I had to mix one of the others with the Fire to get a nice balance.

I ordered the 2 meat/ 2 side meal. Of course, I had to try the burnt ends (namesake, they better do them right!) and the sausage. For my sides, I had the grits, did I mention they were white cheddar and delicious, and their sweet and spicy slaw (vinegar based, not mayo based which they also have on the menu).

The burnt ends were good, and I don&#39;t have much to compare them to but I did enjoy them, especially dipping them into the variety of BBQ sauces they have available- their spicy was my favorite!. The sausage was smokey, but had a texture I found strange which one of my dining mates told me was actually a good texture. I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but try it for yourself and let me know. I still ate the whole thing though so it wasn&#39;t bad, just different.

The line started quickly building right at 11:30, then got to almost out the door before slowing down a little after noon. However, the line went quickly, and it&#39;s nice that you order at the counter, then take your number where they deliver the food to you at your table; which gives you plenty of time to fill your drink, peruse the condiment bar (pickles, banana peppers, picked okra, pickled peppers and more!), and grab some sauce testers (though they have most of their sauces at the table too). 

All in all, not sure there is much that would bring me back here besides a craving for grits as there are a couple BBQ places in the surrounding area I prefer their meat over this one. But, if you&#39;re in the immediate area, this is definitely a solid option."

Yes, it is that good.
We stopped by last evening at 6:00, a Tuesday, and it wasn&#39;t very busy. 
Nice for us as we had 5 hungry people to feed.
We ordered the Bronco Platter (two actually as each platter serves 2-3) which is an assortment of meats, sides, bread, pickles and fries. 
We ordered drinks and sat down.
Yes, they have beer...a serious must when I&#39;m eating BBQ.
They bring the meal to your table with a smile...totally a nice touch.
The meat was all very, very good. 
I especially liked the pulled pork and the ribs.
And the beans...yummy. 
There is a wide variety of sauces and a condiment bar as well.
We couldn&#39;t finish all the food...leftovers I actually wanted to take home...dinner tonight.
Why not 5 stars?
The restaurant is a little bright and lacks atmosphere...but oh the food.
I will be back."

And then I discovering Roaming Buffalo last year and it blew them all out of the water. I had found amazing barbecue in Denver. 

This summer I was in Kansas City and in between sampling the classics, I tried a new place. Burnt End BBQ in Overland Park. Loved it. 5 stars. 

Then I discovered they opened a location in Greenwood Village. I immediately went. I mean the next meal that I could go I was there. Burnt end platter. Mac and Cheese with Fries. Amazing burnt ends. Awesome selection of sauces. Sides are great too. I can&#39;t wait to try the Burnt End Bowl. In fact, I can&#39;t wait to try everything.

Well they do!  Probably the best I&#39;ve had in Denver so far.  Now I don&#39;t consider myself a BBQ expert (Mexican food is a &#39;nother story tho) but these were great.  Tender. Delicious. Just enough fat. Just enough burnt.  And their sauces are good too. I like the plain old original. I had a platter with sweet n spicy Cole slaw and hand cut fries.

Ended up seeing this place on Yelp &amp; had some pretty good reviews. Their known for their &#34;burnt ends&#34; and based by the description was unsure I was interested in tasting them. They claim that their White Cheddar grits are awesome so i decided to give them a try. I get to the restaurant &amp; they share a parking lot where Tavern DTC is. The restaurant is not necessarily fast food, but you order &amp; they give you a number &amp; sit and wait for them to deliver your food. 
I hate a taste for Beef Brisket &amp; and the gal said they ran out. Bummer! I cant eat pork &amp; I was over eating chicken. The gal stated she has &#34;burnt ends&#34;, she described them to me as end of beef, slightly charred, nice juicy pieces of meat. So i said yes i will take that. My sides were the grits &amp; baked beans. They serve alcohol (beer &amp; wine) and have a BBQ sauce station and little cups to pick in choose their award winning sauces. 
I can honestly say...&#34;WOW-ZA! Those burnt ends were delightful. Im glad I gave the &#34;burnt ends&#34; a try. Nice big cuts of beef (roughly 7 pieces), the white cheddar grits are meh! Was not a fan. Lucille&#39;s has better grits. Lastly, the baked beans were under cooked &amp; not too flavorful. 
I would definitely go back for the ends &amp; try out their other sides &amp; try the corn bread. 
Great place for BBQ &amp; staff is nice and attentive."

I&#39;ll usually get a response from a loyal customer or employee when this happens so I&#39;ll try and keep it nice so I&#39;ll pick this place apart bit by bit with rating different parts on their own. Before anyone reads this and thinks I am rating this place off other BBQ joints in the area I find it important to mention I&#39;ve been to KC, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia and know good BBQ. I am rating this place by the quality of BBQ served and I am part of that 75% on Yelp that gives an honest review and I don&#39;t hold anything back.

Atmosphere *** large open space with plenty of seating, music at a good volume and temperature nice.

Customer service **** the cashier was friendly, soft spoken and apologized and offered another side when I was let down to know they were out of mac and cheese. 

Pit beans ***** congrats they got these right! Tender pieces of meat mixed in a juicy mixture of sauce and beans warmed to delight your palette with just the right amount of spices.

Meat * they will charge you a 2.50 up charge for ribs, for me ribs will make or break a place. The ribs were dry, over cooked and no flavor at all. After smothering them in BBQ sauce and I was able to eat the jerky like meat but expressed my dislike to an employee who asked how everything was. The brisket was tender but not juicy and not much flavor either, a little bit of sauce, onions and pickles fixed it right up. 

There is a good selection of beer, soft drinks, sauces and condiments. I will probably go back for the beans and hopefully Mac and cheese. Cheers!"

I ordered the chop sandwich which included burnt ends and brisket with fried onion strings on a hoagie roll. It was delicious and the potato salad side was the perfect pairing. I also thought portion sizes were very generous. I also enjoyed their Southwest BBQ sauce too!

I checked this place out when it first opened and I still feel the same way it. I really like the meats. The pulled pork, brisket, ribs and burnt ends are all pretty good. I am a fan of burnt ends in general, but before this place, I would get them from Brothers BBQ. The problem with Brothers is that theirs are normally VERY fatty, and sometimes a bit charred. There is a difference between burnt and charred. The ones at this spot are done almost perfectly........ can be a little dry, but they are pretty good. Very meaty, not fatty.

I like the Honey BBQ sauce and the Hickory Bold BBQ sauce the best. I just dont like my sauce too hot, so I have not tried the spicy. I know..... Im soft. Now, the reason for the &#34;3&#34; rating is because the sides are what I really did not enjoy here. They were not very tasty to me, surely nothing special. We tried the mac &amp; cheese, cheesy corn, cole slaw and the beans.... and they were average at best. But hey, people have different tastes. 

So when I come here, I just grab some burnt ends to go, and I am good. :)"
burnt-end-bbq-greenwood-village,Crystal I.,Wo0rRedOSEEVBJkO1sMQmg,"Lone Tree, CO",0,1,0,11,24,6it011xzlzIXycC_t0YcIg,4.0,2016-04-20,"After having multiple places be out of brisket when we call on multiple occasions, we decided next time we need a too tired dinner and we notice before 6, we&#39;ll try this place again. Tonight we did, and ordering went smoothly (except for ordering sides, I had a couple of sides that didn&#39;t make it onto the order we placed online, not sure if that&#39;s a Yelp thing or some other product they contract with. Next time I&#39;ll double check better. But nothing was sold out, so we got what were ordered this time.

We got half a pound of burnt ends, full rack of ribs, a pound of brisket and a pound of pulled pork. We also got a pint of Mac and cheese, creamy cole slaw, and baked beans (I forget what they&#39;re called). We got individual size grits, cheese corn, and baked potato salad. 

Meat first:

Pulled pork was kinda dry and kinda meh. It wasn&#39;t meaty and it wasn&#39;t smoky and it wasn&#39;t really juicy. It&#39;s not inedible, but if you&#39;re a fan of smoked meats, and have had lots of friends and great restaurant experiences, they might pale in comparison. That said, they&#39;re comparable to most BBQ places out there, these are common problems.

Brisket was sliced really thin, had no discernible fat cap, and was also really dry. It was nicely smoked, but if I had to guess, it&#39;s crutched in some manner, and slicing it thin makes it dryer, and brisket needs some fat cap to keep it juicy while cooking. Also, they line their containers with paper, which wicks moisture away from the meat. I never in my life liked brisket and this is why. And then I lived in Texas. And Portland (Podnah&#39;s!). Texas was good, but Podnah&#39;s made me a convert and is the reason I finally bought my own smoker. Once you&#39;ve had amazing brisket, you&#39;ll spend the rest of your life chasing it. 

The ribs were a little overdone and a little dry, but I prefer that to underdone. The flavor on the ribs was amazing though, so I enjoyed eating them.

The real star was the burnt ends. Traditionally, burnt ends are glazed and recooked. These aren&#39;t, they&#39;re cubed up pieces of the part of the brisket where the grain goes all wonky, and that&#39;s about it. OTOH, the burnt ends are what I was hoping for in brisket, juicy, meaty, a little fatty, and super flavorful. I think next time we&#39;ll stick to burnt ends and ribs, and maybe a little pulled pork for the kids. I devoured half our burnt ends while serving up plates. 

The sides:

The creamy cole slaw really wasn&#39;t creamy, was kinda dry, and a bit tasteless. Fair enough. I might try the other kind next time.

The Mac and cheese is a pass. NOPE. 

Everyone loved the beans, meaty, and not runny, nice and flavorful.

My younger boys and I liked the grits, they weren&#39;t the best cheese grits I&#39;ve ever had, but they were solid. If you&#39;re a fan of grits, you&#39;ll enjoy them. 

The cheesy corn.... Now that was some crack. We all wanted more. We all could have eaten a vat and skipped the meats. WOW.

But the best dish of all was the baked potato salad. OMG. We were all fighting over an individual sized serving. Next time we&#39;ll order the quart. Maybe two. And the corn. 

Cornbread is okay. Not super flavorful, the sweetness almost makes it a little bland, there&#39;s no salt or other flavor to stand up to it. And they put the containers of butter in there, so they were melted, not sure if that&#39;s by design or what. It wasn&#39;t a big deal. A nice slab of salted butter would help, but it&#39;s carbs that aren&#39;t justified by the taste.

Overall, we&#39;ll definitely be back, but order a bit more selectively. My husband picked up the order and said they were exceptionally helpful and very nice. That&#39;s always a big bonus.

All in all, it&#39;s nice to have a solid BBQ place with excellent options available."

The burnt ends are the end of brisket, and have lots of char and almost melt in your mouth. Got the Stack sandwich which has four different meats, it&#39;s fairly thick, and comes on a hoagie. Prices are reasonable. About a half dozen barbecue sauces and they&#39;re pretty full-flavored and most have some kick to them; the Fire has habanero but wasn&#39;t too hot and is fairly tasty. The cheesy grits was pretty good. Also got a sample of the chicken bean chili, and that was alright but somewhat bland. And a cookie, which is a standard chocolate chip cookie.

It&#39;s a nice corner location and there&#39;s a good amount of seating inside plus patio seating. Nicely decorated and the menu is easily read on four large LCD displays along the wait line.

While we weren&#39;t able to get everything on the platter because they had a busy day, they were happy to double our ribs &amp; pork on the platter to make up for the other items that weren&#39;t available at the time. 

Take out took about 15 minutes, really very fast, it was ready as soon as we arrived to pick our food up. It was smash city after that, the ribs were incredible, the pulled pork was so good we ran out of bread for sandwiches and it was pretty much eaten wholly as finger food after that. Seriously, If you&#39;re in Denver, and you want good ass barbeque. this is the joint."

They didn&#39;t have brisket or the honey glazed wings. I had ordered and payed for the wings, before they realized they didn&#39;t have the glaze. They offered me some more sides to make up for it. They were all very nice here. They ended up comping something, which was awesome. The food was very good. Their namesake burnt ends were pretty good, and moist. I really liked the ribsn and the Chipotle glazed wings were darned good. Give this place a try. It may not be the best bbq you have ever had, but the foodn and service were pretty darned good."

I had the two meat platter with burnt ends, ribs, baked beans, and the cheesy corn.  The burnt ends were excellent and managed to have the proper balance of smoke and crispy edges while remaining flavorful and juicy.  Nothing on my plate was slippery with grease, as is common with other BBQ spots in Denver.  At the other end of the spectrum, the meat was moist, which also stands in contrast to the dry carcass clinging to bone sometimes found at other BBQ places in Denver.

Burnt ends has an exemplary condiment bar, which features a variety of picked items and other fun stuff to accompany your meal.  The condiment bar also has a wide variety of BBQ sauces that allow you to experiment to find your favorite, or reach for that mustard-based sauce that you already know you love.

I&#39;m not interested in the sides until I&#39;ve had my fill of the main feature... smoked meat.  So really, the cheesy corn is ancillary at best.  My sides were all proper temperature, but the friend I was eating with said the mac and cheese was a bit cool, and if there is one way to ruin a processed-cheese-based mac and cheese, it&#39;s inadequate temperature...well, either that or mixing in little chunks of hotdog.

Keep it up, Burnt Ends."

When the food runner dropped our food off she had a place seating for one and when I asked for an extra fork she pointed over to the soda machine area &#34;over there.&#34; The corn bread we ordered was not fresh.

The real reason I am writing this, though, is to applaud their Catering Manager- John Diliberto. He was awesome to work with, and I would highly recommend calling him for any of your catering needs (he works with YaYa&#39;s as well, so not just BBQ!) We catered BBQ for 15 people in my office, not a small order but certainly not the biggest. John was very helpful from start to finish and helped me put together a custom order of meats and sides on just 24 hours notice. 

The real kicker to this story is that John delivered our meal during the 3/23/16 Blizzard that shut down DIA and most of the main roads throughout Denver. He had 2 different employees try to deliver it around noon, but the roads and visibility weren&#39;t fit for the smaller cars they were driving. We tried to go get it ourselves, but the roads were clogged with cars stuck everywhere. John called me after all of our failed attempts and offered to deliver it a little later in their bigger catering van when he got back from another delivery, which was perfectly okay with us. The snow was so bad that John got stuck in the parking lot at the restaurant while loading up our order. Just when it was looking like we would be without lunch due to the epic snowstorm, John found a way to get his van unstuck and our food delivered. 

His pursuit to make us happy was definitely recognized and greatly appreciated, and we will absolutely keep John and his team in mind for our next catered event. Thanks again, John!"

The verdict, pretty solid first experience.  I did the burnt ends, brisket, pork combo sandwich with onion straws and pickles.  Meat was solid, didn&#39;t need a ton of sauce and finally nice to see a BBQ joint including proper pickles for topping.  Good deal on canned beer ($1 on Fridays) with good selection.

He apologized and took the food to reheat. The manager then came over and apologized for this. She brought me new and fresh and hot BBQ that was unbelievably delicious! She also gave me a card for a discount to come back again to ensure that it would be that good again. This is great customer service and shows people who really care. I will go back mostly because the brisket was so delicious and perfectly cooked (the second time) but also because they understand that the customer is important... every customer counts!

I guess maybe we had high expectations but a BBQ joint with dry brisket and extremely gristled ribs isn&#39;t going to appeal to many folks. Wish the cooks would have looked before they sent the food out because it was visible on all three pieces of rib. Based on the makeup of the other guests while we were there I would assume we are not the only ones who would find the music choice annoying. I would describe it as Indy music-not pop or classic-just screamo whiny rock, and it was VERY loud.

I say that because the service was on point, fabulous, exactly what you&#39;d want. But, fuck, the food was boring at best. I ordered a decent sized to-go order of turkey, brisket, wings, cheese grits, mac&amp;cheese, coleslaw and cornbread. First off, the wings were fucking awesome. I had the &#34;fire&#34; wings and they did work. Well done!!! Cheese grits were pretty damn tasty also, but I was actually advised to order a different side instead.. Everything after was just boring. Mac&amp;Cheese was just shells and cheese and lukewarm. The turkey and brisket were dry and forgettable, blah even with the so-so sauces. Not bad, mind you, just so chain-style bbq at it&#39;s blandest. The sauces were alright, not great, not bad, just very okay.

Well most of you know I like BBQ. So I walked from the hotel to Burnt End BBQ. The place is in a strip mall, not to exciting. The decor is a bit sterile. The only thing that makes it a bit BBQ is the wood and metal around the condiment counter. 

The Food. Well let&#39;s say the food is great. I had the burnt ends and pulled pork. The flavor is great and bold. The bark on the Burnt Ends was perfect and you get a good portion. I also had the spicy slaw and the beans, both were very good and the smoke flavor in the beans is great. 

The quality of the food makes you think you are in some far away poodunk town in a dirty BBQ joint that&#39;s all about the food. Oh well I guess they did what they could in a strip mall. 

Hey if your in the Greenwood Village area of Denver swing in and support this great food. Tell them Mike sent you, they may wonder which Mike but tell them anyways. They will look at you a bit wierd.

1) The macaroni and cheese was not wonderful.  Cooked well, just didn&#39;t like the flavor.

Bread was so soggy I scraped the meat off and ate it with a fork.  While this was fine, it&#39;s disappointing when you are looking forward to a good bbq sandwich.

We went in on an afternoon and ordered wings and the Ol&#39; Smokey sandwich and two sides - sweet and spicy slaw and cheese grits. 

The sandwich was fair. Not a lot of meat, a little slaw and no side included. The slaw was the best part, not overdressed, but not a lot of flavor. 

The wings came out late and weren&#39;t dressed much at all. Hard to tell if they were freshly made either. Not much sauce, or if they were sauced at all. The cheese grits were good, but a little medicine-y tasting.

The total lunch bill with drinks and tip was $30 and far from worth it. I live nearby and it&#39;s a shame. I love barbecue, and this isn&#39;t great barbecue. But far worse than that, it&#39;s not a great restaurant either.

I came in on a Saturday night with a friend from out of town and my fiancé, at first the experience was good. 

One of the bartenders, who is a bit older with a ponytail and glasses, insulted my fiancé and myself. He was rude for absolutely no reason and frankly, I&#39;m quite shocked he still has a job anywhere in the hospitality industry. We left immediately after he insulted us. 

I was furious he insulted my fiancé and embarrassed not only for my party but for him. Note to the bar manager, it might be worth having a conversation with the specific gentleman and maybe your entire bar staff about how to treat customers.

It&#39;s an old establishment and the signage is great.  The signage is inside though, there is no signage to let you know the name of the bar.  The drinks are plentiful and the menu is cool.  It&#39;s simple.  I had a burger with 3 cheeses-including a cream cheese that was spicy and fried onions.  I also ordered half and half-onion rings and fries.  

What is unique is that the burger comes out in parchment paper and a massive condiment container.  The ambiance is impressive but the parking sucks balls."

We were seated by a hostess (?)  then it took someone forever to take a drink order. That someone was the busboy... who also took our food order. We watched our simple order of 2 draft beers sit up on the bar waiting for delivery for a good 10 minutes. The waitress eventually roamed over with our drinks. We got 1 order of chicken fingers and when it was delivered we then had no plates and no setups. There&#39;s no music and it&#39;s kind of brightly light, no ambiance.

I ordered a single bison medium. My son the single cheeseburger medium. The waitress, who had clearly been at this job for awhile told me I&#39;d be ordering the large combo of fries/onion rings - and she had read my mind. 

She wasn&#39;t the super friendly type. But she knew what she was doing. It also became clear she cared how we were doing and swung by often. That&#39;s good service in my book, even without the jovial banter. 

The burgers were served with this interesting condiment box. There was ketchup and mustard and small bowls of hot peppers, onions, relish and pickles. It was cool. Get your stuff though, since they come pick them up after a bit for use with other tables. 

My Brother&#39;s Bar is a winner. Perfect paired with a trip to confluence park. We came just after a little river wave surfing under the 16th street bridge. I love Colorado!"

Cheap?  Hell to the yes.  This place feels like you&#39;re stepping back in time...dark wood, dim lighting, old school menu, ancient register with no POS machine... check it out and you&#39;ll see what I mean.

Their beer list is decent, but not mind blowing given that it&#39;s Denver.  Macros and macro-micros abound.  Full bar though.  

Foodwise - they&#39;re a burger and sandwich kinda place.  Their burgers are pretty darn excellent.  The JCB (Jalapeno Cream Cheese) burger is pretty stand-out.  A high falutin&#39; burger this is not.  all burgers / sandwiches come wrapped in wax paper and a flip tray of pickles, onions, pepperoncinis, etc.  

I recommend skipping the salad and chips &amp; salsa... cheap but you get what you pay for.  

For a healthier option, go buffalo burger or chicken sandwich.

Day 82 &#34;DUSA Tour 2016&#34;

One of the oldest bars, if not THE oldest bar in Denver, it has a local&#39;s feel, but a &#34;newness&#34; look on exterior &amp; visible modern kichen area that tarnishes the &#34;oldest&#34; title ...

bartender Owen (a &#34;Run-A-Way Bill&#34; Favorite bartender) and interactive &#34;regular&#34; customers (like Rocky &amp; Gill) made my return visit a positive one 

unfortunately, bartender Charlie is too young &amp; doesn&#39;t realize how much he doesn&#39;t know yet (&amp; he most likely &#34;thinks he&#39;s good&#34;) 

my Buffalo burger was tasty-riffic! 

one great feature is there are &#34;no&#34; TV&#39;s making it a great social-interaction bar 

Interestingly, no business sign on building ... you just gotta know!

If you want to get a sense of what to expect from My Brother&#39;s Bar, check out their website. A name, a phone number, an address, and nothing else. They aren&#39;t into flash, they aren&#39;t into being everything to everyone; they know what they are, and it shows.

The menu is filled with a small, simple beer list that may bring you back to your high school/college days (Labatt Blue, anyone?). The food is standard bar fare (burgers/dogs/fries), but is some of the best in the area. The prices are very reasonable, the service is friendly, and the vibe is about as unpretentious as it gets.

I am finally getting around to writing my review for Brother&#39;s Bar, I have gone at least 5 times and in tend to keep coming back. If you live in Denver - there are so many options, so to go somewhere that many times is a big deal.

They have a simple menu and great beer options. The patty is simple and you can make your own creation with the items they bring out to you. 

The restaurant is a bit hidden but it&#39;s in a great spot in between LoHi and LoDo.

As a big fan of Cricket, I was thus very curious to find out what the competition was all about.  I finally made a special trip downtown just to try this famous eatery.

Being in the oldest bar in town is pretty nifty, but the place doesn&#39;t exactly exude charm.  If you didn&#39;t know its history, you&#39;d pretty much just think it&#39;s a standard dark, dingy bar.  I opted to sit outside since it was a beautiful day.  The patio was a nice surprise - lots of seating, nice and shady.  Unfortunately that&#39;s about where by complimentary impression ended.

I sat unattended for about ten minutes before a server stopped by and joked that I must have &#34;snuck in&#34; (nope, your host just didn&#39;t let you know she sat one of your tables, apparently).  The water I was served came in a very worn, scratched up glass and the &#34;straw&#34; was a swizzle that you couldn&#39;t really drink through.  I ordered the JCB (Jalapeno Cream cheese Burger) and a small order of combo fries/rings.  

I thought the condiment container the brought out was pretty cool, but all that was in it was two kinds of pickles (relish and chips), onions, and yellow peppers.  No lettuce, no tomatoes anywhere to be found in the box or on my burger.  The server didn&#39;t ask me how I wanted the burger cooked, which concerned me a little, but I figured &#34;leave it to the experts, right?&#34;  Unfortunately the burger could only be described as meh.  It was cooked a solid medium (I prefer rare to mid-rare) and there didn&#39;t seem to be any kind of seasoning on the meat - very bland.  There was too much cream cheese and it wasn&#39;t nearly spicy enough - I tasted a few jalapenos here and there, but it wasn&#39;t much.  It wasn&#39;t a terrible burger and was fine for the price, but given that I was going for the &#34;best burger in town&#34; I was pretty disappointed.

The rings were okay, though again very bland (no seasoning, had to add my own salt) and the fries - fat steak fries - were a bit overcooked and again, very bland and meh.

Overall, this would be a fine place to go if you live in the neighborhood and just want a cheap bite to eat, but best burger in town?  Not by a long shot.  Not even top ten, in my opinion.  My feeling upon finishing my meal was that I wasted an opportunity to eat lunch in one of the other excellent restaurants in the area."

Its a small bar, local crowd, and a small exposed kitchen - SOLID! The service, didn&#39;t fall below my expectations, didn&#39;t exceed my expectations. The food, it was good, but definitely not the best. I love how they serve the condiments and sides, I just question if they use the veggies over for each guest :-P.

Wait a minute, we&#39;re talking about a cheeseburger here, dirty birds!

My Brother&#39;s Bar has one of the best tavern burgers I&#39;ve chowed down on for a long time. And I love a good bar burger. Any cheeseburger for that matter! But there is a hierarchy of meat patties and the ones served in wax paper are probably my favorite.

When our server brought over the condiment cart and a slightly greasy packet was placed in front of me, pretty sure I groaned out loud with pleasure. A regular cheeseburger is fairly large but that didn&#39;t stop me from savoring every bite in less than 10 minutes. Onion rings and fries were the side show.

The second visit I branched out and had a hot ham &#39;n&#39; cheese sandwich. It&#39;s served on rye bread, very similar to the Reuben offered on the menu. It was good, but I ended up having burger envy. Pretty much everyone sitting around me had a burger and rightfully so! It&#39;s just that good.

Note: Beers on tap are solid and very affordable, but you don&#39;t have to have a brewski at My Brother&#39;s Bar to enjoy the food. I would gladly come back for lunch or dinner and refrain from drinking altogether. Though a cider or a beer is most welcome for a pre-game experience or a long day at the office."

$5 for a Corona?? I feel like the drinks here are over priced, as is the food. Nothing special enough to write home about.

It reminds my of my favorite dive bar in Upstate New York. It&#39;s simple, cozy, smells like old beer, and produces tasty cheap food along with a decent beer selection.

I inquired about a Belgian ale they had on tap, which my non-beer drinking server described as &#34;like Blue Moon.&#34; I went against her advice and ordered it and was pleasantly reassured on first sip that it did not in fact taste anything like Blue Moon. 

My fiance and I ordered burgers and onion rings. I love the tray they bring everything out on with all the fixings - especially the relish. The burgers come wrapped in paper just like take-out. Nothing fancy here. 

This burger brought back memories of fast food, but only the good kind. It felt very much like a guilty pleasure but not as bad for you as McD&#39;s. The onion rings really shined. I have always been on the fence about this fried food but I fell off on the &#34;yes&#34; side of the fence after trying these. The onions were so tender they easily broke with each bite, instead of sliding out of the ring on first bite like most onion rings. A winning recipe. 

I&#39;ll come back, probably once again at 1am, to satisfy my late-night food and drink cravings."

That is what my Brother&#39;s Bar does. First off the drink menu is exceptionally impressive. As a guy who likes whiskey I stood open and wallet out as I stared at their selection. But as it was mid day, and I did have to work I settled for a beer. I like that I can settle for a beer while working. Anyway.
Moving over to the food, the burger was simple. But in Simplicity is beauty. And that is exactly what My Brother&#39;s Bar does. The ingredients complimented the beef adding the perfect amount of balance and flavor. We also got the fries and onion ring mix basket. This was the only knock I have on this place, I like myself some french fries. And while their fries were good, crispy hot etc,  they were nothing exceptional. The onion rings on the other hand were quite good. If we could kick the fries up a notch this is a five-star all day long."

The bartenders are excellent - they know how to make a good drink, but they&#39;re not pretentious about it. The beer list is decent, but nothing to jump up and down about.

I have been to My Brother&#39;s Bar quite a few years back. I wasn&#39;t too impressed then, and things have not changed.

My husband and I walked in, after a long walk, so we were ready for a good burger. We opted to sit on the back patio, which I remember was quiet, enclosed, and lots of shade. This has not changed. It is still quiet and enclosed, with lots of shade, which as perfect as it was close to 90 degrees outside.

Service was ok, and very slow. The place was not crowded at all, both inside or outside, so I wasn&#39;t sure what was up.  Throughout the entire time we were there, just over 1 hour, service remained slow.  After the waitress took our order, another employee came up to us, and asked if everything was ok. My husband asked if he was a waiter, and he said no, that he was a &#34; food runner.&#34; We watched him throughout our time there, and I think he was bored. He would go inside, and come back out within 2-3 minutes, and ask each table if there was anything needed, each time he came out. The waitress was not so visible.

Our burger was brought out, wrapped in paper, like you would get at one of those fast food chains when you pick up your food at the counter, or a drive through - you know what I mean. The condiments: onions, pickles, relish, and something else (I don&#39;t remember what it was, it left that much of an impression on me), were brought out in a plastic type square container by the waitress (or the food runner, who brought out other tables&#39; food). The burger was on top of the condiment container. The waitress put the burger down on the table, with nothing under it. Granted, it was wrapped in paper, but the burger was placed directly on the table. She then handed both of us a small paper plate, and walked away. That was it, nothing else. 

I wonder how often the items inside the condiments&#39; containers are changed out? How healthy is that, if the containers and their contents are reused time and time again? I wonder. 

We did order, from the appetizer section of the small menu, the potato chips, and the nuts (we opted for peanuts). We also opted to have these before the hamburger was brought out. The waitress brought out one of those individual snack containers of peanuts, in a small glass. I joked with my husband, saying that the potato chips would also be one of those individual packages of potato chips - BINGO! I was right! Yes, these were only $1.00, but well... I don&#39;t know what to say. I really did not expect this. 

Everything about the restaurant states, &#34;easy, no clean-up, and very little overhead.&#34;  Yes, this would save money, as all the staff has to do is toss most of the items from the table, once the customer has left. The glasses were the only thing that have to be washed, at least from our time there. 

This is my opinion of My Brother&#39;s Bar. I like the patio, it was nice, as for everything else, I&#39;ll pass. I have crossed My Brother&#39;s Bar off of my list of restaurants to go back to. I figured I had to give them another chance, I did, and that&#39;s that."

A dive that let&#39;s it&#39;s old-school style speak for itself, a menu that&#39;s straight-forward and service that&#39;s efficient without trying to impress you.  You get the feeling that this is how things have always been and if it ain&#39;t broke, why fix it?

I ordered a cheeseburger, which comes with American cheese, the option of tomato and lettuce and a big plastic condiment tray to dress your burger up with pickles, peppers, ketchup, etc.  I love that they don&#39;t even ask how you want your burger then nail it at medium-rare.  I won&#39;t call it the best burger I&#39;ve ever eaten but if you&#39;re looking for something greasy, messy and absolutely delicious, this one hits the spot.

Also shared a large order of fries and onion rings, of which the latter was the star.  And they serve cheap pitchers of beer, so what more could you ask for?  This probably won&#39;t be in our regular rotation of restaurants, but the experience alone was worth going and if I&#39;m ever craving a classic greasy burger, I&#39;ll know where to go."

They had a decent whiskey selection and a good beer list. The beer prices are cheap! Love that they haven&#39;t overpriced them just because they can. Our server did not have much knowledge of the menus and even said she doesn&#39;t drink. Maybe working in a dive bar isn&#39;t such a good idea.

Anyway, the drinks from the bartender were a good pour and came out quickly. The food came out pretty quickly, too. We had the small 1/2 &amp; 1/2 which was half fries and half onion rings. Our friends had burgers and rings. All the food was gone quickly, so it must have been good for them. My fries were a bit old and chewy but I loved the onion rings. They also bring out a big tray of condiments, napkins, and utensils which always gets oohs and ahhs from newbies.

Atmosphere is cozy and divey, but they are apparently a staple of Denver and thus should not change a thing. Supposedly they play classical music, but I don&#39;t remember hearing it. This is probably because we were hanging with friends like everyone else in the place and conversation was loud. I would love to come back here. Maybe next time our server will know more about the place the booze and hash they are slinging."

As Denver&#39;s oldest bar it has a nice &#34;historic&#34; vibe. 

The burgers do not claim to be gourmet and remind me of good picnic burgers with standard grocery condiments.  Overall, a good burger but my socks weren&#39;t knocked off. The novelty of having condiments delivered to the table in a special box was fun.

Dark on the inside with a bar around the corner kind of feel with a simple menu of sandwiches, burgers and fries.

My Brother&#39;s Bar has been around since 1870 (give or take a few years).  Nothing has changed since then with the antique cash register they use to ring in orders, the chipped wooden counter tops and the rough shelves stacked with liquor bottles.  The menu is located on the top of the bar but they&#39;ll give you paper copies if that&#39;s the case.

I ordered the cheese burger with a side of fries and their O&#39;hara stout.  Stout tasted good, very smooth and went down easy.  The burger was very juicy and tender.  When they present you their burgers, they come wrapped and on top of a condiment/topping tray so you can add whatever you like to the burger.  Convenient and smart on their part.  Cheeseburger was only $6.00, definitely one of the best bargains you&#39;ll ever get.

The food was so generic, and definitely NOT house made. To start, the beer selection was sorely lacking for a Denver bar! Then we ordered chips and salsa, the chips were stale, and clearly bulk purchased, and the salsa was also store bought, tasted like Pace Picante sauce. I like Pace, but not at a restaurant. The burgers were served wrapped in wax paper, with no plates. It felt like, &#34;hurry up, eat, and leave&#34;. The burgers themselves were not house made, and tasted like frozen, reheated patties, from Costco. Very dry! I&#39;m sure there was some thought behind the way they serve their food, but I must say I was severely disappointed in the food, the atmosphere, and even the service.

Maybe because I didn&#39;t grow up in Denver, but I just wasn&#39;t impressed enough to go back.

They do earn themselves a star for having vegetarian options although I had a hard time getting a hold of one - once the server realized (after me telling her twice) that I do not eat meat they took my hamburger back and brought me a veg sandwich.

All that jalapeño cream cheese on a burger is actually heavenly. Another really cool thing about My Brother&#39;s  Bar is that they bring out a tray of add ons.

The tables are also way too tiny for then putting a box the size of a very large tacklebox on there for condiments, making it awkward to eat."

My burger at my brothers bar was maybe a step up from a $1.99 bacon double cheese burger at Burger King. This is supposed to be one of the better burgers in Denver. It&#39;s quaint and throwback, but man, it&#39;s not good food, I don&#39;t give a shit how you sell it, the food has to be good.

The similarities between My Brothers Bar and a shitty Burger King on Federal continued to surprise me. Incessant flies landing on your food were actually the least annoying parts of the evening. As our waitress completely ignored us for the better part of an hour, I got up to use the restroom only to find a man from behind the bar, apron slung across his arm relieving him self. No, shit. A man who handles food or drink pissing without the common courtesy to take his apron off first. Holy smokes. 

I could go into much worse details about the restrooms. They were just simply awful, just disgusting. What was really awful was the service. Business was slow, but the wait staff was clearly not concerned that we Were in the building. I actually debated leaving without paying at one point. I honestly don&#39;t know if anyone would have cared. After asking 3 staff members for our check because we hadn&#39;t seen our waitress I over an hour we received eye rolls and flagrant &#34;hold on&#34;&#39;s 

I&#39;m honestly sorry I paid my tab and tipped. This was bar none the worst experience I&#39;ve ever had in Denver. It was just sad on all accounts. I want to enjoy a nostalgic Denver staple, but was instead treated to a place not concerned with its future. 

Cheers MBB, with this type of performance, you&#39;ll have plenty of days off soon"

Lots of choices is always a positive.

The service was what lacked for my experience here. It took a while to get seated and then for first round drinks to arrive. It took even longer to try and hunt down our waitress and get a bill at the end of our meal. Both very frustrating time periods from a customer service standpoint. Your first and last impression of a place stand out the most. If this is Denver&#39;s oldest bar as it claims, maybe it&#39;s time to clean house on a few of the servers.

I ordered the Johnny burger single with a side of onion rings and a glass of water ( too early for a brew ). The burger was tasty topped with jalapeno cream cheese and grilled onions. The onion rings were your standard fare but good enough. 

The price for a burger is reasonable at 6.25 I think and better than many of the $11 or $ 12 burgers in Boulder county. The service was slow otherwise I would say 4 stars. I would go back for a burger and maybe a brew if it is later in the day."

It was amazing and the burgers are worth the full stomach. Fries and onion rings were nice a crisp. My beer which I could care less about at this point arrived towards the end of the meal and as tempted as I was to send it away I gulped it down so I could get out of this place.

Burger after burger has failed me. I thought I would never succeed in my quest. That is, until I found Freddy&#39;s. Oh my god, I have finally found something good enough to satisfy my cravings.

Their California burger is so good. The meat is good and juicy, and the sauce they use is pretty on point. I mean, it&#39;s honestly just a very slight notch below In-N-Out. 

The fries are what pushes them up and over the edge though. Holy heck, these guys make the best french fries. Like, can I order some french fries by the bathtub size and just have them pour it all over me and have me eat my way out because I&#39;d gladly do that. So thin and light and full of flavor. It&#39;s really the perfect french fry.

I gave her $22.03--the last of the cash in my wallet--for a $12.03 bill. It was a twenty, two ones, and three pennies. I counted it and my boyfriend counted it. The two ones were on top of the twenty, and when I handed it to her I said, &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m giving 22 so I get a ten back.&#34; She handed me my food, and then eight dollars in change back. I asked her nicely what the total of my food was and she said 12.03. I explained that I gave her 22... After her arguing with me for 5 minutes, she slapped two ones back in my hand and shoved my drink in my face. The best part of this?

The Chicago dog is surprisingly decent.  My favorite combo though is the triple cheeseburger, with cheese fries- always hits the spot, and clogs the arteries.

Being from the West Coast (Long Beach, CA)I was raised around In-n-Out, Fat Burger and many other local burger spots I know a good burger when I see and smell one...Moving on, I driven past Freddy&#39;s countless times and decided that yesterday would be the day I give them a shot. So naturally I grab my Lady and we set out to go enjoy &#34;one tasty burger&#34; or so we hoped.

We ordered two double bacon cheese burger combos &#34;Cali style&#34; . Once we got our burgers the excitement and thrill of eating a juicy and fresh hamburger became just wishful thinking. As I laid my eyes on this heap of food I became almost upset. My burger was a mess and it looked like it was prepared by dropping the ingredients onto the bun from the top of their building. Upon my initial inspection of the sandwich I asked my Lady &#34;I thought I ordered a Cali style burger (lettuce, tomato, etc)?&#34; and she replied &#34;You did&#34;. I opened up my bun to find soggy bacon and these dry,extremely thin &#34;patties&#34; laid over a small mound of wilted and pale produce. Let me talk about these patties- They look like someone deli sliced a cooked whole hamburger patty and then cooked it again. I ate the meat by itself to investigate the flavor and it wasn&#39;t appetizing. I took a bite of the whole thing I became upset that we just paid 20$ for these &#34;burgers&#34;. At 8$ and change for a combo I didn&#39;t see the value and quality.

I have never not finished a hamburger, but I wasn&#39;t gonna waste calories (yea I watch what I eat now) on this lame ass sandwich. I looked at my girl and said &#34;Baby don&#39;t eat that, lets go get a real burger&#34;. We got up and went to Fat Burger where my Hamburger craving was properly 100% satisfied.

I&#39;m from the Midwest where Steak n Shake ruled.  The one here, well my one experience  was a disappointment but I&#39;ll go back to try again. Their signature chili and great milk shakes are terrific.

Fed both my wife and I plus desserts for under $20. Can&#39;t beat that. We shared the combo with the burger and hot dog in it and it was perfect. The meat was thin and delicious. Cheese actually took up the entire space of the meat. Fries were nice and thin cut. I didn&#39;t much care for the hot dog, but my wife enjoyed it. I ordered some frozen custard for dessert and my only complaint regarding service was I asked for no whip no cherry when I ordered. I watched the girl make it with whip and cherry and just scoped it off with a spoon when she figured out she messed up. Uhm no. Make it right. The entire top was still covered with whipped cream. They also left it sitting at the counter for three minutes before announcing it was ready so by the time it got to me, it was liquidity. It did have a strange aftertaste as well. An employee mentioned they were making a new batch so maybe that was it? It had almost like a cleaner taste to it. Would definitely go back for the food, but probably not dessert."

The food continues this theme. Sure the burgers are better than McDonald&#39;s and the frozen fries are cut thinner than McDonald&#39;s but is being slightly different than McDonald&#39;s really good? From a burger and fries stand point everything about Five Guys is better. I found Freddy&#39;s burger to be dry and bland. Frozen fries are frozen fries no matter how thin they&#39;re cut. The hotdogs are ok but nothing to write home about. Maybe if for some reason in defiance of God and Man and all things Holy you decide you want a hotdog with tomatoes and celery salt on it you may be pleased with the Chicago dog at Freddy&#39;s. For those of us who believe that there are only three acceptable condiments for hotdogs (mustard, onions and stagnant cart water) don&#39;t bother with the dogs here. When it comes to dessert, I will concede that Freddy&#39;s is better than the competition and for that they get an extra star. However don&#39;t expect custard, even though it&#39;s in the name. I swear that is soft serve they&#39;re giving you. It certainly doesn&#39;t taste like frozen custard. By itself it seems that it is McDonald&#39;s soft serve. That&#39;s the Golden Arching theme of Freddy&#39;s; If you close your eyes you can almost imagine that you&#39;re at a really good McDonald&#39;s."

The first thing I noticed at the drive thru was the extensive menu of ice cream desserts and treats.  Though I wanted to try one of each of those, I ordered a single burger combo, which included the burger, fries, and my choice of a Pepsi product.

Back at home, the first thing I thought of when I unwrapped the burger was how much it reminded me of a Steak &amp; Shake burger.  The single burger was kind of small and, since I left off the cheese and onion, only mustard and pickles were included (I had to add ketchup myself).  No lettuce or tomato, unfortunately.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the bun was very soft and fresh.  I never can see the point of shoe string fries but these tasted okay and weren&#39;t too greasy.

I ended my meal with a fairly decent Oreo milkshake.  Freddy&#39;s offers 3 sizes of milkshakes - mini, regular, and large - and the regular is the same size as neighboring Chick-Fil-A&#39;s small size.  Just sayin&#39;.

I&#39;d be willing to visit Freddy&#39;s again if I&#39;m in the neighborhood, if nothing else to try an ice cream sundae or maybe even a hot dog."

Someone in the car mentioned Freddy&#39;s.  Being the foodie that I am, I chimed in a said I&#39;ve never been and off we went to check off another box for me.

First impression, another burger fast food joint.  I requested ordering advice from some friends and was encouraged to get the burger.  I opted for the California burger (double pattie) I think with all the veggies I like on a burger, lettuce, tomato, and onion, I requested no pickle.  The guy in the car said the fires were &#34;like crack&#34; and said I had to try so I did.

Everything was very yummy.  The burgers are paper thin, made from steak and the thinness cuts down on the grease factor which is nice.  I hate seeing grease dripping down my arms when I eat a burger.  The fries are good, I enjoyed their signature fry sauce, it added a nice bite.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d drive out of my way to come to Freddy&#39;s.  If I was in the area and hungry this is definitely on the list for a good and quick lunch or dinner destination.  I&#39;m a fan."

On the plus side, the staff is very nice, so I don&#39;t mind giving the one star that Yelp requires on all reviews.  Staff gets three stars, food gets a negative two."

It loses a star for minor reasons
They serve pepsi products!  Really guys?  I dislike pepsi so much I usually drink ice water even though I pay for soda..

So low and behold here is Freddy&#39;s with its big butt and a smile having me illegal turn in Aurora where the poo poos pull you over for the most minuscule offense, something to do with public coffers needing fattened up!

So we walk in, and the girls are all fixated on shakes because that&#39;s how I convinced them to come here over good times across the street. First impressions are its pretty nice, but what doesn&#39;t look nice all cleaned up trying to make a impression. From here its basically your straight forward burger joint, walk up, order, pick your poison and I tell you the menu with the pictures make these damn steak-burgers look tasty! So I am a sucker for a big butt and a smile as previously stated but now I want to know do you have substance, so I tit for tat with the lady working the register, which she was ill equipped to engage in with me. Purpose was sell me on this darn burger steaky thing, and big butt and a smile won.

So here is the thing, the #1 on the menu is the double cheese steakburger and for good reason, these steak burger things are so damn thin that you honestly think they are Steak-Ums. You can order them your way, default is with mustard and pickles I think. We ordered the combo meals they arrived after our food runner finally found us, My bad I didn&#39;t put up our number in the little number holder. the fries are skinny skinny shoestring with some seasoning salt, normally I am not a fan of this style of fries but these really weren&#39;t that bad which is a good thing because the steak burger thing even though decent enough wants enough to satisfy my appetite.

Girls were more then happy with the shakes but then again that&#39;s a lay up, ice cream aka custard and kids = smiles! Dug E Fresh&#39;s bottom line is there are better options in the area, 5 guys and even Good Times across the street.

The extra wait was probably just for fresh food, which is OK with me!

The fries are shoe string style, nice and skinny, crispy and fresh.  I kept picking at them on my way home.  The burger was a little dry.  It could have used more mayo and the bacon was paper thin and seemed like it was barely there... boo!!!  Also, another devastating factor was when I asked for a Coke, I was hit with a counter offer of Pepsi... yuck.  I got a lemonade instead (which the nice lady who took my order suggested).

Overall, pretty good.  If given the opportunity, I&#39;d probably eat here again.  I just wish they had Coke.  A Coke would have been the perfect addition to this meal!"

I dropped in for a late lunch this week...and was a little surprised that NO tables were available. Whoa, this HAS to be a good burger joint, right?!

Not exactly. The (steak) burger I had was comparable to the average Good Times burger. Or...like something I could whip up at home. I waited 15 minutes for that?  But I will say that they gave me an ample amount of shoestring fries. My burger looked small in comparison to the horde of fries engulfing my basket. But again, I felt that these were rather ordinary.

Maybe it&#39;s the novelty of this new location, yet I wasn&#39;t all that thrilled with Freddy&#39;s. I&#39;ll give them another try in a few weeks, but for now I don&#39;t see the appeal of waiting 15 minutes for an average burger.

My 9 yr old son thought the fries were the best he ever had and both he and the somewhat selective 17 yr old liked the chocolate concrete.  

My husband, the one who eats to live, not lives to eat like me liked his grilled chicken sandwich.  Service was really quick but there were several management types hovering around so I hope it doesn&#39;t go downhill after this initial opening.  I like that unlike 5 Guys and Old School Burgers -- all within a stone&#39;s throw of Havana Gardens -- they offer alternatives to just a burger.

Freddy&#39;s claim is that the burgers are made of ground up steak, so the theory goes that starting with a better base you build a better burger.  I would agree.  They make a tasty, unique burger.  Simplicity seems to be a theme at Freddy&#39;s.  The number one combo is a double cheese burger with mustard, onions and pickles.  They will add lettuce and tomato if you ask, but it&#39;s not standard.  Freddy&#39;s serves the burger in a paper lined basket along with skinny shoestring fries.  They have a well-appointed condiment area that is divided into two matching sections by a self-service soda fountain.  This great idea cuts down on the waiting and as a guest I appreciate knowing where to find everything I need before finding a table or booth.  The restaurant is staffed with friendly people and each time I&#39;ve been to Freddy&#39;s the tables were clean.  The restrooms were also clean and the sink stocked with soap and paper towels.  Attention to these important details is what sells it for the weary traveler in need of sustenance.  I have yet to try Freddy&#39;s frozen custard, as the meal I just described is plenty of food and I don&#39;t leave Freddy&#39;s feeling hungry.

I got the Cal Style combo and the wife got the regular combo. Now I will admit, I love thin cut/shoestring fries, which Freddy&#39;s gives you. Hence the 1 star. That is all that&#39;s good. The burger was smashed so much, it was like eating a meat waffer. All I tasted was bread, lots of raw onion, and grease. My wife&#39;s burger was not much better. Thin meat, over melted cheese, and half of a raw onion. As someone else posted nice building, but they should have invested more in the food.

I had the single steakburger combo, and my wife had a single cheeseburger.  The burgers were very good but the fries made the meal. Skinny shoestrings cooked to a perfect golden brown.  Hot and crispy without being crunchy, and not the least bit greasy.  It ain&#39;t easy to do those things right, and Freddy&#39;s hit it!  The portion was so large that my wife shared mine, and there were still quite a few left in the basket when we finished.

The custard we really came for did not disappoint.  We shared a turtle sundae.  Perfect amount of toppings over the best frozen custard we&#39;ve had since our last trip to the Jersey shore.  It&#39;s the real thing, not that whipped frozen artificial stuff other fast food places serve.  Rich, smooth, creamy, and only slightly sweet.  The perfect compliment to the toppings.

A lot of items on their already-small menu were not available. So plan to be here a long time because the server will have to walk back and forth between the kitchen and your table to check if something you want is available on their menu (if it&#39;s not, then you pick a 2nd choice, the back and forth happens again, and that choice is still not available...) Also, good luck waiting for your check, we probably spent almost an hour when we first requested the check till we&#39;re done paying. There was a party that night, but I heard the place isn&#39;t open unless for big parties? And you need a reservation.

What&#39;s the hurry to pay and leave, you ask? Because live music starts at 8, while it&#39;s great to have that kind of entertainment (people from the party got up to stage and danced!) as part of your meal for free, the bass is super loud and every beat pounds my heart and rings my ear. A lot of the times, it&#39;s great music if they&#39;ll only learn to TONE IT DOWN!!!

How was the food? Not bad actually! We started with some salad and bread, mom ordered Russian beer, I sneaked a sip and it&#39;s very good. Not dark but refreshing and still tastes like beer! So was the salad, it was very fresh and crunchy. A bit oily but the spices used made it not greasy. The bread is nothing to write home about, it was cold and served with pre-wrapped butter slices. A few of the items we wanted were not available (including Russian Dumplings and Lula Kabobs) so we ended up with:

Salmon Kabobs and regular Beef Kabobs - both were on the dry side and required some teeth strength. I prefer the latter because it was really beefy, and as promised by the server, the beef was fresh, with good aroma of spices. But different from regular kabobs (and from their own menu pictures!), these were neither skewered nor staggered with grilled vegetables. The pork ribs were similar tasting, with big bones and lots of over-charred area, you ended up with just bits of meat. All of these grilled specialties were served on top of a tortilla style flat bread, I forgot what it&#39;s called but it looked much bigger (and perhaps thinner) than a Mexican tortilla, with the corners folded in. Instead of rice or French fries as sides (which is what&#39;s listed on the menu!) we were given Garlic-Roasted Potato Wedges. Good thing these turned out pretty good, but all five plates having the same sides? Sigh...

The best, and quite different, dish was the Beef Stroganoff. The creamy mushroom sauce was spot on and great for dipping the flat bread in. Not to our surprise, the same potato wedges were there but at least smothered with the yummy sauce (was that supposed to replace pasta which is the normal carb in stroganoff?) What&#39;s interesting is the beef pieces were so small that you had to look for them!

We had a theory: since there was a big party, perhaps we were served with some of the batch cooked food. We know that&#39;s the case for dessert as our server pretty much told us she&#39;ll get us some of the party desserts. Hopefully my friend didn&#39;t end up being charged for it (since we asked for ice cream from their dessert menu and again, were told they didn&#39;t have any), they were these square cakelets found in Chinese buffets to which they added some whipped cream, pathetic. Hopefully my friend&#39;s husband&#39;s Turkish coffee was satisfying. It was $2.99 without refill, I mean come on, it&#39;s just brewed coffee!!!

I hope my friends don&#39;t end up seeing my review, lol. It was nice of them to treat us out, too bad it didn&#39;t work out for the better..."

I called on Sunday to find out their brunch hours and once again they are &#34;closed for a private party&#34;. I don&#39;t know why they bother advertising that they are open to the public when they rarely if ever are. I&#39;m starting to agree with my partner that this place seems like some kind of front for an illicit business in the back. Maybe THAT&#39;S why it&#39;s called &#34;Mirage&#34;!

I have a feeling this will become one of my favorite places to eat for as long as they&#39;re open.  Not only is it inexpensive, but the quality is really top notch and the food is yummylicious.  

I started with the shrimp scampi appetizer.  It&#39;s made with a good amount of juicy, succulent shrimp sitting in a bath of butter and seasonings.  I love butter!  I love shrimp!  I almost died from happiness just eating this damn appetizer.  For dinner, I ordered the rib eye steak and lobster tail with veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.  I wasn&#39;t expecting much for the price of $25.  However, it was a huge portion of well-marbled steak, a good size lobster tail, and a giant dollop of mashed potatoes.  Now, I tend to piss people off by putting ketchup on my steaks.  This would be the first time in a very long time that I didn&#39;t feel the need to.  That&#39;s saying a lot about the seasoning and quality of this steak.

Dessert was a gluttonous moment for me since I&#39;ve been on a low-carb diet.  That diet went out the window when I ordered the tiramisu and the triple mousse.  Both desserts were presented nicely and tasted absolutely sinful.     

This restaurant doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, but the decor makes you feel like you&#39;re about to attend a wedding.  It&#39;s kind of nice eating in a fancy shmancily decorated place.  There&#39;s a dance floor and everything in here.  It&#39;s also roomy as heck.  

The service was a good and our server was very nice. He did disappear a few times, but he was the only server there.  The bathroom could use some updating.  There is ample parking here so bringing large parties shouldn&#39;t be an issue.

Overall, I love this place and am looking forward to my next visit!  If this place was located near my neighborhood, I&#39;d probably be here everyday, totally overeating, and I&#39;d turn into a big, fat lard."

I think it is VERY simple. Their service needs to improve, it seems as if they run on a skeleton crew and don&#39;t staff according to the business needs. Both of the times I was there the poor waiter was running around this big a$$ restaurant like a track star. Yes, he was making his fair share of gratuities, however; the experience for the customer suffered. The first time I was there I got the wrong order and I let them know, and they fixed it IMMEDIATELY and without question. 

As far as the food goes, they give you some generous portions. I am a big boy and each of the two times I have been there I had to take food home. 

Another thing to be aware of, don&#39;t expect the place to be open during regular business hours. Sometimes I will drive by and it will look like a ghost town and nobody is there and other times it looks like 1/3 of Aurora is in the place. 

Consistency is what they need in this place. They have a great location and a good looking building now they just need to live up to the expectations."

mirage-steak-and-seafood-aurora,Russ S.,stq-Pgkr_Y9rvnhB8y3gZA,"Aurora, CO",0,1,0,22,1,uGy82yRrdH-2c7vUbmRTPA,4.0,2012-05-07,"My partner and I just happened upon this place en route to another restaurant and decided to try it instead, since they&#39;d only been open for a week or two.  This particular location has been several different restaurants over the years; all have never been able to make a go of it long-term.

The restaurant is HUGE, with a large bar on one side, a dance floor and stage, and wonderful picture windows everywhere...the kind of location that you might think would be a good place for an event center for wedding receptions, quincineras, etc.  All had been freshly painted, nice tapestries surrounding the windows, nice linens and plates, glassware, etc.  It also somehow seemed as if we&#39;d been magically transported back in time to a nice supper club that my parents would have loved back in 1974, but in a good way, mainly due to the goodhearted vibe thrown off by their close-knit staff.

Advertised as a steak and seafood restaurant, the majority of the menu is steak and seafood, as well as a lamb shank, trout, with a few Russian/Eastern European specialties thrown in, including Beef Stroganoff and some pasta dishes.  Prices unbelievably low right now on their menu for all dishes, with all entrees including a soup starter and HUGE portions.

We weren&#39;t expecting much, but like to try new neighborhood locally-owned places when they open...we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of everything we tried, and we did try quite a bit.

I started out with a Russian beer and ordered a scampi appetizer, which was very good, lightly seasoned with fresh herbs, lemon and garlic (maybe a bit light on salt, but you can always add it tableside.)  My partner ordered a lentil soup and I opted for borscht for our soups, both of which, by the way, were soooo good, freshly seasoned with just the right amounts of fresh herbs to accompany the soup stocks and main soup ingredients.  The warm baguette bread slices provided tableside included a wonderful whipped butter with fresh basil and maybe a bit of olive oil all whipped together; we had to have more.

Our entrees arrived:  I had a ribeye steak and lobster tail with whipped garlic cheese potatoes inside of a baked potato skin and steamed veggie medley (for $22!) and the partner had their beef stroganoff ($12.)  I have never seen such large portions, especially at the menu prices, including a soup.  This ribeye must have been 16 oz. with an excellently prepared lobster tail with garlic butter for dipping.  The steak was very tender and perfectly cooked to my specifications.  I tried my dining partner&#39;s stroganoff...and it was really good, good enough that I had to pour a bit of it on top of my steak.

About half-way through our dinners, our server, Jose offered us each a complimentary fruit-infused vodka, made on site, so we took him up on it.  Yum...but quite strong.  I finished every bite of everything, my partner not able to finish the huge beef stroganoff entree, so we boxed it up and told Jose to bring us what ever dessert he though we&#39;d like.  He came back with a tiramisu, pretty good (very fresh and creamy) but not the best I&#39;ve had.

For 2 large Russian beers, two infused vodkas, scampi, two wonderful soups, 16 oz, ribeye, lobster tail, beef stroganoff and sides, including tax, our bill was $48!  Unheard of, and they&#39;ll surely close if they don&#39;t re-think their portion sizes and menu pricing...but who am I to refuse such a low dinner bill?

We spoke with several other employees (family members) during our dinner, and everyone was as sweet as pie and genuinely grateful that we&#39;d stopped in.  As I said before, I love to try new neighborhood locally-owned places when they open, and continue supporting them when they&#39;re good.  I&#39;m putting my money where my mouth is and will frequent Mirage whenever possible."

First of all the manager or owner or whoever was very rude! They had another party there who was also rude. We had 10 people per table which they didn&#39;t even give enough food to go around at 30 a head which is ridiculous. The food was ok but they forgot the salad. Instead of using a knife the waitress grabbed handfulls of cake and ruined it. They didn&#39;t tell us they tripple booked us. When we got there in the morning to set up it was extremely dirty and the manger yelled at my mother in law to clean up the place. We wasted $4000 on that place.

However, I was told that the restaurant was closed for a private party (funeral). I was also told, &#34;And we won&#39;t be open Friday or Saturday night either due to private parties&#34;.

It seems to me that these people don&#39;t really want to be a restaurant, as much as an event center.

I will never go back."

Now for the longer version:  There were 2 of us out for Dinner.  Since this place was new and we love a good steak dinner we decided to give this a try.  We had been to this location when it was an Italian Restaurant.  At any rate, we entered the building and noticed the same decor as 2 restaurants ago....not a good sign!  They were not busy at all...just 3 tables of 2.  Our seater sat us at a table that was so wobbly that it was about to fall off its pedestal!  So we moved ourselves to a table that wasn&#39;t so bad as it wasn&#39;t like any of the others were being used!  After maybe 10 minutes the original seater came back and asked if anyone had been by yet to take any orders.  Since no one had been he decided he would take the order.  We ordered the cheese sticks as the appetizer.....oops...shouldn&#39;t have done that!  They came out cold!  But it gets better......we told the now seater/waiter that they were undercooked.....he takes them back to the kitchen...a few minutes later he returns with the plate...now remember we had to have each bitten into one to know they were cold....what comes back to the table is the bitten ones, along with the others that we hadn&#39;t touched....they now looked as if they had exploded....of course they were hot......they microwaved them until the cheese exploded!!!  The ones we had originally bitten into had only the shell left...the cheese...I hate to say must still be in the microwave!  The taste....HORRIBLE!  The salads now come out.....but they forgot to drain the water from the lettuce when they washed it ad he lettuce was swimming in water!  Now dinner arrives......The Rib eye was EXTREMELY fatty and slightly undercooked....enough that it was medium rare instead of medium....The taste of the meat (when you could find some) was great!  Along with the rib eye was rice and the baked potato skin stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes.  This could have been very very good...but instead of making this fresh...they microwaved it into the 22nd century!
The rice was bland....The other dinner was the filet.....what a disaster!  It was undercooked, the baked potato was huge...but they forgot to heat it back up from the day before!  When this was brought up to the seater/waiter he took it back to the kitchen. Instead of someone coming to the table to apologize and see if there was anything they could do...the staff chose to have everyone walk by the curtain that is separating the kitchen from the dining area to stick their heads out  to see who had complained .  A simple visit from the manager or owner would have at least smoothed the situation over.. Then the server was to scared to come back      so we had to get up to find him to pay for what we ate.. Not good. This is why Aurora has so many chains that do much better. It would be nice if the mom and pop shops could get it right in this city..."

We started  off with chips and salsa. The salsa has a kick to it. I like it!! Chips were good and plentiful too.

I had a deluxe bean and chicharron burrito. It was about $6 and well worth it. See pic. Just the right amount of chicharrones, so there was a little crunch in every bite.

I had some sopapillas too. They are pretty small, but they are good. Get some and you&#39;ll be happy about it, but get plenty, because like I said, they are smaller than what I usually get at restaurants that make them.

I was there on Christmas eve. The restaurant itself wasn&#39;t super busy, but the kitchen and staff were super busy filling Christmas tamale orders. We took home an order of tamales as well, as we have in the past. These guys make a mighty fine tamale I tell ya!

The service was pretty slow on the day we went, but I think it&#39;s because they were so busy filling to go Christmas orders.

They have an extensive menu. You can even get non-Mexican food items like burgers, and breakfast items like pancakes, steak and eggs, etc.

They also have a full bar, so margarita yourselves away! 

The prices are very reasonable too. I will make this place a regular stop whenever I&#39;m back in town. 

It&#39;s the best Mexican food I&#39;ve found in a long time. I&#39;m from Los Angeles, and I wish they had this kind of Mexican food there!"

I waited up front for 10 minutes to be seated while the waitresses were tallying up their bills. One dropped the menus on the floor and no one picked them up,  just walked around them.

I loath giving anyplace a bad review. Here&#39;s an exception. 

Both times I&#39;ve come here, I waited almost ten minutes to order. First time was at 11:45 am. Waited to place a lunch to go order at their &#34;bar&#34; in the entrance area. Never got to place my order and left. Tonight, my family waited over ten minutes after ordering margaritas. Never got them or saw a server to order food. Their salsa was spicy tomato sauce that tasted more Italian than Mexican. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go back. 

Asked to pay for the two kids drinks we did get. They took another five minutes to charge me $3.50 for the two kids drinks after three people asked what we needed. Good service would have suggested they comp us the two kids drinks. Clearly I did not tip. They won&#39;t get any more of my money. 

One star because I can&#39;t review their food. This review is based entirely on service, or lack thereof."

I love authentic mexican food and this sated my appetite. I ordered shrimp fajitas and my friend ordered tacos adobada. The taco meat on hers was tender and so flavorful. My fajitas were generously heaped with shrimp, however I think there wasn&#39;t enough onion. The house salsa was delicious too. I couldn&#39;t stop snacking! Everything came piping hot, our servers were extremely professional and attentive, and I was really impressed with this restaurant. 

I think the only reasons I take away a star are these: when ordering my fajitas, I was not asked if I wanted corn or flour tortillas and it didn&#39;t occur to me to request the mini corn 6&#34; tortillas. Instead I was given two burrito sized 10&#34; flour tortillas, which I&#39;m not crazy about but that was partially my bad. Also, the rice was dry and very flavorless. The refried beans seemed mediocre at best.

The guacamole helping on my sides dish was very generous (I LOOOOOVE guacamole) and I specially ordered my fajitas with jalapeño because I love spicy, and that was accommodated which I was happy to see. 

I will definitely be returning here. I will be more careful when I order but I am very happy my friend recommended this place to me!"

We used to go to the original one on Peoria but moved to this one when they opened. Their &#34;gravy like green chili&#34; is the BEST. Everything is good here but our favorites are the Steak Ranchero plate or the Steak Ranchero burrito. My Mom loves the steak fajitas. The family that owns the place are very friendly and you feel like they really want your business. And before leaving don&#39;t forget to take a pint of that fabulous chili home with you.
Also cheap margs during happy hour.
Don&#39;t miss out on this GEM. You will be a regular for sure."

Unfortunately what we&#39;ve noticed is that disappointingly, although the recipes are still the same and taste good, the prices have -increased- and the portions have -grossly DECREASED-.  We&#39;ve been continually disappointed and have pushed El Lucerito aside for much more favored restaurants like our now favorite &#39;Tequila&#39;s&#39; (Havana &amp; Yale in Aurora), and Casa Vallarta (Parker &amp; Quincy in Aurora).

As I ate my Huevos Rancheros this morning I was thinking, &#34;This isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s as if my Midwestern grandma was trying to make me a Mexican breakfast.&#34; I&#39;ve never before encountered a Huevos dish that wasn&#39;t drowning in green chili - here, they gave me such a small amount splashed neatly over my eggs that I had to order an extra side of it so that I didn&#39;t have to eat my tortillas dry. Everything had a good flavor but was far more mild than I&#39;m accustomed to (and that includes the breakfast burritos at Good Times!) I was at least happy to see that the green chili was the neon orange gravy kind that is somehow so much yummier than the purportedly &#34;better&#34; stuff that everyone&#39;s switching over to these days!

Looking around the place, my suspicions were confirmed: I was the only person under 55 in there than was not part of the waitstaff, and most of the breakfast crowd looked to be ok the same &#34;perm and roller set&#34; crowd that my grandma belongs to. 

That being said, aside from having the gall to charge me extra for some undercooked and colorless diced potatoes that look like they came straight out of a frozen bag, the food was okay.  Not bad, just not for me."

With that said it&#39;s all about the food and their food is delicious. Mexican in the Denver area is a thing all to itself and El Lucerito manages it perfectly. Their hot green chili is on point. Hot, yet flavorful and vegetarian if that&#39;s your thing (the milder flavors have meat). I also love their crispy rellanos. Hot and gooey and drowning in green chili, they&#39;re ridiculous. 

This time around I was able to check out their breakfast burritos as well. We ordered a variety to-go with a quart of chili (seriously) and everyone was pleased. The best part is now I have excess chili to use up!"

If you want  fresh chips they have homemade on menu...can&#39;t really say which item is better-depends on you.  The green chili (mild, hot or mixed) is always good.  Specials of the day really help the budget especially if you like Margaritas...gave them up years ago because most are nasty mixes...these are good and taste fresh.  Portions are more than adequate.

From baja seafood on the western coast, to a more classic Sonoran style recipes more inland. When we moved to Denver we thought we had discovered a hidden gem with El Lucerito. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not the case. When asked to purchase a 4.75 Carne Asada burrito with extra meat the price sky rocketed to over 11.00 . When the bag of ingredients was given, I was shocked to discover a had full of meat, a pinch of cheese, and a single fajita sized tortilla served in a Styrofoam box. Essentially, what was given was a fajita style beef taco. Charged over twice the menu price of a &#34;burrito &#34; and receiving the equivalent of a couple street tacos, I thanked the girl behind the counter for her time and left the food there. I didn&#39;t bother asking for my money back, for I get the feeling they&#39;re hurting for money and customers. Hopefully, they will soon discover the meaning of quality, honesty, and integrity."

The last time that I came here , it was 3 of us and we were seated upstairs. I was pleasantly surprised because I hadn&#39;t ever been upstairs before. It&#39;s cozy and has a bar area too. We came for HH and we came hungry! Their HH is from 3-6pm Daily. We started off with the Arugula and prosciutto salad, then we continued with the pan seared pork belly, Clams, Shrimp and mussels arrabiata, mini cajun pasta and the Pepperoni pizza. Needless to say, we were ready to grub. The salad is fresh and simple, and who doesn&#39;t love prosciutto?? the pan seared pork belly was my favorite dish though. I thought it was going to be small and the 3 of us would have one bite, but it was a rather large portion that was more than enough. The pork was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The pork was on top of some soft mashed potatoes and roasted garlic pan jus. The flavors complimented the pork very well. The Arrabiata had a very flavorful sauce with perfectly cooked noodles and seafood (perfectly cooked seafood is absolutely key to me or the dish is ruined when you&#39;re chewing on a clam for 2 minutes). The cajun pasta has quite the kick to it, but great cajun flavor. The pizza isn&#39;t just a personal sized pizza, it definitely could feed me for at least 2 meals. We did not have any room for dessert after our delicious feast, but it was a very satisfying meal. 

If anyone wants to come here for HH and needs a sidekick, just message me a date and time and I&#39;ll be there."

We live in Aurora and he wanted to try a new restaurant and called me to ask if I wanted to give it a go. I said I was up for the adventure. He had made reservations (and I would highly suggest you do so before you go) for 6:00pm. The parking behind the restaurant is limited but we found parking on the street. 

It&#39;s on the corner of 12th and Elizabeth and a great find. Most of the patrons live in the neighborhood and had walked from their homes or apartments. I love the fact that the servers obviously know most of the people coming and going as there was a lot of hugging hellos and hugging good-byes. There were families with kids, couples dining with friends, and everything in between. 

The bread. This delightful carb could be a meal in and of itself. It&#39;s served hot and the outside is crusty and the inside soft. It&#39;s served with a balsamic sauce--there&#39;s garlic and some herbs and it is very tasty on the hot bread.

Our waiter made us feel at home right away and suggested several wine choices and talked about the specials and what was on the menu. The food was great. Period. We had the Caprese salad which was delightfully presented and had good portions of mozzarella and tomatoes and basil and balsamic.

My husband ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese with a meatball and the Bolognese sauce and the meatball was the closest I have come to my grandmother&#39;s (who&#39;s from Sicily). I ordered the Duo Shells over the lasagna (as I am ordering that the next time). I ate 2 of the four shells as they were quite generous in their portions and took the other 2 home for lunch the next day.

One of the things I loved seeing was that the owner, George Pappas, was overseeing the kitchen, helping to deliver food, and going table-to-table to talk with people and generally having a great time in this wonderful place of hospitality he has created. We didn&#39;t get a chance to meet him, but our server grabbed us a card at the bar so we could put it in our book &#34;places we need to go back to&#34;.

Dessert. Let me just say that when your server tells you to order the Bread Pudding (with no raisons), just do it. I am not a big fan of bread pudding, but this dessert was truly magical. My husband was not happy he had to share with me (as my own dessert paled in comparison and I wound up boxing 3/4&#39;s of it to take home). 

We had a good time talking with and discussing our neighboring tables food choices. One couple had ordered the mozzarella sticks for appetizers (they were huge) and told us it&#39;s one of their favorite things on the menu. Another table had ordered a pizza, calzones and the shells and raved about the food.

My husband and I were still talking about the experience this morning on our walk and ran into our neighbors who we invited to come next Saturday with us (I really want to try the lasagna--although we heard the salmon picatta is to die for).  Come early and make reservations--it&#39;s a great find in a great location."

It was pretty good Italian food. The service was average, and they were out of bread for the first 40 min that we were there, but the atmosphere and good company made up for that. Prices were average, and the quaintness of the restaurant made for a more intimate atmosphere. I had the clams, which was tossed with linguine in a white wine sauce. It&#39;s pretty hard to mess up, and it was really good. My boyfriend got chicken parm because they were out of his favorite, lasagna, and he had no complaints about his food.

It always seemed like a fancy date night type of place so I decided to give it a try for brunch were the crowd is much more laid back and casual.

Sat at the bar and the bartender was quick to provide service and take my order. While I already love chicken and waffles as a brunch meal, the staff  recommended this dish to me before I even had a chance to check the menu! Deciding that sounded delicious and made my decision making much easier, I went ahead and ordered the chicken and waffle as my meal. The chicken and waffles was indeed delicious as previous reviewers have mentioned. The chicken was great and crispy and the waffle was not soggy (well until I doused it with maple syrup...). In all, great brunch spot in the neighborhood. I definitely would like to try their pastas either another time for brunch or for an evening meal."

I was at first a little skeptical because it sounded more Italian, and I was definitely feeling brunch food. I went with the flow, we got there and I looked at the menu, confused... I couldn&#39;t decide because not only did everything sound good, all of the other people&#39;s food who had already ordered looked fantastic. I ended up getting the huevos rancheros, one of my favorite things to order while dining out... This was BY FAR the best huevos rancheros I have ever had. It came with a jalepeno elk sausage that was absolutely delicious. I enjoyed everything about our experience, from the food, company and carafes of mimosas we enjoyed on the patio. I liked it so much, I ended up taking my mom there for her birthday a couple weeks later. My mom ordered the heuvos rancheros and I had the dish with arepa. My mom is super picky about her green chili (only because she makes the best) and she said this was the best green chili she has ever had at a restaurant.

Tucked right on the corner of 12th and Elizabeth, this restaurant is so conveniently located that it seems like a crime not to pop over every once in a while when I&#39;m in the mood for Italian food.

The restaurant itself is quite small, but the ample outdoor seating makes it a bit easier to get a seat when the weather is nice. There&#39;s also a rooftop area, but I&#39;ve never been up there before and heard it might be reserved for private events (but don&#39;t take my word on this). That being said, I will never come here without making a reservation first--it tends to fill up quickly and I&#39;ve seen people wait for the entire duration of our meal without being seated.

But the food is so darn good that it is worth it. Dishes are priced fairly and come in massive portions--I&#39;ve never left without a to-go box in hand. And be sure to ask about their specials! More often then not, I&#39;ll ignore the menu completely and go with one of the dishes they&#39;ve cooked up specifically for that evening. Their wine and cocktail menu is also a delight and I&#39;m always satisfied with my beverage choice.

Service tends to be hit or miss. There are times when the service is impeccable and others when waitstaff can&#39;t get us out the door fast enough. Still, it&#39;s worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area."

Basically they didn&#39;t honor this Groupon which is a slap in the face. 
Clearly they lack integrity here and it&#39;s insulting for prospective new patrons."

The service is efficient, but it&#39;s busy so if you want to eat inside make a reservation. Tonight we started with fried mozzarella, I got the Cajun pasta. Didn&#39;t eat the fried chicken on top but the rest was amazing! Husband had the ravioli special with shrimp and crawfish he says it was flipping good! Boys chowed on their ravioli and meatball. Finished with flourless chocolate cake - my absolute favorite and a rare find on a menu. We will be back next year!"

Shells &amp; Sauce has got a great neighborhood vibe. It&#39;s been around forever and has a large dedicated clientele. It deserves its good fortune. The atmosphere is (as The Donald would say) &#34;high energy&#34; and that&#39;s a good thing. The servers are wonderful, helpful, sweet yet efficient, and professional.

The food is good to very good. One might even say it&#39;s &#34;A-OK.&#34; My honey would give the place 4 stars. She&#39;s truly a fan. Unfortunately, she&#39;s not writing this review. I am. And I think it&#39;s A-OK. Certainly a place to which I look forward to returning because it&#39;s fun, the folks are great and the food is, as I&#39;ve said . . . A-OK.

Our Caesar salad was better than A-OK. I was a fan. The wine pours were generous and very reasonably priced (I had a glass of their Valpolicella and my honey had the Coppela Pinot Noir). They get a woohoo for their wine list given the great value / $. So I can hear you asking with a hint of incredulity in your voice, &#34;Why&#39;d ya give this place just 3 stars?&#34;

&#39;Cause the entrees were A-OK. That&#39;s why.  I had the Chicken Marsala. Couldn&#39;t taste the Marsala. I&#39;m sure it must have been there but I didn&#39;t have a cold and I couldn&#39;t taste it at all. Unfortunate. Not bad. Just unfortunate. My other half had the panko&#39;ed trout with shrimp and scallops. I thought it was . . . (you guessed it . . .) A-OK.

On the other hand, their Frangelico whipped cream flourless choc torte with strawberries was absolutely 5 stars, but just because someone on the team hits a noone-on-bases homerun doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to win. S&amp;S hit a couple of those the other night, and it&#39;s not that they lost, it&#39;s just that the performance as a whole was . . .  A-OK . . . and ya know what . . . there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.

Sign me,
David &#34;Rockies Fan&#34; (&#39;cause they&#39;re A-OK, too) M."

I was thoroughly impressed with our food here. My friend brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Our table was upstairs with a view of the neighborhood. I&#39;m so happy my friend made reservations because the place was packed. 

I ordered the house Riesling. I wasn&#39;t to impressed, but I didn&#39;t want to send it back as the rest of my party already ordered drinks and appetizers. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s crab cake and it was delicious. I ordered the mussels. They were cooked well but I didn&#39;t care for the sauce. I know it sounds like I wasn&#39;t that happy but the experience gets better from here. 

I don&#39;t really want to fault our server too much because there was a serious language barrier. I think if that wasn&#39;t the case, it would&#39;ve been easier to communicate with her. We had the pleasure of meeting the GM and he was WONDERFUL. 

I ordered the salmon/pasta dish. My salmon was cooked perfectly and the pasta was super fresh. I loved the sauce on this dish. My friends said all their dishes were delicious. We got many different desserts. Can I tell you that the Cheesecake was bomb! It was so fluffy, it looked like red-whip was the filling. Even if you don&#39;t eat, be sure to go there just for that. 

All in all, I had a wonderful time and I can&#39;t wait to go back."

-Book a reservation on Open Table. There were tons of people waiting and we just strolled in and were seated automatically. Just do it.
-Pass on the Vesuvio skillet. I was stoked to see this on the menu because I loose Chicken Vesuvio but it was pretty lackluster
-Order the Chicken and Waffles, even if it&#39;s just to share. Every table other than ours had chicken and waffles and I instantly had food envy. I had the crab cake benedict and it was pretty damn amazing but am still sad I didn&#39;t try the chicken and waffles.
-Bring earplugs. Seriously. It was so loud in there, I&#39;m not ready to admit I&#39;m getting older so I will keep it at it&#39;s the environment thats loud!

We came for our 5th anniversary on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was packed!  We didn&#39;t have to wait long for an outside table, probably like 3-5 mins.  We had an amazing server, his name was Jaime/Jamie (sp?)  Really funny guy.  You know how sometimes you just connect with people?  I felt that from our server.  

First off I&#39;d like to say that their bread is probably one of the best bread I&#39;ve ever had at an Italian place.  Toasty, warm, well-seasoned and super soft/moist on the inside.  The sauce was perfection, I love anything balsamic so it really hits home.  I would go back for the bread alone.  Another server was so considerate, he walked by and said to be careful with the bread dipping going through the patio table grates.  I was very appreciative of that, as my bf always gets food on his clothes.... :)

We ordered a bottle of Rose, delicious and dry, just how I like it.  It was perfect for the summer.  I ordered the Creamy Piccata with Salmon w a side chopped salad and he ordered the Filet Tip Stronganoff w a side of Caesar salad.  The Filet Tip Stronganoff is definitely a manly meal, filling and a good size portion.  Flavor was great and creamy for sure!  I wish I had more pasta in my creamy piccta cuz the pasta was literally 2 bites, but the salmon made up for it, and it was pan fried to perfection.  

The chopped salad had a really good tangy flavor but I thought the dressing was a bit much, however, the Caesar salad was super delicious, with an anchovy on top.  

There were some customers that were seated after us in the next table, they were seated probably 15 mins after us, ordered and got their food before us.  Before I even had a chance to waive down Jamie, I saw him looking at the other table and went back to the kitchen to get our food.  He cracked a joke saying that he went and yelled at someone for us, I sure hope he didn&#39;t, but it was very attentive of him to notice when they were super packed. I highly recommend this place, great atmosphere, great food, great/amazing service... everything I&#39;d look for for our anniversary dinner.  

Thank you Shells and Sauce, it was so nice to meet you.  You bet we will be back with friends and family... or just us alone so we can have more of that delicious bread!"

We had the truffle mac and cheese to start and it was not all the cheesy.  I assume the thinking was to accentuate the truffle flavor but the sauce made me think more of a bland alfredo than &#34;mac and cheese&#34;.  At least the truffle flavor was not overpowering: a common issue when the flavor comes from oil and not shaved truffles.  

That said, I really liked the jalapeno elk sausage.  It was flavorful and and the pasta really balanced it out.  The upstairs seating is beautiful an a cool spring day!

Also the cocktails were good if not excellent.  I think I may have to try this place again to sample more of the food, but for now I&#39;m, a happy customer, well on my way to becoming a fan!"

Food: very good Italian. I love that they mix it up with the daily specials. Even the brunch (if not entirely Italian) I delicious. 

Wine: great list, with a nice range of good values to the wines to splurge on.

Service: Always friendly and prompt. 

Ambiance: It&#39;s a romantic, cozy space with a cute little bar.

And they take reservations! I&#39;m so over pretentious places that can&#39;t be bothered to help their guests out by taking reservations. On principle, I refuse to wait more than 20 minutes at a wine or Italian or pizza joint (I&#39;m looking at you, Hops and Pie) that is too cool to not make me wait around forever."

Food was delicious - I had the Vesuvius skillet and I found it difficult to finish the whole thing. I don&#39;t normally have this problem. I recommend the biscuits and gravy and the marinara, though, I&#39;m not much of a green chili fan.

This is, and forever will be one of my favorite places for several reasons.  Their happy hour rocks. Their food is so yummy, and it&#39;s an awesome brunch spot. 

It is a cozy, lovely little place. It has a full bar, and plenty of tables. It also has a really cute space upstairs with more seating. When it&#39;s busy it feels a little crowded because it is a small space but that&#39;s part of the charm, and it&#39;s a really good use of such a small space. 

They take reservations so I would recommend calling in a reservation specially on weekends, and brunch. Saturday&#39;s and Sunday&#39;s are always very busy. On nice days, they open the patio outside and it&#39;s a great place to sit and enjoy the sun. Patio is first come first serve. 

They always have food and drink specials. We love going for the ten dollar mimosa pitchers on weekends. 

The food is awesome. We&#39;ve tried many of their food items, some much better than the others, but almost every experience we&#39;ve had has been amazing. For brunch we tried the chicken fried steak panini which was a special that day, and the  skillet. Try their homemade Italian sausage if you get a chance because it&#39;s delicious. Their brunch specials are always amazing. 

Their sauces are homemade, the food is fresh, and the servers are always willing to give good recommendations on favorite items. 

The service is always amazing. We always ask for Brady. He is part of the reason why we love this place so much. We feel right at home. He&#39;s always honest, helpful, and so incredibly attentive. He&#39;s charismatic, funny, and knowledgeable. We try to make it on days that he is working because we couldn&#39;t picture eating there, and not having him around. 

Parking is limited so you might have to walk a bit, but it&#39;s nothing uncommon in this part of town.

Their wine list is awesome. I recommend it to anyone. It&#39;s no wonder it&#39;s always busy. 

Oh and please get an order of the cannoli. You can tell they&#39;re homemade, and probably the best cannoli I&#39;ve had in Denver."

Not to mention the prime location in Congress Park and a nice rooftop patio (opens Thur-Sun).  I have dined here on several occasions for brunch, happy hour and dinner and I can honestly say that the food has been consistently great!

Brunch: you can&#39;t beat the $3 Mimosa/Bloody Mary deal!  The grilled portabella and asparagus Benedict was a very good option for vegetarians.  However, the Rocky Mountain Frittata was the apparent winner with elk sausage, goat cheese and whiskey cream!

Happy Hour: a great selection of tapas, pizzas and small plates.  Happy Hour doesn&#39;t get much better than this! You get a very decent sized pizza for $5!  

Dinner: they usually have nightly specials handwritten on the chalkboard right above the open kitchen in addition to the normal dinner menu.  They portions are very generous. Their thin crust pizza was cooked in such a rustic manner that reminded me of the authentic pizzas I had in Italy!

When I had dinner here, we sat outside on the patio and had decent service (nothing to phone home about!) and I ordered the classic spaghetti and meatballs with wine. It was pretty good and decently priced! I enjoy the atmosphere outside, as you feel you are at a little bistro in Italy. There&#39;s definitely a warm, neighborhood vibe to the restaurant. 

As mentioned before, Shells &amp; Sauce is a cute Italian bistro known for their classic Italian fare, so I was unsure what to expect during brunch (pasta and eggs kind of weirds me out- this is on the menu though!).  The inside of Shells &amp; Sauce is very intimate and what you would think of when the words &#34;Italian bistro&#34; come to mind. Since my friend and I arrived around 11:30 AM, we decided to sit at the bar to avoid a 30 minute wait for a table.The bar was somewhat retro, as the counters were sleek black with colorful circles sporadically placed, which I enjoyed. Disco mindset for a Sunday morning!

While we looked at the menu, the pleasing price of $3 for a Bloody Mary really caught my eye. You oftentimes don&#39;t find Bloodys for a meager $3 anymore, so I wasn&#39;t sure if they would be good or bad. Ahah!... But, Shells &amp; Sauce.... You really executed the $3 Bloody. I ended up having two of the Bloodys, although I could have had even more if I wasn&#39;t going to drive a bit later. On a side note, I ordered the Vesuvio Skillet Breakfast with Italian sausage and green chili, which was AMAZING! I used to order skillets all the time but switched to benedicts two years ago, so the Vesuvio Skillet was a nice reminder of the good ol&#39; days.

My absolute favorite neighborhood brunch spot... that being said I have only had brunch here, so I can&#39;t speak for the rest of their menu, but I can only assume it is equally amazing.  

First of all, this place is absolutely adorable on the inside.  Their patio is always bathed in sunlight during brunch hours, and their main dining area is bustling.  The bar seems like a pretty legit place to sidle up to as well, and the bartenders pour a mean bloody and mimosa!  If the place is super crowded (always) you might be sad upstairs in their &#34;attic&#34; space, which has it&#39;s very own bar and is equally as awesome!

The service each time I have been here has been stellar, and on times when the service was slow, my server has offered to buy my drinks for me to compensate.  Talk about customer service!

I always order the chicken and waffles, and for only $12, you get a massive belgian waffle and the largest chicken breast I have ever seen, which is moist, juicy, and crisp all at the same time!  And it&#39;s an entire breast itself that is filleted and fried.. no bones here!  The Stranahan&#39;s whisky butter is one of a kind as well.  I can&#39;t lie and say I&#39;ve never thought about eating it solo.  Also, they serve real maple syrup! Not that garbage Aunt Jemima stuff.

Their homemade biscuits are fabulous, as are their benny&#39;s.  Next time you&#39;re in the Cheeseman neighborhood during the hours of 10-2pm, stop by Shell&#39;s &amp; Sauce.  You won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I know that the place was busy but there is no way that everyone just sat down to eat.  She went further to say that they had a party of 16 that was recently sat and that was the reason that the menus were on short supply.  We didn&#39;t let that bother us.  A gentleman brought the menus back to the hostess right as they were walking us to our seats.  We get upstairs and our table isn&#39;t done being bused so we stood off to the side, next to the party of 16 that were enjoying their meal, awkwardly until they were done busing the table.  Everyone seems to be running around like a chicken with their head cut off.  They are very busy, but there was an energy that made me feel frantic and that they were unorganized.  We were sat and the waitress brought waters, 4 waters for 6 people.  She left before we could order anything and came back about 6 minutes later (it felt like forever) with 2 more waters and asked what we would like to drink.  We ordered a bottle of Malbec, one glass of Cabernet, and a bottle of San Pellegrino.  My friend made the comment, while we were ordering our drinks, that we were ready to order our food.  She completely disregarded his comment and left before asking what we would like to eat.  She comes back out and gets behind the bar and starts cleaning wine glasses.  One of the folks with us makes the comment that she is doing dishes and I reply with, &#34;they are probably out of wine glasses&#34;.  We have a bit of a discussion about how an Italian restaurant should never run out of clean wine glasses and then get back to our other conversations.  She comes back with the wine and glasses, but forgets the pellegrino.  She takes our food order, between the 6 of us, we order 1 caprese salad, 3 lasagna&#39;s, 1 cajun pasta, 1 Jalapeno Elk sausage pasta (Minus the peppers), and 1 pasta with mussels (I can&#39;t remember the exact name).  She takes our order then heads off, returning shortly with our S. Pellegrino.  about 3-5 minutes later she comes back to the table and says that they are out of the lasagna.  At this point in the evening I have had enough.  I am speechless at first, that this &#34;amazing&#34; restaurant is falling so ridiculously short of all of the opinions of my trusted friends and fellow Yelpers.  Once I find my words, I ask her to please communicate to the management team that being out of lasagna is not OK.  Her response, &#34;we always run out of lasagna&#34;.  I think her thought is that it is more acceptable and would go over better with us if she told us that this dish is a hot commodity.  The exact opposite happened.  I told her that this was even more ridiculous because if they are &#34;always out&#34; then it is obviously clear that they aren&#39;t making enough to meet the demand.  She responds with, &#34;if you know you are coming in, you can call ahead to reserve a piece of it and they will set it aside for you&#34;.  To say that I am pretty infuriated is an understatement.  My response is, &#34;that is absolutely unacceptable.  I know that this isn&#39;t your fault, but the customer already calls ahead to reserve their seat, it is ludicrous to tell them that they should call ahead to reserve their food.  Especially when you have already said that you always run out!  Please communicate to your management how upsetting this is.&#34;  By this time, my colleagues are asking me to let it go, so I do for the time being.   I order the cajun pasta, the Dad of the group orders the Jalapeno Elk pasta and the other friend orders the Shrimp Diavolo.  Shortly after that, she brings the Caprese and it is fine.  Nothing out of this world, but I don&#39;t know that a Caprese salad can be &#34;out of this world&#34;.  Our food comes and right away we notice the first Elk Sausage pasta that was ordered without the peppers, doesn&#39;t have ELK SAUSAGE ON IT!!  The waitress explains that the Sausage has Jalapeno in it so, the kitchen asked her what to do and she recommended that they left it off of the dish.  At first glance, I understand the reasoning here, but when I think about it, it could&#39;ve been addressed insanely better than serving the dish without the MAIN INGREDIENT.  How about asking her, when she orders the dish if she wants the sausage or not, since she asked for no peppers.  Or, if you didn&#39;t think of it then, maybe come back out when the kitchen brings it up to you that the sausage has Jalapeno in it and ask the customer to confirm that this is what she wanted.  She brings the sausage and we eat.  The food tasted AMAZING!    That is the reason for 1 star.  This experience is 0 stars."

Things that are great about this place:
- The waiting staff was extremely helpful
- Portions are very large, everyone in our party was stuffed at the end of the night
- The fried brussles sprouts with chipotle mayo is a must have for the table to share
- Chicken piccata was chock full of flavor
- The bartender (Jose) was knowledgeable and friendly

Things that could be improved:
- The waiting area is this little hallway that is separated from the restaurant by a door which makes waiting for your table to open up a little awkward
- Tables are very close to one another especially near the walls, this place is great for an intimate date but the proximity of the tables means you&#39;ll get a little intimate with your neighbors as well"

You&#39;ll get good food, good portions, and honest prices. I&#39;ve never been waited on by anyone who wasn&#39;t anything but attentive and polite. Not to mention their 3 dollar mimosas and their killer bloody Mary&#39;s.

I always go for the specials. Most of the time they are good, but every so often they are out of this world. I remember this one sandwich they were serving during brunch; they called it a &#34;grilled cheese prime rib&#34; something or another. It was cheesy, melty, savory, the meat was tender, and you dunked it in a homemade au jus. It was amazing. 

It stays just busy enough to keep the atmosphere lively and fun, but not so busy you wait around forever for a table. I&#39;ll keep coming back as long as they&#39;re open."

Dinner feels fancy and the breakfast feels like you&#39;re right at home. They always have something new (some new special), and one of our favorite features is the mimosa pitcher for cheap. If you do decide to visit, I highly recommend their crab cake benedict - cheaper and much better than their Root Down counterpart."

It&#39;s the perfect place for a 1st date or any date for that matter =)

The food is so-so which is why i am not giving more stars. The bread appetizer is this huge round piece of bread that is very awkward to share and requires it to be cut. While this is fine but if you&#39;re on a fancy date, you woudln&#39;t want to get your fingers all greasy trying to cut the bread apart to share with your date. The dip is also very sour for some reason. The crab cake was good but there wasn&#39;t a lot to go between our table of 5. We also tried the mussels which were much better than the other appetizers we tried that night. 

For the entree, i went for the chicken parmesan because I craved it that night. But in hindsight, I should have probably gone with a seafood option like the rest of my table but those were a lot pricier and I wasn&#39;t sure how they would taste. The chicken parmesan was pretty dry but the chicken was tender. It was a HUGE portion so I took some away with me for the next day because I simply couldn&#39;t finish after all those appetizers. Next time I would definitely go with a seafood pasta option and hopefully it&#39;s better than the chicken parm."

All 3 meals were delicious and they offered a free dessert due to the wait. The cannoli  which we took home was amazing! That wasn&#39;t the best part, when we went to pay all 3 of our meals were taken care of on the house. We only payed for our appetizer. This team went above and beyond.

The restaurant itself is very cute and there is a nice upstairs seating area.  The bread and dipping sauce are very good.  The service was pretty good, except for the guy who seated us who was seriously clueless about everything.  Anyways.. our entrees just fell flat.  Both of our dishes could have used more sauce, which we thought was funny given the name of the restaurant.  I ordered the chicken piccata and my boyfriend ordered the chicken carbonara.  My boyfriend asked for more sauce but was told that it would take a while.  My sauce was thin and oily and didn&#39;t have much flavor.  There wasn&#39;t a lot of pasta either.  I ended up adding salt to try and bring out some sort of flavor, but it just wasn&#39;t there.  Maybe this place would just be better for drinks and appetizers?"

I never knew this little area of town existed and yet is super close to where I live.  I need to return to try a few other establishments.  Call ahead or go to Open Table to get a reservation, otherwise you would be waiting an hour plus on the weekend.  They have a nice outdoor patio, but do not allow dogs on the patio.  A lot of people tied their dogs up on the fence outside of the patio.  One customer left his poor pup outside of the restaurant while he dinned inside.  Let&#39;s just say the dog whined the entire time until he was done eating and left.  Quite annoying to everyone eating there.  (Don&#39;t be that guy!)

Shells &amp; Sauce does serve bottomless mimosas, so they got that going for them.  I had the Garden Omlete, then added the Jalapeno Elk sausage.  The Elk Sausage was amazing!  It added a nice kick to an already flavorful omelet.  I noticed there were also pastas on the menu for brunch.  I have not tried myself nor did anyone in my group, but I would love to return and try.

I sat outside in the cool summer air and waited patiently for my waitress. 

At Shells&amp;Sauce the wait staff takes turn taking tables instead of servicing sections. While this is most fair to the wait staff and says a lot about how considerate the owners/management are, it delays service in such a big establishment on busy nights. Three people passed me five times before I was brought water and bread. So the four stars are for the service...

Because the food was outstanding!!! I had the Chicken Marsala, with a side of asparagus al forno and a side of Alfredo. I try to taste the Alfredo at every Italiano experience, because IMO it doesn&#39;t hold up as well as a tomato sauce and they are all very different. The Alfredo at Shells&amp;Sauce is not a traditional Alfredo. It&#39;s lacking a bit in seasoning, more cream than cheese and garlic. 

I topped it all off with a tiramisu which was rich, but balanced the bitter espresso with cinnamon and cream just perfectly. If you&#39;re looking for a no miss Italian experience in Denver, this is your spot. I can&#39;t imagine anything on the menu being less than satisfactory."

Instead, we came face-to-face with a full on mouth orgasm.  Too bold?  Apparently you&#39;ve yet to try the lasagna or shrimp diavolo. 

Let&#39;s start with the lasagna. 

1) This isn&#39;t just dinner but lunch as well.  To say that my portion was large would be a gross understatement.
2) The combination of amazing Italian sausage, Ricota cheese, fresh Parmesan, tender but not gooey noodles and that sauce that simply just doesn&#39;t quit!  
3) mouth orgasm number one complete. 

Next the Shrimp Diavolo. 

1) They said it was spicy.  Most restaurants  pretend to offer spicy food but the shrimp diavolo delivered. We love HOT and this didn&#39;t disappoint. 
2) Seven jumbo shrimp!  Not 6, not 5, 7 jumbo shrimp!  
3) The sauce on this dish...WTF? Amazing!
4) mouth orgasm number two complete.

On top of all of that the staff was amazing!  Great job management team, you know what you&#39;re doing and you&#39;re doing it extremely well! Other restaurants in the Denver area should come learn what customer service looks like. 

In conclusion, Shells and Sauce mastered the giggity!  Definitely will be going back for more and can&#39;t wait to try their chicken piccata!"

Crispy Brussels served with a chipotle aioli....do not pass that up. The bread they serve is also out of this world. Freshly baked with rosemary...I could have eaten only bread and been happy. And the caperese salad was very fresh and yummy as well. The amor got lasagna for his entree and I got chicken carbonara. Both were delicious. The lasagna was HUGE!!! Not sure how he made it through 2/3?!?! Boys can eat! I really enjoyed the few bites of carbonara I had but was just too full to take more than that. It had peas and asparagus which really sold me and a nice smokiness from the bacon! They also had I think it was a sage ginger presseco....I would certainly recommend that!!!

I went in tonight to order and take some food to go back to my home a couple of blocks away. Ok, it is a Friday night, but there were tables available when we walked in. We ordered a bottle of wine and three dishes to go Lasagna, Salmon Picata, and Tortellini. 

And here is where it went off the tracks. The wine we ordered, a special of the day, was already sold out. 
No worries, we chose another. My wife and I enjoyed it.

When the wine was FINISHED. We got a check at 7:13pm. I paid out, expecting our meals to arrive soon. About a half an hour later, at 7:44 to be precise, one of the waiters offered to refilll our water wbile the bartender was checking on our meal. &#34;No, thank you. I hope we are gone before we get to drink any more water. We have been waiting for almost an hour for our order that was to go.&#34;

The waiter appeared surprised and embarrassed at the same time, he informed me he would tell the manager. What a wasted guesture. Not only did the manager not respond he trued to make me feel guilty for being unhappy and not understanding how a restaurant works, &#34;We don&#39;t prioritize to go orders ahead of dine in...blah, blah, blah. The kitchen is putting up meals in 28 minutes.&#34; Uh, cough, they&#39;re not. 

I started my career in restaurants, I get it. If you can&#39;t get an order out in an hour - not a special, not an off-menu item, not even a substitution, then you don&#39;t have a long future in the restaurant business. 

Have fun storming the castle, Shells and Sauce! 

It will be a cold day where the character with horns and the trident does his business before I visit again or suggest anyone else does.

The environment is very lively and chatty so it&#39;s a comfortable environment to either go on a date, or to hang out with family or a group of friends. 

When we ordered our food, not only did it taste amazing but the portions were huge and we were stuffed without ordering an appetizer or dessert. It was refreshing to find a restaurant with large portions because many hipster restaurant give small portions on small plates and my boyfriend leaves unhappy because he doesn&#39;t feel satisfied even after ordering $50 worth of food. Here, the price is reasonable, the environment was comfortable, and our waiter was amazing. He was very polite and made sure we never ran low in our bread or drinks. A bread bowl with a balsamic sauce comes free when you order so you can socialize and eat bread while you wait for your dinner. 

There&#39;s street parking available and many other restaurants nearby so even if you can&#39;t find parking very close to the restaurant, you walk through a nice neighborhood to get to the restaurant and there&#39;s always people walking or biking up and down the sidewalks. I will definitely come back and try the other foods on the menu."

We are a table of nine who are not drinking out of control, but drinking.  7 of the 9 needed a refresh, nothing.  Maybe 27-30 minutes later she pops back over. Still doesn&#39;t ask how our food taste, takes plates and drops off dessert menu.  A few ask for to go box. One of the to go we have to ask about because she forgets.  Finally get a cup of ice.  Dessert tastes great like shells and sauce typically does. I don&#39;t know- I love shells and sauce but there are so many places in Denver, bad service  will drive people away."

I just love the food and the portions here. It&#39;s the little ingredient upgrades that make all the difference. Havarti cheese in the omelet, habanero vodka in the bloody Mary&#39;s. The prices really are quite reasonable as well. 

Another plus here is the ambiance. There isn&#39;t a bad seat in the house. The patio is nice, the dining room is sunny, and the upstairs section has nice views of the bustling neighborhood streets. 

Our last visit made such a good impression that we drove across town for another visit. But today was not the same delightful experience as before. When we arrived, we waited almost ten minutes to be greeted. The couple waiting ahead of us said they had been there for a few minutes before we even arrived. We waited a full 45 minutes from the time we walked in to the time we ate. No wonder there was a wait, and so many people sitting at tables with nothing in front of them. 

We didn&#39;t get so much as an acknowledgment from anyone, let alone an apology. Our two hungry teenagers complained that their tummys were growling.  If this had been a first visit, it would have been a last. The good first visit may get us to go back. But it&#39;s pretty bad that no one seemed to notice or care about embarrassingly slow service today."

First two experiences were downstairs with friendly staff, great happy hour and food worth writing home about. 

Third visit was a cluster. Even with a reservation we ended up &#34;upstairs&#34; which is a poor excuse for a trailer porch complete with outdoor furniture. Not exactly classic Italian. Complete the package with drafty tarps for walls on a frigid Denver night and you set the stage for an already miserable evening. Wrong meal was delivered to someone at my table and he cut into it before realizing. Same waitress delivers the same plate, complete with the cut chicken, to the table next to us two minutes later. Friend waited 10-15 minutes to receive his food at which point everyone&#39;s food was cold. Thankfully there was wine to get us through.

Mumbled apologies and a meager discount did not make up for what was downright distasteful and unsanitary. Poor judgment and a poor excuse for an upstairs ruined our evening.

All that said, Happy Hour downstairs is highly recommended - just pay attention to make sure you food wasn&#39;t already served to someone else.."

1. If you just walk into a popular restaurant on a weekend evening...or even a weekday...and are bothered you have to wait 45 minutes to eat...that&#39;s YOUR fault. There is a reason you didn&#39;t eat right away...because they are busy and other human beings got there before you! Next time...call ahead and book a reservation. This is a major city! Not a cow town.

2. We have eaten here three times, and every time the food was excellent and the portions were HUGE! To the person who said the portions were small...you must be a 6&#39;10&#34;, 325lbs, Linebacker for the Denver Broncos...because only a giant would think these plates are small.

...by the way, the leftovers are just as good the next day!

So, besides GREAT Italian food, a great waitstaff with good energy, and a cute casual atmosphere, the best part...When I told our waiter I love the Chicken Parma, but wanted to mix it up, he suggested trying it with an Alfredo sauce. WOW!

Eat Here!"

Made several trips back and ordered the same two entries each time. There were few hiccups here and there but over looked as minor things and was just happy to get great meal.

Tonight&#39;s visit with hot date, we ordered the usual two things but when the clams arrived in a skillet, I knew something was wrong. Wrong big time.  They have changed it to &#34;Fresh clams, organic chard, caramelized onions, buffalo sausage and chablis butter sauce with capellini $18&#34;.  It was very unappetizing.  It may sound like gourmet but one sure way of loosing business.  I know the business is trying to make few more $ with tweaked entry but definitely going wrong way.

You can get a flatbread pizza for $5 or sliders (they are a decent size and come with a side salad; 3 flavor options) for $3. There are also beers for $2.50 and a wine Yelp check in offer for $4.50. 

I had the balsamic vinegar bruschetta flatbread pizza with olives which was surprisingly large. I couldn&#39;t finish it because I also had a portobella mushroom slider. 

Their slider came with a side salad which had a little bit too much dressing on it (made the salad a little soggy). The slider itself was large and had a nice shiny hamburger bun. It was very tasty (though I preferred the flatbread). Their slider options included pork belly and chicken. 

I also tried their horchata espresso liquer cinnamon cocktail for $9 which was horribly small and tasted like pure liquer. I always imagine liquer to be something you add a splash of in a cocktail but I strongly felt that I was drinking mostly liquer. There was also a ton of ice in my cocktail &amp; too much cinnamon on top of the whipped cream. It tasted more like coffee liquer than it did horchata. I am under the impression that it&#39;s only called horchata because of the cinnamon sprinkled on top.

We had a wonderful waitress who was kind and helpful with our linner.

One thing that was off putting about this place was the stench that was strongly apparent from when I first stepped into the restaurant. It smelled like old dirty mop water throughout the whole restaurant. It was especially evident because I came @ 3PM when there were no other customers yet therefore no fragrant food smells to mask the stench."

My friend and I opted to eat here before heading over to the Botanic Gardens for the Chihuly exhibit. We were immediately greeted and given a hard time (in good fun) about coming in with our Sbux drinks. Ahhh... this is my kind of place. 

We were pleasantly surprised to realize we were there in time for Happy Hour. Check in on yelp and get an even better deal on glasses of wine! We got the stuffed mushrooms (baby portabellas, 4 of them) filled with cheese and spinach and garlic. Served over a red pepper coulis sauce. Mmmmm.

Also, a small boule of fresh out of the oven bread, served with a bowl of delicious balsamic. WARNING. YOU WILL EAT IT ALL and maybe regret it.

Then we shared two appetizers: truffled mac n cheese and the fried brussel sprouts. These are not small portions. Finished every bite. I wish the mac n cheese was served in a shallower dish so that there was more of that delicious broiled cheese to pasta ratio. 

I&#34;m not the hugest fan of italian b/c I get tired of eating a big bowl of pasta. Shells &amp; Sauce has great service, and apps that are easily shared to go tapas style with your friends.

I forgot to add... TOP NOTCH SERVICE. Water filled, waiter did not hesitate to recommend dishes... and, get this. He went and heated up our Sbux drinks for us before we left (so we would have hot beverages as we perused the exhibit.) I left a much larger than 20% tip for him. I want to say his name was Jamie.

My most recent experience was the deal breaker and I will not be returning even though I live a few blocks away.  Waiting for a seat at the bar I was surprised as someone who came in after me by a good ten minutes was almost immediately seated as I stood there watching in amazement.  When I was finally seated I ordered a salad that came out almost instantaneously leaving me to wonder if it had not been made earlier and left lying on a counter in the back.  Perhaps it was the amount of brownish colored romaine that gave it away.  I then ordered a drink and watched dumbfounded as the bartender empty a glass with ice in it and proceeded to serve my beer in it. The pasta was just so so which pretty much summed up the entire night.  The waitstaff on the whole was friendly if a bit overwhelmed by having a full house so I am not sure where the disconnect lies although there did not appear to be a manager overseeing the room.  Thankfully there are many options to choose from when looking for a good place to eat and sadly Shells and Sauce will no longer be one of those go to places for me.

We had dinner here for thanksgiving this year. I failed to inquire ahead of time if they have the traditional fare of turkey. What a pleasant surprise for Adam who was happy to find out that they do!

I stayed with my usual Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and mushroom. That&#39;s my test for a new place. Always. Happy to report that they are very good. The sauce was thick but not above board. Just perfect. The mushroom was obvious. The portion was nothing to complain about. In fact I took my leftover home.

The turkey dish was surprisingly excellent. So it was the star of the night. It was moist. Part of the reason why I don&#39;t like turkey is because it&#39;s usually dry. Not this. Seasoned well and the stuffing was also awesome. I will for sure have this sometime if it&#39;s in the menu.

Bruno&#39;s sits in a strip mall next to a Walmart. Not a very romantic or extravagant location.

Therein lies one of the best reasons why you should try Bruno&#39;s. Very reasonable and affordable place to dine with amazing food and warm service. Why shouldn&#39;t you?

Tip from a first time diner. Their bread is fresh and to die for. Account for some space for this awesome bread. It&#39;s light with that crunchy crust and that fresh bread taste only a freshly baked bread can impart."

You can&#39;t go wrong with this restaurant. Also, we like to get the Kunde red wine. Its 14% alcohol and tastes delicious."

The price was right considering the portions, quality, and service. Great atmosphere, which you wouldn&#39;t think from looking at it from the outside. Great dining room. Small, but beautiful bar if you just wanted to come in for a drink and an appetizer. 

Not many vegetarian options, very few vegan options (even if you get very creative), but I think the kitchen would be accommodating if you asked. We found something on our own, but might inquire next time (because we ordered the only two vegetarian options). The service really was incredible. Patient and knowledgable, never rushed (even as he got busy).

** Our only complaint: We didn&#39;t ask for the yelp checkin wine offer, but a table near us did and the management didn&#39;t seem to happy about it. Stating &#34;they removed that months ago,&#34; and told the three girls they could split one glass. It was just a bit uncomfortable because we could hear the manager, bartender, and server discussing it (on the opposite side of the restaurant) and they weren&#39;t too kind about them asking for it. This is specifically why we don&#39;t do the check in offers. I would have been really embarrassed if the situation was reversed. The girls were good sports about it though. FYI the wine offer was active at that time and is still active as I write this review."

Simply put, the food was delicious! 

I was really impressed.

I tried the chicken piccata which was absolutely scrumptious with very intense lemon and caper flavors that really popped. The chicken was done perfectly: lightly browned but thin beautiful strips of premium chicken breast.

I was also impressed by the lemoncello marscapone cake. That again had an intense pop of lemon flavor, but smoothed by the marscapone- and the cake was so light it just melts in your mouth treat -really impressed.

I will be back to Bruno&#39;s!"

Went on a stormy Thursday night. Not many people in the restaurant, sometimes that&#39;s the service kiss of death. But not at Bruno&#39;s! I had the chicken piccata over spaghetti.

The service is always good to excellent and the food is always delicious.  I love the homemade tapenade they bring out with the fresh baked bread - EVOO, sliced garlic, sundried tomatoes, and olives (just be careful not to eat too much of the garlic at once or it&#39;ll bite back!).  

I ordered my favorite - the veal saltimboca.  It&#39;s a veal filet topped with prosciutto and provolone served with gnocchi covered in a rich basil cream sauce with fresh spinach.  The other must-try on Bruno&#39;s menu is the Risotto al Gardinio - it&#39;s incredibly rich while still being fresh and not too heavy.

Bruno&#39;s also features a large and reasonably priced wine menu, though I can&#39;t speak to that since I rarely drink."

White table clothes etc. very good and knowledgeable service.I ordered my favorite spaghetti and meatballs; The basic marinara sauce was weak and neede more spices and flavor. The meatballs were also weakly flavored and bland. There seems to be a huge void in Denver regarding the creation of a flavorful, tender meatball. Overall, I would try Brunos&#39; again. Perhaps the rest o their menu has more flavor and energy. Lots of AARP members were dining that evening. A reasonable good choice."

The service was not good. My husband had a lady bug in his salad. The waitress was quick to get him a new salad however did not comp his meal or offer a free dessert. 

We asked several times for bread and none was ever brought to the table. We looked around at the other tables and saw that they all had bread baskets. When we asked her why we didn&#39;t get any she said, &#34;the kitchen was very busy and I asked for bread like 10 times.&#34;  

We hadn&#39;t been to Bruno&#39;s for over five years and now I remember why. It was a disappointing evening. To top everything off it is Mother&#39;s Day and we watched the staff give roses to all the moms as they left. We had 2 moms in our party and neither were offered a rose."

We met the new owner tonight and enjoyed an evening meal. Good, but way short of great. We had the artichoke appetizer, chicken piccata, chicken parmigiana. All was fresh and good. Service was decent. So how did we get to 3 stars? 
1. nothing special about the location or atmosphere
2. salads prepared earlier in the day
3. breads just ok
4. wine list inexpensive, limited, choices mediocre to match the prices, which were low

Overall: Decent place to eat at bargain prices for good food. But no match for really fine Italian dining that you can find at other spots in Denver, admittedly at far higher prices. Could be 4 stars on a price to value scale."

Classic Italian dishes executed well.  Sometimes you&#39;re just looking for a good version of Chicken Parm, nothing fancy.  You know what I&#39;m talking about.  Forgo the Olive Garden and come to Bruno&#39;s and support a local business.  This place is in a dying plaza, turn right at the Burger King (a tip from me to you).  

*Jeans are acceptable.  Try to look presentable, it is a nice casual restaurant after all.

The service is solid, not exceptional, good for a family run Italian restaurant.  The table bread is served warm with an oil dipping medley with sun-dried tomato&#39;s and kalamata olives, can I have seconds please, yes bread and oil yumminess?

Classic Italian menu with pastas, veal, chicken, eggplant, and some pizzas.  We opted for the following:

House Salad - Italian (Homemade, a little vinegary for my taste but still good)
Soup -
Eggplant Parm with spaghetti and marinara - Eggplant was tender and flavorful with the accompanying pasta - delicious
Chicken Parm with the house pesto pasta with mushrooms - Lots of chicken presented beautifully and the house pesto pasta was very tasty with the veggies.  I finished the entire thing.

Prices are $14-$20 for the entrees, average pricing in my opinion.

When I&#39;m looking for no frills Italian this place will be at the top of my list."

My boyfriend and I took my mother here for dinner last night, who was visiting from out of state, solely based on reviews here on Yelp. We were in the mood for great Italian food but didn&#39;t want to break the bank. The other reviewers nailed it - don&#39;t let the fact that this place is in a strip mall deter you. This place was fantastic.

I would&#39;ve rated it a 5/5 if it didn&#39;t take us a while to get our checks. The service up until the time we wanted to leave was completely stellar. Our server and the owner kept refilling our waters and checking in with us throughout our meal, but our checks were delayed 10-15 minutes only because of the large group in the dining area tying up the staff. 

The food....oh man. I got the lasagna, boyfriend got the chicken parm, and mom got chicken marsala. All of us thought our meals were out of this world awesome. The beef lasagna was seriously some of the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Not even lying. We were all so impressed with our food, and actually somewhat surprised that we&#39;d never heard of this place before! 

Also - we wore jeans and nice shirts. I was searching Yelp for this information but couldn&#39;t really find it. No need to get super dressed up to come here, just don&#39;t look like a slob. :)

The restaurant was busy, with a lot of bigger groups. They were still accommodating and split the checks for us individually and for the most part charged everyone correctly.
The bread with the flavored olive oil was a nice start. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana. The edges were a little burn on the first couple of slices, but I actually didn&#39;t mind that though one of the other ladies did point out the burnt parts on hers, too. I thought the tomato slices were a bit odd, but otherwise, I really liked the flavor and texture of the eggplant. It came with pasta with peas and mushrooms--I was really happy with this. It was a nice change from the standard spaghetti and red sauce side, which does come with the rollatini.

On Sunday, upon arriving, the waitress said she had been called about our reservation, although she didn&#39;t seem interested in the name. We were the second set of 2 in the door right at 4:00.  She said they were very busy the day before and this day; however, when we left at 5:30 p.m., there were still many open tables. 

 While our waitress was friendly, time management seemed to be an issue.  We could have been out of there by 5:15 max and had wanted to be. We waited 10 minutes just for her to pick up our credit card for payment.  She had 4 tables of 2 and 1 table of 4, all who had come in at varying intervals. The waiter seemed much more capable and seemed to have time to help her out. She was friendly however.

  We do not drink alcohol so the drink choices were limited to Lipton tea and soft drinks. Flavored and/or herbal teas would have been nice. The small loaf of bread was sufficient, since it was nothing to rave about, and I have had better olive oil dip. 

 Food was  good.:  dinner companion got salad with ranch and spaghetti with meatballs, which I tasted. It was good, but nothing to rave about. I got a cup of minestrone soup, which was just ok, and the Carbonera, which was awesome! We both had the tiramisu, and it was awesome as well!  We would go back again just to order those two items!

 The atmosphere and décor was nice, and we appreciated the music played in the background. - makes one forget you are in a strip mall!  

 My opinion - this restaurant strives to be a notch above the Olive Garden, for example, and makes it in some cases, but falls short in others.

 Nice, little restaurant in a local strip mall, which I do appreciate."

I really wanted to like this place. Mom and pop, hardworking, cute... It smelled amazing when we arrived. But... here goes.

My mother-in-law made a reservation for four of us at 7pm on Open Table at about 2:40pm. She sent us all the confirmation and we were very excited. 

My husband and I arrived ten minutes before 7 (a total anomaly in our world). We knew we were early and it was NYE and we were prepared to sit at the bar with a drink and wait. Well, the hostess who greeted us didn&#39;t even have our reservation. She had a sheet of paper with people&#39;s names written down but that was it. She asked if the reservation was made after they opened because at that point &#34;we don&#39;t really have any way to check reservations on Open Table.&#34; WHAT?! Why are you on Open Table if you can&#39;t check reservations in real time?! (p.s. to the owners... get an iPad... easy solution!)

Fine. She said she would see what she could do and get us a table. So we went to the bar for a drink. And we sat. We waited a few minutes before a guy asked us what we wanted. We said &#34;a drink menu.&#34; He said sure. Then disappeared for 10 minutes. We stopped someone else and they finally got a menu to us. 

Now. These servers were hustling. No doubt about that. But everyone was doing EVERYTHING. The hostess was waitress-ing, the bartender running food. I totally get that it was NYE and they were working hard. And I am happy that this small business was bustling. However... how we were treated was not ok. 

My in-laws arrived about 10 after (they got lost). We still didn&#39;t have a table. We watched half of the dining room leave and be resat (with people who came in after us) but still no one said anything to us about a table being prepared or anything. Frankly, it looked like they forgot about us since we weren&#39;t standing in the tiny vestibule. Several parties of four were sat before us. 

Finally at 7:25 we decided to find a reservation elsewhere and go so we could eat. The whole idea of this dinner was to do something earlier and be home before 9ish. I was really sad to leave because the smells coming from the kitchen were awesome but the lack of communication with us, the disappearing act of the bartender, and... frankly... the oddness of one of the servers (who nearly knocked my off my bar stool and was running around muttering to himself) made it the right decision. We threw a $20 on the bar for our two drinks (way over-paying, I am sure) because there was no one there to cash out with and headed for the door. My mother-in-law stopped a server to tell her we were leaving and she said that they were &#34;just preparing a table...&#34; just like they had been for the past nearly 40 minutes? We were nearly 30 minutes past our reservation anyway. I made an online reservation for Bent Noodle for 7:45, we rolled in around 7:35 and they sat us right away with a smile. 

The hostess ran out after us to tell me that they were prepping our table right now. I told her were were leaving and headed somewhere we knew we could get a table. She said &#34;but your table... they paid like 30 minutes ago. They just haven&#39;t left yet. It&#39;s really unusual.&#34; Well, that is different than preparing a table... you are still waiting on them to get up. 

We went to Bent Noodle and had a great meal.

Overall, I am very disappointed. I would like to try Bruno&#39;s. I was excited to eat there but I will have to convince my husband to go back. He was very upset. 

I get it. I was a waitress for years. I know what it&#39;s like to work on a holiday, with a huge crowd, and to be understaffed but not telling us the situation isn&#39;t cool. And we went to the bottom of her list because SHE didn&#39;t have the reservation. Bummer on NYE!"

I had the eggplant rollatini-I didn&#39;t realize the eggplant was going to be deep-fried. It was good-but I didn&#39;t want a fried food, which dampened the flavor for me.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs, he said it didn&#39;t have much flavor. The tiramisu was lacking-it just didn&#39;t taste like it was made with quality ingredients.

We wanted to find a really good neighborhood Italian restaurant, somewhere that would be our &#34;go-to&#34; - but we&#39;ll keep looking.

It must be hard to run a restaurant and make a profit. I wish I had a better review."

Interior - nice colors, easy to move around in. 

Food - the pasta is good. We had the spaghetti, and the eggplant parmesan. Both were very good. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. My husband ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. We each had 1/2 of the others. I liked the eggplant, but must admit that I LOVED the spaghetti with the meatballs. The sauce was one of the best sauces I have ever tasted. The blend of spices was incredible! The meatballs were also very good. 

We ordered a pizza to go. We were disappointed. It looked good, but when we tried it, not so good. It seemed like one of those pizzas that you finish baking at home, nothing special about it, very disappointing.

Parking - private parking lot, so no problem there.

Location - in a strip mall, with very few other businesses there. It does seem rather desolate.

Prices -  not bad.

Service - good

Will we go back, most likely not anytime soon. The pasta was good, but the pizza, not so good. All in all, OK."

The free bread came with a house olive oil mix with sun-dried tomatoes, garlic cloves, and olives. We asked for more. Everyone was absolutely astonished by their choices. I had the eggplant rollatini, my roommate the special (veal truffle something amazing) and our friends ordered the spinach ravioli and chicken parm. I don&#39;t know how they made ravioli so spectacular but it was the best. My rollatini left nothing to be desired. I didn&#39;t try the other dishes but my friends loved them!

It was the start of Denver Restaurant Week and we didn&#39;t have reservations anywhere, so we were looking for a low-key spot not participating in DRW.  Bruno&#39;s it is!
Within five minutes of arriving on a busy Saturday night, we were seated and reviewing the menu.  Turns out Bruno&#39;s had their own restaurant week offer at the original price of $52.80 for two!  Jackpot!  
For the incredible price of $52.80, we each had a glass of house wine, mussels, salads, entrees, and a dessert to share.  To top it off, we used our Yelp check-in offer for another free glass of wine.  This deal and the food cannot be beat!
A word about the food-- Seriously, you can&#39;t go wrong with the mussels which were in a delicious lemon broth that tasted light and fresh.  For an entree, I had the penne primavera with broccoli, red peppers, and mushrooms with lots of parmesan and my bf had sole piccata with angel hair pasta and capers.   Both dishes were incredible with a light, lemon flavor. For dessert, they were out of the advertised chocolate mousse cake so they offered us lemoncello cake --the perfect compliment to our lemon-themed evening."

Appetizer, soup, salad, entree, and dessert course PLUS glass of house red or white -- quite a deal!

I made reservations some time ago on Open Table, however, upon arrival last night they did not have my name down.  Thankfully, a two-top was getting ready to leave, and they were apologetic for not having my name down.  We only waited a few minutes by the (small) bar before moving to our table.  The interior is warm; clean without being sterile and still casual enough that we saw plenty of couples come in wearing jeans (and nicer shirts).  We received bread quickly after being sat.  The bread was warm, crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside (yum).  The dipping oil had kalamatas and sundried tomatoes as an added bonus.

We managed to snarf down the bread before anyone came over to greet us.  When she finally did, she asked the ever-loaded &#34;Has anyone been by to help you yet?&#34;.  Luckily, I&#39;ve waited tables before, and we hadn&#39;t been waiting that long.  So it wasn&#39;t a big deal.  Also, it gave us time to decide each course so we got our wine and food order taken all at once, and the food appeared in a timely manner from there.

We chose the fried artichokes for an appetizer (other choice was steamed mussels).  They were artichokes battered in something similar to calamari batter, fried, served atop spinach with roasted red peppers and garlic aioli.  It was certainly a hearty portion between the two of us, and probably what did me in when I was too full for my entree later.  Up next we each got a cup of their minestrone.  It wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had; I probably would not order it on its own.  And after that came the house salads (other choice was a Caesar).  I read a previous review that said they make their own Italian and Balsamic dressings; The Dude and I ordered one of each.  The Balsamic was pretty standard fare, but the Italian was no good.  It just tasted like vinegar and was pretty disappointing overall.

Then came the entrees.  The Dude selected the Shrimp+Scallops Scampi with linguine; I chose the Eggplant Parmesan.  Mine came with a side of spaghetti with some kind of pesto-y sauce, mushrooms, peas, and roasted red peppers.  I like each element of the dish (the eggplant and the pasta), but I wasn&#39;t a big fan of them together.  Next time I would request just plain pasta and more red sauce, but that&#39;s a personal preference.  Both items were quite tasty.  The Dude said his seafood tasted fresh, and had a nice balance of flavors.  They were full portion sizes, so I only took a few bites of mine and had the rest boxed up for another meal.  Bonus!  Also, they seem to use the &#34;parmesan cheese&#34; from the green shaker can (looks akin to a Comet can), which I feel is kind of lowbrow for a place like this.

We selected the tiramisu for dessert (out of that, Spumoni, chocolate gelato, or cannoli).  We thought it sounded the best, but after eating it I suspect the chocolate gelato may have been superior.  I could be wrong, but it seemed as though their tiramisu is made with (real) whipped cream instead of marscapone.  It didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor and it was mostly whipped cream (or whatever it was) with a single layer of not-very-espresso-soaked lady fingers.  But the presentation was pretty and at least it came across as housemade.

I&#39;m not sure we&#39;d drive over to that side of town to visit again (another oddly located Italian bistro in a run-down strip mall...), but it was a great deal for Restaurant Week.  I suspect if they participate again next year they might be a front runner for reservations.  Let&#39;s just hope if they are and I do make reservations, they actually have me down that time..."

Its very telling that despite all the renovation work going on around this strip mall and the lack of big box anchor, Bruno&#39;s continues to thrive with lots of loyal locals and great food.  Every time I come here, I am torn because everything on the menu looks great.  Today, it was the osso bucco.  This was a rich dish that had deep flavors and a lot of attention to detail.  In previous trips I&#39;ve had their pasta and gnocchi and will definitely make more visits.  
The atmosphere is very intimate and the service is very welcoming and you always see the same people there.  Service was top notch as it had a home style feel but they were working hard.  My wife had the sole and the pasta with it was amazing.  I wish we had room for dessert.  Eventually, this place will have a patio and in the summer evenings I would highly recommend giving this place a shot over other restaurants around the same area.  
In my opinion, the Italian is as good or better than North or Cody&#39;s to compare a few."

We always make a reservation just in case the rest of denver has caught on to this beauty. If we accidently call too early (brunos isnt open for lunch without a large group) someone will call us back as soon as they get the opportunity. So far we havent had seen a full dining room except for new years eve, but we need to be prepared for when it gets the recognition it deserves.

The staff is incredible.  The manager/owner (nick i believe) is very sweet.  He always has our table already set up with a seat for my daughter when we arrive.  He will also come around at least once to every table to ask how everyone is.  

We havent been to any italian place since, and we dont plan to.  

The only suggestion i have for brunos is to teach the wait staff a wine that compliments each dish.  I&#39;m no wino so i could use the assistance :).  You could also just add it as a little note on the menu."

We asked why we hadn&#39;t been told about the specials and asked for the manager. Turned out our rude server with the worst attitude  was the manager! When she told us her name, she screamed, get the spelling right: JAHNNA. She asked: you didn&#39;t ask what the specials were!  Wait, I am supposed to ask???  She was rude, probably has anger management issues, possibly one of the most hostile people I have seen in this industry. We have traveled all over the world and this is really the worst. We felt discriminated against--it was a horrible experience. We left--after paying for an appetizer we did not want. Feeling terrible. I did not know this sort of behavior was socially acceptable in 2015, in Denver! No call for racism, Bruno&#39;s. We are not going back. I shall tell as many people as I know about this experience.

We are slackers, I admit, and we didn&#39;t make reservations on Christmas Eve.  Everywhere that was open was booked solid, for the entire evening.  I found out that Bruno&#39;s was open and had availably for 4 through Open Table.  Since I&#39;ve had it bookmarked I thought why not?  And I had no idea where else we would go for a decent meal.

We knew we struck gold when they  brought us fresh toasted bread with a great oil dipping sauce.  I immediately saw crispy polenta on the menu as an appetizer and without even reading the description, ordered it.  We knew we really struck gold once it was served.  We all devoured it and literally could have licked the bowl clean of the sauce.  The polenta was fried to a crispy brown but was still smooth and silky on the inside.  It was smothered in the most fantastic sauce that consisted of mascarpone, panceta, and, roasted tomatoes, and fresh spinach. To Die For!!  It was so rich and had a sweet bite to it from the mascarpone.  When we finished the polenta we dipped our bread in the rest of the sauce.

We opted for the minestrone soup instead of salads, but they did say they make their own Italian and balsamic vinaigrette so I&#39;m sure those are both very good.  The minestrone was home made and the best I&#39;ve had.  The flavor was fantastic.  There was a good amount of fresh ingredients in it, not all broth.  

Our entrées hit the mark as well.  My friend and I each ordered linguine in a white wine sauce topped with a feast of seafood.  Calamari, scallops, shrimp, muscles AND clams, hooray!  The sauce was again, fantastic.  It complimented the seafood so well.  The pasta was cooked perfect al dente.  We both loved our dishes.  The other 2 in our party had chicken parm and spinach ravioli that looked fantastic and they both raved about.  The chicken parm was served with a side of    pasta giardino, a basic spaghetti tossed with fresh veggies in a light oil type sauce.  The portions are large, enough for leftovers the next day.

For dessert we all split a slice of home made Tiramisu. It was different than any other I&#39;ve ever had.  It was light and fluffy and had a very thin layer of lady fingers.

Our server was so nice and the owner came to our table to make sure everything was satisfactory.  They didn&#39;t even rush us, or make us feel rushed, on Christmas Eve when we were the last people in the restaurant and I&#39;m sure everyone wanted to get home to their families.  

I should also add that we had 2 bottles of wine and all that food and our bill was under $200.  Bruno&#39;s just made some new patrons I do believe.  We were all very impressed and are looking forward to going back again and again."

Hands down the best Italian food I have found in this area. The Bistro is in a strip mall, not a big sign in front, you would never know it was there, but what a find. Very tastefully furnished, nothing flashy or anything that overtly looks Italian or ethnic in any way, just tasteful. The wait staff is dressed in black. There is a small, nice bar in the back, a small place probably seats 50.  Not a big menu but a nice array of dishes, veal, shrimp, pasta, pizza, salad, appetizers and specials, plus a nice wine list.  Started off with a plate of mozzarella, peppers and tomatoes with fresh basil and a vinaigrette, simple dish but everything was very tasty and just enough to get things ready for the main course.  I had the Baked ziti with peppers, sausage and sage, topped with melted cheese.  Absolutely fantastic, the sauce was flavorful and spicy (as requested) the pasta was cooked perfectly, cheese melted perfectly, topped with a little shredded Parmesan and black pepper. Every bite a delight.  I could tell that the person who put this together knew what they were doing and cared about the product they were putting out to customers. The dish was a real treat and I would not have changed a thing about it. I could have eaten it all, but I decided to take a bit home so I could have that wonderful taste again tomorrow.  I will most definitely return to Bruno&#39;s often to sample the other dishes and plan to take friends there for a great dining adventure. Some may think it is pricey but paying for good food, cooked with care and love is worth every penny. Dinner for two without wine and a hefty tip was $50."

I do not know how service is in the dining room, but Nick had my order ready to go when I walked through the door, at the time I told him I needed it.  Excellent service, cant beat it.  I suspect the dining room is run as well.

I live in Vegas and expect great service and excellent food.  Brunos would easily fit in out on Vegas!  Highly recommend!!

Thank you for a very memorable Chistmas Eve meal, Nick!  Keep up the great work."

Ok, now that I have that out of my system.....let me tell you about Bruno&#39;s! Flat-out great service, the owner came out and visited every table, music wasn&#39;t loud, real tablecloths, decent decor. Bread was good, salads were good, the fried artichokes appetizer with lemon ailoli -very good. I had the spaghetti and meatballs which were very moist and tender and the red sauce was nice and spicy (i was getting full so I asked for a box and now I can enjoy the leftovers. The hubs had the linguini with scallops and shrimp which he loved, he had no leftovers! We finished with the chocolate gelato and the limoncello marscapone cake....oh my! Outstanding!

As for the food, we started with the fried polenta in a bechamel sauce with pancetta, roasted tomatoes and fresh spinach.  This was quite enjoyable.  The polenta was perfectly prepared with the right amount of crunch on the outside and still creamy and tender on the inside.

I had the sausage lasagna and my friend had osso bucco.  The osso bucco was a pork shank in a sauce that was not a reduction of the osso bucco pan juices, but more of a thinner broth with mushrooms, spinach and roasted red peppers.  Though it was not a traditional osso bucco by any means, it was still quite flavorful and the portions were quite generous.

My lasagna was a straightforward rendition of the Italian classic.  The sauce was clearly made with a high quality Italian plum tomatoes with just the right amount of garlic.  Though the tomatoes provided a brightness of flavor, it was still very hardy and the bechamel sauce was a nice touch.

The dessert was a house made tiramisu.  Neither of us was impressed by this effort.  It did not taste like it had mascarpone at all, but simply whipped cream.  Also, a higher ration of lady finger to whipped cream ration would have been good.

The wine prices are reasonable, especially by the bottle.  My friend had a glass of Monte Antico Chianti Classico for $7.

The service was attentive, but not hovering.  All the wait staff seemed fairly personable.  Everyone seemed to help out when they noticed we were finished with our plates or low on water.  The service was quite good.

Overall, Bruno&#39;s is definitely worth a visit and we will go back again."

What a suprize to end up at a NOT SO NICE strip mall and find this very nice Italian Bistro, I thought it might of been another pizza joint but to our suprise it is very very nice. We ordered Chicken Marsala, and Clams in a pesto sauce both were just delicious!!!!  Warm toasty bread, a fresh salad with house made dressing. We are thrilled to of found a yummy new place that we will drive the extra 5 miles. Strongly suggest you check it out..Ignore the Dollar store next door."

I found Bruno&#39;s on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We showed up around 6 pm on a Wednesday evening and the place was nearly empty. A gentleman who I can only assume was the owner/manager welcomed us, sat us and took out drink order. He offered to extend the posted &#34;happy hour&#34; for us (which was nice)
In a nutshell- service was great, food was slightly  above average, and I thought the prices were a bit high for what we got. I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca with gnocchi and my wife had the chicken pasta special. My veal was nothing special, but the gnocchi and spinach cream sauce were very good.

This being said:  yesterday i had beyond par very very very good steamed mussels in a white wine sauce, a glass of proper chianti, a tasty caesar, and i great plate of Chicken Marsala for like not that much cash.  At all.  And i&#39;m a cheap bachelor if i don&#39;t have a date on my arm. 

The atmosphere is impressive despite the dreary strip mall atmosphere that encompasses the parking lot of a defunct grocery store location.  Don&#39;t let that trick you--just because the grocery store failed doesnt mean this place isnt fan-friggin-tastic.  It&#39;s well worth a stop.

Final advice:  You are not gonna go broke taking your woman out to this place any night of the week.  Everyone who works there cares that you&#39;re happy.  And the food is very very good and it tastes like it gets care:  not something you get from most Italian restaurants today, which sucks.


I recommend that anyone looking for Italian in this neighborhood give it a go.  Even the unique mix of Sundried tomatoes, garlic cloves,  and kalamata olives sprinkled into the tried-and-true olive oil bread drip was a very welcome unique touch."

i had the four seasons pizza (prosciutto, artichokes, olives, and mushrooms).  it smelled yummy on my drive home, but it wasn&#39;t as tasty as i had anticipated.  i hate to be this harsh, but i honestly think it tasted like a frozen pizza from the grocery store.  i was not a fan of the pizza dough, and the crust was not as thin as i had expected.  i do have to note that i was somewhat misled by the menu on livingsocial, as they had listed it as a thin crust pizza.  and after going to the business&#39;s website, and seeing that it is not specified as thin crust, this is where the discrepancy comes from.  

another thing i wanted to mention was that i went through half the individual pizza before i came across a piece of prosciutto.  can&#39;t really complain though because i was ultimately only responsible for tax and tip."

I was skeptical given the location of Bruno&#39;s but I thought I would keep an open mind - after all I was in the mood for italian. I&#39;ve lived here for 4 years and have yet to be wowed by any italian eateries in Denver thus far. 

With two friends who ordered the special and the chicken marsala, I explained that I, though it may portray me as 12, was going to order the spaghetti and meatballs. You&#39;d think spaghetti and meatballs is one of those things that&#39;s easy to do - oh - no. PLENTY of places try this and screw it up. Bruno&#39;s got it exactly right -- from the start.

We were greeted promptly and had water ready for us before asking. I had a glass of the &#34;house special&#34; pinot noir ($7) which was much better than I was expecting for the price. Shortly thereafter hot bread appeared on the table with olive oil.

Our meals all came with salads which were decent house salads, but what was FANTASTIC was the minestrone my friend had. She graciously offered me some. I told her I would just have one spoonful. After the second spoonful I let them know that this was in fact the best minestrone I have EVER had (sorry mom). 

What made the spaghetti and meatballs so good? Not one thing, but everything. The spaghetti was al dente - so many places don&#39;t cook the pasta properly - it was perfect. The hand-rolled meatballs were just great. And the sauce. I judge most italian places on their red sauce as a central element/necessity. This sauce was clearly homemade and clearly fresh. The spice balance was exact and perfect for the spaghetti and meatballs. Just thinking about it now, I want to go back.

My friends both raved about their meals as well.

The decor is simple and nice. Dressed up enough for a nice evening out, but not stuffy to make you feel uncomfortable. Our service was also excellent and attentive. 

Finally, one of the owners came over to check on us and make sure everything was ok. No, it was not ok. It was excellent.

Give this place a try and see what you&#39;ve been missing out on.

MANGIA!"

But when we got inside the decor was very nice and they were setting our table up.  We were seated and greeted my our waitress, she took our drink orders and we ordered the steamed clams in white wine sauce.  The bread the give you is freshly baked and is awesome to dip in the white wine sauce!  I ordered the chicken marsala with angel hair pasta, my friends ordered the lasagna and the special of the day which was chicken and sausage in a creamy marinara sauce.  My marsala sauce was watery then other places I&#39;ve tried before, the mushroom flavor was there though.  I tried the lasagna and it was pretty good as well and but the special of the day was my favorite out of our three main entrees.  The only reason I give this place a 3 star was the wait for our entree was much longer than we expected, they were a bit backed up but we didnt really mind.  I still have to say this italian restaurant was pretty good!"

The fact that it&#39;s in a strip mall totally goes by the way side after you eat the wonderful food. My snapper with a garlic sauce and sauteed veggies was to DIE for and my husband&#39;s veal parm was absolutely tasty. Another person in our group had chicken and it was prepared to perfection. The kids had spaghetti with homemade meatballs that I couldn&#39;t keep my hands off of ...

The sauces are wonderful, the cocktails were refreshing and made well and the chocolate gelato kicked butt!! The prices are amazing for what you get a great salad with the entrees ...

Table ready for us when we arrived even though the restaurant was packed!  The house had a real heartbeat - it was great, but not overwhelming.  Just what you&#39;d expect from an institution like Hillstone.

We were celebrating a birthday - started with Nicolas Feuillatte Rose champagne.  What a great way to start the night!

Our appetizer was the artichokes - their preparation is classic.  Cooked then charred a bit on their wood fired grill - amazing.  The garlic lemon aioli for dipping was excellent.  Picture attached.

I had the prime filet with a loaded baked - cooked rare and served on a perfectly matched bourbon cream sauce.  Amazing.  The loaded baked was great - but honestly too much!  Should have kept with their recommended mashed (&#34;pommes purée&#34;).  Picture attached.

My wife had the crab cakes - the best crab cakes in Denver.  No filler, all crab!  Need I say more?  Just great.  The accompanying slaw was the perfect light side.

Finished the night with a double latte!  

Overall - service makes the experience and these folks nailed it.  Just plain great, attentive, pleasant service.  Thanks for a great night!"

My friend and I came around 7pm on a Friday night, and knew we&#39;d have to wait for a bit. They let us know the wait would be 45 - 50 minutes.. 

We just hung around the bar area with a couple beers.. after about 30 minutes, they actually offered us a free appetizer for waiting so patiently! They didn&#39;t have to do that, we weren&#39;t upset or even bored, we were having fun chatting with our beers.. but that was a very nice gesture and we really appreciated that. 

The wait staff was superb throughout the entire dinner. :)

My friend and I ordered the fried chicken and french dip and shared the 2 plates. Their portion size is HUGE! You definitely will not have room for dessert hehe. The french dip came with fries and was delicious. I would definitely recommend it. The fried chicken was very unique... it seemed more like tempura shrimp than fried chicken.. the batter was also very different.. some kinda herb and flavor that I couldn&#39;t really recognize. This dish comes with coleslaw and tomatoes. I think it&#39;s a must try, but I don&#39;t think I would order this again. 

Overall, I would rate the food 3.5 but the service definitely bumps it up to a 4! :)"

Years ago Oprah named one of the hamburgers from Houston&#39;s as one of the best in the country...and they are still hitting a home run with their hamburger.

Long story short - if you like the Cherry Creek Grill you&#39;re going to like Hillstone because they are basically fraternal twins - not identical, but close.

Things that are better about Hillstone - parking and they take reservations.   They have French fries (but they aren&#39;t great).  They have some sushi but the prices are ridiculous - makes Sushi Den look like a deal.

Things that are better about Cherry Creek Grill - pretty much everything else.  Better salads, better atmosphere, way better desserts.

I think I prefer Cherry Creek Grill.  Oh - tip to Hillstone - if you can&#39;t afford copper mugs - don&#39;t serve Moscow Mules at these prices.

Bought lunch for three today for a friend&#39;s birthday (mentioned when making the reservation - nada - not even a &#34;happy birthday&#34;) - Two drinks, two glasses of chard for the birthday girl, shared one order of spinach and artichoke dip (good but what&#39;s up with sour cream and bottled salsa on the side plus toast, pita chips, or crackers would be so much better than tortilla chips)?  Two French Dips - excellent as they should be for $19 each.  She just had a smoked salmon appetizer.  So, netted out at $145.  Seems high for lunch to me.

The convenience of parking and reservations might get me back but I much prefer Cherry Creek Grill."

We were in the area, so figured, why not. It was a Friday night so we knew we&#39;d have to wait. Our wait time, we were told, would be 40 minutes, no problem. We actually waited just under 40 minutes. 

The restaurant is cozy, comfortable, and inviting. The interior is dark, but not too dark. I love the interior, how it&#39;s decorated. There are warm browns, tans, blacks. There are several walls with bookshelves in them, and actual books! The majority of the tables are booths, which we really like. There are some tables, but mostly booths. I think booths are more intimate, and cozier and easier for conversations. There is also a bar, with about 10 seats or so.  

The menu is not huge, which is the sign of a good chef. The smaller the menu, the better the quality is of the food. The chef can focus more on the variety of flavors, etc., in the food. The menu for the Hillstone Restaurant is smaller, and it&#39;s excellent.

I couldn&#39;t decide between the fish sandwich or the flying chicken platter. Well, if you know me, you know I LOVE fried chicken. I asked our waiter is opinion, and he loved both. After he told me about the ins and outs of the fried chicken, BINGO!  My husband chose the ribs.

WOW! Neither one of us were disappointed! WOW! I must admit this might have been one of the best fried chicken dishes I have ever had! It was so light and crispy! WOW! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Wait, I have several pieces left over - I&#39;ll see you!

OK, I&#39;ll finish this review first.  

Service - excellent! Nothing else needs to be said.

Parking - there is a small lot, so that helps, otherwise you have to find parking nearby, and this can be hard in the Cherry Creek area.

Another added bonus, there is jazz music played by live musicians, nightly. And no, it&#39;s not loud, it soft and entertaining, in the background.

Will we be back - Oh Yeah!

See you there!"

As for the food, average at best.  I ordered the arctic char fish special with mixed greens and mashed potatoes served on the side.

It was FANTASTIC. Best crab I have EVER had in Denver.   Perfectly cooked, and nice big chunks of crab.   It isn&#39;t cheap, but like I always say, in Denver, cheap seafood isn&#39;t great and great seafood isn&#39;t cheap.

My dad enjoyed his burger.  The french fries were really tasty. ( I didn&#39;t try the burger cuz I don&#39;t eat cow).

Service was pretty good, too.  The iced tea was a bit weak, but that&#39;s sort of a variable depending on what you like.

The wait for our food was a tad long but I chalk this up to the fact that everything was cooked to order and all came hot.

BONUS! The servers are cute :)

I can&#39;t give it four stars because I reserve four stars for the most fantastic of meals...."

We were seated immediately because they had just opened, and our orders came in within 10 minutes. Just goes to show that classy restaurants can have speedy service if no one else is around! I ordered the thai steak salad and my mother ordered the fish sandwich, and both dishes were pretty tasty! The portions were pretty substantial. 

I will say that I&#39;m a little confused by the fact that the restaurant also has sushi on its menu. Is it there just in case people also want sushi rolls with their entree? The rolls themselves don&#39;t look that amazing, so it seems odd to get sushi here if you know you could get sushi elsewhere...at say a sushi restaurant? Just my thoughts."

They were not wearing fleece or Nautica but instead black hoodies and band tee shirts. No khaki pants or Eastland shoes? You&#39;ve come to the wrong neighborhood. I was amazed the hostess didn&#39;t throw them out for those offenses alone. I kept my eye on them to make sure they didn&#39;t start trouble. The taller one ordered the hiramasa roll.

We were pretty lit on the way in which gave a cool 60&#39;s vibe. It was fairly crowded for not a big night. Solid atmosphere, there&#39;s super cool art such as these cloths with rhombus&#39; and such. I did have to listen to Sound of Music&#39;s &#34;My Favorite Things.&#34; though. We both ordered the Hillstone Cheeseburger, which was, for the most part, delicious. I can&#39;t say the same for the 8 dollar side salad which tastes like the grass that&#39;s growing out back. Once we felt satisfied with our entrees we asked for a desert menu, unfortunately they were not able to provide one! We finally settled on the nut/icecream/fudge brownie. It was extravagant yet subtle, if the world subtle really means flamboyant. After finishing our desert, we had to wait for the check to come forever. What would normally be a quick encounter, turned into a great ordeal as the waitress ducked in and out of sight, clearly trying to avoid us.

We love bringing out-of-towners here as well.  From the live jazz to the menu items it is an easy place to recommend.  My favorite thing about Hillstone is that their menu features upscale classics.  You would be hard pressed to find a better French Dip sandwich or fried shrimp platter.  They also have great steaks and sushi.  

Their customer service is amazing.  All of the servers help each other, who takes your order may not be the server who refills your glass or removes your plates.  You can tell they hire professionals from hostess to chef.  

Lunchtime - the real treat is the complimentary, homemade cookies which are plated at the hostess stand.  They are so much more than chocolate chip, more like chocolate chip heaven!!  

The only downside to the Hillstone is that the secret is out.  We rarely attempt eating there without a reservation.  Even on a week night you will be waiting.  My suggestion is to call ahead or to eat during nonconventional hours like before 6 or after 9 PM.  Also worth mentioning that even with two parking lots that horrors of North Cherry Creek parking could deter you from eating at the Hillstone.

My favorite meal is the house keg Cabernet (yes you read that right) a shrimp macadamia roll as an appetizer, and splitting the Hawaiian rib-eye and Fried Shrimp platter with my husband."

I was late being seated but it was fine because my friend was late too. The service was great, everyone else was very friendly, and our waiter let us know the woman from earlier was the general manager, which surprised me given her attitude.

Let&#39;s talk about this FRENCH DIP. If you like french dip, you need to do yourself a favor and go here. I have never had a better french dip than Hillstones. I get it almost every time I go and I&#39;m still not sick of it. 
If i&#39;m trying to get something on the lighter side, the Cashew Kale Salad is my go-to. It&#39;s soooo satisfying and flavorful without any guilt after eating it!

I will start with the hostesses.   There were two - one friendly - one aloof.  When your hostess sets the tone for the patrons as soon as they walk in the door aloofness is not what you want impart upon them.  I get that it&#39;s Cherry Creek, but aloof does not = fancy. 
With that - the other hostess made up for aloof hostess so it was a wash.  

Our server, on the other hand, was excellent.  Friendly, funny and just attentive enough.  The menu was limited especially for the gluten free. I ended up ordering a baked potato and a salad and they were nothing to email home about.  The drinks were fantastic though.  The prices were too high for the quality of the food in my opinion so I wouldn&#39;t go back for dinner - but great drinks and service - I might be back for just those."

Nonetheless we were seated and the waiter was nice. The menu is fairly unoriginal and nothing really screamed out at me. 

I ended up ordering the spicy tuna roll salad. The tuna rolls were good but not spicy and definitely not the best I&#39;ve ever had. The salad was good.

It&#39;s no surprise they have an advertisement for hire on Craig&#39;s List all year long. They can&#39;t maintain a consistent team of people, and that speaks volumes about this company&#39;s business practices and ethical standpoint. True Story: I was told the manager fired a server who had been with the company for a while (shocking) for initiating a hand shake with the owner when he visited the restaurant. It was an illogical, unethical, and shameful thing to do; a glaring representation of Hillstone&#39;s blatant disregard for their employees, bringing to light the fear tactics that they use behind the scenes. Employees are not supposed to initiate physical contact with guests for fear of germs; fine, but to fire an individual for shaking the hand of the owner and stating that he&#39;s pleased to meet him is disgusting. Don&#39;t support these people folks, just don&#39;t... Yuck."

1.  Consistently excellent service.  
2.  Consistently excellent food (only wish the menu changed a bit more frequently.)  
3.  Consistently buzzing atmosphere no matter what time you stop by plus the live music 
4.  Close enough to home to be convenient for any night of the week (when you just don&#39;t feel like cooking.)
Hillstone is also our place to go when we want to have an important conversation.  Lighting is good, booths are private but restaurant is pleasantly loud.  It&#39;s a great place for a romantic meal, celebration with family from out of town, and business meetings.  All around great."

Everything that I have eaten has tasted delicious! I have never been disappointed, unless they didn&#39;t have any more pork chop left! 

My mom and I went to Hillstone for lunch a few weeks ago. Our server was absolutely amazing... Michael C.! He was very attentive, sweet, knowledgable with the food, all around just an awesome server! My mom and I left Hillstone with a little crush on him! 

I will certainly ask for him to be my server in the future! I recommend you do also!"

The food is always good, which is good because it&#39;s also Cherry Creek prices. 
They have Coca Cola from Mexico in bottles though - so cane sugar instead of corn syrup.

My husband and I often go here on Fridays after work to scope of the great people-watching bar scene. After having one or two of their delicious drinks from the bar (and often meeting great interesting people int he process), we get a table for dinner and share any combination of the kale salad (so yummy), some of their roles, and a heartier entree of some sort.  The service is always great from the hostesses, waiters, bartenders to the kitchen staff and mangers. The food is always solid and they are happy to accommodate any special orders.

Plus, you can&#39;t beat the elegant, non-stuffy, yet electric atmosphere on early Friday evenings!

The menu had a lot of variety so everyone in our party was satisfied (unlike Cherry Creek Grill where half of our party couldn&#39;t even find one thing to get).

The food had an Asian flair to it and was all very tasty. I definitely plan on coming back.

PRO-TIP: There&#39;s a parking lot in back so you don&#39;t have to drive around for six hours looking for street parking... I learned that the hard way."

First off I&#39;ve made reservations twice to cut down on wait time and I would highly recommend it. I love the atmosphere, it&#39;s dark and homey feeling. I recently came here from a work dinner and we started with the artichoke which was great. A good starter for everyone to have while choosing a main entree. 

I opted for the fried shrimp, which was awesome. perfect pieces cooked with slaw and 2 dipping sauces. We also shared the shrimp and macadamia nut sushi which I was REALLY hesitant of, but I was happily surprised and had 3 pieces. 

Finally the service, there&#39;s 2-3 people walking around constantly checking on tables making sure the experience is flawless. I&#39;m so happy to find a great staple so close to home."

After having one at their sister restaurant in Napa, I&#39;ve been ruined for the rest of my life. The meat is so tender and just melts in your mouth. It&#39;s easily the best french dip sandwich you&#39;ll ever have.

Of course they have other things on their menu that are delightfully tasty, but it&#39;s always hard to not get the sandwich.

If you love artichokes, ask if they have them when you&#39;re in there! They are an off-menu item, but well worth it when they have fresh ones in the kitchen!"

The food was great and the portions were generous. Our servers were attentive and always made sure that we were content (I made &#39;servers&#39; plural as at any given time we had 2-3 different wait staff milling around us to ensure our satisfaction). They were kind and the service was great- for the most part.

Now, having so many servers around at any given time can be a great thing, yet in our case proved to be a drawback. It was great since we were always attended to. It was a drawback as since each person was different, they&#39;d each reach for our plates to inquire if we were done with our meal yet or not (even if there was food on the plate still). I understand that this is perhaps due to them not knowing that one of their other co-workers had just checked on us. There were about five of us and we were each asked at least four times in succession if we were done and if they could take our plates away. It happened so often it became something of a running joke at our table. &#34;Cover your food! They&#39;re going to take it away!&#34; We felt like we were being rushed out of there, which may have actually been the case since there was a line of people waiting to be sat when we were leaving.

She recommended sushi and we obliged.  We ordered $100 (at least) worth of cuisine.  Upon the anticipation of our check, our server told us that the manager and she had decided to give us our meal FOR FREE.  I was in shock and sublimely surprised - people don&#39;t do that! It was so memorable and special.  Thank you, Hillstone.  You have made your restaurant a landmark and a treasure in the story of our love.

First time there, and waiting for our table (they were a little backed up on the seating, even with reservations), I saw plate after plate of extremely great looking food walking past me from the kitchen to the tables.  

Salads were huge.  Fried shrimp looked like a &#34;next time&#34; order. Everything looked and smelled wonderful.

Several wait persons teamed up on our table, which made us feel welcome and special.

Started with the house smoked salmon appetizer and the chargrilled artichoke.  Both were amazing.

Main course was the prime rib, which was large and flavorful, but nothing as extraordinary as the appetizers.  I should have gone for the lamb or elk.  Just in a prime rib mood that night.

No, really. If the grilled artichoke wasn&#39;t delicious enough (you can use the creamy sauce to dip if you wish, but I loved the spices of the artichoke by itself), my salad sold me on the quality the rest of the way. I had the chicken salad--- and my chicken was BRILLIANTLY ribboned. I never thought I&#39;d enjoy a chicken salad (which I have to eat every day since I am a traveling businesswoman) this much. You don&#39;t even need the dressing. I made it halfway through my salad because this plus the grilled artichoke was so filling. My guest had the French dip which looked top-notch as well.

I&#39;ve been to several Hillstone (nee Houston&#39;s) locations and one thing is certain, they have consistency down.  Thai Steak Salad? Same here as it is at any other location.  Etc.  A concept that works great across a mini chain such as this one.  They even incorporate the occasional menu item (tuna burger anyone?) from other locations under the Hillstone umbrella (Gulfstream, etc) but I&#39;d love for them to bring in that killer salad from R&amp;D.

However, the staff can&#39;t even tell you why the name was changed, after all of the years and brand recognition, from Houston&#39;s to Hillstone aside from the fact that Hillstone apparently have their own wine.  Didn&#39;t know that?  Yeah, neither does anyone else.

Regardless, as either Houston&#39;s or Hillstone they do a damn good, consistent job so that your dish next time is just as good as the last."

They serve soda from glass bottles- no free refills on a coke that cost a couple dollars. My food wasn&#39;t special or tasty. I had a vegetarian burger, which was not seasoned at all. Simply put, the vegetarian burger was a hot mess- It fell apart when I tried to pick it up, requiring me to eat it with a fork. I asked for ranch, but they don&#39;t have ranch in house. 
Hillstone is not for groups, despite taking group reservations- their tables are bolted to the floor and so our group had to sit at separate tables. Overall, my experience at Hillstone overpriced and under par."

The parents were heading back to TX where Crawfish is abundant this time of year... Needless to say I was somewhat disappointed. I&#39;ve been to other Cajun/Viet fusion places in Texas but this one was missing something. 

Mom and I ordered the crawfish and was expecting something a little more spicy. The 1 lb was a good size for 1 person, but might be worth sharing as well. The actual crawfish has a buttery garlic sauce over it and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a bad or a good thing. It&#39;s quiet savory but a little overwhelming. The actual crawfish were a little over boiled as the shells and the meat fell apart as you opened it.

My hubs ordered the Crawfish Étouffée and had a similar experience. The sauce was buttery and not as spice filled as we had hoped. 

Dad ordered the pho and was pretty impressed with the flavor and size of the bowl. You get a hardy portion for the price!

Ultimately no one got sick and we made it to DIA safely.  I might give this place another go...but only if I&#39;m already headed to DIA."

Pulling up I noticed a nice outdoor patio and ample parking. The inside is clean and large with multiple televisions just as you&#39;d expect from any good sports bar. It was right during the lunch hour rush and there were only 3 patrons in the whole restaurant.  I sat down and was greeted instantly by the bartender who handed me a menu and brought me a glass of water. I looked over the menu and decided on my order...I make my order only to find out that the two items I wanted aren&#39;t available; not because they were out, but because they never had them to begin with...ok let&#39;s try again.  I decide to go with the boiled crawfish, can&#39;t go wrong with that right?  Unlike other seafood boil places there doesn&#39;t seem to be any flavor menus or choices for the boils, not even a spice level. I get my crawfish about 10 minutes later and it looks amazing! I begin to dig in only to discover that the crawfish lack any sort of flavor or seasoning. I mean they&#39;re covered in some sort of sauce but there&#39;s no flavor to it at all. I was very disappointed with the dish but impressed with the service. Maybe this place is still going trough growing pains but for the time being I won&#39;t be back.

A buddy and I have probably had pho around 15 times over the past 9 months. We saw reviews here when it came up on a Yelp search and decided to try it. My buddy loved it. I was on the fence. The rice noodles had the right doneness and chew to them. The meat was flavorful. However, for me the broth wasn&#39;t complex at all. I always like to see what the base broth is like before adding sriracha, hoisin, chile peppers, basil, sprouts, or lime. It just tasted bland to me.

The waiter did say though before the pho came out that it was taking a while since they just started a new batch of broth so maybe it didn&#39;t have the time for the flavors to really deepen. I&#39;ll probably give this place another visit the next time I&#39;m in the area."

Their most popular item is the wonton nachos and they certainly are worth the hype!  Shrimp po boy is delicious, the shrimps are fried to perfection! Very crispy yet light and airy. The gumbo is also good, and due to popular demand, they now come in two sizes!  This place probably has the crispiest fries in town!  Crab cakes are a must!  Cannot wait to try their crawfish boil once it&#39;s in season. My favorite is probably the seafood pasta. The sauce is very rich and creamy.  But wait...there&#39;s more...let&#39;s not overlook the Vietnamese side...their pho is very underrated in my opinion. The com dac biet (rice combination) comes with grilled pork chop, grilled beef short ribs, shrimp, an egg roll, with a side of veggies is definitely hearty and fills you up! Be sure to check out the chef&#39;s special for some pretty good, delectable, delicious concoctions.  They also have soft shell crab baos, crab cake and soft shell crab po boys.

Though it&#39;s a family restaurant, they also open late on Thursday-Sunday to cater to the night owls. They have karaoke nights on Thursdays.  Also I believe there&#39;s poker here on Tuesdays."

I came mid day and got a bowl with rare steak (the #7).  The broth was pretty good, I&#39;ll admit, but the serving of rice noodles was less than half of what I&#39;m used to. Also the &#34;rare&#34; steak was grey and stiff. I get the vibe that it had been cooked, then saved in a freezer. I did get a healthy serving of veggies though, which is okay. 

Pretty early into my meal I realized that there were no napkins on the table, at all. My waitress was too busy chatting at the bar to check in on me, so I didn&#39;t get to ask for them until I was also asking for the check.

Pho is 9 dollars and you have no choice in the size of the bowl, the bowl they bring is closer to a small/medium in most other establishments. My girlfriend ordered the 1 lb wing appetizer, and they were naked, over fried, and obviously frozen when dropped in the fryer, very dry, and bland tasting. Did not try the wonton nachos everyone raves about, but try at your own risk. My biggest issue with tonight would have to have been the service. My girl ordered a patron margarita, the waitress carded my girl, never brought the drink. Waters were never once refilled, and I never received the small dipping dish for the bowl of pho. Specials were not explained to us, but were to the couple seated behind us. Overall, just not an experience worth repeating. If I want pho I&#39;ll still hit up Pho 888, or Pho Duy II. If I want boiled crawfish and Cajun style seafood, I&#39;d hit the Crawlin Crab. So disappointed with this place, and the terrible service.

Authentic? Well...  Not exactly, but good enough for being so far from Cajun Country.  They also have sweet tea which is a big plus. If you are going to have southern-style cooking, sweet tea is a must.

I was disappointed to find out that they do not serve cornbread with their food or offer some sort of cobbler for dessert.  Then again, If you didn&#39;t know this already, this is a Cajun/Vietnamese fusion restaurant; two styles of food that, at least in my book, are not meant to complement one another. Then again, others have told me that their Vietnamese food is quite good too so, in all fairness, I guess I should reserve judgement until I have had a chance to try it too.

Service was top notch; which is to be expected since we were one of the only two table with customers.  Nonetheless, credit is due where it is earned and the young man who tended to us did a magnificent job of making us fell very welcome.

This is certainly a restaurant to which I will soon return."

My husband ordered the crab cakes and crawfish fried rice and we ordered chicken tenders for my son. My Gumbo had a great flavor with some spice, but a little salty.

When we got there, we were probably one of only a half-dozen tables filled. Still it took way too long for our food to arrive. And when it did, oh geez.  Lobster ravioli for $12 consisted of about 6 ravioli, nothing else. They were way too salty, and I swear it was closer to crab than lobster. The gumbo...meh. I&#39;m from the southeastern part of the country, so maybe my standards are different. In any event, my recommendation is this: If you&#39;re overnighting in the area to catch a plane and cannot bring yourself to eat fast food that dominates this part of town, find a grocery store and buy yourself from fruit."

The &#34;garlic bread&#34; was disgusting!  It tastes like cardboard and not to mention the four thumb size pieces.  My niece had the gumbo- you could tell its premise and has been sitting in a pot for days, maybe even weeks for customers to order.

Yabby hut is our favorite restaurant and this is sooo much closer to home! The flavor was great, but the quality of the seafood left something to be desired. It was almost double the price of the boils at similar restaurants. My husband got the shrimp boil, which was so overlooked he literally couldn&#39;t peel the shrimp. When he asked for a new batch (which we don&#39;t do, but he couldn&#39;t get them to peel enough to eat!) we were told &#34;the chef said they were cooked fine, he won&#39;t make you more. It&#39;s the quality of the shrimp, not how they were cooked&#34;. So.... that was that. They may have a few good dishes, and are on the right track, but if they are knowingly selling bad quality food, the price should be reflective of that."

I was intrigued by the Yelp reviews and Cajun/Asian fusion. However, after arriving and scanning the menu there was really nothing fusion about it. They have Cajun food.. they have pho.. and they have wonton chip nachos with crawfish. But whatever, we were hungry so we ordered the shrimp po boy and gumbo. 

Granted gumbo is thick to start off, there was a layer of coagulation when it arrived as if it had been sitting for a while. I took a sip and it was SO SO SO SALTY. I never send food back but this was unbearably salty. I let the lovely server know and she took it back. By then I was in no mood to reorder and risk another poor experience. My bf&#39;s shrimp po boy was fine -- they give a generous amount of shrimp and the flavored mayo complimented the sandwich.

Overall, not impressed. The food isn&#39;t even fusion, so I&#39;d prefer to go to an authentic Vietnamese or Cajun restaurant instead."

I was excited to learn about this restaurant. I am a big fan of both Vietnamese and Cajun food. This restaurant offered what seemed to be a great opportunity - namely a po boy sandwich, perhaps with some Asian flare. A while ago, I tried such a sandwich down in New Orleans. Killer Po-Boys at Conti and Bourbon in the French Quarter, yielded a tremendous  po boy sandwich that was loaded with unusual and delicious ingredients like daikon, radish, and other pickled vegetables on top of the po boy. This was not that sandwich. Unfortunately, my sandwich was simply fried shrimp, a slice of tomato, and wilted iceberg lettuce. There was nothing unusual, nor Asian, nor delicious about this. Service was good, and very timely. No complaints there. But, I would not return to this restaurant, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Darn shame, for I will still continue to try and find a good po boy in Denver."

The blackened catfish was also fabulous but the plain rice detracted from the dish. We unamously thought this place is a keeper. Hope they stick around and take some menu tips from Yabby Hutt. Bring on the oysters on the half shell and the baby clams and I think they will see the same success."

The Good: the food was delicious and reasonably priced. The Bad: Service. 

Once we sat down we didn&#39;t have menus for 20 minutes even after asking one of the (admittedly busy) waitstaff. Then, it took another 20 minutes for them to come back for our order for food and drinks. For a table of 3, they forgot to bring out one coffee to start, and once they brought drinks out, nobody ever stopped by to offer refills on coffee or water. When we ordered, only half the dishes we ordered made it to the table, and when we stood up to pay and asked for the no-shows to be taken off, the staff insisted that they brought them out, and we had to negotiate for a reduced bill when the cashier denied there was any problem at first. 

This was on a Sunday morning, and it was extremely busy, but we still only got serviced when we could flag down a passing waiter and we were there for nearly an hour before we had our food. I feel like such a quaint breakfast place with a home-y vibe was really missing out on their opportunity to complete the experience with quality service."

The chicken fried steak was not overly salty and quite tasty. The gravy complimented it nicely. Th side of 2 pancakes were very fluffy and perfect flakiness on outside.

The hash browns with the omelette and chicken fried steak were cooked crispy flaky on outside, as it should be.

The blueberry french toast made from muffins were so very moist and so very very tasty!!!

All for $38 including the OJ the hubby ordered.

Barely any room for anything else so the bacon and eggs pretty much go on top of the pancakes.  I think the special was under $8.  
He got the mushroom swiss omelet with bacon.  Their menu isn&#39;t large, but the specials give you more insight on what ingredients can go in an omelet if you want to change it up.  The bacon was crispy and thin and the scrambled eggs were cooked properly.  The service was friendly.

The clientele is not quite the yuppie/hipster crowd at the local breakfast places; it&#39;s a very different feel.

As for the food, it&#39;s just a few steps above mediocre, but it&#39;s not disappointing. I had pancakes and green chili  (admittedly odd combination) and the portions were fair but not huge. The pancakes were fluffy and yummy. Dennis ordered the polish sausage dish, but apparently they were struggling to source polish sausage and were serving chorizo instead.

Old school feeling inside with a low bar on one side, booths on the other side and tables in the middle.  You pay up front at an old register.  Feels like a family run operation.

We both got the Ron&#39;s or Rod&#39;s Special, I can&#39;t remember now.  It came with two eggs any style, two pancakes, sausage, bacon, and cheesy hash browns (see the pic).  Does this sound like enough food for you?  It was just what we needed, nothing fancy just a delicious breakfast.  We inhaled our breakfast.  I had perfectly cooked over easy eggs, the pancakes were something we could make at home but completely delicious, shredded hash browns to add to the carbo load and rounding out the plate were the two sausage patties and the two slices of crispy bacon.  

This was exactly what we were looking for this morning.  A cheap, and tasty breakfast.  Service was good, and you can tell this is where the regulars hang out.

2.5 stars would have been my vote, but I just cant give this place even 3 stars.

The place is dated and not in a cute, charming, how cool is that 50&#39;s diner kinda way.  It is dated because the last updating that has occurred was prolly in the 50&#39;s! I am all for retro and deco, but when it&#39;s just plain old and used then I am not going to get too excited.

This place has ZERO health consciousness points. Nothing for Gluten-free diners to enjoy. This is a greasy spoon serving low quality food at low prices.  Is it gross? NO! Not gross at all, just nothing whatsoever to rave about.

In an area full of new, hip, creative dining spots that take food quality seriously, I have to say that 20th St Cafe is blah and really nothing special.  

I cannot get too excited about pasteurized OJ, white bread, and 1 penny hormone filled eggs. Sorry this is just a cute very of Dennys when it comes to the low grade foods being served here.

Bonus points for cheap prices, decent service, and I must admit the breakfast fried rice was especially tasty!"

There&#39;s something magical about that diner coffee and perfectly cooked hash browns that really get him going in the morning and so on a lazy (for us) Saturday morning our family trio headed to 20th Street Cafe with visions of hash browns (Nick), pancakes (Ephraim), and bacon (that&#39;s me) dancing in our heads. And 20th Street certainly delivered.

We actually ended up ordering blueberry muffin French toast for the table, which is as sugary sweet as it sounds. And my simple breakfast of eggs and bacon were a great savory accompaniment to it. The two fellas in my life were also pleased as punch with their eats. And true to the diner expectations we were in and out of there in a flash.

If you are in the mood for a great diner breakfast or lunch I&#39;d definitely recommend 20th Street Cafe. Our family will for sure be heading back there next time pancakes, hash browns and bacon are on our mind. So, you know, next weekend..."

You could make a great breakfast for little cost and relatively little time but it&#39;s your day off and you are feeling lazy, maybe a bit hungover, so you go out to eat. It is mostly the same wherever you go. I like that. I could eat a hearty breakfast everyday but I usually only have time once a week. What I don&#39;t have time for is a 45 min wait at Snooze, Jelly, or whatever trendy hang out you think has reinvented the breakfast wheel. 

What Jim Gaffigan says about Mexican food is even more true of breakfast food, &#34;it&#39;s great, but it&#39;s all the same.&#34; But what about marscapone on my french toast and twelve eggs Benedict options that are all cleverly named? I&#39;m good with butter on my pancakes and toast, and two eggs and two pieces of toast is a fine substitute for stacking one of each and topping it with some lukewarm hollandaise. I don&#39;t want to pay $15 per entree because the trendy place figured out how to put an egg yolk and some butter in a blender. 

Side note: if you want to make the same type of hollandaise as your favorite trendy breakfast place just put an egg yolk and a bit of lemon juice in a blender. Slowly add simmering hot butter while the blender is running. It takes 5 minutes. 2 minutes if you use a microwave to heat the butter. 

Breakfast, which is by nature almost always basic, is not worth waiting 45 minutes for or paying $20 per person for. Save your money and go get a great and inspired dinner that night instead.

I go to breakfast because I don&#39;t want to cook and I don&#39;t want to wait. I am not going to wait and pay extra because the restaurant has some uninspired and copied twists on the breakfast basics. I will go to a diner or someplace fast and relatively cheap. 

20th Street Café fits the bill and their food is better than most diners. Their breakfast fried rice is pretty good too and more original than most of the crap at the trendy breakfast places. If they cut the portion of the fried rice down a bit, put the rice in an oversized bowl, and squirted it with some Sriracha (or other random Asian ingredient) aioli (just mayo btw and most places don&#39;t make it from scratch because the masses fear raw eggs) then a trendy breakfast spot could call it Tim&#39;s Thai Breakfast Bowl, charge $16 for it, and for $3.50 more they could throw in a whole piece of tender belly bacon. What a deal. 

Eat here for breakfast. You won&#39;t wait, you won&#39;t be overcharged, and you won&#39;t regret it."

This place is the real deal.  I am giving it a 4/5 simply because its a great place, and a place I always want to go to, but there may be fancier options if you like standing in lines (which I don&#39;t)

There is nothing fancy, over the top, snooty (snoozy?), pretentious.... This is straight up solid food, good prices, good coffee, and good service.  By a family run establishment that&#39;s been in the hood for 70 years.

Their pancakes are some of the best I&#39;ve had and their bacon is great (a true measure of any breakfast haunt) while not quite Tender Belly level.   They have blueberry French toast that my wife and friends rave about. 

There is rarely a line, or a wait to sit down, your food comes fast, the coffee is refilled often, and the staff are friendly and can be quite entertaining.    

With that said, you wont find tofu dishes, artisanal maple syrup, organic this, gluten free that, etc...   This is real food made by real people for people who like eating tasty things, who don&#39;t want to stand in a 2 hour line for it."

We were visiting friends who live around the corner and got the tip from Yelp to come here for some great greasy spoon inspired breakfast. After visiting, we decided that if we every move to Denver we probably need to be close to this spot.  Straight up, if we lived in the area, I&#39;d probably come here three times a week.

Inside this modest diner there was seriously some magic going on. Small dig reminiscent of the neighborhood diner from the 50&#39;s. I imagine seeing grandpa, dad and sons come in here is a regular occurrence - you just get a good vibe coming through the door. You&#39;re greeted by folks who I&#39;m sure have worked here for some time and while things are a little cramped, it means you get to survey what the food looks like. The atmosphere is totally chill as we ended up talking with our food neighbors about their breakfast choices - very helpful!

Solid coffee with plentiful refills to start out. The offering for breakfast were pretty epic and ranged from standard eggs and toast to some great new takes on my favorite first meal of the day. For me it came down to breakfast fried rice and a smothered breakfast burrito. Das burrito won out and it was quite amazing. A farm wonderland smothered in a green sauce that after tasting, I would consider using at cologne if only to experience it throughout the day. Da wife got the blueberry pancakes which was equally amazing. Thick enough to be the top to a giant muffin, but fluffy enough to sleep on if you like sleeping on pancakes.

Service was excellent and the prices were great. We got out for ~$20 and had some of the best breakfast we&#39;d had in a long time. In addition to all the greatness that made this place so memorable, I love that it&#39;s the sort of spot that you can go give the cooks a hi-five and tell them how good things were when you&#39;re done.

It&#39;s a pretty standard diner/cafe menu, with a surprising Asian twist! The prices are very low, considering the large amount of food you get. The only thing that would make it more hangover-worthy would be an alcohol menu.  The bottomless coffee will suffice, though!

The staff is very friendly! Yet, they are also the reason for the 4/5 instead of 5/5 rating. The same two waitresses are there every morning and neither of them can ever remember to bring out my toast. I know, I know... This is ridiculous, but it happens every single time - without a doubt. It&#39;s starting to weigh on me.  

Toast aside, this place is terrific! Check it out!"

This is one of the GREAT breakfast places. Good ole dinner breakfast. Your eggs cooked perfect (for me over easy...and you would be surprised how many places can&#39;t do eggs over easy), biscuits and gravy to die for, and while their steak is not a steakhouse steak...it is a very good steak. 20th Street Cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places in the city."

We headed to Snooze and Syrup and both had 60-90 minute waits when we arrived. I don&#39;t care how amazing the food is, that is too darn long to wait! 

I continued to peruse Yelp and came across 20th Street Cafe. Short wait to be seated, good prices on their menu, and not too far from where we were: seemed perfect!

Clearly a lot of other people had the same idea because they were slammed. You could tell the workers were stressing to get everything done, but they were still so polite, courteous and attentive. Our food came out in a completely reasonable amount of time and everything was great!

If I make it back this way, I would definitely go again!"

 Once we ordered waitress returned 10 minutes later to ask if we were in a hurry because the eggs and toast I ordered would take a while cause it was lunch time (12:10).  So I changed my order to a ham and cheese.  If they&#39;d taken our order when we arrived (11:35) I wonder if it would have still been breakfast time.

We are young, we like to dress nice, we like to drink, but we (my boyfriend and myself) just needed something really different than the pretentious Denver weekend-morning scene. I didn&#39;t want a specialty mimosa, I didn&#39;t want an hour long wait, and I didn&#39;t want mediocre breakfast with stellar presentation. I just wanted good food for a good price, and a lot of it. I gave my boyfriend a few choices and he ultimately picked 20th Street Cafe because of the picture on this Yelp page of the breakfast burrito. He got that, I got a 2 egg (sunny side up) and bacon with hashbrowns and toast. It only took a few bites for my boyfriend to declare their breakfast burrito the best in Denver (and he orders them pretty much everywhere, so this is high praise). I tried a bite and it was definitely amazing, thick chunks of sausage and their green chile is on point. My hashbrowns were easily the best I&#39;ve had in Denver, as well- just basic, well cooked hashbrowns. Eggs were only cooked so-so but that would be my only complaint. Service was amazing, some of the friendliest people work here. Joint is a little run down but it&#39;s a hole-in-the-wall breakfast place, something you would expect to find in a mountain town is probably the best comparison. I wish they had more options because we would be here every weekend, but it&#39;s pretty much a breakfast burrito, biscuits and gravy, and some combination of eggs and breakfast meat or pancakes. Regardless, we will definitely be back. Especially whenever my boyfriend craves a breakfast burrito which pretty much means we will be back every weekend regardless of menu size."

Comparable to the Breakfast King, but the portions are better here and I have never seen a wait. Prices are actually a little cheaper. There is no free parking though. There&#39;s a cheap lot next door ($2 parking all day on weekends) and meter parking on the street. 

I really like how they do Chicken Fried Steak here especially. Gravy and sides are generous. Smothered Breakfast burritos are also excellent (though the Chorizo burrito at Breakfast King is still a little better in my opinion).

Service is great. Everyone is friendly and responsive. Only real complaint is the hours...they close very early on weekends (1:30), and like most places off the 16th street mall, keep bankers hours during the week. Unlike Breakfast King, this really is a *breakfast* diner. Which is too bad...if this place were open later I would go there a lot more often."

Food was OK, not great, but priced accordingly. I had the breakfast burrito, and did not leave hungry. Some menu items seemed a touch out of place with the Asian influence, but they seem popular (breakfast fried rice?)

Contrary to some other reviews here, J and I didn&#39;t think the coffee was bad--we had several refills, too. Also contrary to some of the reviews, which might have been older, we didn&#39;t think it was super cheap, and the menu has definitely changed from one of the photos posted here on yelp. It wasn&#39;t super expensive, but J&#39;s breakfast fried rice was close to $8 which I didn&#39;t think was outrageous, but not cheap either.

I had the two eggs, hashbrowns and toast. That was under $5, but it&#39;s also about the same price at Pete&#39;s Kitchen.

We did like that several guys from Root Sports showed up for breakfast before the Rockies game and definitely seemed to be regulars at this cafe. The sense of community was nice to see. 

J also thought that I needed to visit the restroom before we left. The restrooms are back next to the kitchen, or a bit in the kitchen; so, it was interesting, I guess.

I used to pass this place all the time during my commute. I would be stopped on the corner of 20th &amp; Larimer, right next to the Buddhist temple, the adult bookstore, and the Blue Feather. Whatever that is.

Anyway, I&#39;d always see the sign for the 20th Street Cafe, and I&#39;d say to myself, &#34;Self? That looks exactly like the kind of place we should check out. It looks awesome. Awesome, it looks.&#34;

Well, one day I tried it!

And it was friggin awesome!

It&#39;s the most perfect hole-in-the-wall, greasy spoon diner in all of Denver. There are a couple of 24-hour diners in town, such as the Denver Diner, that are trying so hard to be what 20th St. is.

What it is, is an unpretentious, no attitude, no waiting, no fuss, all friendliness, quick service, simple fare, good food, cozy atmosphere kind of diner that is the bee&#39;s knees, the cat&#39;s pajamas, and the cat&#39;s meow.

ANECDOTE!

Just now I was typing away and my girlfriend says, &#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34;

&#34;Yelping.&#34;

&#34;Yelping what?&#34;

&#34;20th Street Cafe.&#34;

In a sudden throaty, breathy, sexy voice, she purrs, &#34;I LOVE THAT PLACE.&#34;

ANECDOTE!

I wrote a review of the cafe earlier, but Yelp deleted it. For reasons. But in that review, I gave 20th St. a 1-Star review. Because &#34;I&#39;m trying to bring down the rating so nobody else finds out about the best breakfast diner west of the Mississippi.&#34;

ANECDOTE!

I took my friend here, and her three year old instantly developed good manners, good posture, and proper dental hygiene!

Try everything on the menu! And try the pancakes!"

A little hole in the wall it&#39;s way quieter than Snooze up the street, without the wait or homeless people asking you for money. Just come in and sit down.
The place just feels like what you&#39;d think of when you think of a diner, pleather seats and all. The waitresses are always around to offer to refill your drinks and it has its group of regulars and locals. On Broncos days everyone wears their Broncos attire and its all about football.
I love the steak and eggs here and my wallet loves the prices. I always bring visitors when they&#39;re in town.
The only weird thing is having to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, not sure how sanitary that is...
Overall, this place is a diamond in the rough (just don&#39;t tell everyone up the street, I like being able to get a seat right away). 
Also, they aren&#39;t open on Mondays."

This place serves up honest, fresh, well priced food that just blows most every other breakfast spot in town out of the water.

Sit at the bar, chat with Lou and just prepare to indulge in great food prepared by chef Rod Okuno who makes an amazing Loco Moco, unreal breakfasts, and just honest, tasty food.  I love the Asian flare and will be back to try the fried rice.  The atmosphere is warm, inviting and a home away from home.. I always look forward to my next visit.

Food review:  I haven&#39;t been to this little gem in quite a few years.  It was good to be back for sure.  Tried out the country fried steak which was generally good but it did use brown gravy instead of white which I tend to prefer on country fried steak.  The mashed potatoes, peas, and carrots were pretty standard.  Nothing to really note about those.  Same unfortunately is to be said about the peach cobbler that was generally OK.  I was really torn between 3 and 4 stars here.  The meals here kind of give you that feeling of a good ole home cooked meal but that being said, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean it was great.  Just... satisfactory.

Service?  Friendly

Other thoughts:  Definitely want to give 20th one more try to have some meatloaf."

The waitresses/staff. Really friendly and you just know they&#39;ve been there for decades. 

The atmosphere - booths and a great linoleum bar with small stools to sit at.

The location - not 10 blocks from my front door and NO LINES like at Snooze - a great alternative if you don&#39;t want to stand around waiting for an hour for some pancakes.

The prices - CHEAP!

Not so great things about 20th Street: 

How my stomach felt post meal /:

All things considered, 20th street is a great little spot to have a cheap, slightly greasy meal and drink up some old school Denver vibes."

You certainly don&#39;t need a reservation on Thursday morning.  You&#39;ll be the only one there, besides me.

The old neon style street sign burned an image of good breakfast in my mind as I parked right out front on the street.

The restaurant is a classic, sit down and drink coffee all morning long type atmosphere.  Low stool type bar up front, table and chairs in the mid section and a row of booths against the wall.  Nothing fancy, just a good place to eat.

The restroom is a portal through the kitchen to take a peak and see how your eggs are being cooked.  Trivial Pursuit cards are stashed in between the sugar and creamer packets.  Surprisingly great coffee and local waitresses chatting it up as you wait for your breakfast.

The typical breakfast food is served until 11:00pm.  I ordered the breakfast burrito smothered in green chili and was very happy with it.  I always find if a breakfast place can nail the breakfast burrito along with the smother of green chili, they are good at everything they make.  [I also rate Mexican restaurants on how good their tamales are.]  I actually plan to go back and get it again soon.

Most downtown breakfast places are VERY pricey and over rated.  20th Street Cafe does not have any smoke and mirrors, it is plain good food.  Take a few minutes and venture off the touristic area and get some semi-home cookin&#39;."

I went for breakfast last week and got 2 eggs over easy with bacon, hash browns, pancakes, and coffee. $12 including tip. 

The pictures on the menu are awful, and definitely don&#39;t do the place justice. Hard to mess up my order and since it was my first time, I didn&#39;t even notice the specials board. Bummer! 

The coffee is awesome (I drink it black). They have every kind of hot sauce imaginable. However my pancakes were nothing special, and tasted burned. The staff is friendly. Everything was typical for my visit to a small diner, and I&#39;ll definitely go back to try the specials."

My wife had the pancakes (she is a pancake snob) and loved them. I had a Hawaiian dish called Moco-Loco. It consisted of a bed of rice, a huge hamburger patty, two eggs my style, all covered with gravy.  It was pretty tasty and all for a meager amount of money.   The next time we go I plan on trying the Breakfast Fried Rice.  

Keep in mind that the food is not fancy, but it is solid and one of the better deals-for-the-money that we have been able to find. We&#39;ll definitely make this a regular haunt."

The staff is fabulous! Super friendly, helpful and on top of the crowds. My water wasn&#39;t as full as I usually like, but they were a great group of ladies.

The menu is pretty basic. Greasy spoon type of choices. The breakfast choices looked pretty tasty, but they only served through 11am. Ah well.
But they do server the breakfast burrito (smothered in green chili) all day. It sure looked good! My lunch partner chose that and wow, nummies!

I went with the basic cheese burger. I saw a lot of other people going with the reuben and mmmm that looked good too! They serve most things with chips and a pickle. 

Definitely cheap eats! I might have to just do a late breakfast instead of lunch some day!!"

It was the bacon that put it in the pretty good (versus mediocre) category. The bacon was crisp and actually had a good deal of meat (versus fat) on it. The green chili is fairly mild. If you&#39;re looking for spicy, you&#39;ll need to add some hot sauce or something. The blueberry French toast was actually just a battered and grilled blueberry muffin. I kind of felt $6 was a bit overpriced for a muffin. Don&#39;t those things usually go for $1-2? Also, $2 for coffee at a diner? Is that typical?

I like the staff. They&#39;re warm and friendly and it feels like family. The place may be a bit old and run down, but I felt comfortable there. It has Cheers potential -- where everybody knows your name."

So todays lunch was down to three new places to try: Gastro Cart, Organixx, &amp; 20th Street Cafe.  I presented my friend with all his options and he selected 20th Street Cafe; off we went.

It&#39;s a very small restaurant that aesthetically has not had an upgrade in decades but the place was PACKED when we came in.  Seats were easy to find at the bar but forget getting a table or a booth a lunch time unless you arrive early.  

We saddle on up to the lunch bar and we are immediately greeted by one of the two waiteress running the cafe.  Drinks served, free dinner rolls with butter, orders placed, and now to relax until lunch shows up.

I got the breakfast burrito because I have been craving non-sweet breakfast foods due to the cold weather.  My friend got the Corn Beef Hash.  Both dishes were fantastic!  We also ordered a hamburger to go for a co-worker and a previously mentioned piece of chocolate cream pie to go.  Total:  $21!  Are you kidding me!!!

We left the nearby museum and were really, really hungry.  For some reason Hot Dogs were sounding good, so we narrowed it down to this place and one other.  Luckily we ended up here!  

The menu is awesome.  Full of a ton of different flavors.  We ended up with a Hatch and a Vietnam, both recommended by the employee working.  We also got a side of tots with sriacha aioli on them for a total of around $22.

The food came out pretty quick, and we were excited to eat.  The sausages are on a yummy french baguette that was a perfect size.  Sometimes sandwiches served in baguettes have just too much bread to handle, but this ratio was perfect.  They are split in half as well, so you can easily exchange halves with someone if you want.  The tots were a generous size as well, perfect for splitting with two people.

The Hatch was fantastic.  I have no idea when hatch chiles started getting popular, but lately they seem to be everywhere.  They have an amazing taste that I really enjoy.  This perfectly complimented the sausage.  Delicious melted pepper jack cheese and some cabbage rounded out the sausage.  It was delicious.

Then I tried the Vietnam.  This was a radically different flavor from the Hatch, but still just as good.  It has a Thai chili lemongrass sausage, asian slaw, and some sriacha aioli among other things.  This one was good, unique, and delicious.  

The tots were amazing.  Perfectly cooked through and covered in sriacha aioli.  There were amazing, and are a must order.  I want a jar of this aioli.  

The Colorado Buffalo sounded really good as well.

Overall this was an amazing meal.  We were both really, really happy that we ended up here.  I find myself craving it a day later and will probably want it more and more as time goes by.  This will definitely be one of the places I stop on future visits to Denver."

I love the flavors of the sandwiches - top two are hatch and buffalo. The Vietnam provides a great change of pace. Frankly, I believe I&#39;ve tried them all and enjoyed them. The fresh fried chips are also a great companion to the meal. The service is good, with the owners still closely involved. In fact, if you go at lunch, that&#39;s usually one of the owners taking your order. There is nothing like keeping an owner involved that helps maintain a business&#39; quality. 

I don&#39;t remember why I went with 4 stars in first review, maybe seating. But for me The Uber Sausage is one of the best establishments in Denver and a big time 5 in my book!"

Because of the service. The guy at the counter was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout all of dinner. Awesome service. 

My friend got The Club and said it was really tasty. I split The Farm in a tortilla with my sister and found it to be okay. They ran out of mushrooms, so it was subbed with other veggies they had available. I&#39;m thinking the mushrooms would have complemented the sandwich/wrap very well, but the wrap was okay, nonetheless. If I ever get the chance to stop by again, I think I would try the fish sandwich.

We got an order of tots with no toppings and they were really crispy! I think the toppings would be something to try next time. (Perhaps, the sriracha aioli?!)

I had already went to Uber Eats the day before for lunch and was really impressed with the sandwich! 

I love all the different options you can have here, so I went with the vietnam. I had already carbed up on breakfast, so this time I went with the salad option.

Very affordable and the ingredients were very tasty.  The dog was made very carefully with all ingredients spread evenly and really just pretty.

First of all, don&#39;t blink or you&#39;ll miss this place. Tiny joint with no more than a dozen seats; don&#39;t let it fool you though. Friendly staff and a clean place. 

If you&#39;re not sure how to filter through the delicious menu, they&#39;ll help. Also, I&#39;ll help - get the Vietnam. Damn good, bold, balanced flavor served on a freshly baked baguette. The Hatch is also a winner, but I&#39;m personally over the green chili trend."

The staff were very kind and responsive to any questions we had. We ordered the vegetarian and the Vietnam. Both were good, and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the warm evening. 

The bread the sandwiches were served on was quite good, and the ingredients in the vegetarian sandwich tasted fresh. The Vietnam sandwich had pickled vegetables in it, and though it wasn&#39;t as flavorful as a banh mi, it had a nice crunch and went well with the sausage.

Parking was along the street but wasn&#39;t hard to find on a weekday afternoon.  The location is near the city park area.  The restaurant is small, mostly counter space and a couple of small tables with cute log trim.  However, tons of outdoor seating.  We opted to sit indoors since it had just snowed the day before and it was still a little brisk in my opinion, but who am I to judge, I&#39;m a climate- spoiled wuss from the Bay Area.  The menu has a pretty wide selection of different sandwiches but we still asked for recommendations from the guy behind the counter (his picks?  The Hatch, the Vietnam).  We went with the Hatch and tater tots.  One sandwich was enough for a light lunch for both of us, and this was an amazing sandwich -- spicy sausage, chiles to give it a kick, crusty French bread, cabbage slaw and cilantro, and crema fresca.

I&#39;d recommend this as a nice place to eat, particularly when it&#39;s warm enough to sit outside.

Lafayette is so saturated with good food, and Denver by comparison, well, isn&#39;t. To say I&#39;ve had a rough time finding local places to enjoy a good meal here in Denver would be a grand understatement. But hey, it food options are literally the ONLY thing my old hometown has over my new one, I&#39;ll accept the situation as such, and deal with it, as I have been.

I prefaced this review with that because I want you all to know how genuinely happy I am to have found out about and dine at The Uber Sausage. It gives me hope that there are at least another handful of places this good here in Denver. There has to be, right? I surely hope so, because The Uber Sausage is one of the best places I&#39;ve eaten, not just in Denver, but anywhere. I was really blown away by how good each and every sandwich i had from there was. I believe to date I&#39;ve had seven of the dozen or so special sausage sandwiches they offer.

Each sandwich of totally different and each an individual experience as a meal, which is something you don&#39;t often see at &#34;specialty&#34; places, even though you should. I was taken aback by what each sandwich included and how the ingredients meshed together in beautiful symphonies of taste. There are some truly amazing combinations of meats and veggies in these sandwiches that may force you to do a double take at the menu, then realize the genius behind them after you take your first bite. The guys here certainly know what they&#39;re doing with that menu of theirs.

Besides the extremely high quality of their sandwiches, their customer service is top notch. These guys are some of the friendliest food workers I&#39;ve ever seen. You can tell they know they&#39;re making quality product and pleasing people with each order and it really shows when the guy working over a hot grill for long lengths of time still retains a huge smile on his face. They will go above and beyond to be friendly to you. I&#39;ve seen this from my vantage point, as well as witnessing it with the way they treat everyone else. The food could be mediocre (which is is FAR from), and this place would still rank high for me because of this.

Really can&#39;t say enough good things about The Uber Sausage. It&#39;s a cute little building that makes full use of its property. The dining area is on the smaller side, but that&#39;s the point of these quaint little spots. It&#39;s has a cool personal vibe and I wouldn&#39;t want the place to be much bigger, honestly. My favorite sandwiches are The Greek and The Cajun (what can I say, I&#39;m from Louisiana), and don&#39;t pass on those awesome chips they have, either (I use the ranch flavoring). Thank you Uber sausage, for giving me hope to find other amazing places like this within Denver! Great stuff, guys!"

My dad and I both got the Badger, my sister got the Cajun, and her husband got the club. The food arrived hot, fresh, and ready to eat much quicker than I expected. All were good, but the Badger was superb -- and the table favorite. We also got two things of tater tots. There&#39;s a table with a bunch of different seasonings to use on them. I dumped old bay on one, a creole seasoning on the other. 

The thing that really made this place a 5 star establishment was the service.

I don&#39;t think I will be doing the latter again... the tots and the sauce are good separately, but together kind of odd.

The Vietnam was delicious! Definitely try this one if you can&#39;t decide. The staff behind the counter is nice and everything is semi-full service. You put your order in and they bring it out to you on the patio, and occasionally come out to see if you need anything else.

I tried The Vietnam which contains a Thai chili, lemongrass pork sausage that is filled with explosive flavor and accompanied by lots of tasty fixings. All of it came on a nice, fresh baguette. For those who want other playing options, they also have grilled tortillas or salad. The food was all very fresh, and the nice window at the counter where you can watch them prepare your sandwich is great for something to do while waiting.

Instead, we sat awkwardly and finished out entire meal while he sat there on his cell phone without saying a word to us.

Nice decor.  Small interior for the restaurant and there is an outside patio.  The staff was super helpful with describing the menu.  There is a parking lot...but a bit difficult to get out.

It was a bit early for dinner, so it was empty when we stopped by. I ordered The Club, which is a chicken sausage with arugula, an aioli sauce, Swiss cheese, bacon, avocado, and tomato. Such a tasty combination, and on a French bread bun rather than a boring old hotdog bun. 

My boyfriend ordered the Tijuana, which he also enjoyed, and we also got an order of chips to share. The chips were made well, nice and crunchy, and I added some Parmesan salt/cheese topping to my share.  Personally, I like salty food, and I do kind of wish the chips had been pre-salted, since I couldn&#39;t quite get the toppings to stick.

At first glance of its very discreet building and location you would t think this would be anything to talk about.  If you also had that inclination you would be wrong!  I had the Tijuana sausage sandwich and it was mind blowing.  All of the ingredients were fresh, the bread perfect and the sausage tasted delicious.  Fairly small menu of sausage sandwiches, toys, fries and a nice selection of beer.  They have a sizable patio to enjoy in the sun.  The staff was low key, friendly and got the job done quickly and to perfection.  Not just your late night hot dog stand, they say gourmet and live up to that.  And just to make sure you understand it is not a hot dog style sausage, they are sausage sandwiches served on French baguette.  Very creative!"

First want to comment on the two men working there; they were very helpful and professional. As for the food, it was great. I had the club and husband had the Greek. Mine had great flavor, as did his but he thought the greek might be better if he&#39;d gotten it on the tortilla instead. We also got tots with the bacon and chipotle sauce which were very yummy. One order was enough for the two of us since the sandwiches were so filling. There were so many other items on the menu I want to try so I will definitely be going back!"

I think they&#39;re too large, unnecessary and too rubbery to eat. The Uber Sausage, however, was next level.

Food: 5/5. I ordered the Hatch, which comes with melted pepper jack cheese, cilantro, crema fresca and other delicious add ons in addition to the pork hatch green chile sausage. This was very flavorful and carefully put together. Each ingredient works together wonderfully, the sausage sandwich was so full of flavor and different tastes I had demolished it very soon after getting it. Just so good and of high quality. 

Service: 5/5. I can&#39;t ask for much else here. Our cashier was generous and very helpful with a smile. Our food was put out relatively quick as we got the sandwiches to go. The inside is very clean and has a cool decor. 

Price: 5/5. I certainly would think this place is a little pricey under normal circumstances, but tasting the food here and of high quality it is, that&#39;s the justifier. Reasonable and not too much. 

You gotta try this place, even if you don&#39;t like sausage like me. It was worth the small trip and the food was great."

I had an appointment nearby and it was well after the regular lunch hour by the time I was able to have lunch.  And there on the horizon (well, across the street) was The Uber Sausage.  Well, why the hell not, I said to myself (yes, I do talk to myself - I&#39;m pretty good company!).

In a nutshell, this place is amazing!  They&#39;ll make anything you want if they&#39;ve got the ingredients, but their menu of items is pretty inspiring.  I had the Vietnam (Thai Chili Lemongrass Pork Sausage, Asian Slaw (Pickled Cabbage, Jicima and Carrots), Cucumbers, Mint, Thai Basil, Cilantro, Black Sesame Seeds and Sriracha Aioli).  It was just like a bahn mi on its crunchy French roll.  This was a sizable sandwich and very filling.  At 8-bucks, it was also one of the least expensive lunches I&#39;ve had lately (and one of the more delicious!).  I didn&#39;t try the tater tots with any of the toppings they offer, though.  Actually, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t since I was so full from the sandwich.  The sausage on the sandwich was extremely yummy.  One of the people that works there said that they make most of their sausages (the few that they don&#39;t are sourced locally, I think).

The restaurant is pretty small.  They have seating inside for maybe 10 -12, but they also have outdoor seating.  The restaurant was clean and the people that worked there were very friendly.  Besides street parking, they also have a small parking lot.

I&#39;ll definitely be making a return trip here, but I think I may stick to off-peak hours.  I imagine this place is a mob scene between 11:30 and 1 (and there&#39;s a humongous high school right across the street)."

This place is lovely. Let me lay out the scene
Charming trailer/food truck-esque restaurant with only a couple tables inside. Patio attached with a few picnic tables. The most delicious interesting sausage sammies you could imagine and loaded tater tots or homemade chips. The cutest, nicest, handsomest, hunkiest people behind the counter you could ever dream of (when you dream about hunks giving you food, like we all do).

When I say eat it all, I mean order the Vietnam. You won&#39;t regret it. Messy Bahn Mi Sandwich that leaves you wanting more. When I say loaded tots I mean get the tots with green chili or the ones with sriracha aioli.
Ok. Sorry I&#39;m not trying to be bossy. The truth is anything you get here will be delicious and served with a babe-ish smile."

I had the &#34;Vietnamese&#34; which was a bit spicy for my liking but it was still delicious. Very filling, I only ate half of it. We also had the smothered tater tots which were delicious!

The Über Sausage is a small and friendly establishment serving fast and delicious sausage-centric food. 

The Vietnam salad was spicy, had plenty of fresh greens, and was not overly large. My husband&#39;s Hatch sandwich was also tasty on a wonderful baguette. If only I could eat bread...

Environment is similar to a sub shop or a pizza-by-the-slice place. While delicious, the prices are a little high, though. Most sausages start at $8, so if you tack on fries/tater tots and a drink, you&#39;re looking at about $15 per person.

They have some nice happy hour specials, too. I believe it&#39;s $2 for beers from 2-4, weekdays (a dollar more for craft beers). They also features a $1 bin with day-old baguette bread. The bread is delicious; so if you&#39;re in need of bread for dinner, skip the grocery store and pick up one of their loaves."

I also tried my bf&#39;s sandwich which was the tijuana made with bison sausage, bacon, mango pico de gallo, catsup, mustard, crema fresca and queso fresco.

Uber has been on our to-try list for quite sometime now, and we finally can check it off. Over and over again. 

Hit.the.spot. I ordered the Vietnam and my love ordered a Cajun. We shared a side of tots. So finger-licking good! The bread was fresh, toasted to perfection, and most importantly, it was the right amount of bread to filling ratio. I can&#39;t tell you enough how much of a pet peeve I have against overly-bready sandwiches! This was spot on perfect. 

The filling in my sandwich was definitely much like a banh mi. Fresh pickled daikon, carrots, cucumbers and some cilantro. The sausage was porky and tender (the fatty pork probably helped). Refreshing, savory, and mouthwatering.

(This is, of course, in reference to their awesome food truck.)  So each time I&#39;ve had the chance to try them, they&#39;ve either arrived later than planned or in one instance, ran out of food before I could get my hands on the grub.

The latter bodes well indeed.

James F and I, like creatures of habit, were meandering around Twist and Shout on Colfax and began to get peckish.  I quickly checked which places nearby I had bookmarked but still hadn&#39;t been to and boom, the Uber Sausage was the winner.  So we hopped into the car and made our way down the street.  Two blocks to be exact.

This place is TINY.  Like, front porch tiny.  But that&#39;s okay.  The friendly staff and tasty grub make it worth rubbing elbows with the other two people stuffing their faces.

Upon our arrival, the guy behind the counter welcomed us and gave us the rundown of the menu.  I couldn&#39;t resist the Hatch green chilies inspired sausage and James went with the Vietnam.  Oh, and let&#39;s not forget the awesome side of tots.  Those buggers were awesome!  As for the main event, I love what Uber does with their sausages:  slice them in half and essentially create a sandwich on delicious toasted bread.  Both of our choices were fantastic, I really can&#39;t wait to get back and try more of the menu.

Yes, there&#39;s Biker Jim&#39;s and Billy&#39;s in town, but what I love about them, and Uber for that matter, is that each is doing their own unique twist on sausages and hot dogs.  I couldn&#39;t say one is better than the other because they are different.  Biker Jim&#39;s focuses on the sausage, Billy&#39;s on the accouterments, and Uber focuses on making the sausage into a sandwich-style.

They take simple ingredients and put a really gourmet spin on them. Don&#39;t worry, this isn&#39;t gourmet from the standpoint of it being weird to eat. These guys did their homework right and the concoctions they came up with are really good pairings together. I&#39;m a fan and after driving past this place for a while, I&#39;m kicking myself as to why i didn&#39;t stop in earlier. I guess it was that fear that they would make gourmet food in an overwhelming manner. They didn&#39;t."

the-uber-sausage-denver-3,Cheryl L.,q1UgiumcDgva03ZHsTB0IA,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",1,1,1,527,106,bBCzVKe2VqUd9rMkEgxg9g,5.0,2013-01-21,"Welcome back to the latest installment from Uber Sausage Addicts Anonymous (USAA for short), I&#39;m your President, Cheryl.  

A bit ago they joined forces with the great talent Justin Brunson to develop a new menu.  The collaboration was true genius and I wouldn&#39;t expect anything else from the owners.

With this announcement I know this was pointed right at me and the gauntlets were thrown down and the challenge excepted. The challenge was to try each and every new item on the menu.  It has taken me months to do it but this past Thursday the task was completed.  How can you say one is better than the other if you haven&#39;t tried all of them?  I think not!

Disclaimer - the items from the old menu are not include (The Swiss, Colorado Buffalo, Tijuana).

These are listed in order of preference:

The Cajun - If you haven&#39;t been here before and aren&#39;t sure what to order this is my suggestion.  So while you might say Crawfish sausage, what were they thinking?  They were think it would be a bit of heaven.  With the Caramelized Onions and Remoulade Sauce this is elevated to &#34;Pure Fricken Genius&#34; in my book.  I don&#39;t believe that you will be disappointed with this one.

The Vietnam - Thai Chili Lemongrass Pork Sausage, this makes my mouth water just typing this.  The Sriracha Aioli adds a bit of heat.  I get mine with extra Sriracha.  Save yourself some hassle and have them add the extra Sriracha before they wrap it up - it will keep the mess to a minimum.  

The Mexico  - Some of the best Chorizo sausage I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Before they heat up the sausage they butterfly the link and place it face down on the grill.  This gives it the black caramelizing char that transforms the Chorizo to a higher level.  The avocado adds a creamy coolness and goes perfectly with the Mango Pico.

The Badger - Brat, Cheese and Sauerkraut.  Three items that you can&#39;t go wrong with on a sausage.  With the addition of Spicy Brown Mustard this is one kick ass sandwich.  Only thing missing was a beer to go with this one.  When they open their new location they will have a liquor license and depending on what you pair with this tasty morsel it could move closer to the the top of the list.

The Hatch - The messiest sandwich on the menu.  The real star of this one is the Colorado Green Chili.  You get the green chili flavor through and through with the added crispy and coolness of the cabbage and crema fesca.  

The Baja - I actually had this one as a salad, which was fabulous.  The Chipotle Sauce on this one was the key.  Loved the Saltine Crusted Fish Fillet - it made it crispy and not greasy at all.

The Club - Rosemary Chicken Sausage with bacon.  How can you go wrong when you add bacon.  This was middle of the road for me.  It has more subtle and classic, but solid, flavors.  

The Greek - This is the first one I tired of the new menu and it was the one I was most looking forward to and perhaps I had built it up more in my mind.  Don&#39;t get me wrong it was good but for me it was missing the WOW factor of the others on the top of my list.  I&#39;m willing to give this one another try and see if the little tweaks that they have given in the last couple of months have done the trick.  

The Farm - Great vegetarian sandwich.  But it was lacking the magical ingredient for me - If I&#39;m coming to Uber SAUSAGE I&#39;m coming for the Sausage not the vegetables. 

Kid&#39;s Menu - Mac N Cheese Hotdog - The is truly a hotdog with macaroni and cheese in it.  There are little bits of cheese and little bits of macaroni.  It is as described and it was good.  Kids must love dog.  For $4 it comes with chips and a drink.  Great Price and great taste."

Sure, they both are serving upscale &#34;hot dogs&#34; if you will.  But, the approaches they take to their craft seem very different.  Although I still think that Biker Jim&#39;s is my favorite of the two, I think that The Über Sausage has an amazing and artful approach to how they do food.  

The subtitle of The Über Sausage is &#34;Gourmet Sausage Sandwiches&#39;, and this really encapsulates what they do here.  This artisanal approach with upscale ingredients really works.  On my recent visit, I was able to sample The French (Chicken Apple Sausage, Apple, Caramelized Red Onions, Baby Spinach, Crumbled Bleu Cheese and Spicy Mustard).  It really did have an authentically French flavor profile, and was quite delicious.  I ordered the Colorado Buffalo (Spicy Southwestern Buffalo Bratwurst, Berry Chipotle Sauce, Mixed Red &amp; Green Cabbage and Queso Fresco).  It had great depth of flavor and was very delicious, but almost had too much going on (if you know what I mean).   I am not sure that the sausage was still the star of this symphony.

One other unique offering here is the Homemade Chips w/ Seasonings (Italian Spice with Parmesan, Cajun, Cinnamon and Sugar, Ranch, Lemon Pepper, Creole, Seasoned Salt and Malt Vinegar).  They give you a paper bag full of piping hot, thick chips and you add the seasonings you want and shake until mixed.  I liked the spiciness of the Creole, but have heard others sing praises of the sweeter selections."

Ambiance is fun and upbeat with lots of tvs. Definite sports bar but also family friendly. The staff is friendly , but our waitress was forgetful when putting our order in. They do have fast service though. 

We got the fried pickles as an appetizer which my friends said were good . I got the garden salad which was huge ! And my friend got the fried chicken sandwich buffalo sauce on the side, and thankfully on the side because the sauce was not good at all. Our other friend got boneless wings with regular buffalo sauce which they were not a fan of either. Our waitress forgot the fries but when she did bring them they were bland and under seasoned. 

Over all had a great night because of Mammoth night ! But wouldn&#39;t return for the food."

I requested for crispy buffalo wings, I ve got my wings after 15 minutes later which was not crispy at all. I said to the waitress that I wanted it crispy she said sorry and took my plate to replace with the crispy ones. I waited almost 1 hour overall and guess what ?? again not crispy. The manager of the place was sitting on the bar and was being the guest I assume but even didnt bother to come and try to make an explanation. You are expecting an apology from the manager after waiting for 1 hour not from waitress.
I was having a good time but they ruined it over a simple crispy wings issue. Never Again"

Anyway, it seems that certain waitresses treat customers better if they come with larger groups. See, that equates to larger tips. So they&#39;ll focus more on these guys and talk with them more rather than someone coming in solo...like myself.

I came in to order and the waitress took a few extra minutes to get my drink (I was even greeted by the manager before she came around), and when I went to order my boneless wings, she argued with me that I couldn&#39;t place a custom order of 12. &#34;10 or 15,&#34; she barked at me. The sign indicated nothing for that, and she wasn&#39;t exactly helpful. I ended up ordering 10.

So she only came around one more time to check on me before my food arrived, and I had to ask twice to get my drink refilled. The food was okay -- the wings aren&#39;t bad, and the sauces are good, although they were cooked a little dry -- but her service just turned me off. Meanwhile, the two guys at the table across from me were treated fine because, you know, they ordered beer and more food.

Hooters really should find a way to balance their service better. Even single customers can make all the difference. Here&#39;s hoping their waitresses come to realize that."

You get 10 of the first flavor and 5 every flavor after. All night long, as much as you want.
Plenty of TVs, great tables and lots that will fit a ton of folks.

Yeah, well... the wings were good and cooked to order. Thats all I can say was good because the service was horrible. We sat at the bar and if the girl at the bar wouldve treated us like she treated her friends in the corner she wouldve gotten a much better tip and happily returning customers. Instead, shes lucky she even got 10 percent from me. No name. No smile. No blue cheese(even though she asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese). Looked at her cell phone more than she looked at her patrons. It was the Wednesday Wingday... 12.99 for all you can eat wings. You get 10 on the first order then 5 each order thereafter(at least thats how she explained it). Chose 2 flavors(5 each) and the first order was nice and hot. The next order I was expecting 5 so I got one flavor(no offer on the blue cheese this time). She brought 10, all the same flavor. Grrrr. If I wouldve known that I wouldve gotten 2 flavors to try and they were definitely not as hot as the first order. Lackluster service for us but all giddy and attentive to her friends. Oh yeah and then she had to ask how many beers I had(1), telling me she thought it was 2. Seriously? My friend felt the same about the service and was also disappointed about the second set of wings being 10 instead of 5 and all one flavor and on the verge of being cold. Too bad as I think the Wednesday deal is good deal but service is important to me and I cant patronize a place that has none. Oh yeah, she did no upsell on the beer either as there were bigger sizes and I wouldve gotten the larger size... so, she lost the business money there too. Boooooooo!"

I think I got a deal, eating 50 wings for that price!  Granted the first 10 wings were quite dry, as though they had been sitting out for a while, then they got moister after that.  My friend has given up drinking and I decided to support him and we both had diet cokes.  I think the waitress could read the writing on the wall that we weren&#39;t going to be big spenders with those combos.

The girls were all actually quite pretty but I found our waitress to be a little cool with us, vs. some of the others who would sit down at the table with the customers for a bit, but whatever, it&#39;s a restaurant not a strip club.

Lots of big screens, and the manager turned ours to the one we wanted."

The wings are big and there are plenty of different flavors to choose from now.  I like to stick with the original hot but we did try lemon pepper and habanero (super spicy).  

The service was good...except we had a long blond hair in our Sprite.  The waitress got us a new one.  Then with the next refill, the nozzle from the soda dispenser dropped into another Sprite.  The waitress apologized but I still asked for the manager cause that&#39;s pretty bizarre and gross.  He took the 2 Sprites off the bill, I think he could have done better.  

So check your drinks before you drink them!"

The orders are delayed, dont know what happen that day but we notice the slow service they gave us. When it arrived, the orders has big cuts. Didnt expect them to have a good tasting gravy.

I don&#39;t know if I will live long enough to visit all of them, but that is my goal. Anytime I am traveling, I make it a point to visit the closet Hooters.

I was passing through Denver on my way up to Estes Park and I made a detour to Aurora to go to Hooters. It was well worth the detour. 

I went on a Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised to learn that they had all you can eat wings. I stopped at 27. The wings were fantastic and the service was great. The place had a good vibe and upbeat feel. All of the staff was friendly and the manager came by to check up on us. One of the better Hooters that I have been to.

If you love wings like I do and you want good service and food, then I would highly recommend the Aurora Hooters."

The wings were good but not great, a little overdone at times but still a solid 8/10, and for all you can eat it was a great deal; I put away forty of them! Still regret that I didn&#39;t branch out and try more than one sauce.

For a guy that lives in the heart of downtown, this was quite a trek, and I won&#39;t be making it again.

The wings were a good size but seriously devoid of any (hot) buffalo sauce - my lips weren&#39;t on fire, no mountain of towels used up, etc. etc. In other words, there were none of the stereotypical consequences of a wing feast.

The service here was good although our server didn&#39;t really have a clue on what seasonal beers they had, and apparently they didn&#39;t serve Blue Moon in a pitcher, only on certain days, but whatever.  After running back and forth we were finally able to enjoy a ginormous mug of our iced cold Blue Moon which was all that mattered.  The wings are good and they added a few new flavors to making it that much more difficult to decide which ones to get.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend the lemon pepper, found it rather too salty. Their new triple dog dare is the spiciest flavor they had and packs quite a punch!  My favorite would be the 3 Mile because it has just the right amount of heat where it doesn&#39;t singe your tongue and ruins your appetite as your gulping down cups after cups of water and beer just to alleviate the pain."

We both got the all you can eat wings on Wednesday for $9.99. The wings were okay, even the hot didn&#39;t have much kick, and they were really greasy. (Might be my fault, I got the boneless)

Otherwise, the service was decent, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going out of my way to go again.

As an aside, the waitresses working were &#34;cute&#34; but not really hot, and as I said, no flirting with me or my husband, which sucks."

I can&#39;t really tell the story like Sheri can, so I will not attempt to tell it, instead I will just review this location.

A couple of days ago a co-worker/friend of mine had a friend in town and the three of us were trying to figure out where to go for lunch. At one point during the conversation the out of town friend mentioned that he wanted to go to Hooters at some point during his stay because he&#39;s been to one in every city that he&#39;s been too. Not ever having their wings before I said that we could just go then. So that&#39;s what we did.

We got there around 2pm and took a table on the patio. It was pretty dead, but then again this was a Monday and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the ideal time to go eating wings... well... for me, ANYTIME is a good time to eat wings. 

I knew I came here for wings and that&#39;s all I planned to eat, but of course I couldn&#39;t just have wings. I needed something to wash it down. So I ordered myself a Guinness. Our waitress had an interesting way of pouring the beer and I was quite amused. After a few minutes of looking over the menu the three of us decided to order 50 wings, half Hot and half Samurai (teriyaki). I knew I could handle more than plain ole Hot, but we figured we wouldn&#39;t go too hot for one of our three. 

In no time our wings had been brought to our table and I began to do it to it to those wings. Now up to this point I never believed that Hooters wings were as good as people proclaimed them to be. I can&#39;t say why, but it was their image I guess that put me off. Sure, most men like the Hooter girls, for me... eh, their okay. Nothing to go nuts over. I&#39;m more interested in the food. And come to find out, I really do enjoy their wings. They are made different than most other wings that I have tried. They come breaded, but you can ask to have them naked. Although I can&#39;t imagine having them without their breading. They were just so good. 

Their Samurai tasted pretty good, not the best teriyaki sauce in the world, but pretty good for a chicken wing. The hot as I mentioned earlier wasn&#39;t hot at all and I could have handled more. I eyeballed the 911 and the Cajun and definitely had to go back to try one of those.

I have dropped my previous assumptions on their wings and will gladly go back anytime for some more of their delicious wings."

The Waitress flat SUCKED!!! She was a total joke to even be called a waitress, just because you are decent looking with a chest, does not mean you should be serving food.

Details:
We sat down in the far corner, which was great for some privacy, until the waitress came over, quickly got us drinks.  Then sat down at the table and wrote down our order.  Awesome!   And then as I finished my drink IN FRONT OF HER, I set it down, quiet loud on the table in plain site, IE: Give me a refill please.  She left and never came back until food was about to come out.  She swung by with plates, and with attitude set them on the table and kept walking.  Then when food came out she put them in front of everyone (Never a word to us after our order).   She FINALLY got me a refill at this time.  She then came back AFTER we were done eating and said &#34;How is everything&#34;  Really?  You just now ask?  Oh by the way here is the bill.  I said get me a manager at this point I was heated.

The Chicken sandwich was amazing, the garlic parm wings were nasty!  CAKED in sauce, which is fine for bbq and hot, not garlic parm it is just too much.  

So the manager came over, and said &#34;Yea she isn&#39;t one of my best&#34;  Okay why would you tell your customer that?

Then he grilled her in front of us off to the side... After that he came back with a new lowered bill.  Cool for us I guess. So we gave the payment and she comes back over.  OKay maybe to say something or explain how she was having a bad night and how slow it was that she was too busy for us?  Well no she slapped the receipt on the table with a pen and walked off...

What a ******!  This girl sucks, the manager was less than helpful at resolving it, this is why he works at hooters as a manager and not somewhere else.  

Due to this POOR experience I will likely never be back.  I can only hope they close this one down too."

We opted to sit outside and enjoy the nice late summer weather. They have a really nice side patio section.

I ordered the meat lover&#39;s omelette -- egg, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheddar cheese -- with a side of potatoes.

The place is less than a third full and we are the only table to not have food.   Asked to speak to manager 20min ago but nothing.  My son and I are scratching our head how this is a 4 star rating."

They have GREAT vegetarian options, which is fantastic. (Also a ton of non veggie options!) Everything is local, and organic. Really a great practice they have going here ! Plus you have the groceries- you can buy all their hot sauces, and so many other great local/organic things. The honey sriracha sauce is incredible!  Everyone is always very friendly here, and they are efficient with quick service. The best part, they are open for weekday brunch and there&#39;s never been a wait. I have not gone on the weekends, but weekdays we are always immediately seated !"

I visited with a friend on a Friday, late morning, and it was not too crowded. The menu is full of every breakfast food you could want, sweet or savory. I went with the garden omelette which was definitely 75% artichoke. No complaining here! I loooove artichoke so this was amazing. I like that they offer veggies as a side in the morning because sometimes you&#39;re just not feeling a heavy potato laden breakfast. The homemade toast and jam that came with it were also amazing! I&#39;ll be back to try more of the menu, the lunch looks amazing.

This would be a great place to go grab take out to picnic at the park with."

The pork belly hash was amazing! The wild mushroom omlet had such a unique taste w the cream sauce and the hearty mushrooms. Fabulous. All the hot sauces were a great touch as well. 

Friendly waitstaff, definitely the place to try after a walk in the park."

But in short, I visited on a Wednesday morning for breakfast. There was no one there at all. The place was bright and the decor was cute with yellow flowers at each table. But overall, still felt depressing and lonely. We came in to an empty restaurant. A few minutes later, a staff member came out from the back to greet us. She then left again for 10 minutes. Finally, my fiance went to peek in the back so we could order and saw her on her phone. That&#39;s all fine and everything, but she was irritated that he&#39;d peek back there. So became fairly unpleasant. 

After she takes our order, she goes back and disappears again. 15 min later, she returns with our food. While I always enjoy the company of my fiancé, there was just something sad about the completely bare restaurant with soft playing emo music. Lol... but I digress... We ordered the Cuban Sandwich and Tender Belly Omelette. Both were pretty good with different tastes. The omelette had dates in it for example... which was ok! Didn&#39;t love it but it was different! Also, the breakfast menu is small. It&#39;s great if you like pork belly or veggies because those ingredients are pretty much in all the breakfast options. 

I&#39;m a little bummed because I had bookmarked Fooducopia and wanted to try it for a while. But it sounds like maybe dinner would be a better option. Open to coming back!"

Service was incredibly slow on a busy Sunday morning. There was much disorganization among the staff. At one point a gentleman came and asked to be seated and the hostess responded by saying it would be a 30 minute wait, however there were at least six open tables with no sign for reservation. It was almost comical. I definitely saw customers leave because of the disorganization. The food was OK but it didn&#39;t make up for the shit show that was going on among the staff. It&#39;s nice to see the servers have some sense of urgency especially during a busy Sunday brunch time but here the servers are so laid-back it is almost painful to watch. Definitely will not be going back here. 

One positive I can say is they have a cool little grocery store you can browse while waiting for eternity to be seated/waited on."

To start, Fooducopia has a phenomenal concept.  It is a combined corner store with a fully functional dining area.  The food they serve and provide here is locally sourced and organic; which is awesome, but makes things kind of pricey.  Staff here are beyond friendly and makes you feel as if you have enter an utopian city.  I love it.

What I did not care too much for was the food; thus, I could not give this place more stars.  I came here with my boyfriend for morning brunch.  He ordered the pesto scrambler, I had the pork belly hash and the bloody Mary.  Now I ordered the bloody Mary specifically for the bacon (bacon-lover unite), but it did not come with one although it stated so on the menu =(.  The bloody Mary was delicious nonetheless.  As for my pork belly hash it was good at first.  However, got overwhelmingly greasy after the fourth-fifth bite.  It was just too much pork belly and not enough hash.  As for my boyfriend&#39;s dish, it was almost entirely made with potatoes and for the price it was definitely not worth paying for just potatoes.  We left a little disappointed.

However, the dinner menu looks way more promising than the brunch."

I probably shouldn&#39;t tell people about it because more for me! But, it&#39;d be a crime not to share. Coffee was fresh and strong and local. The pork chile &#34;soup&#34; was delectable and had tons of pork in it. I forget what it was called, but we got an omelet with bacon and sausage and dates and it was to die for. I will probably just get that again the next time I go. It came with a huge heap of freshly sauteed veggies. Portions were grand. What really got me is that everything was perfectly seasoned. I didn&#39;t have to salt or pepper a thing! The veggies were buttered and salted! This is a big deal and where many restaurants mess up and so I was so pleasantly surprised that they put so much thought into everything including the side of veggies! The omelet...I&#39;m craving it now. It&#39;s lunch time. Gotta go!"

If you are a restaurant, you need to have some big cojones to name your joint with a word that reminds folks of perfection.   So how did they do?  They weren&#39;t perfect but they were very good. 

We parked about one half a block away for Sunday brunch.  As we approached I noticed the very large casual patio.  It&#39;s interesting that it was capable of holding many more tables even with decent spacing.  They need to work on this as the tables were full and it was a beautiful morning.

The casual ATMOSPHERE continues inside.  This is a tiny place with a tiny market adjoining a tiny restaurant.  Actually casual is an understatement.  As you roll out of bed on a Sunday morning, don&#39;t bother combing your hair.  Shaving is also optional.  It&#39;s that casual.

In keeping with the spirit of the place the staff is young and free spirited and dressed in jeans and shorts and assorted tats.  The CUSTOMER SERVICE was spot on and I loved it.

The menu is one page with mostly typical breakfast items.  There is a twist in that most everything is farm to table.  I ordered a Meatlovers Omelet for $12.99.  It came with ridiculously good wheat toast and my choice of side which in my case was organic fried potatoes.

I thought my omelet was a bit overcooked but overall my FOOD was four stars.  My dining companions agreed.

Pro Tip- These folks have a bar so if you crave a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa that&#39;s not a problem.  EXCEPT alcohol is only available inside and not on the patio.  Keep that in mind if you are nursing a hangover.

The bottom line is that this is a great place for breakfast/brunch and I would happily return in a heartbeat!"

We sleep in (until around 7am...oh boy!) and wake up naturally, walk the dogs, and start thinking about breakfast (sometimes this begins at 11am, but isn&#39;t it still breakfast if it&#39;s the first meal of the day?). For the past couple of weeks, E has been the one to pick our breakfast spot, so I was excited that it was my turn! Following my nostalgic tendencies as well as my cravings, I picked Devil&#39;s Food Bakery in Wash Park. UNFORTUNATELY Devils Food seems to have become a hipster haven, and the sleepy little bakery I used to come to all the time in high school was at an hour+ wait mid-morning on a Sunday.

Dejected, we returned to the car and were wondering what to do when E found Fooducopia on Yelp. The best part was that it was right around the corner! We strolled through the neighborhood on a warm and sun-dappled day and even though I was bummed about our change in plans I had the best damn breakfast in recent memory.

E and I both ordered the hash. Although I normally lean towards French toast or pancakes in the morning, I couldn&#39;t pass it up with its Pork belly and caramelized onions. And holy crap, I am so glad I decided to not only order savory for breakfast, but also to order the same thing as E (it&#39;s kind of an unspoken rule - we like to sample each other&#39;s!).

My eggs were cooked absolutely perfect sunny-side up. The hash browns were crispy, with big, delicious chunks of pork belly as well as onions and roasted red peppers. Despite the Hollandaise being served on the side, which is a nice touch, I&#39;m not ashamed to say I used all of it. Also loved the rustic toast it was served with. And even though I didn&#39;t think I wanted coffee at first, E&#39;s cup was so delicious I ordered my own. And the honey-Sriracha hot sauce was to die for!

Service was really lovely and the ambience was nice and open and sunny. They have a cute little food shop attached and we were hoping for farm fresh eggs, but the only ones they had were a mass-marketed brand. Oh well. It also looks like they do refillable milk gallons too! 

Overall, I was so very happy we stumbled on this place. I highly recommend the hash, and I can&#39;t wait to go back and try some other menu items!"

In the summertime, they open their patio for dining..... but I heard you can&#39;t drink alcohol out there :(

After we were seated, our waitress came to take our drink orders. My friend and I ordered Bloody Marys and were very, very sad when our waitress came back to tell us they ran out of Bloody mix. We put on our faces of despair and- voila!- delicious Bloody Marys arrived five minutes later. And man... They were good. Check out my detailed review here: http://bloodymarytour.org/2015/05/27/fresh-local-review-of-fooducopias-bloody-mary/

For my meal, I ordered a wild mushroom omelette made with four varieties of local mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and chevre, with a side of well-done breakfast potatoes. This is the first time I have ordered an omelette from a restaurant in a while and it did not disappoint; the mushrooms were luscious and the chevre was a nice compliment. Everything about Fooducopia was so.. Colorado. And I loved every second of it.

Price: a bit on the expensive side (think $9 Bloody and $13 omelette)."

I ordered the Veggie Eggs Benedict with scrambled eggs, and thoroughly enjoyed it! I really like the light cranberry hollondaise sauce with it, it really added a nice, subtle difference to the average veggie Bennie that you get at every other breakfast place. I got potatoes on the side and they were flavorful and delicious too!

The service was fantastically friendly and smiley.

The restaurant is connected to the grocery market they have inside. I didn&#39;t take a look at the items, but would like to go back and take a peek at what they offer next time!

You can be sure that you&#39;ve found the kind of Sunday morning farmers market feel inside of a physical location. Lively, yet calm and welcoming. Very enjoyable atmosphere. 

Now, for food. We started with a large French press which yields about 4 cups of Jo. Personally I ordered the pork belly has. Now, it&#39;s delicious and if you choose this one make sure to use all the goodies. Don&#39;t get too excited and eat it all before adding the nice hollandaise sauce they provide. 

Looking around the restaurant all the food look fantastic. The pancakes are HUGE and had fresh whipped cream on top. I will definitely be getting. Some next time."

Our waitress was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable to our questions about the menu options. She suggested bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese crumble which was delightful! She even let us try some items that weren&#39;t on the menu yet because the chef was giving the recipe a test drive. We shared an order of bone marrow which came on a wooden block with crostini. We tried this because we never had something like it. It had great flavor but the texture and scooping it out of the bone was mind bending. 

We will definitely go back and try something else off their changing menus. Fooducopia screams Denver because of it&#39;s local, organic character."

It has a family feeling with a modern twist. I tried the berries toast. Don&#39;t remember the official name of it but I do remember the taste of it. Exquisite. First time that I see queso fresco incorporated in the dish that balances the sweetness of the berries. Also they use thick slices of flavorful bread so therefore every layer of the dish has a depth of flavor and works harmoniously. It&#39;s amazing.
fooducopia-denver,Allison S.,4-Zp7eBLU7_Af0fddRVzsA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,24,16,yYdqy_7ne3kZ14cYq2IjJw,3.0,2015-11-09,"Living in the neighborhood, my husband and I have wandered past Fooducopia dozens of times. We knew it was a corner store/restaurant, but didn&#39;t really know what to expect...so we waited and waited and waited to give it a try. Would we walk in and see a counter? A store? Was there seating? Just a counter? I know...a little yelping/google searching would have answered those questions, but we&#39;re creatures of habit and have lots of yummy brunch places nearby, so weren&#39;t in too much of a hurry to find out.

The answer to our uncertainty:  There&#39;s both indoor and outdoor seating, but you need to be seated by Fooducopia staff. When you walk in, there&#39;s a corner store to your right, the checkout straight ahead, and a little dining area off to the left with a sign that says &#34;Please Wait to be Seated.&#34; The inside dining area seems like it could seat 24, with the outside area seating about the same. On a Sunday morning at 11am, we only waited 5 minutes to be seated. 

The service at Fooducopia was great and the concept is equally wonderful. The food, however, left a little to be desired. We&#39;ll be back to try again, but this first go around was a bit of a disappointment. If I could leave 3.5 stars, I would, but for now I&#39;ll stick with 3 and hope to be inspired to change my review once we&#39;ve had a chance to try again.

We tried the Grapefruit Brulee (2 halves of grapefruit and bananas brûléed with Sugar In Raw - $6.99), Vegetarian Breakfast Burrito (stuffed with potatoes, eggs, beans, salsa, and sour cream - $13.99), and the Cinnamon Apple Brioche French Toast (caramel cinnamon apples, flavored Blosm whipped cream and nuts - $12.99).

I LOVE bruleed grapefruit and often make it myself at home. Sure, $7 is a little steep, but it sounded delicious and sweet and light and just right. Unfortunately, the grapefruit had been cut in such a way that it was difficult to tell if it was just a small grapefruit or if some of the fruit had been lost in the cutting. What I&#39;m saying is...there wasn&#39;t much to eat. Good? Sure. It was smaller than it was good, though. 

The Vegetarian Breakfast burrito was flavorful but misleading. First of all, the &#34;salsa&#34; is not stuffed in the burrito as the description states, but is rather a warm green salsa that is below the burrito. My husband and I shared entrees, so he cut the burrito in half before he began to eat it. His half had absolutely no eggs and few beans, but my half was almost exclusively eggs and beans. We tried to balance it out on our own, but by that point it was basically a scramble (not a burrito). The salsa was flavorful, but I wish there had been more because the inside of the burrito was so dry (the sour cream comes on the side). The burrito also seemed really bean heavy and potato light, in general. I might try this again, with the salsa on the side to try and save enough for the last bite, and also with the expectation that I&#39;m going to just cut it all up and eat it like a scramble.

The Cinnamon Apple Brioche French Toast was SO good. It was ridiculously decadent, with a (very heavy) cinnamon apple sauce all over it. The sauce was good, but it consumed the toast and was just a lot. I didn&#39;t think that there would be a sauce (it honestly was almost like a toffee sauce, although I imagine that&#39;s not what it was), let alone so much of it, based on the description. It was smothered. Delicious, but smothered. Not remotely healthy, which was so okay, because I didn&#39;t think I was asking for a mouth full of nutrition when I ordered the dish. I would absolutely get this again, but with the sauce on the side. Yum, yum, yum....but whoa, whoa, whoa. Basically, this is dessert. For three. 

We&#39;ll be back, for sure, and are looking forward to asking better questions so that we have clearer expectations when we order. Like I said, the food was good, it just wasn&#39;t prepared/served in such a way that was all that impressive. With such fresh, delicious ingredients, it&#39;s bound to be good...I just need it to be a little better."

However, this time I came with my sister who was visiting from out of town, I had been raving about this place and was excited to take her. We were a table of 4, and got there at 10:30. They told us our wait would be 30-35 minutes. We were patiently waiting for our turn after the restaurant accommodated numerous parties of 2, and at 11:30 we were told that the restaurant would not be seating anyone else as their kitchen staff was backed up. We had already been waiting an hour and then they finally tell us this, rudely I might add. The restaurant knew we had waited for an hour and then told us we couldn&#39;t eat there? At least give someone the curtesy to find another place before wasting an hour of their Sunday morning. They didn&#39;t offer us anything, wouldn&#39;t make an exception just said, sorry we&#39;re backed up. I most likely will not be back here again.

The pork belly was fatty, crispy and delightful. That rich flavor went well with the potatoes. Towards the end I started getting some burnt pieces of potato. Also, the jam or preserves they served with the bread was so delicious."

The food and drinks were all great! Our table had the pork belly benedict, pork belly hash and chorizo hash. All of it was excellent and the serving size is plentiful! They certainly did not short anyone on the meat in each dish. Everything was flavorful, well cooked and delicious so for that we will be back! Bloody Mary was a good spice level as well.

There&#39;s not a ton of tables but 6-8ish inside and even less outside. The ambiance is very casual so no one will judge you if you roll out of bed and head on in here on a Saturday morning.

I&#39;ve gotten one item here and that&#39;s the prosciutto benedict. I&#39;m not usually a big fan of ham but prosciutto is heavenly. That&#39;s right, heavenly. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the cranberry hollandaise sauce so the second time I asked for no cranberry sauce and I enjoyed it much more. The potatoes are very tasty. They&#39;re cooked well. The first time I thought they looked burnt but either way you&#39;re going to enjoy the texture and flavor.

They are a locally sourced and organic breakfast joint. They have bags outside. It&#39;s kid friendly. What&#39;s &#34;bags&#34; you ask? I guess the locals call it cornhole but I&#39;m from the Midwest so bags it is.

Within their building, they also have a small market in case you feel inspired to purchase some fresh produce and uniquely flavored olive oils."

I have been coming here a lot over the past couple years and I have always been greeted with a smile. Foodacopia has a passionate staff that will help you with any question you may have from the dining menu to the products on the shelf. 


Grocery side: 
This is a specialty or limited variety market that has fresh from the farm produce eggs and other great options. While you will not be stocking you whole kitchen here. One will find options for spicing up their selection at home. The hot sauces are phenomenal! Their is a coffee I get here that I think is just amazing, had it one night after dinner and then brought the beans home. They also have some take away meals that are already made. They are behind the cash register in the cooler. Easy way to have a delectable meal at home. 

Restaurant side:
Breakfast, lunch and dinner are the reasons I come here more than I probably should admit. They have a seasonal menu that will blow your mind when you eat your way through it. They are more than happy to accommodate dietary concerns when possible. Truly some just a nice staff that contributes to the experience. You will usually see the chef sticking his head out to see a patron take their first bit and watch as they try express what amazing flavors they are experiencing in their mouth."

It&#39;s my favorite breakfast meal and I&#39;m on a quest to find the absolute best in Denver. I still have a lot of places left to try but so far Fooducopia has the win. I had the Bananas Foster French Toast and it was heavenly. It was well worth the $10.99. I couldn&#39;t stop eating but I still left with leftovers. The place itself was interesting to me. Walking in, I thought we had gone in the wrong door. It opens up to a little marketplace. But around the corner is where you find restaurant portion. Very tiny with not many tables. We came on a weekday pretty late in the day so luckily there was no wait but I can only imagine what the wait is like on the weekends."

I got the meat frittata which i would definitely recommend. It was quite filling and delicious with the locally made hot sauces.

It&#39;s not a huge seating area, but it provides exactly what you need on a lazy morning while relaxing with your family and friends.

I ate at Fooducopia on a Sunday night.  It was the highlight of my trip.  They have upscale food and excellent service in a cozy little neighborhood restaurant.  We started with a bottle of Malbec, very good for a reasonable price.  My sister ordered the gnocchi for an appetizer.  I&#39;ve never liked gnocchi because other times I&#39;ve tried it it&#39;s been a heavy ball of pasta.  This gnocchi melted in my mouth, I loved it! For an entree I ordered the scallops.  They were cooked perfectly and the presentation was beautiful.  We were too full for dessert so we picked 2 pints of ice cream from the little market to take home.

And while I still love these items, I just don&#39;t enjoy that much sugar in the morning anymore and will almost always order a savory breakfast. So when Jennifer B. mentioned that Fooducopia had Savory French Toast on Yelp Talk, my interest was piqued! 

I met up with Erin H for brunch a couple a weeks ago and we were both surprised that there wasn&#39;t a wait at 9:30am! In fact we had our choice of tables. I ordered the Savory French Toast and Erin ordered the Meat Frittata. My French toast didn&#39;t disappoint: big, fluffy pieces of brioche fried and topped with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes and goat cheese served with a side of hollandaise to dip it in. Erin  let me have a bite of her frittata and it was also delish. We both were so impressed with their homemade strawberry preserves that we each took home a freshly filled mason jar ($5.99 each).

I&#39;m worried that once word catches on about Fooducopia there will be more of a wait, but this is seriously good brunch so I&#39;ll definitely return!"

It took a little time, but I eventually convinced him.  

Fooducopia is half restaurant and half market with a beautiful outdoor patio that may have more seating than the indoor seating area.  The space inside is quaint with a dozen tables or so with a tiny kitchen in the back.  When the warmer weather comes and these freak May snow storms go away, I can see myself with the rest of Denver vying for a spot on that patio.

The food is why everyone should come here, and coming back for seconds and thirds.  The breakfast menu is one page and offers French toast, Omelets, Benedict&#39;s, and the like.  I guarantee you will find something you will love. 

I decided on the Savory French toast served with mushrooms, tomato&#39;s, spinach, goat cheese with hollandaise on the side.  I enjoy French toast and have had it at several different places and this one is by far one of the best I&#39;ve had.  The amount of French toast I received was ridiculous, two people could easily split the dish and be fully satisfied.  The ingredients all complimented each other perfectly and the hollandaise was creamy and rich and acted like a savory syrup to pour over my French toast.  I want this dish over and over and over again.  

The BF decided on the Burrito with shredded pork and I was able to snag a few bites.  The Burrito must have had a whole pound of shredded pork inside, no joke, it was an over stuffed burrito.  We also shared a side of breakfast potato&#39;s.  This was a mistake since the side of potato&#39;s was like a whole other dish, it was too much food for the two of us for sure.  Excellent potato&#39;s, homemade and had a crispy exterior the way all breakfast potato&#39;s should.  

Fooducopia also offers Mimosa&#39;s and Bloodies and a few other libations for us morning drinkers.  I tried the Bloody and enjoyed the flavor as well as the crispy piece of bacon sticking out of the top.  

Now having tried Fooducopia I can definitely say it&#39;s one of the best Brunches in Denver and I would choose it over Snooze any day of the week.  Trust me - one of the best if not the best Brunch in Denver."

When we sat down, the restaurant was super busy, and although the staff were super friendly, they looked overwhelmed. 

We ordered the basic breakfast plate for our 2-year old daughter which consisted of potatoes, eggs, and a choice of a meat (ham). Hubby ordered a hash and I ordered the proscuitto eggs benedict. In general the food was just alright. Nothing special and nothing really stood out to us. 

The main reason why I gave this place 2-stars was that I found pieces of egg shells in my eggs. Not just 1 piece but 2 pieces. I was going to say something to them, but they looked so busy that I decided not to bother. Luckily, the shells were in my eggs and not on my daughter&#39;s plate. We won&#39;t be back again."

Not as a garnish, which would at least have had some misguided purpose, but rather appearing like a giant warning sign that they do NOT understand cross contamination at all. The manager was horrified and comped our meal. The ticket clearly said gluten allergy. To make things worse it took a very long time to get our food. There were empty tables, and yet not enough staff. And, as a final insult, their earl grey tea was made with so little actual tea as to be more an experience of drinking hot water.

For a small, neighborhood spot touting locally sourced food we had high expectations. The menu is super small which is understandable given that it can only seat maybe 20 people. Both of our entrees were underwhelming though. Lamb/bison burger was dry and overcooked (ordered medium rare, came out close to well done). Side of &#34;Parisian gnocchi&#34; was tasty because anything fried is, but a nice side of fries would have been just as exciting. The Marlin entree was also overcooked and under seasoned. Corn salsa on top added some moisture but the flavors were seriously dulled by the heavy handed avocado crema underneath. I really wish they left that off. Fried plantains were tasty but very oil logged, and the sogginess wasn&#39;t helped by swimming in the avocado sauce. 

It would be nice if the menu changed a little more but we will most likely not be back for dinner anytime soon."

I had the wild mushroom omelette, I asked it not be overcooked. This has been a problem in Colorado, so I have been specifying when ordering. It came borderline overcooked, while the mushrooms were undercooked. I don&#39;t think I found 4 kinds as the menu description listed. They were in the eggs themselves. If I was going to make this at home, I would sauté the mushrooms first , and fold them into the center of the eggs with the goat cheese. Also the dish was bland and unseasoned. I had the biscuit with gravy as the side. I was not a fan of the biscuit, but the gravy was one of the best things I tasted. My boyfriend got the pork belly hash. The pork and the potatoes were quite dry, and that is sad, hash should have some moisture. Our friends got the mushroom omelette, and the banana foster french toast. The french toast was very good, but also will put you into diabetic shock. I can&#39;t do much in the way of sweets, especially for the first meal, but if you like sugar you will be in heaven. They have a chill patio, we went on a weekday and it was very pleasant sitting out there.

They are a local supplier,  and farm to table restaurant. I like that, but for the price point, and the slightly disappointing dishes, it is a hard sell for me to go back."

Off track? Not at all. Fooducopia fills my foodie heart with joy and fresh veggies. The man friend and I stopped in for an early brunch on our return home from DIA in need of a sunny atmosphere and sustenance. 

I ordered the pesto scramble which featured blackened potatoes, fresh and lightly cooked veggies, fluffy eggs and a meaty green pesto. Add some organic ketchup to the mix and there you have a perfect breakfast. The man ordered the savory french toast but my food was too good to sacrifice stomach space and try his dish. 

We cleaned our plates without cleaning out our wallet. I&#39;d happily return here for more meals, friendly service and my little foodie love affair."

A place that serves a breakfast plate that lets you choose and side and one of those sides is a PANCAKE! Yeah, forget silly fruit or breakfast potatoes, nothing goes better with eggs and bacon than a single, side order of pancake. I speak from experience people.

Fooducopia is such an interesting little spot - the right side is a little shop with locally sourced grocery items and the left is a restaurant where you can eat breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner. I was there for breakfast and had The Square Plate which is served with two eggs cooked to order, choice of meat, toast, and the aforementioned side for $10.99. I also had a pot of tea to drink which they will steep 2-3 times for you. 

The atmosphere is super cute, the people there are super friendly, and the food is quite good. All in all, I&#39;m definitely a fan of Fooducopia!"

My friend who lives near Wash Park and I decided to do a weekday brunch here and expected less of a crowd than what we have heard happens on the weekend but did not expect to be the only ones here, but we were. Sometimes that can spell disaster on freshness of ingredients or care at these  places, but not here. We had a very sweet server who kept an eye on our table, refilling my teapot before I had to ask and being helpful in any way possible. The cook (or manager) came out to check on our food and offer any extra condiments we might want, which the server had already done too. I guess we had their complete attention.

I had the &#34;pork belly biscuit,&#34;  which was really a twist on a benedict since it came with a poached egg and hollandaise on each pork belly slab covered biscuit half. The eggs were just right for me, with the yolk just fluid enough to spread when broken but not so wet it would run off of the rest. The ample side of potatoes was very crispy and fresh, hot from the skillet and cut with skin on. My style! The pot of tea was a cute spring loaded drip funnel that drains automatically when you place it over a mug. I found the tea complemented the plate even better than my usual espresso drink. Since I passed on the fruit or salad side option as I always choose potatoes when offered, perhaps a decorative palate cleanser slice of orange on the plate would have been a nice touch.

I would absolutely go back again when in the area on a weekday and I would probably try the savory French toast next. I had a hard time deciding which for today.

It was so easy to park at 10:30am on a Tuesday, right by the front door. And another nice touch was that the restroom was up to date, clean and nicely decorated, not always the case in a small neighborhood cafe in an old building. Also, the grocery portion had some organic produce and locally preserved MM Local veggies and some other brand goods. There was a cold case too but I did not have time to look through  it, but this would be a nice convenience for the neighborhood.

Nice folks and nice food in a quaint setting."

We made a reservation for 4 for dinner, and 3 hours later we were  happy and already planning for the next visit.

I absolutely love its local-oriented menu concept that backed up with excellent execution. My husband and I ordered the Parisan Gnocchi, Peppered Beef Filet, and the Buffalo Burger. Although the portion of all these three dishes were very generous,  we still manage to  clean all the plates.

Limited seating available, so I would highly recommend to pick a low key evening with an advanced reservation to dine at Fooducopia.

It used to only serve breakfast and brunch, but two months ago Fooducopia added the dinner menu to its offering. Closed on monday and Tuesday for dinner btw."

The french press was weak, the biscuits were hard, the &#34;pork belly&#34; if you could call it that, was nearly all fat.

the portions were medium sized, but for a breakfast joint this expensive, I expected more. 

The server was also not very friendly."

My Wife and I stopped by for brunch on a Sunday. There were several open tables so the restaurant was not overly busy.

It took 5 minutes of standing by the front door before a greater walked back up to the front to seat us. Once we were seated it took another 10 minutes before we were asked about drinks, at which point we ordered our food (because we had time to view the menu). And then it took another 30 minutes to get the food. This was 45 minutes of waiting before food was at our table...

Both dishes we ordered were very good, which is why the poor service was so disappointing."

I would eat here any day over the other famous breakfast places. Wild mushroom omelette with local CO goat cheese? YES. Came served with a 10 grain toast and local strawberry jam, delicious and sweet fruit. All so good. 

My friend ordered eggs benedict with prosciutto- wow, to die for. So good. All of it. We licked our plates clean. No joke. 

Service was fantastic. Friendly and so helpful. They are also a mini market with a small selection of produce, a variety of local Colorado spices, jams, sauces, pickles. Definitely worth checking out."

The food is still tasty and features organic products, though nothing to dream about, since I like ethnically fused American food. I love the locally made sauces and jams they stock in their corner store, and what&#39;s cool is you can pick out stuff and add it to your meal (obviously, you have to pay for the full item). For instance, I picked out a particularly tasty habanero raspberry jam and added a liberal amount to the toast that came with my wild mushroom omelette (which was okay, since the omelet itself spawned a slightly unappetizing watery and oily mixture under the omelette). Their teas are fantastic, and the pressed coffee is pretty good too. Recommended choices are the filling hash, with tasty and tender pork belly, and the French toast. I&#39;m a little bit sad that they took off the breakfast burrito.

All in all, this is the brunch place I inevitably go to when I get the crazy inclination to hit up Snooze in the winter and am told there will be a 75 minute wait. Still, you should probably go before 11 if you don&#39;t want to wait at all."

Some really good things and some things that didn&#39;t blow my hair back.  Been wanting to try it.  Seems like a lot of the real raves are for breakfast/brunch and we were there for lunch (pretty limited menu).

+ Super cute place.  If they were going for the little neighborhood corner market with a small cafe attached - they nailed it.  Very cute and cozy.

+ Delightful waitress/hostess.  Quite bubbly - makes champagne blush.

+ My sando - Hummus and Roasted Veggie Sandwich + Side  with chipotle cranberry sauce   $10.99 It was amazing and a generous portion.  $10.99 seemed a little high but you get your choice of sides (which ARE expensive by themselves).  I wisely chose the soup of the day -  potato (excellent).  Food is obviously fresh and made to order.

- She had the Cuban Pork Sandwich + Side  - slow roasted pork, Swiss cheese Anija&#39;s Finnish mustard, &amp; The Real Dill pickles   $10.99.  Not good and in definite need of some food lube - dry as a bone.  She didn&#39;t care for it and passed half to me which I passed right back.  She chose the Terra Chips for her side.  Meh - just earth shoe chips out of a bag.

- She had a glass of chardonnay which was, at best, a 6 oz. pour at $8 I think.

- Kitchen was s-l-o-w.  We were the only people in the dining room on a sleepy Thursday afternoon and it was a solid 1/2 hour from order to food.

I think we&#39;d go back sometime but if this is what you&#39;re looking for I think Vert Kitchen or Gaia Bistro are much better choices."

We walked in and were so excited when we saw several open tables, particularly because it was a beautiful, sunny Saturday at 10am. The hosted greeted our party of two, and refused to seat us inside the restaurant because they had just sat two large parties, despite the fact that there were other open tables. She said it was a 30 minute wait, so we asked if we could just sit at an open table to enjoy mimosas during our 30 minute wait, and that we had no problem waiting until they took care of their newly seated, larger parties. The hostess refused at first, and then reluctantly gave in. We were seated right by the host stand, where another employee loudly commented to the hostess about how to &#34;handle that situation in the future, and to not seat people if that happens again&#34; -- I&#39;m sorry, but how ridiculous. We ultimately left the restaurant, feeling quite offended and confused. I hate to point out incompetency, but these gals... I would think the owner of the establishment would be appalled at their behavior. We went over to Devil&#39;s Food Bakery down the street.. Happily waited 45 minutes in addition to the 10 minute walk.. And couldn&#39;t have been happier. Devil&#39;s knows how to treat customers... And we hear the food is significantly better.

I saw that this place had really high reviews and was in the location we were searching.  We decided to give it a try.  I&#39;m SO GLAD that we did!!  This place is fantastic.

It&#39;s small so there aren&#39;t many tables, and if you want to sit outside with your dog you&#39;ll have to wait a little bit longer usually as there are only 4 or 5 tables outside.  There is plenty of room for them to add more tables so I sincerely hope they do a bit of rearranging so they can accommodate more outside seating.  The only downside to sitting outside is that you can&#39;t enjoy any sort of alcoholic beverage (mimosas, etc.) as they are in a residential neighborhood and can only serve alcohol inside (but note that they do have a full bar inside for the beverage of your choice).  

It&#39;s attached to a small store where you can pick up some fresh organic foods and jams...super cute and convenient!  They serve coffee in these hand made mugs that are adorable, and while you wait on a weekend you can play a game of cornhole on the side walk :-).  

On to the food.  Delicious!!  I&#39;ve been twice now.  The first time I had the Meat Frittata and the second I had the Banana Brûlée Oatmeal.  They were both super delicious!!  I have some photos I&#39;ll upload later.  The bananas in the oatmeal are out of this world.  You can order coffee in the French Press for a group (fills 4 small cups) which was delicious the first time we had it and cold the next (but we let them know and they took it off our bill).  

We&#39;ll definitely be back for breakfast and are now curious to try them out for lunch and dinner.  TOP NOTCH!"

The French Toast was more akin to thick slices of toast drizzled in fruit juice and nuts; it was at best lightly dipped in any egg batter, though more likely I think the bread simply stared longingly at an egg before being toasted on the griddle. The bacon was good though."

I&#39;ve been twice, both times on mommy/baby dates with friends.  This place is pretty tiny, but they were more than accommodating for our babies, which was really nice.  Large strollers may be a challenge, but there is space to park them off to the side (at least there was during my visits, on a weekday).

The first time, I ordered the Savory French Toast.  *drool*  This was AMAZING.  If you love French toast, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and goat cheese, and if you love to order sweet delicious breakfasts but don&#39;t actually order them because they are unhealthy so you end up ordering savory eggs dishes because they are healthier but they end up being super yummy too, then you will LOVE THIS DISH.  It is enormous but somehow I ended up finishing (impressive, I know).

The second time, I decided to go the healthier route, and I got the Greek omelette with egg whites, and it was still SUPER YUMMY!  And huge!  Score.  This came with a delicious &#34;toast&#34; that was insanely good and not actually super toast-like.  But I loved it.

Overall, I can&#39;t recommend Fooducopia highly enough.  Sure, it&#39;s a little bit of a silly name, but the prices are really reasonable and the portions are huge - and it&#39;s all local, fresh ingredients.  This is truly the epitomy of a 5-star &#34;As good as it gets!&#34; review."

While my GPS took me the craziest route to get there, on the way home I realized that Fooducopia is like one minute from Wash Park (which, makes sense now - since they do have a Wash Park omelette)!  Set at the corner of Race &amp; Kentucky, this corner cafe/market is small but actually has quite a bit going on!  As you enter the front door, it&#39;s not hard to differentiate the market from the cafe. 

I&#39;ll start with the market. I can&#39;t say that Fooducopia&#39;s market is anything more than a healthier, more local convenient store. It features last-minute needs &amp; most of the staple ingredients required for clean eating. Its a fairly efficient space with no aisles just perimeter shelves &amp; fridges for items such as:  cooking sauce, chips, bread, rice, cereal, juice, fun-flavored pickles, cheeses, limited produce and a few toiletries, as well. They also have daily &#34;Grab N Go&#34; items that seemed legit and nailed their intended purpose.

As for the meal experience... it appears this place could get pretty busy any given day.  There is not much seating - indoor or outdoor. Today they had a sign up &#34;Please Wait To Be Seated&#34;. Not sure if this is the case everyday or just on the weekends, but we followed the sign and were sat quickly. Note: if you&#39;re coming with two guests, you WILL be sat at a two-top. Three or four guests will get first dibs on the four-tops. They seemed very strict on this. 

Our first server Ren immediately greeted us and served ice-cold water in cute Mason Jars the minute we sat. This is a hot button of mine, so she made me very happy!  She started helping other tables so a different server - didn&#39;t get an intro nor did I ask her name - came over to take our order. The second server made a point to say she could help us while Ren was busy. Ren came over next as the second server was passing by (so she stopped too) and asked for our order again. We politely said the other server got it and she attempted to cover a &#34;wtf face&#34; with explaining their operation of teamwork. It wasn&#39;t a minute later that we overheard girls in the kitchen having a conversation that basically was the equivalent to &#34;so she took your table?&#34;. That made us feel bad initially; but by the end, a few different servers touched our table so we confirmed with the cashier that all tips are pulled and they are. This makes me believe timing or &#34;getting in the weeds&#34; was the true concern of the girls in the kitchen, rather them gossiping about whose table is whose. And to me, that&#39;s a level of service I can appreciate. 

In regard to the food, it arrived in a timely manner with all proper accompaniments and was steaming with warmth. Definitely didn&#39;t wait in a window! My Bananas Foster French Toast included four thick pieces of broiche toast covered in pecans &amp; soft bananas. My husband&#39;s Wash Park Omelette was the perfect size and was served with Potato Chunks. We were both surprised by how unevenly the toppings in the omelette were spread throughout and how bland the potatoes were, however. Aren&#39;t potatoes served at breakfast always supposed to have remnants of onions to add that specific flavor we all love? Maybe its a midwest thing... hahah. 

I&#39;ll close with our intent to return for dinner, once the Chef returns from his wedding vacation... They take reservations for dinner and it seems a bit more up my alley. Don&#39;t confuse my review for the food &amp; service not being good at this time of the day, because both were. That said, nothing set this place apart in taste or offerings from any other brunch spot in Denver. So... onto the next."

The hostess, however,  was rude &amp; very bothered by our arrival there on a relatively slow Saturday morning. We asked if we could sit on the front patio &amp; received an angry &#34;no&#34; because they are unable to serve food at those tables. A simple explanation would have sufficed. I later heard the same hostess raise her voice in a panic as someone brought their dog onto the outdoor patio when the dog should have been outside the fence. Again, a simple explanation would have obtained the same results. The adolescent drama and rudeness was almost laughable. 

The hostess was the only contradiction to the otherwise awesome Fooducopia experience."

It&#39;s convenient for her to walk to from her office, but it wasn&#39;t so convenient for me... Warning: parking is terrible here. I mean, in an it&#39;s-easier-to-find-parking-downtown way. Once I found a spot a couple of blocks away, I walked in and we were sat in the bar area by a friendly host. The first thing we both noticed and commented on at the same time was the noise level. It&#39;s LOUD in here. There seems to be a trend with newer establishments to have raised ceilings with exposed ductwork and oh-so-chic concrete floors and such (you know, the &#34;industrial look&#34;?). Well, it ends up creating rooms that reverberate normal level conversations to really high levels. It&#39;s not the best practice... 

Once we sat down, we were warmly greeted by the bartender who was also our server for lunch. He was very attentive, and the menu had a lot of interesting things on it, which I was pleasantly surprised by. We started with their pub pretzels with housemade cheese sauce, and they were yummy. As entrees, my sister had the Maverick Chicken Quesadilla (off the starter menu) and I had the West Coast Club Sandwich. The food yummy-ness kind of stopped there... The housemade potato chips are decent, but need seasoning or salt of some kind and the bread they serve the sandwich on (described as &#34;wheat&#34; on the menu) is icky. Lumpy with all kinds of seeds in it. It doesn&#39;t toast well, and makes for a dry, dry sandwich. Also, the guacamole on the sandwich and served with the quesadilla tastes like the kind that comes out of the cheap plastic containers at the grocery store (as in, not even the premium kind at the grocery store). Yuck. My sister who eschews salt, actually picked up the salt shaker and added salt to her quesadilla. I have literally never seen her add salt to food. Never. I ate about 1/4 of my entree. 

The service was really good, but aside from the appetizer, the food wasn&#39;t even average, especially for the price. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go back. I think three stars is generous, but hey, it&#39;s Friday...cheers!"

Forget the plastic fork and heating lamps, take an actual lunch break and walk into the fresh and tasty.

The pretzel with beer cheese was fantastic. You get what are essentially three pretzel loaf stick things, and a bunch of beer cheese sauce. I&#39;m used to places that either have good bread and not very good cheese, or vice versa, but Cedar Creek does a fantastic job at both, it&#39;s a must order for an appetizer.

So that means I don&#39;t really come too often and this definitely wouldn&#39;t be my top choice of restaurant if I am hungry. It basically has monopoly over the whole area and I think people eat here largely for convenience sake. The food is mediocre and there aren&#39;t a huge variety of choices. They are definitely lacking in the vegetarian department (speaking on behalf of my veggie friends). Everything is also slightly over priced but they do give large portions to make up for it. There is ample seating throughout the pub and it&#39;s generally kept well cleaned. The owner helps out with donations for various school clubs if you ask well ahead of time so students really appreciate that. 

They have a nice beer selection as well but I&#39;ve had more food there than beer. The quesidillas are pretty good. Even though they are under the appetizer section, the portion is enough for a meal. The san juan burger is massive and it comes with fries and usually lasts me two meals. The gemini is pretty good as well. I have also tried the BLT sandwich which comes with whole wheat bread and very crispy bacon and a ton of fries. I was so stuffed, i didn&#39;t even finish the fries. As you can see, it&#39;s your basic bar foods but the menu is pretty small in comparison to other bars. I hope they expand the menu and make the prices cheaper. It&#39;s not ok to be so expensive just because of lack of competition. Or I hope more restaurants open up within walking distance of fitz."

My first two visits weren&#39;t really all that great. The drinks and food were good but the service left a lot to be desired.

But my view is now a changing! The last two times I have gone the bartender Stephanie has helped us. Both times she was super friendly, engaging and seemed to be enjoying her job. Bravo on making Stephanie a part of your team! She has made us want to return to our neighborhood pub!
They have a rotating tap selection which is usually packed with good local beers, including some from Coda which is right across the street. 
Food wise I would have to say that the quesadillas and pierogies are my favorite. I&#39;ve tried a couple of the sandwiches and have always been pleased though they didn&#39;t really EAT ME AGAIN! The only thing on the menu I have encountered that I didn&#39;t really enjoy were the wings. I will admit to being a wing snob and that&#39;s probably why I wasn&#39;t a fan.

They have a decent selection of beers here most notable a few coda beers, a few southern california brews (ballast point, bruery), coors, and a few others. 

As for the food, I got to try:
Bourbon Pub steak: Not a bad entree.  At $14, this is a nice little dinner to satisfy the stomach.  The mash potatoes were good and the brocolli added some greens to the plate.  Ask for more of their bourbon sauce to compliment your steak.  (I ordered medium rare and it was cooked medium).

Elk Burger: While the sweet potato fries that came with the burger were perfect, the elk burger itself was just okay.  The patty was quite thin and didn&#39;t have a lot of juice to it.  Just an okay burger.  (I ordered medium rare and it was pretty cooked).

While visiting the restaurant itself isn&#39;t out of the question, I&#39;d actually prefer to chill at Coda Brewing and do a phone-order from there.  That way you get to enjoy the entire selection of Coda while munching on a few bites.  Otherwise, if a game is on, Cedar creek isn&#39;t a bad place to spend your evening."

Granted, this might not be CCP&#39;s doing but it still affects the business.

I will say that our server was GREAT! She was efficient and polite and took great care of us. I was very surprised by the quickness of the crew. All of the employees were really nice and they were workin&#39; hard.

Personally, I just wasn&#39;t a fan of the location or the atmosphere. It seemed like a bunch of hoity-toity clientele who were snooty and snotty. Sure, it&#39;s situated next to a golf course but this ain&#39;t Bushwood (insert Caddyshack reference here). 

The menu seemed a bit pretentious. Most items were crazy expensive for a pub. I had a burger that was ok, not great. For $15 I expected more. I hear the garlic parmesan chicken wings are good but I didn&#39;t get the chance to try them. 

Would I go back? Sure, but I would walk so that I don&#39;t have to deal with parking and I would go at non-busy time. I&#39;m willing to give it another shot but the first experience was totally meh."

I&#39;ve been here several times this year since finding this pub while exploring the neighborhood, and each time has been a good experience. 

I&#39;ve tried the fish and chips, pub pretzels, wings hot, and elk burger; all well prepared and exactly what I expect of a quality kitchen. Nothing was greasy, or under/over cooked. I&#39;ve also taken my wife and friends here in a group of five, and we had no trouble getting service or drinks.

In particular I went here on St. Patricks day, and found that for a pub they had a comfortable sized crowd, as well as a real rarity on tap; Deschutes the Abyss. The very fact that the owner was willing to put it on tap for the holiday makes it a really special place in my book. 

This is a great pub, with really well prepared food, great drinks, and a relaxed atmosphere. Don&#39;t expect to pay dive bar prices, because quality food and quality drinks are not cheap, but also you can expect to avoid the drunken Friday night crowds while still having a great selection for dinner and drinks."

We grabbed seat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a bartender who did not want us there.  That cost this review a star.

They have a small but good tap list, and a very good whisky list.  We ordered a couple of beers and filed away the whisky for future reference.  
 
After perusing the menu, we went with the pierogi, dry rub wings. and the Gemini sandwich. Being of Czech descent, I was thrilled to see the former on the menu.  They made a good sour cream habanero sauce to accompany it.  The dry rub wings really didn&#39;t impress us, we found them a little flat.  The sandwich I would gladly return for.  

Overall I feel the menu has much potential and I can&#39;t wait to sample more.  And I love the beers they offer. 

The downside....  That bartender hated us.  He really made us feel unwelcome and I noticed that he treated others the same way.  I&#39;ll come back but I&#39;ll sit in a servers section if he&#39;s working."

It&#39;s a good restaurant, especially compared to most around the area in terms of atmosphere.

The food is really good! I am a big fan of the chicken quesadilla and buffalo chicken salad. It&#39;s a tad pricy but I guess that&#39;s what you get when there&#39;s little competition for the wallets of the staff and students of a huge medical campus. The service is VERY hit or miss. There are a few servers that seem to be perpetually in a bad mood-- but other than that, the owner and other servers are great. 

They have a KILLER selection of eclectic draft beer from all over the United States. Every time I go here, they have multiple beers that I&#39;ve never heard of before which is neat.  
They host trivia nights on a weekly basis, and the lady that leads them is amazing.

They have happy hour from 3-6pm daily, but the discount isn&#39;t anything to get excited about. I&#39;ve had many conversations with classmates about how much more often we would come to this place after school if they had a good happy hour with &#34;cheap beers&#34; like PBR/Coors for a couple of bucks, but I guess that&#39;s not the managements cup of tea. I think there&#39;s a ton of untapped potential since they&#39;re attached to an apartment complex FULL of students. I know for a fact my friends and I would be weekend regulars if there was some sort of late night happy hour with heavily discounted &#34;cheap beer&#34; or food.

CONS: 
I&#39;ll be honest, the service I received (or lack of service I received) here on two different occasions is enough for me to warrant this &#34;meh I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; 2 stars. I appreciate the convenience of having a restaurant/pub to visit near campus and I can understand why this place can get pretty crowded sometimes (trivia nights, lack of competing restaurants and pubs in the area, non-shady patrons, variety of drinks and eats) but their happy hour is hardly a good deal and their lack of attentiveness to customers during busy times is inexcusable. 

It was really hard for me to flag down a waiter/waitress when I came here and I even walked around looking for a hostess or someone to let me know if there were seats available. I&#39;m not at all an inpatient person but I think it took me a considerable amount of time before I could talk to a worker about getting seated. 

I can understand that a restaurant gets busy but I&#39;ve been to plenty of busy restaurants before and I&#39;ve never been blatantly ignored before while waiting to get serviced. I even made eye contact with several waitresses who, I&#39;m pretty sure, saw me and then looked away (rather than give me some indication that they&#39;d be with me in a minute). 

This is my 2nd time writing this review. The first time I wrote it I had someone message me telling me &#34;cmon give the place a break they were busy.&#34; Do you really think that a restaurant being busy gives them a pass for not having attentive service? Restaurants get busy. That&#39;s not abnormal."

We just moved here from Fort Lauderdale and were very happily surprised at their Maker&#39;s 46 price ($8)! The Happy Hour beer selection was lacking, but it was still nice to be offered Happy Hour on a Saturday.  

The restaurant itself is gorgeous! We asked the bartenders when they get busy on the weekends and they told us they are mostly a week day place, as Anschutz it literally next door.

The bonus to the place not being crowded is that we got to pretty much control the TVs and were able to watch Florida play and the Braves game at the same time with no competition!

The food and drinks are both par and tasty for the price. Service is good, never rushed or slow. Almost always friendly and casual, which is exactly what I want from a neighborhood pub. 

We stopped in to watch the college football championship during our most recent visit and were surprised to find that the place was less than packed. In fact there were probably less than six groups on the place. On the one hand, this makes me sad because I want this place to do well. On the other, it&#39;s nice to have a secret watering hole that&#39;s never busy. But ultimately I want the former more than the latter so I&#39;m here to let you all know that Cedar Creek Pub is definitely deserving of your patronage in the near future!"

Conveniently located across the street from the Anschutz medical campus at the fitzsimmons apartments it&#39;s great for post exam drinks and food. I always enjoy the beer they have on tap and usually end up going with ciders which have all been good. I think it&#39;s about $4.50 for a beer which isn&#39;t bad. Food is around $10 a plate. I&#39;m obsessed with the cedar club sandwich I always order this. It&#39;s just a simple turkey sandwich with avocado and bacon but man it&#39;s good. The wings here are also really good with side of ranch. Gotta try the pretzel when you&#39;re here it&#39;s a great snack or meal it&#39;s enough to share with a table of people or if that&#39;s your main meal great for just you as well.

Consistently delicious food from a regularly changing menu that is Colorado Proud, friendly and efficient wait staff, and a pretty fabulous happy hour menu.

I&#39;m delighted that Cedar Creek appears to be gaining ground in the Anschutz Medical Campus area.  It&#39;s truly a lovely place to have lunch, HH, or dinner, and enjoy time with friends and coworkers.

I had the bourbon pub steak.  While the meat itself was cooked properly, the glaze tasted like it was mostly soy sauce.  The mashed potatoes were dense and not at all what I had hoped for.  Again, the place has good beer and decent service.  The food is just lacking."

Appetizer took about 20 minutes to arrive, food 15 minutes after Appetizer. Both food and appetizer were good.

I will tell you that the food has really, really continued to improve since the restaurant&#39;s opening. My personal favorites have to be the Portobello burger, the Elk burger (with an over medium egg :), or the wedge salad!! As for beer? Gosh. It depends on the day of the week.

Seriously, I wouldn&#39;t have known there was a pub here if my husband (who works on the campus) hadn&#39;t ventured out for a happy hour a few weeks back.  Since we were in the vicinity over the weekend, he decided to take me to lunch here.

On a late Saturday afternoon, the place was nearly empty.  My husband assured me that it had been packed for Thursday night happy hour.  The layout is nice, and, like the typical pub, has booths as well as tables (both high and low), with lots of wood accents.  All the TVs are tuned to ESPN, natch.

Our waitress was friendly, and the food appeared quickly.  I had the chipotle chicken sandwich, but sampled heavily from my husband&#39;s grilled tuna salad with pear and gorgonzola.  Both were healthy choices -- you can ask for dressing or mayo on the side, and we skipped any fries.  The amount of food wasn&#39;t overwhelming, which was great.  However, there wasn&#39;t anything radically special about it.  The salad came from a standard, store-bought mix, and the chicken and tuna looked like they&#39;re the kind that are bought in bulk at Sam&#39;s Club.  Not a bad thing, as they&#39;re certainly yummy and edible and all that, but nothing...special.

It looks like yet MORE condos are being built behind the current set, so the pub is sure to have more business in the near future.  I&#39;m sure it will become a neighborhood hang-out for the immediate locals if it isn&#39;t already (since dining options near the medical center are not exactly plentiful).  Overall, it&#39;s a good place to grab a bite if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn&#39;t bother driving a long distance  to seek it out."

We had tried a variety of dishes at cedar creek including the elk burger, tuna steak salad, shrimp and walnut salad, cedar fries, and a few drinks. The salad was described as being on a bed of mixed greens; however, what arrived came on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Additionally, items which were not in the menu description were included in the dishes. For example, the shrimp and walnut salad came with shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese, much like you would get from a bag of cheese at the local king soopers. Unfortunately, none of this translated into being a good meal. Conversely, nothing was bad either. In short this was a disappointing meal for 80 dollars, and with so many better options out in the marketplace, it is not worth your expanditure. That said, if they can find a chef who can execute the otherwise great menu, this could become a star. As of now, this is not that place."

It has the usual burger/sandwich menu, complete with a very nice beer selection.  Non-happy hour prices are a bit high, especially if you work on campus and just want something other than Subway or Jimmy John&#39;s, but at least the place is clean and comfortable, and it has lots of TVs as well if there happen to be some day games on tap.  Burgers come &#34;pink&#34; or &#34;no pink&#34;, which is a bit odd, but generally are cooked as indicated.  I&#39;ve tried the chipotle chicken sandwich, which I enjoyed, and also the elk burger for a little something different.  I wish there were a few more options on the menu, though in fairness they do change it up from time to time, and there is a daily special as well.

Got the feeling the Sysco truck was in the back unloading the entrees onto the conveyor belt as we were sitting down.  Spring rolls were clearly a frozen then heated-up appetizer.  One spring roll had no evidence of any ingredients other than spring roll wrapper.  Bagged lettuce.  American cheese on the chicken sandwich?  Really? TIGF quality food, just higher prices.

The acoustics of the place make for a sound-rebounding hell.  Lots of loud happy hour patrons, but then again, it is happy hour in a bar.

I have been here a few times over the last month and am always disappointed with the service.  Service is slow and the servers are unengaged, crabby and bitter.  Most recently, had a decent sized party and the initial drinks took forever which is expected.  After initial serving, I would think that the drinks would be replenished quickly.  The waitress rarely checked back in with us and so we often had empty glasses.  Several times, someone from my party actually had to stand up and find the waitress to submit additional orders.  In addition, we had moved the tables into a square shape (with the manager&#39;s assistance) which apparently was not the preference of our server.  She constantly made under her breath comments about how the tables weren&#39;t arranged how she liked them, she couldn&#39;t get to everyone and we would have to pass drinks down.  We were fine to do that in order to create more of a group environment.  Despite us saying it was fine, she made an annoyed comment several times.

The icing on the cake was when we had individuals from another group join our group.  When the checks came, one person offered to pay for both checks.  The server from the smaller group who had moved over said, &#34;No, I need to get tipped for this.&#34;  While the point is valid, there is a much more tactful way to say it.  Something like &#34;since you had different servers, would it be ok to keep them separate?&#34;.  Or, even better, have some customer service and let people pay how they want and worry about the tips internally.

As mentioned by others, Cedar Creek is the only pub on campus so I will be back.  But, hopefully they can treat customers like we have a choice rather than acting like they know we have to be there and will come back no matter what the experience."

It would be nice if they had a rotating appetizer menu - as this is the only pub on campus, and probably the only pub I&#39;d go to in this neighborhood.   I typically go for happy hour, so I am sick to death of the app menu. The food is alright, but nothing I&#39;ve gotten excited about or raved about. Also, drink and regular meal prices seem high to me, but maybe I am just cheap.  I think they can get away with charging higher drink and food prices because there is no other option.  Triva night was fun. Staff is very friendly.  I hate to give it a 2 becuase I have had so many happy times here, but they really need to step up their menu.  I haven&#39;t had anything terrible, just nothing exciting or even really good."

The interior is beautiful and the space expansive.  The owner, Tommy, waived us over to the bar and following our questions began to tell us how Cedar Creek came about.  It&#39;s the first restaurant / pub in the revitalized and growing Fitzsimmons Biotech area and their speciality is local brews and local / handcrafted liquor.

Truth be told, we didn&#39;t have time for a any food; however, the menu looked strong and should only grow beyond the 3 months of their existence.

We&#39;ll definitely be back to enjoy their large outdoor patio area and the relative peace and quite of an upcoming neighborhood."

The sad part is, the food is actually good.  The service completely kills any appeal.  The servers are always very snotty, completely unorganized and extremely slow.  I was told that a certain beer was not on tap, my coworker arrived two minutes later and ordered the same beer I originally requested and was told it was just tapped.  After asking to change my order to my original request, I was told it was too late with an incredibly snotty attitude.  Any other restaurant would have tried to meet my request, considering both of our beers arrived to our table at the same time.  This pub does not go by the mantra that the customer is always right.  They argue when you question a charge on your tab and are very reluctant to change it for you. It&#39;s really too bad that the service is so awful because it&#39;s very conveniently located on the medical campus.  This is a skip for sure."

Note: don&#39;t be like me, the person who didn&#39;t realize you have to grab a menu from the wall before sitting down at a table and waiting like a true rookie.

We got here around 6:30 on a Saturday night and the lower part of the restaurant was pretty full but the upstairs had plenty of seating. The hubs particularly liked how they had college football playing on the TV. We both got medium bowls of pho (warning: portions are gigantic) and they came out crazy fast. The broth was flavorful and they def didn&#39;t skimp on the meat!  My biggest pet peeve is when pho comes out with noodles that are either soggy or stuck together, but luckily that wasn&#39;t the case here! The owner rang us up at the counter when we were done and was super nice, he even recognized other guests in line and took time to ask about their weekends.

My one semi-complaint-ish thing is that they serve milk tea with boba as a slushy. I would&#39;ve preferred just normal milk tea, but maybe that&#39;s a personal preference thing. The food and service more than made up for the iffy drink! 

We&#39;ll def be back for more!"

After a few minutes, we were seated. This place seems very understaffed and employees look way too busy. Waiters were clearing tables, no bussers? We gave our drink order to a rushed guy and our soda and coffee never came.

On the other hand, our food came out pretty quick. We got an egg roll appetizer which had a beautiful presentation and was extremely fresh. 

Each of us got our own version of pho. The medium is huge! Definitely getting the small next time. They were delicious, healthy, and fresh. I got the chicken and it pulled apart beautifully and was so flavorful.

We waited in line to pay up front. They have an archaic method of using hand written receipts which holds things up and does not seem very reliable. 

We were on our way, running a bit late. Again, food is great, but the service staff needs to nearly be doubled to manage the lunch rush."

The rice seemed a bit dry or old and the meats were definitely reheated from prior cooking. Their pho might be the way to go since the reviews seem to be high when pho was ordered.

I will say their boba tea is great (tapioca balls were soft, flavors weren&#39;t too sweet or strong, definitely well balanced). Additionally, the service was very accommodating and attentive."

The spring rolls were also good but I was missing my favorite ingredient of cilantro. It was missing from my pho veggie plate too. Obviously I didn&#39;t miss it THAT much after the fact but cilantro reminds me of the homemade Vietnamese food I used to eat.

The space is your typical pho restaurant, divey and casual -- and it&#39;s a good sign this place was packed with diners during lunch hour.

SPRING ROLL WITH SHRIMP &amp; PORK - $4.50 for 2
Disappointing b/c it was mostly shredded iceberg lettuce and a lot of vermicelli noodles. At least the peanut dipping sauce was good. I&#39;d skip the spring rolls next time.

GRILLED CHICKEN BOWL - $8.50

This place started as a hole in the wall and had I not gone into that parking lot, I would have never even known it existed. Since my first time eating there, they bought extra space next to them and went from having roughly 12 tables in their restaurant to just about doubling in size. 

The staff is very personable and truly knows the importance of providing a great customer experience. I used to eat here almost weekly (and sometimes more during snowy weeks) and they have consistently remembered my order and would have it ready for me when I came in. 

The highlight of this restaurant is the beef noodle soup. The only broth that competes with theirs is the pho in Southglenn, and I would still gladly come here first. The pho is absolutely delicious, meat is tender, and the quality is consistent. If you&#39;re looking for an appetizer, try their lettuce wraps. The other entrees are all delicious, but their pho is so well done, I can&#39;t stress it enough and that it is a must try!

Fantastic food with friendly, helpful service.  I love their spring rolls and noodle bowls.  Their shrimp are big and juicy and tasty.  One of the people working there (the lady that goes around to each table and talks to all of the customers) came by my table this time and we chatted.  She also recommended I try the chicken wings, though I told her I like to just stick with my favorites and said I might come back the very next day.  She asked if I didn&#39;t want to try something new or if I didn&#39;t get tired of the same thing for multiple days and I said, &#34;not when the food is this good!&#34;

Anyway my only regret was ordering with my eyes instead of my stomach.  The rice noodle bowl was huge and had a generous portion of rice noodles (my favorite part).

They give generous portions and use high quality meat and vegetables. I&#39;ve found most of the places in Colorado use pretty fatty meat. My wife and I eat a ton of Pho and Ramen and we probably go to this place 3 times a month at least for lunch. The Vietnamese Egg Rolls are also great. Honestly though since we both love the Pho so much we don&#39;t venture out on the menu much. The pork chop with rice is also very good though.

My manager recommended Pho Lee, only about half a mile from our hotel. I walked over (in the perfect denver sunshine) and was greeted by a server who patiently walked me through all my options, after I explained I was vegetarian, didn&#39;t want pho / anything brothy, and liked spicy dishes. 

The server highly recommended the coconut curry pad thai (how innovative!), and I read a few reviews about it as well. I decided to try and I was so impressed! There was a large amount of thin tofu strips, which were great and made it feel like you got some in most bites, rather than big bits you have to ration in your meal. The coconut curry taste was already great - not too heavy, like I was worried about, and spicy and flavorful, making the typical lightly sweet pad thai taste a little less sweet. The coconut curry is NOT like a curry on the side of your pad thai. The pad thai noodles instead are just seasoned with the coconut curry, so you still have just a solid noodle dish with curry flavors. 

I also ordered the pearl milk tea smoothie. Unfortunately, it came out way too sweet (should have asked for less sweet). The smoothie concept was cool - i&#39;m used to just liquid pearl milk tea, but this was heavier and had the potential to be really good. 

This place deserves 5 stars just for the service: Special thanks to the sweet server, who answered all my annoying questions (&#34;is there fish sauce&#34;, &#34;can you make it spicy...but not SO spicy&#34;, &#34;how spicy if your food usually&#34;, &#34;how thick is the smoothie&#34;), gave me water and a table while I waited AND gave me every type of hot sauce since I was doing take out. 

I will be back (possibly tonight)."

Food portions were enormous especially for the price. I ordered the combo noodles bowl and my girlfriend had the vegetable pho. The vegetable pho was good, besides the tofu which was just rather bland and unseasoned. Loved that they have you huge amounts of basil, jalapeño, cilantro and sprouts to customize your pho and make it your own. 

The combo bowl was great, huge amounts of chicken, pork, and beef but did wish they gave you more then 2 shrimp for maybe a little less of everything else. We also had an order of chicken pot stickers that were very good.

I had the Tofu Veggie soup, it was perfect. The spice was just right, it was seasoned just right to go with the bean sprouts, lime basil etc. I had the medium which was definitely two meals worth at least. There wasn&#39;t much tofu but the portion was already more than I could finish. The spice level was perfect, there wasn&#39;t a dry nose in the restaurant but I could still taste the food and it wasn&#39;t &#39;need a glass of milk&#39; hot. 

I wouldn&#39;t recommend the boba tea, it wasn&#39;t great. I don&#39;t consider this a detractor because I was here for the food but it&#39;s worth mentioning. There was a misplaced flavor in my Thai boba, almost like it was made with broth or stored with other food items. I was looking for a regular Thai tea but they only have the boba version on the menu.  

The service is always excellent, friendly and attentive. Everyone seems genuinely happy and relaxed which creates a similar dining environment. 

Other than the boba tea, my only feedback would be to ditch the video game music playing in the background. 

Update:

I have been eating here often, sometimes three times a week, they recognize me now. I feel a little like an addict because I get the same thing every time but it has to be my favorite food of all time. The vegetable broth is a little different every time I order it. They explained that they add shrimp tail to the veggie broth so I&#39;ve been asking them to leave it off. I got beef broth instead once when I ordered to go but I mentioned it next time and haven&#39;t had a problem since. 

The spring rolls are warm rather than cold which I like better and you can order them with tofu. The peanut sauce is fantastic. I believe it comes with the noodle bowls too. My friend has tried the pad thai which is more saucy than i&#39;ve seen before but she loved it. My husband had the fried rice which he said was light and not too oily."

At the time their customer service and food brought me back multiple times a week. I eventually changed job locations which forced me to find a new spot. 

Today I was in the area and chose to go eat at Pho Lee for the first time in a long time. I ordered my usual small combination pho with steak on the side. When my bowl came out all I had for meat was steak on the side. The waiter agreed to fix the mistake and came back in a fairly prompt manner with the correct dish. While he was gone I fixed up the steak on the side which was left while he got the rest of my meat. When he got back with my bowl he told me that I was going to pay extra for the meat that I had fixed up. I told him it was his mistake and I don&#39;t think I should have to pay extra. The waiter seemed kind of irritated, walked away and I didn&#39;t see him the rest of my time eating. The interaction we had was mild so I didn&#39;t think much of it. 

While at the cash register paying I see the waiter go up to another patron in the restaurant that he apparently knew, pointed at me and loudly said &#34;You see that guy! He&#39;s an A$$#ole!&#34;. I was taken back and shocked immediately asking the owner that was swiping my credit card if she heard what he said. I told her what he said and she said &#34;Oh i&#39;ll talk to him&#34;. I told her that I would not ever return back to this restaurant because of this and she said &#34;Oh ok&#34;.  As i&#39;m walking out the door in shock I hear the guy yelling again and look back to see him yelling &#34;He&#39;s an A$$#ole!&#34; looking like he would probably fight me if I walked back to him.  Being a non confrontational person I just walked away in awe. 

To the owner:
  I&#39;m still quite shocked at your response to your employee yelling &#34;He&#39;s an A$$#ole&#34; in a full dining room during lunch rush. I&#39;m not sure if you are aware but this isn&#39;t really considered the best of customer service. I work in the customer service industry and would love to give you some advice on how to handle these situations. I&#39;ll give you a hint on how to handle this one... You walk the guy out right then and there (I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s family or a friend). 

To the waiter that thinks i&#39;m an &#34;A$$#hole&#34;:
  You apparently had a bad day and i&#39;m sorry for that. If you screw up somebody&#39;s order and they get a little extra steak out of the deal i&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not a good reason to get so upset. I truly do hope you find a way to cope with your anger because that can&#39;t be a satisfying life to live. I think you need a hug."

It&#39;s walking distance from the hotel, is super quick and the portions are huge (maybe TOO big)! 

I like to judge a Vietnamese restaurant on the lumpia/egg rolls and bun with grilled pork. Both were excellent and even better than usual because...

1) Our server told us the proper way to eat the rolls. All these years and I never knew to wrap the roll in the romaine and mint. Man, this really changed the flavor experience for me. 

2) Unlike most bun I&#39;ve had, the noodles were warm. I&#39;ve always thought the cold noodles were odd and I appreciated this version. 

I would give it a 5-star review, but because the portions were so big, I felt as if I wasted a lot of food."

Both tasted like something you&#39;d get in the frozen foods section of the grocery. I&#39;m extremely dubious about the veracity of the other reviews. This is making me really lose faith in the usefulness of Yelp.
pho-lee-greenwood-village-2,Caroline B.,0APKAz9SgMkclnUaC52OIQ,"Littleton, CO",0,1,0,4,16,zkx2t3lWM678vYAvkX0qZA,1.0,2015-09-18,"I had high expectations of this restaurant because of the reviews. Well...I was disappointed. Actually, my husband and I were both disappointed. He ordered the combination (grilled beef, pork, chicken, shrimp and egg rolls) on noodles, and I ordered combination (grilled beef, pork, chicken, shrimp and egg rolls) on rice. We also both ordered  coconut boba tea (our favorite)! 
ENTRANCE. As soon as we came in, they tried seating is at the table next to the door. Being our 1st time at this restaurant, we did not know they had another section up the stairs. They did not offer us a table there, and yet customers who came after us, were led there. Fortunately, another booth opened up (still close to the door) and I signaled one server that we were moving, and he signaled to wait a second. He did not move to clean the table though, so I signaled to another one, and still no movement. The older man (I think he&#39;s the owner) came and finally cleaned off the table.
ORDERING. We waited about 15 min before someone took our order. The servers were moving back and forth passed our booth and nobody bothered to take our order. I had to signal again to the older man (the owner?) and he sent a female server. She apologized for the wait when she came to take our order. I liked that!
FOOD ARRIVAL. The server brought our food and we forgot to ask for a fork for my husband. I use chopsticks, but my husband does not. I tried catching the attention of a server to no avail. Finally, when the (owner?) came to bring boba tea to a table next to us, I asked him. Nope...as simple a request...we did not get a fork. I asked a female server, and still no action. My husband finally got up to get one, then the (owner?) remembered and gave him one. The female, on the other hand, sent another server with a fork too! Just shook our heads...a very simple request took 10 minutes to accomplish.
THE FOOD. Everything tasted as expected, but the pork slices were VERY THIN compared to the photos. The chicken was tough...actually hard. All-in-all, food was just okay and not as GREAT as the reviews portrayed them to be. The coconut boba tea was just okay too. Too little boba and whipped cream seemed to have disappeared into the drink. We are NOT returning to this restaurant again. We will go back to the Vietnamese restaurant we always frequent across the street."

I had the vegetable pho and not only was it delicious, it came with an array of veggies for me to choose from! They even told me as I picked it up that they put some pepper on top of my broth so I would know which one was the veggie! Little things like that make it so much more special and just a little easier to live an alternative lifestyle. The chicken pho, pho ga, was enjoyed thoroughly by my boyfriend as well.

I ordered the fresh spring rolls with pork and shrimp.  I liked how they give u appetizer plates and 2 small dipping sauces of their delicious peanut sauce.  Most pho places/Asian restaurants would just give you one dipping sauce and no appetizer plates.

The restaurant was neatly decorated and menu covered a wide variety of food.
We ordered Fried Chicken (Karaage), Chicken Ramen and Tonkotsu Ramen.  The owner told us that he is seriously making the ramen broth, and indeed they tasted great!  Flavorful broth, juicy chashu meats, and right noodle.  So far I thought Tokio serves one of the best Ramens in Denver.

I had the spicy miso ramen and the hip hop roll. Going to school in LA and eating some of the best ramen in Little Tokyo, this place definitely is a close competitor to those in LA. The miso ramen was delicious and has the thick flavorful broth that has been so hard for me to find here in the Denver area (vs. it being more watery). 

I&#39;ve tried Domo (disappointment) and some other spot on 16th St. (decent) but this has been the best so far. It is a bit pricey for a bowl of noodles, but in comparison to others, the additions like the pork (however, overcooked and cut too thick) and egg (perfectly cooked, and still a bit yolk-y) make the $15 price tag okay. The hip hop roll was good, but nothing to write about. However, I do love that it is open til 1am. It is so hard to find places in Denver that are open late these days. Also, apparently they have a parking lot, which I missed, for those who hate to parallel park in the downtown area. Service was excellent, decor is nice inside, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much seating inside, so I&#39;m not sure how the wait would be if it gets busy."

*Friday&#39;s  night and the restaurant is not full or even close to full. That might say a thing or two already. *Service: &#34;greeted&#34; by a server with green hair who didn&#39;t even look at us. Seated by a green hair hostess who filled our water and said our server will be over. About 3-4 servers passed by without noticing us. I asked one of the servers who served the table next to us who was suppose to be our server, she didn&#39;t answer, just said she could take our order. The ONE star is coming from the food didn&#39;t take too long but that was it.
*Food: we ordered the caterpillar roll and the tonkatsu ramens. The roll was mainly made out of rice and avocado, can&#39;t really taste the eel. The eel sauce on top was way too salty. The ramen, which they claim to be their &#34;most authentic bowl of ramen in Denver&#34; was a joke. When you see thick slices of carrots in your ramen, it cannot be authentic. The broth was &#39;fatty&#39;, like my lips was sticky after eating it. The cha-Su pork was anything but cha-Su pork, the slides were improperly cut(chunky and not thinly sliced). They also did not carry any favor like cha-Su pork should. Overall, food did not exceed the ONE STAR I&#39;m giving this place. The bottom line is if you travel out of your way to try this place because of the reviews on Yelp (like I did) then save your time/money and try a different place."

Really really enjoyed the sushi, Kobe beef skewer, and miso marinated cod; they totally warmed up our appetite for ramen (not the best I&#39;ve had, especially the curry ones; but Denver should still count its blessing for having Tokio that serves ramen). Also got to try the Japanese fried chicken. Not happy about the misconception: it should say &#34;nuggets&#34; coz that&#39;s what they were!

Interesting restaurant layout--I bet this place definitely fills up during peak dining hours.

Our server was attentive and quick to get our orders in. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, while Ryan ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen (his favorite!). 

I loved how much was in my Spicy Miso Ramen: fish cake, four thick cuts of pork, veggies, and of course, delicious ramen noodles and a flavorful broth. I admit, though, there wasn&#39;t too much spice in the broth....until the very last sip! Still a great bowl of ramen, though. Ryan enjoyed the Tonkatsu Ramen as well; we both left very satisfied.

I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the curry ramen and other dishes: they make their desserts in house! I wanted to try the green tea tiramisu, but I was so full after my bowl of ramen, that I had to pass on that offer.

Pricing is reasonable, about average especially for the neighborhood TOKIO is in. Looking forward to our next visit!"

As any good Asian will do (or maybe it&#39;s just Chinese folks?), I had to have noodles on my birthday to symbolize long life. 

We started with JFC (kara age), blistered shishito peppers, and an order of siu mai. I have never cared for the pork dumplings, so I did not partake. The JFC was crispy and served with a nice garlic spicy aioli. However, I&#39;m not sure what made them JFC vs chicken nuggets served with better sauce? They were tender and yummy though. The blistered peppers were also gobbled up; most were mild, with a few hot ones to keep you on your toes.

Most of us ordered bowls of ramen. Three! of us got the same bowl (tonkotsu), which was complex and yummy. I could&#39;ve done w/o the pork, actually, and had more veggies (more bok choy). Beautifully presented and I got an extra half of a soft boiled egg since my friend did not want hers. I finished mine (YAY for stretchy clothes!). Others got the curry ramen or the bacon wrapped scallops. Everyone seemed pleased. Service was attentive w/o being pushy or intrusive.

However, the place seemed super crowded with furniture. Our table and the table next to us each had a chair at the end (not sure why they put a chair at the end of our table? we didn&#39;t have a 7th person) and getting out to go to the washroom or to leave the restaurant was not possible w/o disrupting the meal of the other party. I had to ask the person sitting at the end of their table to get up and let us through. Yes yes, I&#34;m not the tiniest person, but I&#39;m not overly large either. 

Summary:
1) Parking is a pain due to the huge popularity of this area for residential buildings. On street parking is all 2 hr. BUT! There is a parking garage that is sort of hidden but dedicated to WTF and Tokio.
2) Lots of delicious things to try here, including bincho grill. Ramen broth was complex and developed. mmmm. Perfect way to warm up on a winter&#39;s night.
3) It gets easy to rack up a bill if you order lots of starters and bowls of ramen. Trust me that you don&#39;t need more than a bowl of ramen to be full, unless you are a VERY hearty eater.
4) Why is ramen so expensive in Denver? I&#39;d say the average bowl is about $14 here."

Their binchotan yakitori list was very little.  We ordered grilled chicken meat balls, liver and bacon wrapped asparagus and that was about all they offer as yakitori goes.

We came in around 7:30 or so and were seated upstairs. I like the layout and look of the restaurant.. It&#39;s somewhat industrial mixed with wood and retro furniture. We were promptly given waters and our drink orders were taken. I had a glass of cab, but others at our table ordered sake. The server didn&#39;t seem to know much about sake and had no suggestions for which to order, which I found odd since this is a Japanese restaurant. 

To start, we had two orders of the shumai. I think it may be some of the best shumai I have ever had! Each one was large, hot, and filled with a delicious pork filling. I also had one piece of unagi nigiri, which also was good and included just the perfect amount of rice. I would like to order more sushi here next time. 

I chose the tonkotsu ramen for my entree. The tonkotsu is served with many delightful ingredients, like bok choy, carrot, mushroom, pickled bamboo, etc. and each ramen bowl comes with a soft boiled egg, pork, and ramen noodles. The broth was good (pork broth) and was relatively thick. I enjoyed the ramen and it got better as the noodles cooked in the broth.

Price was what you can expect at a Denver ramen place that is somewhat more upscale.. Each of us spent around $30 with an evenly split check. Water was always refilled, though at times I thought our waiter disliked us and was giving us those vibes."

What really makes this place great for us other than the awesome ramen is Dana. She is an amazing server, and she always makes us feel so welcomed! We have never been the type to request servers at restaurant, but we always request Dana whenever we come. 

Since we started coming here, we visit at least twice a month. The Tonkatsu and Tsuke Men are our favorites, and they are always on point. We have also tried all the other ramens, the Curry is pretty good too, but the rest isn&#39;t as amazing as our favorites. However, we must say that their ramen here is THE BEST we&#39;ve had in Denver. We tried Brazen, which was okay, and the ramen at Uncle and Linger were really not good at all even though they are very highly recommended. 

Other than their ramen, their izakaya style small plates are great too! The Kara Age (Japanese fried chicken) will be the best fried chicken you ever eat: tender, flavorful, hot and fresh! Their Yakitori (grilled items) selections are also great, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Aspara-Bacon. 

Tokio didn&#39;t start off with sushis and rolls, but I assume a lot of people go in to there expecting to be able to get sushi even though ramen-only shops are so commonplace in Japan. Whatever the cause, I&#39;m glad they did it! Now I can get both my ramen AND sushi fix at one spot that I love!

We love coming here. The earnest atmosphere (you can see the owner/chef Miki san working all the time), accommodating waitstaff, and delicious food will keep us coming for, hopefully, years to come!"

I think in the larger cities where there is an abundance of diversity and ramen shops, Tokio would be a solid &#34;meh.&#34; In Denver, it&#39;s okay... as there are few other options. 

I ordered the Spicy Shoyu and think that I prefer the non-soysauce based soups. It was quite okay and I was starving.... (insert something about hunger being the best spice or something). Friend ordered the Tonkotsu, which was a little better but also saltier. The Curries were okay as well. 

The service was, however, wonderful and our server did a marvelous job re-filling our water cups. Sorry, guy-with-bleached-yellow-hair, we must have been terribly dehydrated - thank you for the great service."

I had the Cremoso Diablo ramen which is absolutely DELICIOUS. It&#39;s definitely very rich, but if you&#39;re into that, I&#39;d highly recommend it. All four of us ordered it and we were not disappointed. It&#39;s advertised as spicy, but the cheese and creamy miso balance out the spice so even for a spice wimp like me, it was completely fine. We also had the Diablo roll (yum) and fried chicken (karaage) which were also delicious. The waiter also threw in some green tea ice cream at the end :) the ambiance was great and I love the fact that they&#39;re open so late (1 am on a weeknight? Yes please). If I had a complaint at all, it would be that the chashu wasn&#39;t as fatty as places like Daikokuya in LA which was a little disappointing."

It was frigid outside and my group wanted to wat something warm and healthy (ish). We drive by this place all the time and didn&#39;t even knew it existed. The sinage on the front is very small. We didn&#39;t see it until we came in the back entrance. The place is two levels and is decorated beauitfully. It is small but they seated us right away.

My roommate and I ordered a yellowtail roll for appetizer. The fish was fresh and the roll was delicious. Was I blown away, no. I come from Vegas and believe it or not, but because they import the fish daily, sushi is amazing there. Even the small neighborhood places. 

I ordered the Spicy Shiyo ramen. It came quickly and in a beautiful bowl with lovel presentation (see pic.) I found the broth a little underseasoned. I was delicious but I was looking for a little more salt. I had to use the soy sauce to give it a little more flavor. The pork was cooked nicely. I loved the boiled egg. I want to cook all my boiled eggs like that. The yoke was soft and smooth. The noodles where all the way down at the bottom under a myriad of sprouts. I would&#39;ve liked more noodles, less sprouts. But overall the food was declicious. I would like to come back and try again."

We also got the chicken thigh yakitori, just for the sake of trying it since it was teasing us right in front of our faces all night. Again, delicious.

Only other place I&#39;ve felt compelled to do that was at Ippudo in NY. Warm and inviting atmosphere. Delicious appetizers. Had grilled squid as a starter and it was incredible; rich, smoky flavor, cooked perfectly so it was tender and not chewy. Everyone in my party was very pleased with their main dishes and would get them again.

We tried going to Uncle first before Tokio, and BOY -- was Uncle on an early Saturday night a disappointment! Many pissed off people sitting around, atmosphere was too bright and felt very sterile/fake.

1. I road my bicycle that evening and was drinking a lot of water. Our waitress left the bottle of water when I asked, great service. The other staff kept coming by and taking the bottle from our table. Bad service.

2.  Trim your fat! Having fat in a broth can make it delicious but I was served more fat than meat. 

3. I had the  Katsu-Curry Ramen and asked for it extra spicy. The waitress assured me that they would make the ramen hot enough to burn through the bowl. I could not detect any spice in my food.  Extra spicy means the average customer will feel uncomfortable eating that level of spiciness. 

 I spent $14 on a disappointing bowl of ramen along with several overpriced drinks and apps. Tokio should be avoided. If you are curious about what extra spicy means, go to Miyako Ra-men and ask for the Tantan men extra spicy like &#34;Scott&#34; orders it."

Dōmo arigatōgozaimashita

Taking my cue from Jimmy Fallon, I have to write a &#34;Thank You&#34; note to Tokio for a really lovely dining experience last night.

First of all, thank you for hiring professional, adult staff members.  Both Dominic (host) and Meg (server) were so polite while being very friendly, welcoming and great at their jobs.  How often do you find that these days?

Second, thank you for having a wonderful Japanese design aesthetic.  You&#39;ve created a serene, elegant yet warm environment in which to relax in a lovely little jewel box of a restaurant in the heart of the bustling Ball Park neighborhood.

Third, thank you for having two happy hours!  We arrived just as they opened at 5:00pm so we were able to save a few yen on selected small plates and sake.  Started with an ample serving of Blistered Shishito Peppers in ginger sauce ($5) - absolutely yummy but a couple of those babies were HOT - careful.  Also, sampled a few of the $2 sushi offerings (eel, tuna, yellowtail, salmon) - generous cuts of very fresh fish prepared by the owner.  All enjoyed while sipping (not very daintily) their cold house sake served in overflowing lacquer boxes ($3) - worth the $1 upgrade from the usual hot sake.  OK, full disclosure we had two rounds - goes down easy and the perfect foil for the wonderful food.

Fourth, thank you for the show.  We sat at the sushi bar and watched the pros at work.  On the end where we sat you are directly in front of the Bincyo-Tan Japanese Charcoal Grill.  We were here for ramen but next trip I&#39;m definitely going to sample some of those beautiful morsels hot off a sizzling cherry wood fired grill.  I seriously considered doing so last night but saved room for the ramen.

Finally, thank you so much for &#34;getting&#34; ramen.  Absolute perfection.  Noodles with just the right amount of chew and broths deeply flavored.  We sampled both the Miso ($15) and the Shoyu ($13).  Very ample portions for the price.  Meg said her favorite was the Shoyu so I jumped on it and was glad I did as I preferred the broth to the Miso my dining companion enjoyed.  Both wonderful though.  (See the photo of me pigging out - thank God for good chopsticks skills).

Five stars is my Yelp thank you for creating a wonderful new oasis of Japanese food and hospitality right here in Denver.  Thank you very much indeed.  We&#39;ll see you again soon."

My friends and I were sorely disappointed by the ramen here. This could be one of two reasons:
1. It was too hyped up in our heads so our expectations were higher.
2. It was just simply not good.

I&#39;ve had ramen from many different places, from Cali to New York, from Canada to Japan and this is not even the best in Denver. When I went, I happened to bump into various tables of friends. My table of 5 and the other table of 4 just didn&#39;t think it sat very well when we got home.

Let me start with the venue. It&#39;s awesome and nicely decorated. It has a very clean feeling and the staff is super friendly. There is an upstairs and downstairs so there is definitely ample seating:
Tip: There is parking in the garage on the side.

My best friend and I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen because I like a more flavorful type of soup. My opinion of this ramen:
1. It was WAYYYYY too salty and I understand, that ramen in general is a saltier dish but I added hot water to it and it was about as salty as the places I have been to. After the addition of hot water, I enjoyed my ramen a lot more.
2. They followed the traditional method of having thinner noodles, which is nice that they are keeping to tradition.
3. The egg was done perfectly.

My other friend ordered the miso ramen:
1. Too bland. This should have a bold and strong miso flavor but I&#39;m not sure what happened. Maybe the addition of the bean sprouts watered the base down and changed the flavor or something.
2. The noodles were of the thicker variety, which is accurate.
3. There was just nothing spectacular about this one.

Tsukemen:
1. If you didn&#39;t know, this is a dipping ramen so the soup should be thicker and on the side so that it may evenly coat the noodles when you dip it and this should be a stronger, saltier flavor since it is a condensed version of the broth. Their version is the chilled version and I think I just personally prefer the hot version. 
2. The noodles were decent. These were the thicker, chewier noodles.
3. I liked Uncle&#39;s side menu version better.

I bumped into another friend who said his curry ramen wasn&#39;t bad so if I ever go back, I&#39;ll probably try that or their side dishes. The only thing I feel like they really got on point was the egg! The meat was not as fatty, which some people may like but I mean, with ramen, the meat is supposed to be a fattier, no point in cutting back when you&#39;ve already committed to such a fatty dish itself!"

Yes it feels that we might be &#34;transported&#34; to a modern feel with some Japanese touch.  We came at 17:00hrs and were the first few who decide to dine in here.  We opt to be seated upstairs.

From the Menu, we have both the Happy Hour (HH) and the normal menu which consisted of Grill items and Nigiri/Sashimi/Sushi items.

Happy Hour Dishes :

*  Unagi ($2.00)
*  2 orders of Tako Nigiri ($4.00)
*  2 orders of Ebi Nigiri ($4.00)
*  2 orders of Tamago ($4.00)
*  Spicy Tuna Roll ($3.00)
*  Curry Chicken Wing ($5.00)
*  Wasabi Tokio Chicken Wings ($5.00)
*  Shishito Peppers ($5.00)
*  Ikura ($2.00)
*  Agedashi Tofu ($3.00)

*  2 Uni Nigiri at ($6.00) each, hence it was ($12.00)
*  Kobe Beef ($13.00)
*  Thigh Yakitori ($3.50)
*  Leva ($3.00)
*  WHOLE Squid ($12.00)

*  Trumpet Mushroom ($6.00)
*  Seared Tuna Tataki Salad ($14.00)

*  Ginger Ice Cream ($5.00)
*  Green Tea Tiramisu ($7.00)

Highlight Dishes :

*  Agedashi Tofu
*  Shishito Peppers
*  Seared Tuna Tataki Salad
*  Ginger Ice Cream

My friend like the Agedashi Tofu and the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.   TAKE NOTE the Trumpet Mushroom and Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, those come in HUGE Portion.  Definitely GOOD and INDEED FILLING!  YES, those Shishito Peppers are MIGHTY SPICY!  SPICY that I like ALOT!  Though I cannot deny my friend, said its TOO SPICY for her liking.  The Ginger Ice Cream is creamy and indeed very flavorful.  What can go wrong about House-Made Ginger Ice Cream!

My friend opt to have 2 HH Japanese Beer ($6.00).

I am torn about this establishment.  There are some Hits and Misses about all the food we ordered.  If its NOT for Happy Hour (HH), I bet we would have spent more.  Anyways, they can do better in terms of the flavor of the food aka on certain items in the Menu.

From the Appetizer Menu, I am slightly disappointed with the Wasabi Chicken Wings.  The Wasabi Chicken, though has a taste of Wasabi, it DOES NOT WOW me!  *SIGH*

I am OK with all the Sushi or Nigiri order we had.  As for the Desserts, I am disappointed with the Green Tea Tiramisu.  YES, its elegantly made.  Maybe I am NOT used to Green Tea flavor of any Tiramisu, hence the Green Tea might be OVER-POWERING for my personal taste bud.

Service was indeed stellar from our Main server.  If I am NOT mistaken, her name is Jin Park.  Overall TOKIO has potential to grow.  I wish them well in their future Business Undertakings.  I might return when needed if I am in this Neighborhood.

Kind of a weird name but decided that I haven&#39;t had any good Lithuanian borscht and rye bread in ages and so this evening we decided to stop on by.

Holy Kibinai! &#39;Tweren&#39;t no Lithuanian nothin&#39;. Was a new-style Japanese noodle / sushi / bar / binchotan / eatery / drinkery.

Turns out one of the scions of Denver sushi--Mr. Miki Hashimoto who ran Japon sushi house on old South Gaylord for almost 20 years--has gone a little hipster and is now rockin&#39; it out at this very authentic ramen shop.

Mixed and matched some charcoal grilled binchotan delicacies with some ultra fresh sushi (will do the noodles the next time), along with a big ol&#39; carafe of sake and very much enjoyed this new neighborhood hot spot.

Bottom line: A rare and splendid delicacy: 珍味佳肴

I come from vegas which has a lot of good ramen places as well and I have to say this place is just as good.

I like the vibe when you walk into the restaurant it&#39;s very nice. The deco is also very aesthetically pleasing, the long wooden table it in the middle was very cool. There was also a second floor to the restaurant but we were seated on the first, so I hope one day I might be able to go and see the top.

The food was also amazing! Very filling!
We got the shirmp tempura roll, shoyu ramen, spicy shoyu ramen, and tonkotsu ramen. All very very good choices and I highly recommend them.
The sushi they have is very delicious, it was pretty big but nothing my family couldn&#39;t finish and it was super yummy.
I&#39;ll be posting a photo as well of the food.

I would highly recommend this place for people who want a ramen, the service is very good. We had Jessica as a server and she was very very kind. Also the food is amazing, I plan on coming here often when I move out here to study."

The decor inside was also really nice modern and unique. We sat at the chef&#39;s table so we could speak with the sushi chef and have him suggest items that we should try. He did not disappoint. I highly suggest trying this place, especially the ramen. I&#39;ve tried many popular ramen places here and this one is the best so far. Try it...."

I had sushi and my boyfriend got the Diablo. He loved it, and I was very happy with mine as well. We started with the gyoza (also good). The server took a while to get to us initially, but made up for it by docking our drinks from the check, and giving us good service after that. Definitely will be going again."

We got &#39;stuck&#39; at the bar when we really wanted to be upstairs, but we learned to make reservation next time-- and there will be a next time. Plus, we got to speak with the chefs and watch the cookin&#39; go down.

But we&#39;ll likely walk there as opposed to driving (I live downtown (half-time)); street parking near all those lofts has always been a nightmare (for that liquor store, too).

We crushed a survey of the menu: ramen, sushi, and apps. All of it was amazing. Most amazing was the Japanese whiskey, and I can&#39;t remember which one it was, but my girl said it was the smokier one, so DEF try that. 

She even made it on the rocks when I asked for just two cubes, so she gave me the one and made me a new one-- two cubes-- and only charged me for one.  Very classy, and very, very much appreciated.

Get at this joint."

The grilled meat skewers are expertly done, my advice is don&#39;t order more than 1 of any type, but order more of the different types. This is a place to go in a group of 4, more than that will be hard to seat, 2 is not enough mouths to try the different items. The sushi is excellent, ramen is great, spicy miso.

I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen bowl w/extra noodles. Great broth! Not too salty, and very rich/silky. The noodles were perfectly cooked - not too soggy, not too chewy. Needless to say, I ate them extremely fast so the consistency wouldn&#39;t change, and because they were absolutely delicious! The sesame oil, the pickled ginger, the [perfectly cooked] egg &amp; the broth....everything combined made for a wonderful meal.

One thing I want to note for people expecting certain components of Tonkotsu ramen:

They do not offer chashu (pork belly) in their ramen, just sliced roasted pork. The meat was still pretty good, but given the great broth I was wishing I had something that better complimented the richness. I did know about the lack of chashu coming in, and was still not overall disappointed. Also, the bamboo wasn&#39;t the best (not prepared in-house)

I did notice the owner Miki Hashimoto was in the kitchen, which other reviews have said will be indicative of a great bowl. I will attest to that - great stuff."

Tokio is one of a few places in the area that does ramen very well.  Any dish that has the word &#34;spicy&#34; in it gets my full attention, as did the cremoso diablo ramen.  It was not overly burn your face off spicy but just enough to make you feel alive.  Good balance between spicy and flavor in a HUGE bowl!

The Japanese style fried chicken (JFC) was pretty stellar as well.  The mayo based sauce that it is served with the dish complemented the fried batter and chicken well.  A bit spicy but nothing that is going to make you need milk or even water.

The space is pretty hip, there is a sushi bar and a handful of tables downstairs along with a small bar and more seating upstairs.  It&#39;s deceptively larger than it feels with the open floorplan.  Service has been above par ... looking forward to my next bowl of ramen!"

I got a couple pieces of sashimi, the salon was buttery and mouthwatering. I got one of their cold ramen dishes as my entree, I can&#39;t remember the name but it had hot chili oil in it. That blew me out of the water, I was kinda worried about ordering a cold ramen dish but they didn&#39;t let me down.

The space is small and there seems to be upstairs seating. The cool part is there is a lot of seating around kitchen, so you can watch them prep food as you wine and dine. We sat right in front of the meats getting grilled away to perfection. 

The service was fantastic. Waters were filled several times throughout the meal. A man who might have been the owner also stopped and asked us how we were doing and how we were liking our food. 

My friend and I both ordered ramen bowls- the ramen air and the spicy shoyu. 
I tasted the broth of the ramen air and it definitely contained more flavor than you would imagine. I had the whole bowl of the spicy shoyu and it was awesome. It had a nice kick without being overwhelming. There was also a good amount of pork and veggies. The noodles were definitely cooked to my liking. If my tastebuds tell me correctly, I think they were fresh noodles. 

I will definitely return. Still a bit more pricey than I&#39;d like a bowl of noodles to be but in this case it&#39;s worth it."

When it came to the ramen, I got the tsukemen and my boyfriend got the Cremoso Diablo. My tsukemen is a dipping noodle where you dip the noodles in a concentrated broth. They only serve it cold there which I was a bit disappointed with. My bf&#39;s ramen had a blend of cheese in it which actually really works and was surprisingly good!

He used to own Japon and sold the business, went back to Japan to perfect his ramen skills, and brought himself and his skills back to Denver, lucky us. 

For those people who wrote that their miso ramen is not good, I&#39;m sorry you have an American-ized taste buds.  Their miso ramen is actually pretty authentic.  I personally like a little lighter taste on the salt so I thought it was a tad too salty for my taste on all of their ramens (I have tried the curry, the tonkatsu and the miso).  

I really love the squid and the grilled skewer stuff like - chicken breast, chicken liver, kobe beef, pork, chicken wings.... 

Also had their pork and onion katsu, that was delicious with the mustard.  As well as their sushi.  I LOVE their hamachi sashimi, so tender and so tasty!  Their agedashi tofu was also authentic, I love the mochiko powder on the outside... with delicious hot broth.... yum!

Apparently the last few Fridays we have made this the Friday spot for us, love the fact that they have covered parking behind their restaurant.  It will come handy during snowy days.  They are open from 5 PM to 1 AM everyday so this will be an amazing late night spot with late night Happy Hour that is really a great deal!!!!  Thank you Miki-San and Edgar!

We tried the yakitori since it seemed to be a staple here. It was mediocre. Most pieces were dry. The best was the chicken thigh which had a nice smoky flavor and wasn&#39;t as dry as everything else. 

Tried 2 of the ramen bowls. The noodles were good. Had a nice, chewy bite too them which I like. I enjoyed the miso ramen a lot. The broth was flavorful and not too heavy. The egg in it was perfectly cooked. The pork wasn&#39;t chewy. Good experience overall. Also tried the spicy shoyu which was a little salty for me, which is saying something because I love salt."

I&#39;m from the bay where we hyphy &amp; go dumb but more importantly, where ramen is a-PLENTY &amp; the competition is fierce. Denver ramen scene? Lacking. 

So, when Tokio opened I was psyched but also very skeptical. 

My one MAIN critique for the ramen is that the pork is not as flavorful, tender or beautifully cut as maybe 5-6 other ramen places I have tried in the bay. You do not see the marble effect of the meat with the fat and the flavor is much blander compared with traditional chashu meat. With the negative being said, let me talk about what I did love about this place and why I am giving the 5 stars:

1. interior decor - It&#39;s hard not to enjoy yourself in such a cool space. The ambience really makes this place a cute date spot despite ramen being a much less date-like menu item. There is an upstairs area with a small bar and a downstairs area with a giant raw wood table &amp; the sushi bar
2. texture &amp; flavor of ramen noodle; the noodle was shiny and had just the right amount of chewiness to it 
3. broth that wasn&#39;t too salty (though traditionally the Japanese eat the broth much saltier); I actually drank all of my broth which is usually difficult for me to do given the saltiness of more ramen broths 
4. cool red soup spoons that were the perfect size for slurping some soup 
5. deliciously marinated agedashi tofu appetizer - this is a top contender for &#34;what would you want your last meal to be&#34;; it was flavor packed and texturally interesting; it had an elastic consistency on the outside that prevented the tofu from degrading &amp; falling apart; I would absolutely order this again 
6. music- they played a lot of Frou Frou, Imogen Heap, Lana del Rey &amp; other similar artists (though I didn&#39;t like that you could also hear the Pandora commercials- upgrade to Pandora 1 you guys!)

I also tried the sparking peach sake 250ml for $12 &amp; the green tea tiramisu (A+ for creativity). This is only my 2nd time having ramen in Denver (I have had ramen countless times in the bay area). That being said, I concur with other reviewers about this being the best ramen place in Denver (the only other place I tried it at was the modern Vietnamese restaurant next to Olive &amp; Finch-cannot remember the name). Don&#39;t trust Ramen from a Vietnamese spot. But you can trust the Ramen here @ Tokio&#39;s."

Ok maybe I&#39;m the only person led astray by this, and it&#39;s totally my fault, but when someone talks up awesome noodle soup, I think PHO!

Ramen, is not Pho. It is not pho made with ramen noodles. Pho and ramen are nothing alike.

This was bitterly disappointing to find out. Again, my bad. I know. But... Come on.. Who doesn&#39;t love pho?!

So with that unfair biased chiseled in my brain, I got my ramen - which again, not pho.

The service was amazing! The appetizers were amazing!

The ramen... Was not pho.

I ordered the wrong thing because while everyone else was raving about their bowls, I couldn&#39;t get over how bland mine was :(

We ordered the miso ramen, curry ramen, grilled squid, gyoza, kobe beef yakitori and sapporo beer.

Grilled squid came out first. Tasty and not chewy (definitely fresh squid). You have the option to dip into the sriracha sauce or the dried chili powder for some added kick.

The gyoza is next. This gyoza is really moist. Definitely not frozen.  Just based on the size, you could tell that it was made fresh.

Both ramens came out flavorful. The noodles are not soggy. The amount of meat is proportional to the size of the bowl.

The kobe beef yakitori is so tender and juicy.  Not overcooked.

Service was prompt. Our server took the time to explain the concept of the place.

I came here for dinner with a friend.  We split gyoza and the yakitori sampler (which included bacon-wrapped asparagus, chicken thigh, chicken breast, chicken wing, and chicken liver skewers) for appetizers.  And for our main courses, we ordered tsukemen (me) and shoyu ramen (her).

What worked:
-First of all, great concept and great menu.  Personally, I&#39;d like to see some expanded varieties of yakitori in the future -- especially chicken skin, hearts, and gizzards -- but I&#39;ll take what I can get.  The fact that this place takes yakitori seriously is awesome in and of itself.
-The noodles, at least in the tsukemen, were great.  Springy and just a bit al dente.
-The bacon-wrapped asparagus and chicken wing were standouts.  Really exceptional.
-The ambiance was quite nice, and the decor was tasteful.  I especially enjoyed that the bar was made out of marble with a solid wood extension.
-I tried some of the shoyu broth.  Tasty and complex.
-Great service.  Everything came out quickly, and we even got some free ice cream.  Sweet.

What could use some improvement:
-I was unimpressed by the chashu, which was bland and dry.  If I had to guess, I would say they roasted an unseasoned (or lightly-seasoned), un-marinated pork loin in the oven for about an hour, and then sliced it for the chashu.  Note to Tokio: pork belly is much tastier.
-It would be nice to choose between salt or teriyaki seasoning for yakitori.
-The gyoza were kind of soggy, and, at $7, way overpriced.  Aoba Sushi gets it right and for half the price.
-In general, the prices were a little high.  I know we live in a world of $15 bowls of ramen, but come on, this is supposed to be a casual, drunk food sort of place.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong.

Overall, I was quite impressed, and I&#39;m excited to see this place blossom in the coming months and years."

* The gyoza were burnt on one side, but they served it to us anyway. That&#39;s always disappointing.

Overall, though, that diablo roll will bring me back!"

It&#39;s a sushi restaurant with a limited selection of ramen and Japanese tapas.  I stopped in with a craving for ramen, so that&#39;s the route I went.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen (no add-on options besides extra pork chasu or extra noodles.) with karage to start.  The karage was good, but nothing to write home about.  The ramen was served in a bowl way to big for the portion size which fortunately was the biggest offensive.  The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly Snd the tonkatsu broth was delicious, chasu was blah, and seasoned egg was not so seasoned but acceptable.  Service was good, a tad overpriced in my opinion, but for ramen fix, you could do worse."

My boyfriend and I tried a variety of their different menu items. We expecially liked the japanese pickles that were served. I had to get a second order! The fried tofu was pretty bland. Nothing really amazing about the flavor. Pretty plain.

The ramen was pretty average. I enjoyed the plating of it and it came in a pretty large sized bowl. It is a little overly priced too since the broth is the main showman of any ramen. 

The whole chicken plate I would pass on. They grilled different parts of the chicken, but it got kinda dry and one dimentional when I got to the chicken breast. They had a tiny amount of sauce at the bottom and I definitly, needed more of that to add to the chicken. Plus, I wish they gave me a bowl of rice to go with the chicken instead of just the roasted chicken parts alone. 

Sadly, I was a little annoyed at the end when the chef came out with the table next to us. He started pouring drinks and shots with the entire table. They were watching a game and it got too loud. It felt a bit disrespectful to my boyfriend and I because we were trying to have an intimate romantic dinner. We could of gone to a sports bar if we wanted to be around drunk noisy people. 

The setup is cute, but I doubt I will be coming back here again."

The food itself was great. ( the taste of their food never disappoints me, actually) 
Service? NOT GOOD AT ALL! The visits I had before the waiting staff was all friendly and welcoming, but this particularly waiter provided terrible service! 
When I first arrived I asked about the baseball special(a bowl of ramen and a glass of house wine for $15), he gave me a very unhappy look but asked the hostess to turn on the TV to see if there was a Rockies game playing. The entire time he wasn&#39;t sure if there was really a game playing! Come on! If you offer that kind of deal you really need to promote it, or at least let your customers know whether or not they can get the deal! Not just giving them an attitude when they just want to confirm with you!
That waiter was serving the table next to me. He always had a smile on his face when he served them, but the smile went away right when he approached to me and my friend. It was so obvious that anyone can tell he was having trouble smiling at us, like it would kill him to do that. 
He even talked to the hostess about what had happened, and obviously he was teasing about us cuz they kept looking at us. I felt so uncomfortable just sitting there. 
I don&#39;t know what issues he had against those who just want to get the deals they deserve to get. ( oh, that guy never mentioned it was free to add extra noodles to our ramen noodle soup until we discovered it by ourselves. He was very unhappy about it cuz he thought we caused him trouble. Guess what? He told other customers about the deal but not us! )
This waiter is an Asian guy. Me and my friend will go back just for the food. If it happens to be the same guy that serves me I&#39;ll definitely ask someone else to serve me!"

I visited Tokio four times and nothing beats my first experience here. The ramen and everything was spot on! Since then, every time we went the ramen got saltier and saltier! Tonight, even the appetizer was salty! After dinner, I needed to get a gallon of water because of all the sodium and dehydration! The main difference between all my visits is the chef. The first time I ever visited Tokio, the owner was the one cooking our ramen. The second, third and fourth time we went, other chefs were cooking our food. 

Thus, this is my tip: If you know the owner will be in, I would recommend this place for their ramen! If the owner is not in, I would recommend the sushi. Although the sushi is ok here; however, for the price of sushi, I would rather go to my favorite spot. So, if the owner is in, go ahead! Enjoy. If not, get ready to drink a gallon of water after your meal!"

Now I know that when I first joined Yelp (wow, has it really been that many years ago?) I wrote a less-than-flattering review of The Summit. But during a recent visit for brunch, I had quite a different experience!

The venue is remarkably unchanged from the outside but all of the menus appear to have been pared down considerably - and honestly, I think that&#39;s a good thing. Nevertheless, there was still quite a bit to choose from this morning. I eventually settled on the Prime Rib Breakfast and was treated to twelve ounces of very tender beef (probably the best I&#39;ve had at The Summit honestly), sided with smooth scrambled eggs with Hollandaise, and some ultra-fresh fruit for good measure. I have to say, I was extremely impressed. I also got to try a few bites of the serrano-tinged Pork Belly Benedict and can recommend that one as well if you&#39;re searching for something a bit out of the ordinary. 

Before I knew it, it was time for dessert. I had initially planned on the white chocolate mousse (with a hint of chile - believe me, it&#39;s not as odd as it may sound) but since I had tried that before, opted instead for the Chocolate Ganache Bundt Cake. Based on the name alone I worried that I might be consuming a chocolate doorstop but in fact it was surprisingly light, yet rich at the same time. Even if I hadn&#39;t had that mimosa I think I&#39;d still have been effervescent about it. So anyway, if you&#39;ve been unimpressed with The Summit in the past, try them again! Oh, and ladies - if you happen to get James for your server, I have no doubt he&#39;ll take care of your every need - including some you didn&#39;t realize you had!"

While the food was OKAY, the service was slow, disingenuous, and possibly dishonest.  Value? Terrible: 2 of us spent $120 on a meal that should have been $40-50.  If you are headed there now, Alice says: TURN AROUND!

Lets begin with Happy Hour- yes!  Everything is 50% off in the bar, drunkards! Great wine options for $5!  While this is a great deal, the service was SLOW and! EEK!Watch out for skimming on your credit card- at least one member noticed a one dollar up-charge.  Maybe an error, but a good reason to check your statement!  The patio, overlooking busy Havana, actually looked like a super nice spot for those half-price cocktails!!

The dinner:  the BF and I split the chateaubriand for two at $89.  The meat was good, served perfectly medium rare.  The vegies and potato were oldschool and fine. The French Onion Soup was great- teeeeny- but great.  The sauces were congealed and barely warm- sorta gross and Campbell&#39;s soupy....MSG, anyone?

Our server TOD was.......uh.... Slow and most disconcerting, both difficult and untrustworthy- the rules of our dining kept changing. A friend brought a coupon and Tod kept having to check with &#34;his manager in back&#34; just like a sleazy car salesmen and at the end of the night, guess what- the coupon was not honored. So that&#39;s 2 dishonesty points for the Summit. 

My suggestion is to take advantage of the half price drinks at happy hour, then stagger else where for dinner, or just straight into Havana traffic- either option will beat the dining experience."

Room could use some updating and decor but not why I was here. Had seen decent reviews and was recommended but not likely to return. 

Was served wine in the dirtiest glass I&#39;ve ever received. Waiter took care of it for me but it should have never been sent out in the first place. First red flag..don&#39;t care about cleanliness of glasses. 

French onion soup was great and could be worth a quick lunch stop on its own. 

Scallops were small and very chewy in pasta swimming in what was supposed to be wine sauce but was more like a gravy it was so thick and tasteless. 

Filet was plated on very plain white plate alone. While this is common with steakhouses it is customary to have a better looking plate or butter melting on the filet. In any case the filet itself was good albeit slightly over cooked. 

When I compare this to other steakhouses in the area it is simply way overpriced for what you receive. There are much better choices at this price level nearby. 

Service was very good and received a nice wine recommendation that turned out very well."

My ribs were a little dry, but good, except for being really, really over sauced.  The mashed potatoes were still good, and the onion rings were the best part of the meal.  For the price, the manicotti should probably come in a larger portion with more than just four pieces of asparagus as an accompaniment.  It&#39;s nit-picky, but I was disappointed that we didn&#39;t get great bread as a starter, like the baguettes they give you at similar upscale restaurants in the area.

Appetizers were solid. The sampler was a good variety of appetizers we wanted to try. The dip was what made the dish. However, shame that there was a lack of chips to go along with it.

Next up my french onion soup. So rich and flavorful--however, too flavorful. I think i t became a little too salty towards the end. But its a french onion soup, so I forgive it for being that way.

Now by the time my main dish came up, I was way too full to savor it. The shrimp scampi was nice, but I think I enjoyed the beginning rather than the finale. My finale was alright. I think most pasta dishes are better once you let all the flavors sit (overnight).

So tomorrow, I&#39;ll be trying my leftover pasta and see how it goes!

Unfortunately while the prices have risen, what used to come with your meal is now extra.  But what really has turned me off is the quality of the food has sharply declined, the cooking is uninspired and the service is virtually non-existent.  The style of presentation was on par with Golden Corral, served on a kids plate with nothing visually appealing about it at all.  I tip starting at 20% and work my way up from there.

Our server recommended the salmon, I bet it&#39;s good but we don&#39;t eat much salmon... It was our first time there so we just wanted to try some things.  
Calamari.  Good, no tentacles but not those frozen rings your used to seeing.  They are definitely still pre frozen as all our seafood is but it&#39;s yummy.
Escargot.  Classic dish and presentation.  I wish the bread was grilled or charred a bit. But it was fresh, garlicky and buttery as it should be.  Great dish.
T-bone.  Yummy!  It&#39;s not prime but angus and once again, very traditional presentation.  Came with soup or salad and a side so for $52 a great deal.  It was cooked medium plus, we wanted medium rare but it was still delicious and tender. 
The best part was the French onion soup!  We had 2 cups of it and it was once again, traditional!  When you want traditional American steakhouse, this is up there.  So basic, so boring that it&#39;s what you want when you can&#39;t figure out what you want.
I will go back just for the escargot and French onion.  Our server, Jason?  Young gentleman was very patient and thorough in guiding us through the menu.

We ordered the ribeye with mac and cheese and potato. The Mac and cheese had way too much cheese in it, the potato had this pond of liquid in it, and don&#39;t get me started on the steak. They ruined a perfectly good steak by covering it in some butter mixture. Their plating was terrible, it was literally a piece of steak on an oval white plate and the sides were served on different dishes.

Greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant by a very pleasant woman. We were assigned a table, menus handed out, and drink orders taken within the first 3 minutes - hot damn!  

Restaurant was clean, lighting was perfect, and plenty of space between tables. The menu had a nice selection from basic sandwiches to steaks. I am not sure how some reviewers talk about spending $250 on a dinner for 2. The most expensive cut I saw was $65. The math is pretty simple after that. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with home fries. The sandwich had just enough bite and the number of fries was generous. Another one of our party ordered the fish and chips and enjoyed his meal as well. I was told the French dip was tasty. Stupid French!  I believe my sandwich was $13, so not exactly cheap, but not a pocket emptying experience. 

Friendly staff and good food will have me coming back."

From the random Jake Jabs Karaoke sightings to the guy with the mullet singing Neil Diamond covers, the rhythm of the lounge is smooth and the wine flows to keep the patrons alive.

Although there are unique qualities in the atmosphere, the food is rather exceptional.  The proximity of the Summit to my office provides a minimum of three meals weekly enjoyed on the patio, in the dining room, or if I feel like hitting on a grandma, in the lounge!

The happy hour drink specials are decent.  The stuffed burgers are some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, the salmon is dry and served with a Mc-Fish-Filet type patty, the steaks are decent but slightly over-priced and the french onion soup might be the best in the city.

Looking forward to my next run-in with the Golden Girls, Kenny Rogers and Kris Kristopherson at the ol boat."

It doesn&#39;t have the corporate Del Frisco&#39;s or Capital Grille atmosphere to it, and you feel that difference the second you walk in. Great ambiance, live piano music many nights, and the happy hours to be taken advantage of! 

Exceptional food, bar none, each and every time. The steaks are fabulous and they&#39;ll melt in your mouth. The sides are fabulous - Go for their twice-baked potato. The appetizers are fabulous; I have the calamari almost religiously during happy hour. The drinks are always well made. 

I was in last week for dinner, and while I&#39;ve made my way in for more happy hours, this was my first dinner back here in a few months. My god, they must have had a major price hike - I felt like they owed me a used Hyundai after I paid the bill, and I&#39;ve been a customer here for somewhere close to a decade. 

Four stars because I still love the place and the experience each and every time - right up until it&#39;s time to pay the piper. It&#39;s a great place nonetheless, and you&#39;ll have a unique experience here that other Denver-area steakhouses won&#39;t replicate."

An appetizer, two entrees, and two cocktails averages about $130-150 not including tip.  The food quality is good and the portions generous, but if you&#39;re looking for a cheap date, you&#39;ve come to the wrong place.

I recommend the Summit Sampler as an appetizer.  It offers just enough variety to keep it interesting.  It comes with two pieces prime rib bruschetta, four jumbo cocktail shrimp and cocktail sauce, a serving of fried calamari with dipping sauce, and a small dish of spinach artichoke dip and chips.  

For entrees, I&#39;ve had the 12oz. ribeye steak and I&#39;ve had the Alaskan King Crab legs.  I prefer the crab legs as I&#39;m a seafood lover, but if you love meat, then the ribeye is a good choice.  Skip the Bearnaise sauce though, as it tastes weird to me here.  For your salad option, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Caesar.

Service has always been friendly, but sometimes it can be really slow.  The bar area usually boasts some kind of entertainment like a piano player or small band.  After 9pm on the weekend, I think they have karaoke or some sort of DJ as it gets loud with pop music/hip-hop blaring from the bar area."

My first visit was for happy hour and the service was unbelievably slow, about 20 minutes to get a drink once ordered. Also the drinks were served without garnishes so if you want olives to go with a dirty martini or limes for a vodka tonic, make sure you ask otherwise by the time they bring the fruit (another 20 mins) the drink is almost gone.  
The second time was for Sunday brunch. First I found a hair in the cream cheese I had spread on my bagel. It was blonde and about 4 inches long, I have long dark hair so I know for sure it wasn&#39;t mine. I understand this happens from time to time but when I told the lady that cleared my plate all she did was say &#34;oh no&#34; and the same cream cheese remained in the buffet. No one apologized or even acknowledged how disgusting that was. 
Then I tried the crab legs which I was really looking forward to. Those were unbelievably dry and the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The only thing I liked was the prime rib and mashed potatoes so if you go I suggest sticking to the basics and have a lot of time on your hands. Not sure I&#39;ll return, I had really high hopes for this place since it&#39;s so close to home :/"

(Example: we ordered ribeye steaks, filet mignon) our steaks was just sitting in there without side dishes. They forgot to bring out the rest of our food.

My wife and I came here for our 8th anniversary and were not disappointed. We wanted somewhere that we could get a little fancy, go have a great meal, and expect to spend around $100-150 and that&#39;s exactly what we found here. We had a restaurant that we favorited back home in North Carolina, and during the course of our meal we both agreed that this was our &#39;spot&#39; here in Denver. 

We tried the appetizer platter and most everything was delicious. I can&#39;t remember exactly what the dish was I tried on the app that I didn&#39;t like, but I&#39;m sure it was more my taste, than the food itself. The salads that came out were sized just right. Not so huge that you are scared to eat it all b/c you will fill up on salad, but also not so small as to be left wanting a little more when you&#39;re done. Almost immediately after we finished our salad&#39;s our entree&#39;s came out and they were amazing! Literally every bite my wife took of her steak she commented on how great it tasted, even to the point of bringing it up a few times once we were home. The same with the twice baked potatoes and the vegetable medley that came with it. As far as my dish goes, I ordered the prime rib and it was cooked exactly as I asked. I though the price for it was very reasonable as well. The creamy horseradish sauce that came with it was also very delicious, not too powerful, but just enough to give it the right taste I was hoping for.

All in all, from the décor, to the private booth seating we were given, to the entire meal, and the waiter that we had everything was great and was a great ending to our anniversary day!"

This place used to be a required visit by me but now I would rather drive by. The service has decreased along with the quality of the food. I sat in the lounge and also at the bar and the waiters seemed more interested in the male patrons and their names than me. My food arrived cold and spoiled tasting. I was never asked if I was ok with my order. When I expressed my concerns to the manager he had nothing much to say and shrugged his shoulders. No follow up, no nothing.

I am giving three stars now because this place has a great past, but the quality varies a bit more than it should.  They have a selection of prime beef that will have you wanting more, of which I am partial to the ribeye because I like a little char on the marbling.  The dining room is classy and comfortable.  The place is done with a lot of warm wooden beams and classic art.  

I like to sit in the bar and listen to the live music or or out on the patio in the evening. They have a separate food menu for the bar but both are available.  I love the tuna appetizer.  

The last few times I have been I have noticed the place has been slipping.  My most recent visit was a Thursday night with my lady friend for her birthday.  We sat in the lounge but just missed the piano player who had ended at 8.  We had the place to ourselves except for two other tables.  Our server was sweet but very new and didn&#39;t know the wine or food menus well at all.  We ordered drinks and orders of buffalo wings and beef sliders from the bar appetizers and sat and chatted.  The food seemed to take a really long time which left me sort of looking around the room where I found the staff camped out on a table in the bar eating what looked like a steak.  I have never liked it when the staff camps out in the bar or dining room on or off shift.  It is tacky.  When the food arrived the wings were all dried out and appeared to have sat under glow lamps for a long time.  They tasted ok but were dry and not very tender.  The sliders on the other hand were ok.  They are served three to an order and come with a choice of shoestring potatoes or steak fries.  

I love this place but I wish it would stay consistent so I would feel better about upping the stars.  

They have great live music and a nice mature crowd that is just rowdy enough :)  
The view from the patio is fantastic at sunset."

Anyways, I think I have a pretty decent gauge of what to expect from an excellent steakhouse.  This spot misses the mark.  Slow slow slow service and the steak was overdone.  The escargot was also a bit &#34;funky&#34;.  Given what you pay, you can get a much better experience at other area steakhouses.  To the restaurant&#39;s credit, they did credit a glass of wine for the overdone steak.  Still very disappointing."

I will NEVER return to this place again!  I have given it three chances and never again!  The first time was earlier this year and the service was poor.  We had decent drinks and appetizers on happy hour, but our server was slow and not very competent. The next day, I saw my credit card was charged twice for the full ticket amount.  I called the manager on duty and she said she didn&#39;t know why and for me to &#34;just wait&#34; and see if it falls off.  She didn&#39;t really care about my concern 
This isn&#39;t typical practice at any other restaurant I frequent.  Two days later, one charge went through and posted and the other was still pending.  They held the amount on my card for FOUR days, even though the original charge posted.  The second time I went to The Summit, the service was poor again!  And the food was just OK.  

LAST NIGHT, July 15, 2015, my friend wanted to meet there.  So I said one more time I will give &#39;er a try.  Our waitress was completely incompetent and forgot about us SEVERAL times.  The drinks were not made well.  The food was just OK again.  When my card was ran, I signed my receipt, left and when in my car I pulled out my wallet because I realized my credit card was not in the ticket book when I signed my receipt.  I immediately called and spoke with a manger who said nothing had been turned in.  He didn&#39;t offer to look or speak with our waitress about it.  So I said I was coming back to the restaurant to talk about it.  I arrived and the waitress had left already (who I overheard earlier talking about all her financial problems with another server).  The manger said she looked for my credit card.  I said &#34;well it&#39;s here somewhere&#34;. The manager shrugged his shoulders said &#34;I don&#39;t know what to tell you&#34; and walked away to the back leaving me there.  That was it! Didn&#39;t ask for my name or number in case it turned up.  Didn&#39;t look for it.  NOTHING!!!! I had to cancel my card!  This place is shady!!!!!!"

Since the Summit is close we thought we&#39;d try there. To our amazement pretty much anytime we wanted was available. There was a reason. First thing that happened-we specifically asked for a booth and was told by Ken, the manager, that none were available. We were seated in the middle of the bar area. Come to find out three booths were open when we walked in, and were still open after quite some time. This is the 2nd time this has happened, both times by Ken. Second thing that happened-we were never told until we were seated that the only option for the day was the buffet. OK, we thought we&#39;d give it a try. The food was mediocre at best. The prime rib was extremely fatty and not very tasteful. The croissants were still frozen. Most items were not very flavorful. We thought how much can this brunch be-$20 or $25. No, $42.95 per person. Not close to being worth that. Afterwards I did some checking on their website-you really had to dig to find the price and that the regular Sunday brunch menu was not available that day. We won&#39;t be returning.

I ordered the cowboy steak and my wife ordered the 16 oz Ribeye so I could take some home for breakfast.  We both felt that the steaks were good but not great.  For paying $59 and $41 for our two steaks we expected an amazing meal.  We do eat out a lot at high end steak houses so we do know what an amazing steak tastes like.  Both my wife and I would give the steaks around a 5-6 on our scale of ten.  The steaks didn&#39;t melt in our mouth like some places we go and it seemed like they were a little more chewy.  The bread also wasn&#39;t very good.  The thing that made our experience a three was the waiter.  He was great as far as customer service and being outgoing and recommendations and knowledge of his menu.  He was also very personable and in an age of zero customer service it is hard to find that.

Every item we ordered was absolute perfection. The crab and artichoke dip was outstanding. I ordered the filet with sautéed shrimp. I prefer my steaks cooked well, I know some say that ruins the cut of meat, but this was cooked to pure perfection. It was still tender and juicy and deliciously well seasoned. Each vegetable in the vegetable medley was amazing. The twice baked potato was devine. The prime rib that my husband ordered, cooked medium to medium rare was melt in your mouth tender... so I&#39;m told, anyway. I enjoyed the atmosphere, especially with a jazz band playing in the bar area, complete with a big bass a player and a guy on the saxophone. Our waiter was so friendly and attended to everything we asked for. He engaged in conversation and made us feel more than welcomed. He was highly knowledgeable of the entire menu and offered great suggestions. It was a bit pricey but worth every single penny. I would most definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic meal and environment to celebrate a special occasion or to make any occasion special!"

We had always heard how amazing this is and having visited other Denver landmark restaurants with great results, we decided to celebrate a new job by visiting the Summit. What can I say, well true the interior is dated, think 1975, but I really don&#39;t mind that as long as it&#39;s quiet and clean. The service was adequate, nothing bad but nothing great either. Now the food:
Ahi Tuna appetizer- was overcooked and served at an odd temperature
Calamari- absolutely no seasoning, not the worst I&#39;ve ever had but seriously near the bottom only thing saving it was it was not rubbery or overcooked so was edible with sauces
French Onion Soup- what can I say, was one of the best if not the best we&#39;ve ever had, I think the veal stock seals the deal 
I had the NY strip medium and mashed potatoes and broccoli - steak was more well done and so bland and greasy, no seasoning at all. I know some believe if you have great meat no seasoning is needed and it can shine on it&#39;s own. ...this was not the case. I ate maybe 3 bites of this chewy bland thing and had enough. Broccoli and potatoes both good nothing special.
Fiancé had T-bone extra rare with broccoli and french fries- again the steak was not just not extra rare it was closer to well done a far cry from what he ordered. Again broccoli and fries nothing special. 
Dessert was Creme Brulee- not the best at all, it was grainy and served at a weird temperature , the strawberry on top tasted like it had been stored with cooked meats 
Drinks were okay mixed correctly but over priced
Bread- came out close to the end of the meal only got a quick taste and when we asked for remaining food to go it was not in  included. 
*we asked for food to go because hell if I spend $250 someone is eating this 

Overall would likely not return or if I did just order soup and drinks"

The Summit never has let us down. It&#39;s been around for years for good reason.  The Chateau Briand Filet mignonette for two is wonderful. You get a lot of delicious gourmet food. We order appetizers too and then get a to go box (packaged nicely by our server Tracey - she&#39;s terrific) for a sumptuous lunch the next day. The food is the main attraction (oysters, shrimp, best Kalamari ever) The ambience is right too. Soft lights, beveled glass, linen table cloths, fresh flowers, friendly people and great cocktails, it&#39;s all very rich and relaxing.  I definitely recommend The Summit and can&#39;t wait to go back again."

So started our evening outside for happy hour drink but the service was slow and the waitress was rude! Other people came after us yet they received their drinks before we got ours. Then our drinks came and we did not get them how we ordered them. When we ordered a second glass of wine and a different kind of wine we were not even offered a new glass we had to ask for it. We wanted to have appetizers with our drinks but it was never even an option. Then she came by and just removed my glass not even asking if I was done! When I noticed what she had done it was to late she was gone so when I told her she had a snarky attitude and goes oh I thought it was just ice but I bet you were timing it just right, haha!!  Never offered to replace it not that I even wanted another one but really how rude!  Should have left then!

So got up to go to dinner anyway.  Once seated we told our waiter of our experience. Then the manager came in and we also told him he of course apologized but never offered to replace the drink either or do anything else for her awful service! Again we should have left with all the great restaurant choices in Denver why would anyone go to this outdated place with poor service!

So next thing we see is the awful rude cocktail waitress come in and start apologizing for her &#34;poor&#34; service but then goes on to say that she really is a &#34;good&#34; waitress&#34; and chuckles and walks out!!!  Truly unbelievable the nerve of this person and really the entire staff to allow this kind of behavior! As I was the one being taken out I did not have the control over the eving otherwise I would have walked out right then and there!!

But I can say I will never go back to The Summit Steakhouse and I guess they do not care because they keep staff like this."

It was a great experience at a non chain local restaurant and we would highly recommend it. 

First of all, they take reservations which is very nice and uncommon now days. Second, we requested the private wine room, which is in the center of the restaurant, private dining with glass windows and near the piano bar so you still get entertainment yet can hear the conversations you&#39;re having. We loved this room and I would request it again for a group of 6 or more. Third, the service was great. Our server had almost 40 years experience, was very attentive and explained everything well. He filled water glasses and wine without asking, brought out the food in a very professional way, was personable, calm, and fun. He took our picture without hesitation, went into detail about the specials, and overall we really enjoyed him and he made our dinner even better. It was a slower service but that&#39;s to be expected at a steak house and what we wanted to catch up with family friends. Fourth, The steak was cooked just how we wanted it with a delicious Hollandaise sauce on it and the sides were really good. Asparagus cooked just right. We had a dessert of a molten chocolate cake. which was to die for.  Fifth, great wine selection. Enjoyed a few bottles. We did spend a lot, but it was for a special occasion so worth it and good to keep in mind.

Everyone was very pleased with the food and service and we will be back again!"

The attentive servers are a definite upgrade over what you find in an Outback, Black Eyed Pea, or Chili&#39;s.  What is holding this place down is the 70&#39;s Piano Man style decor in the place...it is dark and depressing.  If I were management, you need bursts of color to make this place more inviting.

The noise is okay, and the place is white glove clean each time I come.  Overall impression: my first choice for eating steak in Denver.  Would bring more friends and family here if they could just make the place more modern."

Had dinner with a friend here after a movie.  It was a place neither had been, served both steak and seafood, wasn&#39;t in the tech center or downtown and wasn&#39;t a chain.  Also had some decent reviews so sure, let&#39;s give it a shot. 

I had called on the way from the theater to see if they had seating available so when we got there we were seated immediately.  Nice for 7PM on a Saturday night. It was relatively quite volume wise when walking.  I noticed some others as we walked through to be seated.  I think the carpeting helps to damper some of the noise.  You could hear the music from the bar/dancing area.  The to me was actually very nice, it wasn&#39;t loud and blaring and once in a while it was a tune you knew and secretly sang in your head.  

I will admit I am a part of the older crowd.  I grew up around older people, worked with and for older people in my youth, spent most of my time with my grandmother growing up so the fact that this place was filled with more 40+ then it was 20+ was perfectly fine with me.  This may not be the trendy thing to say, but I would much rather not be elbow to elbow with everyone and hear every word they have to say.  I am not the see or be seen type most of the time.  

The décor reminded me of a place back close to where I grew up, it was a place you only went for VERY special occasions.  The place where your Mom and Dad went on their anniversary kind of place.
Not overly decorated and a little dated in places but that&#39;s part of its charm.     

The dining areas are pretty large but are divided into smaller sections with glass wall divider type things.  This also adds to the coziness of things.  The wait staff wasn&#39;t down your throat constantly or seemingly distracted by their cell phone constantly either.  We ordered a few glasses of wine.  The self proclaimed wine snob I was with made fun of me for ordering Riesling.  I am not really about the red with this or white with that.  I order what I like!

Now before we get to the food I must bring this up.  The silverware.  It looked neat but man that stuff had girth to it.  The forks in particular.  It&#39;s hard to describe but it reminded me of a fork a child would eat with.  Blunt ended tines and large handles. It just felt a bit awkward to me to eat with.  Back in the day it was probably really neat, but if I could have them make one change, that would totally be it.  

Ordered a Rib eye and Au gratin potatoes which also came with a salad.  Opted out of the lettuce wedge and went with house.  Mixed greens, an unusually large (thick) slice of cucumber and a tomato wedge along with a few scatter croutons was presented.  It was nice enough, I don&#39;t go to a steak restaurant to eat salad, I WANTED MEAT!  The greens were seemingly fresh and the balsamic dressing was a little heavy on the balsamic, which I like.  

Rib eye came out and was really cooked well.  More medium to medium well which I requested and was happy to be served.   I was extremely excited it was not covered in 5 ways of seasoned salt.  It appears to be just lightly olive oil and salt and pepper seasoned which I also prefer so you can taste beef, not salt.  I have never understood the whole, this is what you pay for a steak and this is how much a side of this or that costs.  The Au gratin potatoes came with the meal as you were given choice of potato.  They were nice chunks of potato in a cream and cheese sauce.  The also had some melted cheese on top which was still a bit stringy.  The only complaint I had about them is there wasn&#39;t nearly enough of them! It was a monkey dish of them basically.  

This was also my first experience with Aha i Tuna. It was pretty good but not sure I want to have it all to myself.   I am just learning to eat a little more adventurously lately.  Baby steps in a new phase of life.  

Over all visit in my eyes was good.  I enjoyed the place, the food, the company and the nostalgic feels it all stirred in me.  They do have a brunch on Sunday so I am thinking this will be my next experience till spring when the patio opens back up for happy hour."

We got the opposite.  I cannot applaud the staff enough for their attentiveness and devotion (one server spent our whole meal polishing the stemware for his section with added scrutiny to the light).  The marbled bread was delicious and excellent wine selection.

But for the amount we spent on what should have been a premium meal was so not worth it.  The ribeye had the dullest sear on it; we tried blamed it on being medium-rare but that shouldn&#39;t affect a sizzling grill.  The prime rib was a little dry, which I hoped would be compensated with some dazzling horseradish; nary a flare to either nostril.  The mashed potatoes were just OK and the potatoes au gratin felt like a throwback to 1970.  

Should we try it again, with all these great reviews?  I don&#39;t know.  Maybe lunch to see if it was just an off night.  But remembering dissatisfaction and subsequent bill ($$$) might be hard to convince me."

I chose a seat at the bar as I was dining by myself. The menu was promising and the prime rib I chose was okay, not quite worth the price tag, but my biggest complaint was the service. The bartender did not know what kind of wine was available, a polite customer next to me recommended one for me that was tasty. He had no knowledge of any specials and acted surprised when I asked for the dinner salad that the menu promised came with my meal. I don&#39;t know his name because he never introduced himself. I would come back and try again but there certainly needs to be more staff training on the menu and people skills. Two stars is generous for my experience."

By that, I mean the 1970s, and not the average age of the customers you might encounter here.  Okay, I am exaggerating, but for a restaurant in Aurora, the drinkers and diners seem to be skewing older, whiter, and richer than one might expect.  Perhaps the nearby golf course is exercising an undue influence over the facilities.  That said, you really need to check this place out.  It is a dimly lit cavern of dark woods and heavy furniture.  The customers here all seemed to be having a good time, and I soon did as well. 

A friend of ours was kind enough to organize a happy hour adventure to The Summit.  I was a bit skeptical before I arrived, more troubled after I walked in, and was prepared to be disappointed.  Fortunately, I was very much mistaken in my negative anticipation.  My doubts burned away like a light morning mist under the blazing sun, as soon as I ordered my first drink.  For, you see, drinks during HH are 1/2 price.  I don&#39;t mean SOME drinks are half off (like lite beer and well drinks), I mean the whole liquor menu (as far as I could tell) was 50%.  This means that a glass of single malt Scotch, that might normally cost $24, is now only $12.  Indeed, I was almost giddy as I ordered a 15 year old Macallan for a mere $6.50.  Damn . . . it was a nice pour into a small snifter, and it was so very smooth.  Other drinks were similarly on sale, and our table soon went into a frenzy of bargain boozing.  

Appetizer prices during HH are okay, but not great.  You get $3 off of the regular price, which is still not that cheap.  I was not impressed with calamari I had.  It was well-cooked, but rather cold by the time it hit the table.  Although steak sounded good, I was in more of a burger mood.  I went with one of the steakburgers (ground fresh from their steak trimmings).  These are served with a choice of steak fries, shoestring fries, fruit, or cottage cheese.  I wisely chose the excellent steak fries.  My Portabella Mushroom steakburger was outstanding!  This is a half pound of meat with marinated Portabella mushrooms, sauteed onions, &amp; mozzarella.  It was a meaty, juicy, hearty offering indeed.

The service was very good.  The menu offers such classic items as tuna stuffed tomatoes and french dip sandwiches.  You really do need to check this place out."

The ambiance is warm and cozy; it&#39;s decorated for the holidays right now and is absolutely gorgeous. I chose the steak salad for lunch and it was delicious. The steak was hot and perfectly cooked medium. The salad was delicious in flavor and very good portion size. We enjoyed the Kona coffee after and oh my! What a treat! They brew it right at your table - such a great experience. The coffee itself was strong &amp; smooth, accompanied by fresh whipped cream and sugar cane sticks. It was such a delight.

Am I glad we did! Wednesday night is half off martini night. (pretty sure it was half) And we&#39;re talking top shelf HIGH quality martinis! These are served in normal adult sized martini glasses, not those mini glasses as I&#39;ve experienced at other &#34;high class&#34; establishments. 
AND, it&#39;s really more like a martini and a half since they bring the shaker with it, so you can refill your own! Right there, I&#39;m sold on it!

Yes the decor was dated and drab. The fellow patrons were older and some looked as if they just rolled out of bed, but no mind, they all seemed like locals and I didn&#39;t feel uncomfortable. 

I knew I wanted a Grey Goose dirty martini and they did not disappoint! My second round was off the large drink menu.  Our waitress was very friendly and quite knowledgeable in regards to the different drinks which was helpful. 

The bar food menu was $3.00 off for happy hour which lasts until 7pm!! SEVEN PM! The sampler was really quite good but on the pricey side. The shrimp cocktail had 5 large shrimps and were hearty! 

This is a gem of a happy hour without the downtown drive or stuffy vibe! Don&#39;t let the outside put you off, meet some friends here and enjoy some quality cocktails!"

Just not my thing. I went for the first thing I saw on the bar menu. The stuffed blue cheese burger is the best burger on the planet. It&#39;s not even close. Just like Red Robin, your choice is pink or no pink. This was cooked perfectly. The next time RR gets that right will be their first time. The fries were undercooked, but thats an easy fix. This isn&#39;t a place you go for fries. The beer was cold, the happy hour prices were right. My wife had the surf and turf, she wasn&#39;t complaining."

I ordered the 16 oz ribeye, medium. With twice-baked potatoes as a side. It comes with salad. The salad was good and the ranch dressing was great, too. A good-size plate and my wife and son complimented 

The ribeye looked good and was slightly undercooked as a medium-rare, instead of medium. It tasted bland; no taste really and required salt to give it some flavor. The meat itself was also tough and took effort to cut. I&#39;ve had better at Ted&#39;s Montana Grill in Aurora, Southlands area. 

The twice-baked potato was tough to cut into and was loaded with too much seasoning and was salty, too. I should&#39;ve ordered the steak fries instead. 

Our waiter was awesome. Courteous and attended to our wants and needs. He saved our night from being a disaster. 

I don&#39;t recommend this place. Good ambiance but food needs some work."

Ease of making a reservation - 4
Seated promptly - 4
Waiter - Chris - 5 - he was excellent
Other service - 3 - front desk staff were not paying attention
Food - 1 - see below
Ambiance/decor - 2
Noise - 2
Price for food/service delivered - 1 - Chris got a good tip
Overall Experience - 1

First, reservation was made well in advance, and no problems with it.  We were seated promptly.  Chris was our waiter and he did a stand-up knock-out job.  He was the only really pleasant part of the night.  We were seated in a different part of the restaurant than last Valentine&#39;s Day and the area we were in this time has low ceilings and really dated, terrible, not-classy decor.  It looked like a steakhouse interior that attempted to be classy on a $25 budget.  

We had crab cakes for an appetizer.  They were a little too mushy, but they tasted good as did the accompanying sauce.  I had the french onion soup, and it was very good, perhaps the best part of the meal.  My wife ordered the New York Strip and her steak was prepared perfectly and tasted stellar.  It was great.  But, it was not my dish.  I ordered a medium rare rib-eye.  I personally love to grill and I know what rare, medium rare, medium, medium-well, and well-done all look like, feel like (center temp), etc.  99 times out of 100 I will order a medium-rare steak when we go out because I can eat a rare steak, and I can eat a medium steak, but i really prefer something right smack dab in between.  However, I feel like at a nice steakhouse I shouldn&#39;t have my steak screwed up.  I ordered medium rare, and I got a really freaking rare steak.  I had no grill marks on either side of the steak either.  I really truly wonder if I got someone else&#39;s steak.  

**See my picture to see how rare it was**

I couldn&#39;t eat it.  The center was very cool, and nearly cold.  When Chris came by, I asked him what I ordered, since I could have messed up or he might have only heard the &#34;rare&#34; part.  Well his ticket said medium rare, and he even showed me.  I showed him the steak and I asked him what it looked like.  He said, wow, that&#39;s really rare, even for a rare steak.  He offered to take it back and have them cook it some more, but I really didn&#39;t want to mess with that.  Two other tables near us also received cold, or poorly cooked meals that had to send it back.  I didn&#39;t want to be the 3rd.  When I saw their problems, I just knew something with ours would be screwed up.  AND, it was.

So, this place deserves a 1-star review, no doubt in my mind.  High priced steakhouses are held to a higher standard.  This place lives up to no standards.  Avoid this steakhouse, period.  Avoid it.  They don&#39;t know what they are doing.  They are either too busy in the kitchen to do it right, or just don&#39;t know what they are doing.  Why a 2-star review then?  Chris, our waiter.  He was running around like crazy trying to get everyone meals fixed.  I felt bad for him.  He was doing his darnedest to please everyone.

For about a $150, I have zero reasons to even consider this place again.  It straight up SUCKED, and I rarely will write that in a review.  I felt scammed.  I really did."

It&#39;s close to the house and we love steak so we were excited to try. As a lot of previous posts point out the service was terrible. It was later on Saturday night and you could tell they just wanted us out. I get that because I have served but the food is super expensive. If you&#39;re going to drop $200 for dinner for 2 you want to feel taken care of and valued. The steaks were good but the oyster app and salads were nothing impressive and at a very high price point. They over price and under deliver in my opinion. May go back again just to see but it wasn&#39;t our favorite.

It was that place that I always drove by but never stopped at until last year.  Oh sure, I&#39;d been to the Cabin Bar, but never had I eaten in the restaurant.  But now that I have eaten there couple of time, it&#39;s good!

Let me start with the onion soup.  Now, everyone knows that I love French onion soup, right?  Well this is probably the best French onion soup that I&#39;ve ever had.  It&#39;s rich and delicious, and they don&#39;t skimp on the cheese (très important, no?).  So good!

Other than that, I&#39;ve had the steak, the chicken cordon bleu (the revamped one that&#39;s on their dinner menu now), the Chateaubriand and several of the appetizers, which have all been very good.  Mr. Mixer particularly enjoyed the shrimp scampi that was served with his surf and turf filet.

All in all, the Summit is a good experience!"

I don&#39;t know how many times we&#39;d passed by this restaurant, but it was exciting to actually walk in! I was surprised by the elegant decor and intimate lighting. Not at all what I was expecting for a steak house. We were also surprised by the inexpensive pricing of the brunch selections, especially considering the large portions. My chorizo could have been much spicier, but the accompanying potatoes were delicious! My only regret is that I didn&#39;t discover this place sooner!"

And the total, even more impressive, about 20 bucks! We&#39;re from LA so we are use to paying 30-45 on takeout.

The food was very hot and fresh. There was plenty of meat in the fried rice dishes and the overall portions were large. The only critique I have is that everything could use a bit more salt. We had to drench the food in soy sauce to help bring out the flavor. However, for really cheap takeout, I&#39;d say this restaurant is decent."

On top of that, the crab cheese wontons were cold and the cheese was not the consistency I am used to. I&#39;m afraid to even try the pad thai I ordered for fear of being disappointed.

I thought that the extensive menu looked good, the prices seemed decent, and the promise of free delivery kind of sealed the deal.  At least I thought it did.

We tried to order online, but their website gave me an error message every time I tried.  So that&#39;s out the window.  We called in our order instead, and being relatively reasonable people, expected that it might take a while, since there&#39;s an inch of snow on the ground.  I guess the first clue should have been when the lady taking the order told my wife that &#34;it might take a while, because our driver is not very good.&#34;

So a little over an hour goes by, and nothing.  My wife calls them, and the lady on the phone says &#34;he&#39;ll be there in 5 minutes.&#34;  So 45 minutes later, my wife calls back and offers directions to the lady on the phone.  She tells my wife, &#34;he&#39;ll be there in two minutes,&#34; and then hangs up on my wife.  I&#39;m writing this review about 20 minutes later-it&#39;s now been over two hours, and no sign of our food yet.

I&#39;d love to review the food, but since I doubt I&#39;ll ever see any at this rate, this review pertains to the service we&#39;ve received so far.  Looks like the mailer is going in the trash, and we&#39;ll be finding somewhere else to eat Asian food."

Ambli is an excellent recent discovery of ours.  My mom has been here before and raved about it so we had a family dinner with some relatives that were in town and appreciate a good bite.  

I was immediately struck by the way they utilize the space.  It&#39;s located in a very old mini-mall that doesn&#39;t exactly exude charm, but as you walk in there&#39;s curtains that separate the dining room from the host stand so one gets a more private and fine-dining feeling.  The restaurant is also laid out in a circular pattern, which seemed to me to add space.  

We were greeted immediately by a very friendly waiter.  We each began with a drink, I had the Rosemary Rye Manhattan, which was the smoothest cocktail I can recall tasting.  Upon mom&#39;s recommendation we started with crispy brussel sprouts, and for dinner I had the Kuku Paka.  This was a very new dish to me, and I really couldn&#39;t get enough of it.  The owner touched our table a few times, and when I asked for a wine to accompany my dinner she came back immediately with an excellent chardonnay that paired magnificently.  For dessert, they featured a key lime flan that had a much thicker consistency than a traditional flan.

The menu is very eclectic and small and each of us were delighted with our experience.  The owner is a very kind and friendly lady and the attention she gave us was perfect.  I would highly recommend Ambli if you&#39;re looking for something new and different, it&#39;s perfect for a special occasion, date night, or celebration dinner.  I truly can&#39;t wait to come back here."

The service: very friendly (maybe reign it in a tad), very helpful with the menu offerings

The drinks: well-made cocktails - I had a rosemary-bourbon concoction (good and strong) and my friend had a strawberry drink, which he seemed to enjoy.

The food: 
  - Beef Samosas with cilantro chutney - great flavor combination, lightly flaky and fried, but not greasy.
  - Vegetarian Indian platter - chana dhal, red-bean coconut curry, and masala potatoes. All very tasty and unique. The potatoes were cooked very well, but the red-bean coconut curry was my favorite. It came with rice and naan, however, when they asked if I wanted more naan (of course I did because there wasn&#39;t very much), they charged me extra. They should&#39;ve said something. Other than that, I&#39;d order this dish again.
  - Chicken Tikka Masala - My friend ordered this, and he was very pleased with it. After trying it, I can see why. The sauce was sweet and tangy with a great spice combination.

Overall, this place was a winner. I&#39;d like to go back and try some of the other menu offerings."

5.  The owner of the restaurant- Kelly was walking around the restaurant, talking with repeat customers and welcoming new guests as if this was a party in her home.. which I guess it kind of is. 

This place was so busy on our first snowy night of the  season.  Reservations recommended.  

We will definitely be back!"

                Crispy Brussel sprouts - great.
  Sake style lobster shooters - really great.
  Crab cake - great.
  Bistro tenderloin naan tostadas - really great.
  Thai style tempura shrimp sushi roll - really great.
  Steak chimichurri flatbread - okay.
  Caprese flatbread - great.
  Banana bread bananas foster - really great.

The service (Nathan) was GREAT.  We let him order for us, and he did an outstanding job with that and with taking care of us in general.

I already have plans to go back!"

I liked the warm interior where the outside world seems to float away. I liked the service which was highly-informed and attentive. I liked most of the tapas I tried (I&#39;m trying to remember them all. I recall delicious samosas and some sort of cheese dip). We were able to hang out and catch up for what seemed like hours without feeling like intruders. The wine selection was inventive and the tapas were as well. I think I would like to return to try an entrée instead of simply appetizers to get a more holistic sense of the chef&#39;s tastes &amp; culinary style. 
I would definitely recommend that you check it out - it is, as others have noted, an oasis in the midst of the urban jungle!"

The menu offers various tapas, as well as larger full entries. We opted for tapas and got the Thai Style Tempura Shrimp Rolls, Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Sweet Chili Calamari, and Tuna Jalapeno Ceviche.

The rolls tasted heavily like peanut, as the peanut sauce in the center dominated the dish. The Brussel sprouts had dates, almonds, and green apple, creating an unique fusion of tastes and textures. My favorite dish by far was the calamari - the chili sauce went well with the bits of fried squid.

Probably not the best place for a first date since all of the food is non conventional, but not a bad choice if you&#39;re up for a culinary adventure."

It&#39;s not quite authentic Indian since they have a little spin on their recipes, but that&#39;s what made the dishes fun-tastic and fresh tasting.  Of the limited non-dairy options they had, we had the samosas, tuna roll, and kuku plate.  We were impressed with the food and service, and felt underdressed as other patrons looked a little more formal."

It may not look like much given the strip mall setting, but once you step inside you&#39;ll forget there&#39;s a McDonald&#39;s and subway a few steps away. 

Great decor and lounge with some awesome weekly specials. 

The thai mussels were spot on, as well as the lobster shooters(could drink the broth straight), lamb kebobs, fig flatbread and ceviche.

Wow, I&#39;m so glad this place is right down the street for me because I see myself eating here anytime I don&#39;t feel like cooking.

The service was attentive and not afraid to show their real personality and not a waiters song and dance, really appreciated that.

Nice open kitchen, always a positive sign for me, nothing to hide. 

Good selection of wines and spirits, a few decent beers but that&#39;s not the target here. 

Finished with their take on bread pudding and chocolate gelato sandwich. 

Do yourself a favor and if you&#39;re in the area, stop in and your tastebuds will thank you."

Perhaps it&#39;s my lack of interest in this style food, but I did not enjoy myself. I ordered Brussels sprouts which weren&#39;t anything special. For my meal, I ordered a sushi roll. It was rather flavorless. It was a loud environment and a bad menu for my picking. Will not be back."

The service is AMAZING and the drinks are great. We always get the calamari and brussels sprouts. The calamari is topped with peanuts and some kind of sauce that makes it so unique. They cook their brussels sprouts with some green apples which adds a whole new flavor. We have tried their steak flatbread but we prefer the naan flatbread. The lamb kabobs are pretty good, they&#39;re tender and the white sauce has a nice bite to it. Great martinis. Great ambiance. Great vibe."

Don&#39;t come here looking for authentic ethnic foods-- this is a fusion style restaurant. The chicken tikka masala was good but not great. It wasn&#39;t very spicy, and it lacked much of the creaminess and richness that an excellent version of the dish would have. We also tried the brisket tacos, which were very tasty, although the flavor of the meat was overshadowed by the taste of the taco shells. I&#39;d order the brisket again and eat it without the shells for the best taste. Reservations seem to be necessary in order to obtain a &#34;good&#34; table, otherwise you are seated at bistro tables near the door."

We got beef samosas, steak naan tostadas, lobster shooters, tuna jalapeño ceviche, Portuguese tiger shrimp, saag chicken quesadillas. It was so much food! I&#39;d say next time we wouldn&#39;t get the quesadilla only because those 6 tapas were a bit much for 2. Quesadillas were good but everything else was really awesome. 

The atmosphere is also very cute. Unexpected for a strip mall restaurant! And the staff was absolutely top notch. 

Thank you for a great dinner~"

I&#39;m confident the rest of the menu is also wonderful. 

The atmosphere is great. Curtains close out the outside world. Plenty of lonely tables for couples and foursomes for intimate conversation. But several large tables for big groups to enjoy.

The decor is quiet modern and white with a lot of little LED lights which just sets the mood perfect.

They so not have a huge selection of wines but the house selection is pretty good. We had the house chardonnay and easily finished the bottle between the two of us.

For the food, got the roasted beets salad (my favorite) and the vegetarian indian platter. I was surprised how good the indian food tasted with all the little condiments (like green chutney) on it.

The service is very warm and friendly. Would def recommend and rethrn."

I am still thinking about our dinner at Ambli a day later. I have driven by it a million times, Ambli is unassuming and could easily get overlooked because it&#39;s in a rather bland, typical sort of strip mall. You could easily mistake this for a little neighborhood wine bar. And in fact, that&#39;s probably what this originally was -- and while wine choices are excellent here, it&#39;s the food that upstages everything else. 

Behind the curtains in the entryway, you&#39;ll find a completely different experience than the generic strip mall exterior. With an open kitchen and a rounded bar in the back that overlooks the restaurant -- the environment is social and fun. Attire was surprisingly more dressy than you&#39;d expect for Denver in a strip mall restaurant. Guys were in dress shirts and sport coats, women in dresses and jewelry. There were dashes of &#39;Cherry Creek Cougar&#39; and &#39;couple&#39;s Date Night&#39; among the patrons -- but ultimately, this is elegant, but not stuffy in any way. Its comfortable and really all about having fun while dining. The staff only amplifies the experience and aesthetic in the restaurant -- they&#39;re friendly, helpful in sharing in what to expect from different dishes and seem to understand the right balance of being attentive without being overbearing. 

We dined on Tuesday, which is their tapas night (every tapas item is lower priced) and I was amazed at how busy the restaurant was. Reservations should probably be made the day prior, as tables fill up quickly, however, the staff did their best to accommodate their booked space with our day-of reservation by finding a space with small tables in the open, bar space up front. It&#39;s more casual up here, but perfectly comfortable for a group of four -- with tapas, flatbread and wine. I liked the casual space we sat in so much, that I am not sure I&#39;d prefer a normal dining table -- so if you&#39;re not on the reservation list and they offer this, don&#39;t be worried about a less-than experience. A few people seemed upset that they couldn&#39;t get a table that came in as walk-ins, but you should understand upfront this place is a bit of a gem and quite popular. Be prepared.

The food -- which we had several tapas options was downright delicious. Absolutely a fusion of flavors, largely Indian and Mexican focused-- our bites were delicious and intriguing. So much so, that one taste of their smooth Sake Lobster (curry) Shooter and you&#39;ll be sold, or quickly re-ordering for another bite. For me, the Sake Lobster will be a must-have as long as its on the menu. Samosas were delicious, tender and wonderfully full of savory beef, a bold chutney, but delicate enough to not have any one element overpower the next. Crab cakes were tender, juicy and beautifully simple with a citrus remoulade. Shrimp were fresh, tender and not overcooked with a nice kick. Also of note, the spicy fig habanero flatbread was delicious -- with a tasty, savor fig mango spread paired with goat cheese and a nice kick of habanero pepper. For me, and my palette, Ambli hits a homerun for two reasons: They&#39;re not afraid of using heat in peppers and spices, and thankfully, it&#39;s all done with knowledge of the flavor of the dish -- and not simply hot to be hot and spicy. Second, Ambli changes their menu often -- and I think this is so important. If the chef does not continue to explore and try new things with the expereince, then there is probably no reason to go back more than once or twice to any restaurant. Ambli isn&#39;t afraid of trying new things. Wine choices were also nice with a good mix of European and California choices. Deals of bottles were also wonderfully priced. And mixed drinks are crafted well and were delivered by the bartender, not the server. A nice touch.

I&#39;ll be back -- particularly because I am curious to dive into their entrees and also see what their curious week day (not weekend) brunch offers."

The inside of the restaurant is very well decorated.  Friendly staff.  We ordered the beef samosas and chicken flatbread for apps, brisket and tikka masala for dinner.  Everything was great!!  The highlight was definitely the beef samosas... best I&#39;ve ever had, and the accompanying chutney was superb.  We were told that the samosa recipe comes from the co-owner&#39;s mom.

For dinner we had the Wasabi Fish and Chips (excellent) and the Kuka Paka (tender chicken in a curry sauce) - both of which were fantastic. For dessert we finished with a Blueberry Flan which was so unique and delicious.

From the hostess to bar tenders, they make you feel at home while maintaining a professional demeanor. The front of the house staff is doing their job well.

We are relatively new to the area and a friend recommended Ambli. The reviews on Yelp all looked good. We live less than a half mile away. My girlfriend is a long time craft bar tender and her mouth still waters over the gin martini that the bar staff made her. It was the food that has turned us away from Ambli. It is over priced and just isn&#39;t good. We have come to Ambli 3 times now, each time ordering different small plates and entrees. We didn&#39;t love anything, and didn&#39;t even eat the ahi tuna it was so bad. The bar tender bought me a beer because we didn&#39;t eat the tuna. We normally don&#39;t put negative reviews on Yelp, but we don&#39;t have anywhere else to get good food close to the house and want the management to know that they&#39;re missing out on our business because of their food. That being said, the place is always packed so other people must be enjoying it."

I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this place as it was close to my hotel but in the opposite direction of most of the recommended eateries in the area.  They had ample parking in the strip mall lot and plenty of overflow at the McDonald&#39;s next door.  The interior was trendy and spacious and featured many older patrons on a Thursday night.

The staff were very friendly and interactive.  I was expecting them to be stuffier and less helpful than they ended up being which was a great surprise.  The food was tapas style and featured some very interesting choices.  My partner and I split the roasted beet salad ($12), the caprese bruschetta ($9), and the saag chicken quesadillas ($9).  It was more than enough food for two and featured a wide array of flavors and styles.  Each item was packed full of flavor and spices and featured fresh ingredients.  I was very pleased with the food at this gem of a restaurant.

Overall, this place was a complete surprise to me.  I was not expecting such good food in a trendy restaurant hidden inside a very normal looking strip mall.

Pros: Tuesday half off tapas is the best deal you can get. They have half off tapas on Tuesdays (excluding seafood), and it&#39;s totally worth it. Also, the lobster shooters are  unique and definitely worth the try. All the flatbreads are good portion sizes as well.

Cons: During my second visit, we were asked to move after we finished dinner (and were just chatting) in order to make room for another incoming reservation. I understand the bind this places the restaurant in, but my friends and I still felt that this was a bit rude. The manager was very apologetic, however, so that made the situation more bearable."

- crispy Brusselsprouts, with a minor alteration due to being lactose intolerant; paired with dates, silvered almonds and green apples. This dish had sweet and salty components that thrilled my taste buds. This by far was my favored dish of my meal.

- shrimp polenta, two spicy garlic jumbo shrimp on a bed of coconut polenta topped with apricot chutney. This tapa reminded me of shrimp and grits with sweet apricot chutney. Same salty and sweet taste however the dish was cold which made it not as enjoyable.

My friends and I came in on a Tuesday for their Tuesday tapas special, we ordered everything on the specials menu and I&#39;m so glad we did! My favorites were the crispy Brussels sprouts, Portuguese garlic shrimp, lobster shooters, corn dip and beef samosas, but honestly you probably won&#39;t go wrong with ordering everything and sampling it out.I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the quesadilla (honestly, wasn&#39;t anything special in my opinion). The bistro tenderloin was good, but they also spread the naan with goat cheese-so if you like the gamy taste, you&#39;ll probably like this dish."

This place is on my top 10. The servers make you feel at home. I heard that they work so hard that the owner gives them a paid one week off in summer! That&#39;s dedication. Don&#39;t go by its location. It&#39;s out of no where, but he food, ambience and service are no match to some $$$ restaurants of Denver. Had the lamb hummus, yellow tail cevice, steak chimmichurri flatbread. Every dish was innovative and amazing. Tuesday&#39;s they have $20 house wine. 2013 Monterey Pinot Noir, who serves that as house wine! And after all a blueberry flan! Get ur self here... Don&#39;t miss"

Great wine, very tasty food. We just did all small plate stuff, and boy there were some i got more than once.

Ambli was just as good as I remembered. They just revamped the menu and everything my party sampled was absolutely delicious! From the Beef Simosas, Spicy Calamari, Braised Brisket, Curry Mahi Mahi, and the Mussels and Shrimp with a Zucchini Pasta it was all excellent.  

When my flight home was cancelled due to weather it just provided a chance to visit Ambli once more before departing Denver. This time we stuck with the tapas menu. The Tuna Ceviche was fantastic. The Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Beef Medallions with Naan Bread, and the Cauliflower Coconut Curry Soup were all delicious. 

Ambli excels at attention to detail and customer service. The owners, Pariza and Kelly are always working the dining room and welcoming their customers. I would highly recommend giving Ambli a visit if you&#39;re Denver area."

You walk in...and I&#39;m really taken back by the atmosphere.  It&#39;s amazing - looks like it belongs in Cherry Creek or logo - great ambiance.  Didn&#39;t have a reservation (I would make a reservation next time) but we were graciously sat in the lounge right away.  Very nice of them to do this.
We ordered 3 Tapas:
-Calamari - it was okay, had peanuts which was interesting, but I just wasn&#39;t blown away by it
-Jalapeno Tuna Ceviche - it was good!  Light, not too much food at all...great amount
-Tenderloin Naan Tostadas - WOW.  Must get these again!  The beef with the goat cheese was outstanding!  My favorite thing we got!

And we ordered 1 entree - the Mexico City Brisket....it came with corn tortillas so you could make your own street tacos...it was good....not GREAT, tasted just like a classic potroast from a crock pot..not bad, but definitely not OMG.

Overall, the service here is top notch, the ambiance is fantastic, it&#39;s a great place to go!!!!  The food is good, but my expecations were probably too high based on past reviews, but I think I will come here on a Tapas Tuesday when the prices drop a little bit and try the Tapas I want to try.

I really hope this place sticks around and &#34;makes it.&#34;  I could see this place being constantly packed if the location were different."

We love the atmosphere and the service was great. We were seated immediately and tended to by our superb server, Nathan, within a minute.
Now about the food: We love restaurants that reflect diverse cultures without westernizing them, and I think Ambli definitely meets that standard. They maintain the authenticity of the dish and the flavors are just incredible.
I got the Kuku Paka and my boyfriend got the Apple Brie Burger (one of the best burgers he has ever had, he says). They were both delicious and we left feeling satisfyingly full.
Compliments to the entire staff- they have a great thing going here!"

This place is a hidden gem. I don&#39;t know why it is hiding in a strip mall by McDonalds but I need places like this near my home so I have no complaints. I have been there for Tapas Tuesdays and Flatbread/Mussels Thursdays. I do recommend Tapas Tuesdays for the $20 house wines but make a reservation! 

The service there is very good. Everyone loves the food there and they share their enthusiasm for what you are about to eat. They give great advice and make sure you don&#39;t over eat. Both times they were great at being there when you needed them but left you alone to enjoy the company and food.

Now for the highlights. The shrimp polenta is an amazing combination of flavors. It is two jumbo shrimp with coconut polenta and apricot chutney. Make sure every bite has all three. One other tapas I would make sure you don&#39;t pass up is the lobster shooters. Fired lobster dumplings served sake style with a red curry sauce that is sweet with heat but not too spicy to ruin the next bite.  Other items tried and would have again was the thai sweet chili calamari, esquites and bistro tenderloin naan tostadas. But don&#39;t take my word for it, go try it!!"

THANK YOU...

We have a Meetup here recently.  At first I was a little apprehensive, to bring a big group to this establishment.  But boy am I glad, I did!  After speaking with one of the Staff, her name is Pariza, she said that she will take care of us and even offer FAMILY STYLE Dining for some of my friends.  I invite like 9 of my friends to have a feast on what Ambli has to offer.

Though the seating at the Bar with HIGH CHAIRS/STOOLS ARE NOT to my liking, things went smoothly.  4 friends and I opt to have FAMILY STYLE Dining while the other 5 opt to have from the Restaurant Menu.  The ones who opt for FAMILY STYLE DINNING, sat to my Right, while the rest who opt to order from the Restaurant Menu sat to my Left.

That lovely evening, was on Saturday October 11th 2014.  The time for our Dinner is at 17:00hrs.  I came in early as usual to make sure things are ok before my friends arrived.

For the FAMILY STYLE DINING which was ($36) per person, without tax or tips, we opt to have the following items :

*  Beef Samosas - Pastries filled with savory beef mix served with cilantro and Ambli chutney

*  PEI Mussels Sautéed coconut broth

*  Portuguese Garlic Tiger Shrimp with a garlic chili sauce

*  Fig Flatbread Fig spread, goat cheese, mozzarella and slivered habanero with fresh basil

*  Tandoori Crab Cake, Jumbo lump crab cake with red peppers, onions &amp; Indian spices served on greens with tamarind aioli

*  Kuku Paka Marinated, Grilled chicken cooked in a coconut curry sauce, served with naan, rice &amp; curried zucchini potatoes

*  Personalized Open Faced Pistachio Gyro with Bistro Tenderloin, Red onion, tomatoes, cucumber, feta, pistachios, tzatziki drizzle &amp; house sauce on naan with Fries

*  Snapper Biryani Pan seared with onion masala, Indian spices, served with naan, rice &amp; curried zucchini potatoes.

If I could recall properly, my friends who opt from the Restaurant Menu, they had :

*  Bhel Puri, Indian Popular Street Food; made with fresh vegetables, beans, peanuts, cilantro &amp; AMBLI chutney

*  Arancini di Funghi, Risotto croquettes with wild mushrooms, 3 cheeses; served with a wine &amp; mushroom sauce

*  Crispy Brussel Sprouts tossed with dates, slivered almonds and parmesan cheese

*  Half Saag Quesadilla Marinated chicken, spinach, masala, cheese &amp; cilantro drizzle

*  Shrimp Polenta Sautéed Tiger Shrimp on a bed of Tomato Polenta with seasonal vegetable and blistered tomatoes

*  Crispy Rellenos with Chicken, black beans, mushrooms, mozzarella &amp; jalapenos, served with rice &amp; pork green chili

My friends also opt to have Desserts which are fried, and comes with ice cream and also the Chocolate Bread Pudding of some kind.

All in all things went well.  There are HITS and MISS with regards to the food.  Personally, as long as my friends are happy, I am happy that the evening went well for them.  Some of my friends who opt from the Restaurant Menu, from their feedback, some said OK, some said, they fell short in some levels, especially in terms of the VEGETARIAN dishes.  

From the price point for the FAMILY STYLE Dining, it was indeed a STEAL DEAL with LOTS OF FOOD.  We cannot thank you enough AMBLI.  My friends raved it so much, and they cannot wait to bring their friends to you and dine away.  I hope and wish AMBLI well in their business undertakings and many more years to come.  See you soon.

That evening, our Main server his name is Alec who handled my friends who ordered from the Restaurant Menu and the lovely Pariza, who handled all our needs with regards to the FAMILY Style Dining experience.  The service was indeed inviting and prompt.  All our drinks are filled regularly throughout our Dinner there.  We Came, We Feast and Indeed We had a great time!

AMBLI, THANK YOU!

My sister also ended up disappointed after giving them five stars after her first two visits. She had a hard time deciding what to order after seeing her favorite pasta and chicken skewer dish was taken off the menu. She ended up getting a substandard spaghetti in meat sauce, which seemed an odd addition to the Indian-African-Latin inspired menu.

I actually loved my dish: the beef medallions. The meat was extremely tender and juicy. It was smothered in an amazing jalapeño cream sauce and sitting atop creamy scallion mashed potatoes. Sautéed seasonal veggies came on the side; they were tasty but I didn&#39;t have any room after eating all of the steak and potatoes.

We all shared samosas and the crispy Brussel sprouts. Both were good but the latter was especially delicious. It was tossed in a tasty oil/glaze of some sort and mixed with parmesan and sliced dates. I don&#39;t even like Brussel sprouts, but these were sooo good.

The reason for my three stars was solely based on service. Don&#39;t get me wrong, everyone was very nice, and I appreciated the owner checking in on us a couple times, but every stage of our visit took too long. From putting in our order to getting our meals to getting our check, it all took a long time. We were sitting at one of the bar tables, an area served by only the bartender on a busy Saturday night. After asking about the status of our meals, they brought them out one by one, so a couple of us sat waiting while the others ate.

I don&#39;t live in the area, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back. But if I am, maybe takeout is the way to go."

By appearance, I mean the unassuming exterior, in a strip mall and adjacent to a McDonalds.  The interior is quite inviting and comfortable.

The food is a wonderful take on Indian and African and possibly other influences.  We&#39;ve eaten there several (6-8) times and with possibly the exception of a dish or two, everything has been a real treat. Many dishes are spicy, so for those opposed to a little heat, you may want to check with your waiter first, but for my taste the level is perfect.  Some dishes not to be missed in my opinion are Kuku Paka, a wonderfully different chicken curry, the green curry mahi mahi, the spicy fig habanero flatbread and any number of the tapas, which are specially priced on Tuesdays.  The sauce on the sweet chile calamari make it the best calamari presentation around.  And every service person, door and table, are so warm and accommodating.  I&#39;m quite lucky to have it in my neighborhood but I&#39;m sure it is quickly becoming a destination restaurant."

This restaurant is located in a less than desirable location but the once inside, you can see how beautiful and intimate the restaurant is. 

The service is beyond amazing. Got sat right away and the server recommended dishes and wine all night to us. 

Since the appetizers looked so good, we just ordered a ton of them instead of a main entree. 

The food here is a mix of Mexican and Indian. Sounds weird but so flavorful and rich. 

Example: get the saag paneer quesadilla and naan flatbread.

The flavors are distinctive and filling.

Don&#39;t miss out on the chocolate bread pudding. One of the best desserts I&#39;ve had!

Don&#39;t be thrown off by the Indian tag on here, there is a mild Indian influence in most dishes but if that&#39;s not your thing, you will find something else.

Check out their happy hour and specials, especially tapas Tuesday. The owner is also the nicest person ever! Definitely try this place and I would recommend reservations if you have more than 2."

We had steak Naan to stay as for the Tapas. They were outstanding. Imagine a sweet and tender cut of steak, on goat cheese and drizzled with fig, onion, and jalapeño marmalade. My words don&#39;t do it justice.  

The Asian salad was fresh and crisp, with fresh jicama, oranges, peanuts, mango, greens and a sesame peanut dressing. So fresh!

Now, the entrees. We had the Mexico City Brisket and the Green Curry Mahi Mahi.

The brisket came sitting on top of their potato and scallion croquettes with some corn tortillas on 
the side.  I went nuts tasting these together. I wished they had more ingredients going into the corn tortilla, however the brisket by itself was a stand alone that required no help. Those croquettes though!

The Green Curry Mahi Mahi came well presented. The Mahi Mahi rested on a layer of rice, surround by Green curry sauce and with an Asian Brussel sprout slaw on top. The Mahi Mahi was soft and tender,  cooked nicely and went really well with the curry. 

Although it was a small drive away,  it was completely worth it. The food was exceptional!"

Ordered the lamb lollipops medium rare. (See my review of Ambli immediately below for the comparison). The cost of the dinner entree: $27. The serving was 2+ to 3 times bigger than the lamb lollipop entree at Ambli. It was just as delicious and the ambiance and service were just as good. 

So dear consumer . . . please tell me . . . would you rather spend $10,000 for this car or $25,000 for the same car?

Right. We&#39;re on the same page here.

I liked Ambli but I more like to get good value for my money. Therefore, on reflection, Ambli&#39;s is not &#34;A-OK&#34; but rather more &#34;Meh&#34; the more I think about it. I know this makes me a member of the small number of people who aren&#39;t in love with this new restaurant, but maybe y&#39;all have got a bunch more bucks than I do and don&#39;t care where they go or what the comparative worth is of what you&#39;re spendin&#39; it on. 

Beats me.

The food here is so unique and different, we wanted to try everything on the menu.

Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was wonderful. Our waiter, Nathan, was so friendly and he kept us laughing through the entire meal. Near the end of our meal, one of the owners also stopped by to ask us how our meal was.

The original plan was for a gourmet take out establishment with retail wine sales.  Due to permitting headaches, the retail wine idea was scrapped in favor of a wine bar but still with a focus on carry out food.  As time went by and more people started hearing about Ambli, more tables were added in the dining room.  Now the two cash register counters that were near the front door have been removed and even more seating has been added.  I am super excited that Ambli has adapted to the needs of the neighborhood!  My neighbors and I were desperate for a casually upscale have-a-seat-and-stay-a-while neighborhood eatery.

Ambli&#39;s menu is ever evolving as well.  The kitchen serves dishes from India, Africa, Italy, Thailand, and where ever else strikes the chef&#39;s fancy.  The options seem to change a little bit every time I&#39;ve visited but the flavors are consistently unique and delicious.  Here are some of my favorite selections from the current menu:

Arancini di Funghi (mushroom and cheese filled risotto croquettes) - absolutely scrumptious

Samosas (filled with a savory meat mixture and served with cilantro chutney and Ambli chutney) - totally tasty and I can&#39;t decide which chutney I like best

Roasted Beet Salad (tossed in greens with balsamic vinaigrette and topped with crumbled feta and walnuts) - light and refreshing

Ambli Hummus (served with naan) - it has a nice smokey flavor and the naan is thin and slightly crispy, so you won&#39;t fill up on bread

Chicken Tikka Masala - some of the best I&#39;ve ever eaten, perfectly seasoned

Karahi Gosht (Steak cooked with spices and tomatoes, served with naan and rice) - the steak is ridiculously tender and the sauce is lovely

We finally checked out the brunch menu yesterday for Easter.  A few of the regular menu items are repeated there but also nontraditional takes on traditional brunch dishes.  Our table had:

Polenta Shrimp with Brussels Sprouts (tomato polenta with seared shrimp, Carolina style BBQ sauce, crispy Brussels sprouts and over-easy eggs)

Naan Benedict (Sliced naan topped with black beans, red onion, avocado, two over-medium eggs, hollandaise, cilantro and chili flakes)

Veggie Croque Madame (A vegetarian version of croque madame filled with mushroom duxelle and mascarpone topped with two over easy eggs, hollandaise and scallions)

We all left happy plates.

Wait!  I haven&#39;t even told you about my favorite part - the wine!  Though I&#39;m very partial to local Colorado wines, I&#39;ve enjoyed sampling the various varietals and international offerings.  I like that you can order a half glass so you can mix, match and sample or just know what you&#39;re getting into before you commit to a full glass.  If you&#39;re going to have more than two full glasses of wine (don&#39;t judge!), the most economical route is to just order a bottle.  At our brunch, we sampled both of the unique mimosa flavors:  apple and orange and apple, carrot and ginger.  I actually think I liked the apple, carrot and ginger the best because it was light, not acidic, and the flavors were well-proportioned.

In addition to the cozy atmosphere and all the wonderful food and wine, Ambli offers fantastic service.  The two friendly and gracious owners are always walking around checking to make sure everyone is doing well and the servers are enthusiastic and on their game.

Not surprisingly, there will be new menu in May focusing on tapas, tacos and a third thing I can&#39;t recall (sorry, I was drinking mimosas).  I&#39;m also happy to see that  new Spring/Summer hours mean Ambli will be open later in the evening (until 9:00 Mon. - Thurs. and until 10:00 Fri. and Sat.; open for brunch only on Sunday).

Welcome to Virginia Vale, Ambli!  We all hope you&#39;ll sit down and stay a while.

You think Nail Salon. You think, Subway. You&#39;d be right. Would you think, &#34;Holy sh*t surprising atmosphere, delicious food at pretty reasonable prices?&#34; Probably not (unless you&#39;re just into Subway). But Ambli is just delicious in unexpected ways.

We had a couple of #foodiesofInstagram types with us; and the food was so good that they forgot to take pictures. That should tell you something right there, amirite?

Our group included two meatarians, a vegetarian, and a pescetarian and everyone was happy: we started out with cocktails (the margarita was made from scratch and delicious), switched to wine (small list, but nice selections). But really, it&#39;s all about the Tapas. Share what you can: the Naan flatbread pizzas, the Puri, the tacos. The lobster shooters were our only iffy selection -- the lemongrass curry that the server poured over the shooters was so good I wanted to crawl into the pitcher and lick it all up; but the fried lobster-something bite was chewy and weird.

Their Indian food in particular is a whole new level: we included a vegetarian Indian platter to share as one of our apps, and the flavors were a revelation. You could taste the layers of flavors, combined in new ways. The people at the table next to us were ooh-ing and ah-ing over their Fish Masala and the shrimp pasta in coconut sauce. The servers and hostess were also delightful.

On Tuesday nights, they have half-price Tapas, so you can try lots of things without a huge tab.  Just, go. The strip mall -- and you -- will be better for it.

Next time I go we&#39;ll take pictures before we devour the food. Maybe."

   Love Ambli&#39;s  open kitchen. The chef is often scanning the customers to ensure they are enjoying his magnificent skills, flavors &amp; artistry. The staff are all very knowledgeable, professional &amp; treat everyone like royalty. The owner is not only charming but she goes out of her way to go by each table personally to offer a warm welcome &amp; check to see each of her guest/tables are content &amp; comfortable. It&#39;s a very old school touch of finesse that was lost decades ago in the restaurant industry so it was refreshing &amp; delightful to experience that extra added hospitality/ artful skill &amp; special touch/detail that has been missed/lost in most dining establishments today. A dining patron would never believe they were inside a strip mall while dining inside the this sleek, pleasant, simple &amp; understated surrounding yet COMFORTABLY chic ambiance of this fantastic bistro/eatery with exceptionally delicious food.
  *** It&#39;s great quality of food masterfully prepared/created by an incredibly talented chef using some of the owner&#39;s family recipe&#39;s at an affordable prices in an elegant setting  without the excessive pretentiousness.

Shared many tapas dishes, which were all very good and we loved the exotic mix of sauces and spices.  Then the entrees!  I had the shrimp/mussel linguine, which was not pasta at all, but long thin bands of zucchini.  So so good, with the sauce being totally mopped up and slurped.  We were full, but had to hear about the desserts.  Next time we are coming just to sample the desserts.  I would recommend this place highly.  Love what they have done with the decor, too-in a small space in a strip mall, but the place looks much bigger with the strategic placing of the mirrors and the centerpiece round cut-out in the center of the ceiling.

[pause] 

&#34;No, there is too much. Let me sum up.&#34;

The food is terrific.  Lots of amazing bites.  Small plates and bigger options. Amazingly shareable (which is one of the highest compliments there is).  A mix of Indian, African, Mexican, Colorado and other influences.  The Indian in particular has great, deep flavors.

The Masala Chai gets a line to itself.  Reminds me of the chai in India and only sweetened if you ask (I never do!).

The people are fantastic.  They have been wonderful and accommodating, truly putting us at ease.

Several gluten free options, including one or two they can make special (e.g. with corn tortillas instead of flour).

&#34;You are going to get hungry in a little less than half an hour.  So all you have to do is grab a friend (or two), make a reservation, get to Ambli, and enjoy a variety of great food... no revenge required.&#34;

Watch out for six-fingered guests, but don&#39;t miss Ambli."

Its location is unappealing, but it&#39;s lovely inside and Yelp don&#39;t lie. Tuesday is half off tapas, apparently, and they were accordingly busy.

My friend and I were sat initially at a community table. We each ordered a nice glass of wine with a solid pour and we each chose two tapas. Eventually, the hostess realized she had sat us at a reserved table and we were apologetically asked to move to a bar and offered free wine for the inconvenience. They were extremely kind and I&#39;m not easily offended, especially not when Malbec is involved.

The food was delicious. Though it may seem that Ambli is too eclectic to execute their wide array of flavors well, they certainly do. I particularly liked the samosas and the little tacos with goat cheese. Four tapas was more than enough for two women.

Do it."

The reviews I read, described the food as Mexican/Indian inspired. I wasn&#39;t sure how this would work out, but the food is delicious!

We came in on a Tuesday night, without a reservation. The hostess explained we could get a small table in the middle of the dining floor, and could order Tapas, one at a time, and drinks but not dinner because the tables are too small. I really liked the pace of tapas. In a lot of my reviews, I complain about everything being served at once, this time my husband and I got to enjoy each plate as it came out without having to rush and stuff ourselves. It would have been even better with wine.

Our plan was to maybe order one or two plates of tapas, then get a table and order entrees. The weird part about this center-table-waiting area is that no one in particular seems to be assigned, we had 6 staff members stopping by, taking our orders, refilling water, and clearing plates. We certainly weren&#39;t forgotten but it was incredibly redundant, not to mention odd. Perhaps if the tables were numbered and assigned a specific server, rather than classified by customer wardrobe this could be alleviated. The check came in a champagne flute, and was labeled &#34;leather jacket&#34;.

We never did get a table, which was okay because as long as we were center-floor, tapas were half price! We both got plenty of food from 4 tapas orders, totaling under $30.

The food is worth a return visit, even enough to overcome the awkward concept."

I had the miso ramen with pork belly. For a cold day, it definitely warmed me up and was satisfying although it was not the best ramen I&#39;d ever eaten. The pork belly was a bit chewy and not fall-apart tender as truly excellent pork belly should be.

I also got the avocado bubble tea. This bubble tea probably had some of the best tapioca balls I&#39;ve had, and that is saying something. They were just he right consistency with a just-right chewiness. However, it didn&#39;t taste extremely like avocado, possibly due to the addition of whipped cream on top? I would have been happier with more tapioca balls in it as well; I ran out of them about halfway through the drink. 

The service was also quick; I didn&#39;t have to wait long to order my bubble tea and my meal.

Overall, I rate this restaurant 3 stars for a satisfying meal. Nothing mind blowing going on, but I still definitely enjoyed myself and had a nice lunch."

This places Pho has decent flavor most times, it does tend to vary.  My issue with this place is not the food, it&#39;s the staff/management...
On one occasion I had the bus girl take my bowl before I was finished, I was to reserved to stop her.  She did the same thing to the table next to us but they made a scene and she brought their food back.  Thought that was odd, wrote it off as a fluke.  Perhaps the don&#39;t have enough bowls to accommodate their customers?  It was a busy night that night.  

Recently a friend and I decided last minute that we wanted Pho.  We looked them up on the internet and found they close at 10pm on Saturdays.  We got in the car and drove down, found a parking spot and walked in.  The guy behind the bar just looked at us.  So I said, &#34;two please&#34;.  He&#39;s walked over and said, &#34;can I help you?&#34;  I asked if we could have a booth.  He said that they were only doing to go orders now, they are closing.  I looked around, there were others in the restaurant watching us, seated with their food.  Embarrassed, we turned around and walked out.  Once outside we checked our watches, it was 9:20pm, right on the door it&#39;s posted 10pm Saturday&#39;s.  

There seems to be a Pho restaurant on every corner now days.  My next bowl will be at my favorite place, or I&#39;ll just give another restaurant a try if I&#39;m not up for the drive.  Don&#39;t plan on going back here.  I&#39;m a bit surprised to find this kind of service at a Southlands location."

They are a 2nd store from the same people who own Pho 97 down the street off of Smoky Hill and Buckley and most of the staff look extremely familiar. The Pho itself tastes about the same and the rest of the experience is about what you&#39;d get at the other one. 

What really threw me was that a medium bowl of Pho (which was $7.95 at the other Pho and about $7.75 at others) was $9 here. 9 big smackers. Seems really high for Pho to me. Since they are now the closest to me and not on the major intersection like the other one, I&#39;ll keep coming back (and probably complain about the price every time).

Pho 97 was fine (phine?) for a quick pho fix. They seated us right away, service was fast. We really enjoyed the beef spring rolls. Broth was good, not amazing and not terrible. I will say that for the price (which isn&#39;t crazy, but probably more than other pho places) I would have expected more meat. Also, I like spicy food but beware the jalapeños! I dropped one in my soup and within seconds my soup was on the verge of being uncomfortably hot. My fiancé didn&#39;t even eat one...he just added aome sprouts that had been touching them and his soup was way too hot - he had the spicy sniffles and everything!

Very bright, great seating and simplistic design is wonderful. I took my daughters (ages 6/7) in here for the first time and I wasn&#39;t sure how they&#39;d like it. After I got them the combo platter (they shared one) and their drinks came out with some lovely little pink cakes, I thought my girls were going to giggle more than they ate.

Growing up eating Vietnamese food, I was happy with the quality of the food and because the location was so convenient to us, we began ordering from them AT LEAST once a week. We only ate in the restaurant once because the service was slow and the size of the location did not accommodate my family of 6 very well. 

For months, we had no issues with ordering takeout weekly. Sometimes our food wasn&#39;t ready when we arrived to pick it up, but that wasn&#39;t a huge deal-a little annoying, but not a deal breaker for us. As time went on, we had more and more issues. We received incorrect orders, were missing items, noodles weren&#39;t fully cooked on top of the staff becoming more and more rude. 

One time, they had put a promotion for 20% off on a sign when I arrived to pick up my order and I asked about it and the girl rolled her eyes at me and said &#34;you did not ask about it when you called.&#34; I did not argue, I let it roll off and continued to wait for 25 minutes for my order when I had already been told that it would be ready by the time I had arrived. When I asked if my order was ready, I was told &#34;They&#39;re making it now.&#34; And the girl walked off. Since I had been in there so often, I spoke to one of the employees that I had seen every time I was there and told him about the girl being rude. He apologized and had the other girl get my food for me right away. When I got my order home, it was missing one part of the order and it looked like everything was dumped in the container. 

My husband and I assumed there was a change in management because we always substituted one item in one of of our orders the last time I placed an order, we received a return phone call that we could not do that and that we would have to place a new order. When I said it had been a normal order that we had done weekly, the response was very rude. 

Needless to say, we no longer order from there."

We tell him what we want and he takes forever bringing us our food meanwhile we hear some one gaging in the back room. He take our menus and my sisters phone is on hers and he pull her menu out from under her iPhone and it dropped on the table he didn&#39;t say sorry or even acknowledge what he did. He brought us our food our limes looked used and our utensils were dirty. We ask another waiter for some new limes and we tell her our problems so far.

I ordered a small rare steak bowl and a side of spring rolls. My fiancé ordered a large rare steak bowl. The prices at this pho is $3 dollars more then what we usually way for entrees. 

After waiting about 10 minutes the waitress came back with egg rolls(nothing that I ordered for appetizer). Before I can voice my opinion she ran off. So we ended up eating the egg rolls, I really wanted spring rolls. after finishing up the appetizers we sat around for another 20 minutes. In that 20 minutes I&#39;ve heard the staff pass our table using inappropriate language, and being very unprofessional. Our waitress was much more concerned with her tips, then caring that we needed refills.

The broth was good, not the best but still very tasty. Service was fast and friendly. The location is clean and modern looking. A good movie(x-men) was on tv but  it was not loud or disturbing of conversation."

We share an entree because, the portions are so big and also order a side of spring rolls. The waitresses are always friendly and seat us quickly when we enter. The price is very reasonable for the Southlands area. It&#39;s great for meat eaters and vegetarians alike to eat together without hassle. The location is close to home and next to the AMC theater so, it&#39;s great for date nights as well."

The broth doesn&#39;t have real beefy flavor more like a substitution of beef bouillon cubes. The broth is so salty and flavor less .Their Bun Bo Hue is a joke tastes nothing like It should be they didn&#39;t even use the right noodle for this spice soup. I feel like they cut cost for  cheapest ingredients. Beef market has gone up 21% I would pay more for better broth. I live less than 5 minutes from S.Land mall and I will tell all my friends to drive  further to Pho Vy in Parker &amp; Arapahoe ( nothing to write home about but a least a bit better and just as close to home)
   I&#39;ll check back sometime in the future to see if they change their cheap ways. I want awesome pho in SL"

Last night we decided to try Pho 97 at the Southlands and what a mistake that was!  Usually for Pho you wait a few minutes ... 10 minutes tops.  We waited over 20 minutes - and there were only 3 tables with customers (and 2 waiters).   Yes, they did give us free crab cheese wontons but these were the unwanted pieces ... overcooked and barely any filling.  I will give the Pho97 on Smoky Hill another try but will not return to the one at the Southlands."

The boba balls were under cooked.  I talked to the host.  He said that they were still cooking, that&#39;s why their hard.  I asked him why he was even serving them.  Got a very strange look.  Asked him for my money back.  Even stranger look.  How dare I even ask - of course not!  Last time I&#39;ll ever support this business!  I should have poured the drink on the floor at that point.  Instead, being polite, I left the drink on the counter.  Hard to believe such arrogance!  I&#39;ll never have a chance to try the food.  Way to go Pho 97!  Hope you 86 out the door!"

The steak wasn&#39;t of great quality and the flank steak was really fatty, and there was hardly any meat on it. The broth left a lot to be desired. It was bland, a little oily and I couldn&#39;t fix it up to be palatable. I spent $10 on a bowl of pho (which is expensive) and I couldn&#39;t even eat half.

It&#39;s always very clean and the staff are great! We use to go to the location on Smoky Hill and Buckley but the Southlands location is just right around the corner. Others have pointed out that it&#39;s a little more expensive but they make up for it with their big portions. The egg rolls are always fresh and you get three really big ones (I recommend using the condiments they bring out with them. Roll the egg roll in lettuce with cucumber and cilantro and some of the pickled carrots and dip it in the fish sauce. Heaven in my mouth! With the leftover fish sauce, I always put it in my pho. Yum!) I usually get the tofu and veggies; my husband gets the rare beef. Both bowls are treats!

Man, I did not know it was the &#34;opening&#34; day that we went here for Dinner.  That recent visit was on Thursday February 12th 2015.  Time was about 20:00hrs ish.  Thankfully we managed to get a parking space, and right when we enter, we are like 2 other patrons in line to order the food.

YES, there are ample of seats, but since it was Opening Day, this establishment is indeed jam packed.  From the Simple Menu, we opt to have the following items :

*  Meal Entree of SPICY DELUXE Chicken Sandwich ($6.69)
*  Meal Entrée of Grilled Club Chicken Sandwich WITHOUT Bacon ($8.39-$0.90), hence it was ($7.49)
*  12 Count of Chicken Nuggets ($4.65)

The Main Entree comes with Medium Criss Cross Cut Fries, and Medium Fountain Drinks.  Hubs opt to have Coke Cola, while I opt to have the Root Beer.  The Fountain Drinks, are being placed in their Signature Foam Cups aka Styrofoam White Cups which are &#34;Re-cycle-able&#34;.  While ordering, we get the option to choose the kind of Cheese we want on our order.  Both Hubs and I opt to have the Pepper Jack Cheese.  For Hubs main Entrée order, we requested to have NO BACON, in which they obliged to our request.

We sat ourselves at the nearest available seat which is near to the ordering counter.  YES, the service is fast and prompt.  The food came out hot, though it more like lukewarm to my personal taste bud.

The SPICY DELUXE Chicken Sandwich, is NOT SPICY at all.  *SIGH*.  As for the rest of the food, it was just OK.  Even Hubs said it was OK, since he does not fancy Chick-fil-A.

All in all its 3 stars for this establishment.  YES, even the washroom it was kept clean when I get the chance to use it to wash my hands, etc.  It seems that this Chick-fil-A is more on a &#34;smaller&#34; scale in terms of size of the restaurants, in which I have been to several across Colorado soil.  

YES, it has Patio aka Outdoor Seatings available when the weather is good to eat outside.  It has an Indoor Playground for the little ones, FREE WI-FI and the Franchised Restaurant Operator, his name is Matt Williams.  It was opened on Thursday February 12th, 2015.

The operation hours of this location is as following :

What stood out about this one, however, was the level of customer service. Chick-Fil-A employees are known for being super polite, but this one should set the bar for every other store. The employees were extremely friendly, attentive, and even remembered our names for the entire stay. We even had someone come check on us at the table to see if we needed anything, like it was an actual restaurant.

The staff were so friendly that honestly I assumed the food would be just ok. It wasn&#39;t. Since it was my first time in I wanted to get a few things: Pulled pork is delicious. 
Mac and cheese to die for. 
Garlic mashed potatoes creamy, with some skin!
Great sauces, and a free piece of Texas toast with the meat!
I also got there slaw, vinegar based, just not my thing. Not bad, I guess I prefer mayo based. 
As I was paying for my meal, I grabbed a sample house-made potato chip to enjoy while I waited. It was so good I went back in to buy a bag.

Beer was $8, wings (&#34;1 pound of wings&#34;) were $10, chips a few bucks....comes to $30...and you only get a like 7-9 wings. It wasn&#39;t enough and had to get another pound of wings...

Yeah the wings were very good, but damn, weighing them like that seems cheap because bones. But overall I liked the food. 

Place very clean, the mac and cheese was noodles with cheese sauce poured over it.

I think I would go elsewhere for a new experience before coming back here to spend my entire paycheck on a few wings (like serious I like wings but they&#39;re the biggest rip off in the US for food). 

I would recommend this place if your name is Bill Gates or Warren Buffet lol...

Ordered the brisket and ribs. Brisket can&#39;t compare to my fave, La Barbecue. Maybe I should check out Wayne&#39;s since I&#39;m a fan of TX BBQ. The ribs were surprisingly tasty, though. Also had the mac and cheese and the beans which were good.

Neither meat tasted like they were smoked.  Maybe CO does it different?

I travel to Denver often and this is my 2nd time here in a couple of weeks. 1st time service was great. I even got to sample some apple coleslaw. Brisket was ok, sausage was good and I tried a friends rib which was great. 

This time around although not busy today service is just like everywhere else and by that I mean not good and not bad. Brisket is horrible and full of fat, ribs not good and feels rushed, mash potatoes no flavor, beans ok and the sausage remains good. 

Don&#39;t know of it is worth a 3rd visit as they are expensive. I am ok with the price when the service and the food live up to it. But $29 for lunch well I might not be coming back. 

Place is clean and nice layout.

Update:
I just got a reply from the owner and that alone is awesome. I went by there today because of the first visit. Service was awesome and I was constantly checked on and even offered to try a side of the Apple coleslaw which was good. The owner asked me to give it another shot so I will.

1. Sweet tea was old and the lemonade that was &#34;homemade&#34; was just Minute Maid powder mix. Gross.
2. French fries were just plain no flavor after being advertised as &#34;salt brine flavor&#34;.
3. Mac n cheese was disgusting. .99 cent Kraft Mac n cheese is better. Noodles were hard and cheese tasted so weird.
4. Pork sandwich was cold and the pork was mushed to bits so it was mushy and had no flavor at all. 
5. So expensive for what you get! $30 for 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 drinks. 

An employee came to clear the table and asked how everything was and we were honest and told her but she looked dumbfounded and walked away.

We decided on putting together a sampler of 1/4 brisket, 1/4 pulled pork and 1 sausage link at 4 dollars each.  Unfortunately, they were plum out of ribs for an afternoon lunch!! So alas, another day. 

For sides we chose the Mac n&#39; cheese, apple slaw and pit smoked beans.  There is a good selection of soda and non-soda drinks as well as selected beers.  All our options were delicious, but if I had to order again I would order the brisket on Texas toast, with a side of Mac n&#39; cheese and yummy Apple slaw!  I am a huge fan of the apple slaw, which had no mayo yet still flavorful - that&#39;s the first for me. 

Service is very quick and friendly. We only waited a couple minutes before our food was brought out.  What initially looked like very little food for $25, turned out to be a moderate meal for two people. I took a star rating away because I feel the prices can be cheaper and they ran out of ribs on an Saturday afternoon lunch. Overall, very good food, clean establishment, but not cheap."

The wings were amazing-again, a slight crisp with the perfect amount and amazingly balanced dry rub. My husband ordered the brisket sandwich. The two sauces are both excellent. The Hottish spicy BBQ sauce has just the right amount of heat and The Topper savory sauce is full flavored and not too thick or thin. For sides, we got the onion rings, beans, and cole slaw.

Looking at the ratings we must have hit one of the excellent days. We are hopeful that our future meals will be at least close to this one in quality. The restaurant was also very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I highly recommend that you try this place as it is the best barbecue place in the North Metro area.

In my opinion this bbq is just average at best. I had the Meltdown sandwich with macaroni and cheese, mind you that was $15 for lunch without a drink.  The also charge $2 for two slices of Texas toast, which is absurd. 
The brisket basically had zero flavor and needed the sauce to close the flavor gap. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good for boxed macaroni and cheese. I&#39;ve been to a lot of bbq places all over the US and this one is just average. The prices are high for bbq and it&#39;s very close to flavorless."

Lunch was delicious and the decor was fresh, clean, and spacious.  I ordered the pulled pork platter with mashed potatoes and texas toast.  The pork was tender and seasoned well, but the other two items were fairly average.  However, the star of the show of a BBQ joint should be the BBQ, and I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more of it.  They just opened a couple days ago and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re still working out a few kinks, but it&#39;s definitely a great addition to the area.  

One one thing that might give people pause is that their food seems a little expensive for what you get."

Loved the handwritten paper menu on the wall. It&#39;s a little spendy and worth every penny. There were 8 of us and I think we got a fair sampling of the offerings here. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs, turkey, jalapeño cheddar sausage and wings for mains. Sides were baked beans, onion rings and apple coleslaw. For drinks they have plenty of local brews on tap as well as one of those cool Pepsi mixology machines with all the options. They have chocolate chip cookies that we took home for dessert. They were yummy and super good, especially coming from a BBQ place.

It was a good experience. I ordered the ribs, brisket and a side of macaroni cheese.
The ribs were super flavorful and generous in size. The brisket was OK... only 3 slices in a 1/4 order but it was decent. The cashier recommended the macaroni and cheese and again, it was decent but not memorable. 
You only get slice of toast per 1/2 order which is a shame. You&#39;ll need to order extra. Also, you get 2 BBQ sauce containers per order (so I had 4 in my to go order tonight) which is plenty.
All and all- it was a good experience. It&#39;s worth trying for sure and I&#39;ll be back for the ribs and to look for a favorite side dish. 
I would skip on the brisket (weird to say for a BBQ place) and mac and cheese. The wait is 10 minutes which is totally fine. I wish they had better beer offerings to enjoy while I waited.
The service is friendly and the place is a bit pricey. The ribs are where it&#39;s at!"

I got the ribs and brisket.  If I could give the ribs a -5 rating I would do so. It was seriously like eating jerky off of the bone. The worst ribs I&#39;ve eaten. The brisket was ok. The homemade potato chips were very good. It&#39;s likely they had a bad day because I honestly can&#39;t see anyone giving a good review after eating those ribs! Service was  ok and environment was nice. I won&#39;t be back though. This is why I smoke my own ribs.

We didn&#39;t bother with the sides, continue reading below for why. We got 1 pound of brisket. We started eating. It was delicious! Halfway through the mound of brisket, the bottom half had dry, over-cooked brisket hidden underneath the delicious, moist and tender brisket. MORE SAHARA DRY BRISKET! WTF dudes?? Get some quality control!! Don&#39;t serve burnt brisket! Don&#39;t try to pawn off your mistakes on your customers! There isn&#39;t enough quality there to keep us coming back, so I guess we&#39;re still on the hunt for a favorite BBQ place. 

Updated Review: I received a message from a management team member, apologizing for the terrible food on the first visit. He indicated that there was a new cook who had over-cooked some brisket during the time we made our visit, which explains how it was so dry. He asked us to return and try again. I am a fan of second chances, so we gave it another shot. 

The brisket and pulled pork we tried on our return visit was very, very good. I would absolutely return for these items, and will probably try their other meats as well. The brisket was just how it should be, very tender, a little fatty, very moist. The flavor was smoky and delicious. Both choices were easily in the top five (possibly top 3) most delicious BBQ meats I&#39;ve had, which for us is saying something, as we&#39;ve been to many great BBQ restaurants. The main sauce and BBQ meats are made in the Kansas City style, which I prefer. The BBQ baked beans had an excellent flavor, a little sweet for my tastes, but most people would like them. The garlic mashed potatoes were quite garlicky, and pretty good. Personally, I favor garlic mashed potatoes made with roasted/sautéd garlic for a more savory flavor, these tasted of sharper raw garlic. This is a personal preference thing, they were a perfectly adequate side dish. The mac and cheese side we had was also adequate, I personally would like a more cheesy flavor, and would like noodles a little softer. They serve theirs more chewy or al dente. Again, nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. That said, isn&#39;t BBQ really just about the meat?? I&#39;ll just take the meat home and make a side salad. :) 

Original review: 
Dry brisket. Dry as a bone. The whole dinner was awful-- BBQ is supposed to be moist! Impossibly tender and moist with melted fat, not over-cooked and dry as the Sahara."

First off it&#39;s well appointed and clean inside. Two TVs for the inside dining if you want to catch a game. Also, I found it funny that the hours are 11 till its gone, kind of neat. Anyways I ordered the turkey and sausage and my wife got the ribs. The food is excellent, the sausage had a nice smoke ring but was not dry, additionally this sausage was awesome. My wife got the ribs which I have to say we&#39;re delicious and fall off the bone. They have a nice selection of local tap beers as well as many normal fare bottles and cans.  I wanted to try the brisket but they ran out while we were eating, so next time. 

Also, the service was excellent with and in horrible for not asking either the owner or manager making rounds in the dining room seeing if everyone is on and delivering and taking trays.

More like over-shredded and over-worked/mixed and stored in a steamer of some sort. It sat atop a bun that was simply WAY too much bread for a sandwich, and was covered in some sort of seasoning. This makes me think that even they know the meat is lacking some taste, so they took a shortcut. Tasting the meat, it was nice and tender, but lacked flavor. It&#39;s as if it was slow cooked in an oven, and was never smoked. Maybe I&#39;m totally wrong, but I didn&#39;t taste any smoke flavor here. The best BBQ meats are eaten by themselves with no extra seasoning, and no sauces. There were 2 BBQ sauces to choose from on the table. One was very sweet, and the other was nice and spicy. There was no smoky BBQ sauce, but that&#39;s a personal preference. I mixed the two together and got a nice spicy sweet sauce. It really made the meat shine, and all together it made for a great sandwich, except that towards the end I had to ditch the bun. Too much bread. The BBQ Beans were outstanding, if a little sweet. They had a good spice, and tasted great. Additionally, too expensive. A sandwich with beans would have been $12. I happened to go on a Monday, so sides were free.

Regardless, it&#39;s worth checking out. I&#39;ll go again, and I&#39;ll try out their brisket. If it&#39;s outstanding, well... I&#39;ll have to raise my rating."

I was really craving good barbecue and beer and found this gem. Walking in we were immediately shocked at how many people were already in what looked like a very long line, but even with one person on the registers we flew through the line ordered our foot and found a seat. 

I ordered the pull pork sandwich with a side of apple coleslaw and a Colorado crafted Oktoberfest. First off, the coleslaw was fresh, soooo fresh and the pork was tender and so perfectly seasoned it was almost a shame to add the sauce. The only complaint I would have was that the mac and cheese seemed a bit watery, but that is all. 

The bill was up there, but for brisket and pulled pork not too bad at around $40. Will definately return."

Clearly take pride in what they do. Had the fortune of chatting with them on this visit. The food was great. And they take pride in the sides as much as the main course. 

Brisket- they don&#39;t separate the point and flat. You get a nice solid cut on your tray. Good flavor allowing the beef to shine through. And the rub and wood allowed that flavor to shine. Very moist brisket. 

Ribs- strong rub. A bit sweet and bit of a bite in the back. But well balanced. Tasted good on the ribs. 

Mac and cheese - great al dente pasta with a sauce on it. Not overly cheesy and balanced well. 

Beans- perhaps the winner of the sides. They cook them bellow the ribs in the pit. You end up with the complexity of the rub and pork in the beans and ding a level of flavor that was welcome."

I can&#39;t say it was all great cause they were out of some stuff. The brisket was good (Texas good). The wings were also good. We had them dry rubbed and buffalo style, it&#39;s not a traditional buffalo style a bit tangier and with a bit of smoke. But if they stay consistent it&#39;ll be nice to be able to get good wings without having to make them myself. I&#39;m not much of a pulled pork guy but it too was good.

Food is a solid 90% consistent, and consistently, jaw dropping, price-justifying, outrageously delicious. The first visit or two, the food felt like it was above the norm, but then it happened. The cravings. I just couldn&#39;t stop craving each spectrum of everything offered. Are the ribs different? Yes, diabeticly unique, delicious, sweet, and just amazing. Have I had the previously noted &#34;jerky&#34; tough served once or twice? Sure. The brisket also has its 10% dried up disappointing inconsistency. That being said, I go back again and again because the 90% it&#39;s great, the food is just... Magical.  The wings are amazing. The staff friendliness is great when the owner, Jason is around. You can tell he really cares and will always listen to feedback and refocus his hands on business. Buying the premium meats by the pound, to go, seems to be the best bang for the buck from a value standpoint. They also offer great local beers, whiskey, and a pretty decent patio. I hate how everyone loves to be a bbq expert and over-critically judges this place. It&#39;s amazing. Best advice? Go once, just to go twice."

If portion size and price are your main factors when choosing a place to eat, GQue ain&#39;t for you.

But if quality is your bag, then ignore everyone here and drive the fuck over to GQue right now, this place is fantastic.  I have not yet had a single thing I&#39;ve disliked, and I&#39;m making an effort to order different things every time I go, as well as try everything my wife orders.  My main complaint is that this place is really close, so I&#39;m going to get extremely fat eating it.

Pulled pork is great, brisket is great, the sides are excellent, the sausage is good.  But holy hell, the ribs.  The Ribs.  Hands down, the best ribs I&#39;ve ever had in my life.  There&#39;s some kind of honey or something coating them, so if you don&#39;t really like &#34;sweet&#34; barbecue sauces, you might not like them, but if you&#39;re a sweet BBQ person you&#39;re going to love these ribs.  The bones that come from the ends tend to be a little overcooked and tough, but any other rib on the rack is just moist and falls of the bone and is truly delicious. 

I&#39;m not kidding, these ribs are absolutely amazing - I was recently in a different restaurant for dinner, a place where I usually ordered the ribs.  But I decided not to bother, and just ordered a burger instead, because if I was going to eat ribs, I wanted to go to GQue and order there.  I can&#39;t wait until the next time my dad is in town - he&#39;s from the south and always makes fun of my attempts to find good barbecue in Colorado.  That old grumpy bastard&#39;s gonna eat his words!

It&#39;s worth mentioning for completeness that there are only two types of sauce, a sweet and a spicy, and the spicy sauce isn&#39;t very spicy at all.  I like a good spicy sauce so this is a slight bummer - if you&#39;re into spicy BBQ you might be a bit disappointed.

Anyway, look, I need you to go buy some food here.  If this place doesn&#39;t succeed and winds up going out of business, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do.  It&#39;s fantastic barbecue right near my house, it has to stay in business and feeding me ribs, please go give them money."

Not sure about the price complaints as all lunch these days are gonna cost you 15 bucks.  I&#39;ve had the Turkey, sausage, brisket.  So far my favorite is a toss up between the turkey and brisket.  Sides are solid.  Good potatoes, beans really stood out.  Mac is just OK.  HOuse chips are crispy and well seasoned. 
Hard to say what the specialty is..sandwiches look awesome but the meat by the lb. is excellent as well.   Probably my favorite BBQ around here now that big Hoss is closed. 
Definitely give it a try."

I thought it was amazing, one of the better BBQ places I&#39;ve been except for a handful in Texas.

The ribs especially, are amazing - they have a kind of glaze on them along with some kind of spices sprinkled on top which are fantastic, I ate a few ribs without any BBQ sauce at all as they were so delicious.  I also had the brisket and pulled pork, both were very good with the sauce - as some have mentioned the spicy sauce is not really very spicy, but it&#39;s got a good flavor - what both my wife and I liked best though was mixing both BBQ sauces in equal amounts together, that I thought had a great flavor.

For sides we had the beans and mac &amp; cheese.  The beans were amazing, super flavorful.  The mac n cheese was good but so rich I could have only a little.  Even the smallest side is pretty large so you may not want to order many.

One other thing I especially enjoyed was the cherry bourbon cheesecake, it has a great chocolate crust and the flavor and texture were great, by far the best cheesecake I&#39;ve had at a restaurant anywhere.  I normally prefer other desserts to cheesecake but this was fantastic, I would even consider going there just to have dessert...

Especially because of the ribs, I&#39;m not sure I can think of any BBQ place in Denver I&#39;d rather go to.

Since they can run out of stuff you might want to make lunch as your first visit so you get the fullest selection."

However, as their popularity has soared, the quality control has steadily decreased to the point where it is no longer worth trying to keep liking it. Today&#39;s failure was an extremely overcooked brisket, cooked to the point of  being, not just dry, but sandy and pasty. Last time it was the pork, mostly just mush without any meaty characteristics left. The side items have remained decent, but certainly not worth the price asked."

Perhaps my favorite thing about the place would be the friendliness of the staff, particularly Amy who was working the register and was very personable and made an effort to introduce herself to each and every customer.  My second favorite thing would have to be the beef brisket. It was moist, flavorful, beautifully cooked, and they did a very nice job of trimming off the excess fat before putting it in the take-out container.  

Other items I had were somewhat less successful from my point of view. I did appreciate that the pulled pork was moist and that I received a good sized portion of it. It did not seem to have a ton of flavor to me, however. I found the mashed potatoes to just be fair. I felt like the beans were a missed opportunity. They were well cooked, and had some decent flavor. However, I found them to be rather boring. There was nothing in them other than beans and sauce. I know that some people like them this way, but to me it felt like well-made barbecued beans for children. I think a little bit of bacon, or some chunks of brisket, or some onion or peppers would&#39;ve gone a long ways towards making the beans more interesting and superior. I also found the barbecue sauces to be just fair. The savory one did not do much for me, and the spicy one was not especially spicy. I could&#39;ve used a much hotter/spicier one.  Also, perhaps a different style of sauce would&#39;ve been a nice addition.

I cannot fault them for doing the food that they want to do it. And they are doing pretty well at it from that perspective. However, I guess I&#39;m looking for something a little more exciting when I go out for barbecue."

My husband and I came in for lunch and had high expectations since we&#39;re from TX and love BBQ. We&#39;ve visited many other BBQ joints with the same &#34;Al a cart and per pound&#34;   Concept and we were looking forward to trying this one since it&#39;s close to where we live.
The cheese fries were amazing and the brisket was tender and moist but The apple coleslaw wasn&#39;t our favorite.  I usually have to be cautious when it comes to BBQ sauces b/c the ingredients used in most of them give me extreme migraines but that was not the case with G Que. The BBQ sauce they offered was amazing and I had no adverse effects from it. 
The down side was the cost.  We found it to be a little more pricey than some other BBQ competitors with the same concept.  When G Que says &#34;everything is al a cart&#34; they really mean that.  As our experience at other barbecue places you can get slices of sandwich bread for FREE with your food.  that&#39;s not the case for G Que.  we found that out the hard way.  We didn&#39;t know to we had to pay for sandwich bread, so when we received our food my husband asked for a few slices, the guy at the counter was pretty rude and gave my husband a very hard time and let him know the bread wasn&#39;t included and we had to pay for it. We were surprised at his response and how short he was with us.  My husband then apologized for asking and for our &#34;not knowing&#34;  since we didn&#39;t have cash on us we were happy to eat our meal without it.  as we started for our table the guy then said &#34;just this once I&#39;ll give it to you for no cost&#34; and handed us our two slices.  Overall the food was good but our experience with the staff and their attitude and rudeness really set the tone for us and I think for now on we will satisfy our bbq cravings elsewhere."

This place opened about a month or so ago and had been under construction for awhile before that. The former tenant was Double D&#39;s pizza and GQue has done a good job with the space. It&#39;s interior is fresh, open and modern. Well laid-out and clean with a queue-style ordering area immediately up front, open dining room, and the front-kitchen along the left side where you pick up your order. They have one of those nifty &#34;Freestyle&#34; Pepsi centers for fountain drinks, and offer alcohol (beer, wine, and a selection of spirits).

Since it was lunch, I was looking for a multi-meat combo (I wanted to sample a couple of different items) but they don&#39;t appear to offer that sort of thing. Their &#34;special&#34; appeared to be a sandwich combo, and all other meats were single-platters, one side. Everything else is ala carte.

The order-taker wasn&#39;t really able to take me through the options on how I would put something like that together - she didn&#39;t appear to have much familiarity with the ordering process (but I do think she was new).

At any rate, I ordered 4 ribs, what looked like either a ¼ or  1/2 pound of pulled pork, and two sides, rather small: coleslaw and baked beans. With drink, the grand total was $26.00 - way too much to pay for a single person for lunch, and way way too much for what I actually got once I received my order - it looked like what I would expect for a 13 dollar-or-so platter at a competitor. You could go across the street to Old Man and get BBQ just as good, for significantly less.

On to the food:

Baked Beans: Excellent. Nothing more to say here, probably the best baked beans I&#39;ve had. Only thing that would make them better is some chunks of brisket or pulled pork in them.

Coleslaw: Fresh, but boring - no spice profile whatsoever. Add a little zing and they would have something here.

Ribs: Quite good. Tender, and a really tasty rub they are using. Not overly fatty. A+ on these.

Pulled Pork: Tender, but strangely TOO wet. I like a moist pulled pork but this was almost broth-soaked. I smoke quite a bit at home, I&#39;d say this pulled pork was either over-cooked or allowed to rest in the foiling juice for too long which gave it a mushy texture.

Texas Toast: Didn&#39;t get any, which is strange since it looked like every platter on the menu came with some and I certainly paid enough for it!

Table Sauces: Nothing to write home about. Perfectly adequate Kansas City-style BBQ sauce, sweet and hot variety.

Overall, I like the place, but be prepared to pay for it - maybe they want to get their construction loans paid off quickly so prices are high right now! I&#39;ll probably be back, but simply order smarter and maybe walk out a little hungrier.

I tried the 4 rib plate, and really loved the ribs, which were a great combination of sweet and salty. But everything here is ala carte, so I paid $15 for the ribs and a drink, way too much, in my opinion. Other established rib chains in the area charge around $12 for the same amount of ribs, a side, and some even toss in a drink. If you intend to compete you need to offer a similar value. For that reason, I will not be back to this new place! I really wanted to frequent this place, but just can&#39;t do it!"

We ordered the brisket platter and the jalapeño a usage platter with garlic mashed potatoes and were thoroughly impressed. The brisket was soooo soft it was almost hard to eat cuz it kept falling off the fork.  I&#39;m a mashed potatoes critic and these were relish!!!

And, unlike many Asian restaurants, you still get the fried rice on the side if you order Lo Mein. My son (who always orders both) was so happy, and so was I since I didn&#39;t have to pay for an extra side of rice. It is also one of my favorite places to get Hot and Sour soup.

When I placed the order the man on the phone said he preferred cash or checks over credit cards which should  have alerted me that the owner of the restaurant must be cheap to not want to pay 3% for  his customers using credit card. But, we decided to take a chance and placed a $45 order. We ordered sesame chicken and two different orders of lo mein. I would say the food was a 3 at best although my husband is claiming his was a solid 2. It was bland and there were no vegetables insight in my lo mein  or the fried rice which leads me to think that they are very cheap and cutting a lot of corners. Also the sesame chicken was terrible! It tasted as if it had previously been frozen and just reheated from something you would buy at Costco. In fact Costco brand would have probably been better. We also tried the eggrolls and the fried crab cheese wonton. The egg rolls were absolutely soaked with the grease and the inside tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for weeks. The crab cheese wonton had zero crab and the cheese was very minimal and seem to be dried out. Needless to say about $38 of our food went in the trash. I would not recommend this place to anyone.   Not sure what has happened to all of the areas restaurants?"

But, today we were headed to the restaurant right next door to this place and I saw something that insures I will never eat here again.
The man who works inside East Dynasty was standing in front of the restaurant when we pulled up. I watched while he pinched one nostril closed with a finger while he blew snot out of the other nostril onto the rock pillar. Then he proceeded to do the same with the other nostril as his snot flew through the air.
When he was finished he wiped his hand across his very wet nose. So much mucus that I could actually see it stretching between his face and his hand. He wiped his hand on his pants and took out a tissue to blow his nose.
He stuck the tissue into his pocket and then went inside the restaurant.
YUCK!! I have eaten there.
Never ever again."

My favorite is the orange chicken though I have yet to clear my plate in one sitting. Not required or expected but they have always given a treat to our kids when dining in. The quality and quantity of food is enough you should give it a try if you haven&#39;t already. But personal attention and care really puts them ahead of the rest.

Hunan chicken is my favorite (with straw mushrooms, broccoli and black bean sauce).  The Yushan Eggplant is also very good.  Wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Happy Family.  Mongolian Beef is so so.

Pepper Asian Bistro is my new favorite place for Chinese food.  It&#39;s convenient for takeout and delivers quick and delicious food every time.

My consistent ordering allows me to say with certainty that the sesame chicken and spring rolls are top quality and have excellent flavor.  Easily one of the best versions of sesame chicken in Denver.  I&#39;m a sucker for good spring rolls and order them every time, their peanut dipping sauce is thick and creamy and a perfect accompaniment to the spring roll.  I&#39;ve also tried both their shrimp Singapore noodles and their shrimp lo mein and have been impressed with the volume of plump shrimp served with both - outstanding value.  On a recent occasion I tried the pepper beef and was impressed with the savory flavor - I think the beef dishes may be a new favorite for me. 

I&#39;m purely a takeout customer and Pepper Asian Bistro delivers excellent quality Chinese food when I&#39;m in the mood.  It&#39;s a great local choice for Chinese food and I can attest to the above average value."

Their curries, however, are outstanding. Perfectly spiced with a good portion of veggies. My favorite is the green curry, although the Panang is good too. As far as apps go, I like the cream cheese wontons.  Pretty standard but tasty.  I find the satay chicken to be a bit dry, as are the Vietnamese spring rolls.

Been floundering for awhile trying to find a good Asian place, and this one has officially won our hearts. We always order along the same lines regardless of the restaurant- Hot and Sour Soup, Orange Chicken, and Chicken Pad Thai, so I feel like it&#39;s easier to compare restaurants when you always get the same things. Out of all the comparing, this was simply the best.

Most restaurants ask you spice level when you order Hot and Sour Soup and certain entrees, but it pretty much tastes the same so I just click &#34;medium&#34; or some variation of it. Here, I chose &#34;spicy&#34; for both the Orange Chicken and the Hot and Sour Soup, and guess what? IT HAD A KICK TO IT. Delicious, the perfect level of medium spice. If you&#39;re a spicy foods lover I would recommend ordering your food &#34;Thai Hot&#34; as I&#39;m imagining that to be tongue burning! The spice made the Hot and Sour Soup and Orange Chicken next level, the best I&#39;ve gotten from any restaurant hands down. The Pad Thai had excellent flavor and toppings, with plenty of chopped peanuts to add texture.

The woman who delivered came to our door (never happens in an apartment building), and was really friendly. Food arrived on time, and just highly exceeded our expectations. Again, this is the new spot. You have won my loyalty, it is just that delicious."

The best part was, it arrived in less than 20 minutes!!!! We ordered through GrubHub at 5:44, and at 6:08, the driver was downstairs!

I have been on a hunt for good wonton soup since we moved here, and this place did not disappoint (especially, since the last place I ordered it from... didn&#39;t have.... wontons?)  The container was PACKED with wontons and the meat inside was delicious, not all gristly and gross like it can be.

I also ordered the crab rangoons (cream cheese wontons....) lo mein and sweet and sour chicken which was very good, and the boy had the Katsu pork.  They use different noodles in the lo mein, more like rice noodles, but even ordering a side, the portion size lasted me for another couple of meals!

Overall, it&#39;s not the best food I&#39;ve ever had, but this is definitely a good stand by if you want good food and you want it fast!"

Moved here 6 months ago from Chicago and have had to put up with Chinese food mediocre, at best. Tried Peters, meh. Been a regular at Grand China that was ok, and was our regular go to just because we got fed up. Last night, worked late, got to Grand China 2 minutes after 9 and they refused a to-go order. And Denver why do all your restaurants close at 9?? 

Well back to the point, got on Yelp and saw this place stayed open until a whopping 10 so we drove over to give it a shot. The restaurant it&#39;s self is really nice inside. Great decor, super clean and a full bar. Friendly staff, so we made our to-go order. Got the Vietnamese Eggrolls, not what we were expecting but pleasantly surprised. But if your looking for a old fashion pork eggroll, it&#39;s not what you want. Missus got the General Tso&#39;s chicken. It was amazing, more meat than breading, great sauce (could use a little more heat) and believe it or not it could use a little less chicken and a bit more broccoli. I had the sesame chicken, same thing more meat then breading, still crunchy in an amazing sauce. And lastly we didn&#39;t get the, ugh we had Chinese stomach this morning!!

So I&#39;ve rambled on way too much but we will be back to eat in very soon. Keep up the great work Pepper!! You have a few new regulars now!"

I live in Northern California where Chinese food is quite different from what I got from Pepper Asian Bistro. But what should be a constant is service, and I find fault with PAB in this. 

We were staying close by and ordered takeout online from this restaurant. The order, including tax ran to about $60 and we paid by credit card.  We added a 10% tip to the charge. 

There is no way to tell when your order will be ready to actually pick up - the website just says to call the restaurant. They did not answer the phone, but we were within a three minute walk, so no bother. 

We went to get our food about 15 minutes after placing the order. I was asked to sign a credit card slip and noticed that there was a line for a tip on the cc receipt. Hmmmmm, I thought I already added a tip. I checked the order paperwork they handed me and sure enough, a $6 tip had been added to the $60 total. But somehow, the total charge was $68, not $66. I really don&#39;t care about $2, but right is right, and basic math is basic math. We got that straightened out after a few minutes and took our food home. 

We sat down to eat and immediately noticed that one dish was missing from the bag. We went back and they gave it to us, but certainly didn&#39;t apologize for the missing item. 

The food itself was OK. The spring rolls were meh. The fried rice was OK. The Mongolian Beef would be appropriately titled Mongolian Onion - seriously, it was about 85% onion and 15% beef. The best dish was the Kung Pow chicken. 

But the overall experience was disappointing - from the overall quality of the food to the missing item and inaccurate credit card charge. We&#39;re not going back anytime soon. I don&#39;t write a lot of negative reviews on Yelp. Mistakes happen and poor reviews can hurt honest businesses. Somehow, I don&#39;t feel too bad about submitting this one."

Quality is amazing, you are going to get good food no matter what. My personal favorites are: ALL the curries, chicken pad thai, and the sesame chicken.

I got the chicken pad Thai, crab cheese rangoons, and a Thai tea. I am left with mixed feelings.

First, the positives: the rice noodles in my pad Thai were cooked perfectly (not too squishy, perfectly al dente), they left out the bean sprouts as I requested, the Thai tea was excellent AND had the option online of subbing soy milk instead of dairy, delivery was friendly &amp; FAST (maybe 20-30 minutes), and everything was packaged very well.

Now the uncertainties (I&#39;m not sure if I just picked the wrong menu items for my personal palette or if my concerns are valid in context): Everything was very sweet, even the rangoons and the pad Thai. While I am not an Asian cuisine connoisseur, I have had this dish before from a street cart back home and loved it; here I felt that the Pad Thai should&#39;ve been much less sweet and a little more salty/limy/zesty, and they should&#39;ve cut the sugar in the crab cheese rangoons. However, as I said, maybe that&#39;s how the dishes are supposed to be made and I should just explore other menu choices, because aside from that matter the ingredients seemed to be of very high quality.

All things considered, I will definitely order from Pepper again, but I will probably choose a different menu item and see if that resolved my concern."

I order from eat24 which is the yelp sponsored online ordering app.  In my opinion, it&#39;s super hard to find decent Asian food in Denver in general, and as far as good Asian takeout goes, it is slim pickings!  I would recommend this place to anyone -- but especially those living in North Denver -- we live in the Cole neighborhood and a lot of places don&#39;t deliver north of MLK. 

My favorite dish is the sesame chicken because it comes with lots of veggies and it comes crispy with a great meat to breading ratio (not overly breaded).  I usually choose the fried rice vs white, which I really love!  The Vietnamese pork egg rolls are kick ass and so are all the extras that come with it.  I would also recommend the miso soup, panang curry with beef and the Mongolian beef which is onion heavy and really flavorful/spicy.  I have had the vegetable lo mein, which is decent but not my favorite lo mein because the noodle choice is not traditional. 

If you&#39;re looking for something authentic and not americanized this probably isn&#39;t your first choice. But it&#39;s a good option for good quality and affordable takeout with good portions.  Give it a shot, you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

-The sesame chicken had barely any chicken, was mostly breading and the chicken that was actually there was extremely dry. 
-chicken lo mein noodles were so overcooked that it had no texture nor flavor. 
-the flavors are way off and the quality of the ingredients is horrible. 
I hate writing a bad review but there was just nothing good about the food, in the end we weren&#39;t able to eat it and just tossed it in the garbage which I hate to do.

All of the ingredients are very fresh and the prices are reasonable.

I had the Panang Curry with chicken on my first visit for lunch. On the second visit for dinner, I had the Yashun Chicken.

Let me tell you that statement was completely false, it is almost exactly the opposite!  Every single bite I took was all breading and could barely taste the chicken.

I can&#39;t wait to try some other things on the menu. 

We did delivery and it was on time and the food was still hot. We used grub hub which made it fast and easy.

To our surprise, they didn&#39;t ask us how spicy we wanted the pad Thai (like most Thai restaurants do)...we didn&#39;t think anything of it till we got the dish and realized it was a bit too sweet and had no spice to it at all. The fried rice was good but nothing special. We were very disappointed with the Lo mein and potstickers...both were way too greasy. There was a pool of oil at the bottom of both dishes. Not a fan of this AT ALL. But...Service was fast even though they seemed very busy. Our food was ready in 15 minutes. Staff was friendly.

This is a pretty standard Chinese takeout place, but it did have a few things going for it that makes it stand out.

Mango shrimp was tasty with several shrimp and while I&#39;m pretty sure the mangos came out of a can, I was overall ok with the dish for what it was. Crab ragoons were not as good as I&#39;d hoped, most likely out of a frozen bag with thick breading, but the egg drop soup really picked up the slack. The standard fried rice that comes with the entrees is tasty and the beef dishes looked pretty good with lots of vegetables.

Every damn thing was freakin&#39; fantastic.  The sesame chicken was nice and spicy, and, best of all, totally lacking in that nasty, super sweet generic sesame chicken sauce I&#39;ve gotten so used to.  No, their sauce is unique, and while there is definitely a sweetness to it, it isn&#39;t cloying, and the spice is allowed to outshine it.  The chicken was definitely all white meat, and surprisingly tender.  Crisp, fresh green beans , carrot and broccoli were a nice companion to the chicken.  

The Tom Kha Gai is nice - I like the heat of it.  Plenty spicy, and, once again, the chicken in the soup was very tender.  My only complaint would be that I could have used a little more coconut milk in with the broth. A bit less creamy than I usually like.  And, I hate to be a nitpicker, but half of my soup was huge slices of onion.  No bueno.

The Vietnamese coffee was also awesome, and bigger than I expected it to be, pre-mixed and on ice, it wasn&#39;t even remotely watered down and I didn&#39;t see any grounds in it.  Tasty as hell.

Thank GOD, I finally found good, local Asian food!"

Customer service is supreme and has gotten to a personal level between us and our server. She may not know that it&#39;s personal, but I believe she knows every move we make and she kills it. We always start with a soup, I usually start with the egg drop and my liege, a coconut chicken soup. Both soups are delicious along with any other soup they offer on their menu. For an entree, I order the general tso&#39;s chicken, a sweet and spicy zing over a crispy crusted chicken, it&#39;s dynamite.

Came to Pepper&#39;s based on a friend&#39;s recommendation. I called for a take out order and picked it up within 10 mins. The crispy spring rolls were blah, I think they are store bought (boo). And the fried was with chicken was good, nothing to write home about.

I made a reservation for a Wednesday night, it was probably not necessary but not a bad idea for a weekend night. Our server was on the quite side but very attentive. I started with a beer flight of their 5 staple beers (Pilsner, IPA, stout, jalapeño and DIPA). All of them were fantastic minus the IPA which was just okay. They had other beers on the menu which were seasonal so I tried their 8th anniversary -chonolungma which was a very strong beer with a sweet flavor that I enjoyed a lot. 

The food was excellent as well. Naan was superb as was the samosa chat. For our entrees we had the chicken masala and vindaloo with lamb. Both had excellent curry sauces with perfectly cooked and seasoned proteins.

It&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had in Colorado. The flavor is robust and the milky texture just tops it off.

We ordered the momos , noodles, paneer masala, chole , garlic naan, and daal (they list it as soup). The monks and chole were great. North Indian food was excellent and not oily (many restaurants are very oily). The noodles were a bit too indian-y for my taste, but they accomplished what was supposed to be accomplished. The paneer masala was a bit spicy, but delicious (we got mild). 

Why the 4 star instead of the 5 star? -- 
I&#39;m from a city with a lot of Indian restaurant and diversity. Our waiter barely looked us in the eye even when we were complimenting the food. We watched him with the other customers. He smiled, entertained conversations, etc... It almost made it seem as if he treats Indian folk in a lesser manner than others. Hopefully, he was just tired."

They possess what I call the trifecta that I am always searching for. Great food. Reasonable price. Attentive staff.

They have one of the best all you can eat buffet. About $10 for lunch and about $14 for dinner. The spread was loaded with some of the dishes that one would see in an a la carte menu. Don&#39;t forget. A regular naan is included with your all you can eat price.

So I had most of their spread and I can tell you they all taste excellent! I dare not mention one dish and play favorites! They are all so well seasoned. Go check it out!

It&#39;s also a brewery, but I did not indulge due to the Saturday night hangover that was slowly approaching haha. I&#39;ll have to come back to try their beers.

Samosa - beautifully crispy exterior with a hearty and well-spiced filling. 

Chicken tikka masala - very rich flavor, not too creamy which was nice. Lots of pieces of juicy chicken breast. 

Daal soup - gorgeous flavor, hint of smokiness. 

Alu gobi - very nicely spiced, delicious. 

Mango lassi - perfect drink to soothe the palate! You can taste the thick yogurt and sweet, ripe mango flavor very clearly.

Three friend and I went for a lunch that was highly admired by one of the friends.  Expectations were met with 4-5 different items that were as good as any I&#39;ve had anywhere else, and a couple good dessert items as well.  While not very spicy, it is flavorful.  

They brew their own beers as well.  I sipped one and it would&#39;ve been a good idea to get one.

I&#39;ll be back for sure, and can easily see pushing five stars."

I love that this restaurant is in an old house with a European feel - not what you&#39;d expect for an Indian restaurant! Everyone was very attentive and friendly. Lots if vegetarian options on the buffet, and I really like that they can make so many items vegan upon request (though the buffet is not vegan). Also surprised to find out they brew their own beer!

The food was delectable. The only thing I wish I had known prior to ordering was how large the portions were. While it was an excellent bargain, this out of towner didn&#39;t need leftovers. One entree was definitely enough for two hearty eaters to share. I would love to try every dish on the menu."

Took a good 15 minutes to bring us our drinks, didn&#39;t ask how our food tasted, didn&#39;t ask if we wanted any dessert and we had to request to go boxes.  Had to request a bag as well.

I do not give this title lightly, I have been to many Indian restaurants... even some overseas. Every curry was made as if an Angel from heaven kissed each one before being set off to its table. My husband and I love spicy food. As in &#34;sweating like hell, needing water between every other bite, load on the peppers&#34; spicy. This restaurant delivered. For those of you who cannot handle the  level 6 &#34;Indian spicy&#34; they will make your meal at whatever level you&#39;re most comfortable with. They have the most amazing raita, filled with veggies. Their garlic naan is covered in fresh garlic and is at the perfect crispness/softness. They also have some wonderful beers-especially the IPAs.

The brewery inside of this restaurant also features some great beers - some of them GABF winners. Really hard to go wrong just picking at random from the beer list too. 

Yak and Yeti is in a beautiful old Victorian house, which I think makes it a really unique place for bringing family and friends. The Christmas buffet is also very nice if you&#39;re looking for a non-traditional activity for the holiday."

After driving by this place for years and being starved we decided to check it out - 
We were the only ones there  that we could tell - it was  about 3ish and were sat in the main dining area...I ordered the chai ! It was very good - I ordered saag paneer and cheese naan - I&#39;m a veggie so no meat for me! It was good and came out pretty fast ....
I like the idea of it being a restored mansion..I remember before it was restored and has always wondered what the inside looked like - I guess they brew beer inside as well - thought that was kinda cool!! So the mystery is over !! I have finally been to Yak and Yeti - if your looking for Indian cuisine check it out ....
I even ate the left overs for dinner - and it was still good ... I&#39;ll be back when I&#39;m in the mood for Indian -

Boy, were we disappointed. To be clear, the food was fine, no complaints, although the service was poor. The quality, flavor, and portions were simply very inferior to other Indian restaurants in Denver. The Shrimp Vindaloo was a bit bland and had almost no heat at all. The Vegetable Biryani was equally average in flavor. How do you under-season Indian? Maybe we need to try something uniquely Nepalese next time, if we go back. Until then, we&#39;ll be driving over 20 minutes (as opposed to 5 for Yak and Yeti) for our old favorites."

Kal (the host manager) is also a great guy and always treats us like friends and not just customers. My current favs for eats are the veggie pakora, tandoori wings, and cheese jalapeño naan as snacks or part of our meal. I&#39;m still partial to the saag paneer and the wife is a chicken masala kinda gal. For beers it&#39;s usually the West Coast Glutton IIPA (not just because I am the latter and wish I could spend more time in the former but because it&#39;s a damn good beer and one of Adam&#39;s best brews as far as I&#39;m concerned) but sometimes I have a thirst only a &#34;regular&#39;s&#34; Himalayan IPA will fill."

The buffet was while not huge was bigger or at the very least on par with other Indian buffets in other local restaurants.
The curries were all very good especially the Lamb Masala, but ultimately all of them were flavorful and well executed. The naan bread was also up to the standards of any good Indian restaurant.

I had Yak and Yeti bookmarked forever, and it took a lot of convincing to get my boyfriend to come along. &#34;But they have BEEEEER!&#34; 

The restaurant itself is super cute, the menu has a great selection and I love that they brew their own beer. There is character out the wazoo. We were seated upstairs next to a built in bookshelf that was filled with interesting books, and we enjoyed flipping through them while we waited for our food. 

Our server wasn&#39;t particularly enthusiastic. He took our order, he brought our food, he refilled our water, but there was no more chat than what was absolutely required in order for him to do his job. This wouldn&#39;t ordinarily be an issue, but we wanted to order dessert, and instead of asking if we&#39;d like anything else, he just stopped by, dropped the check on the table and walked away without a word. 

My food itself was a huge disappointment. My tandoori lamb was way, way, way overcooked. In the time it took everybody else to finish their food, I think I got through a quarter of my plate because it took me so long to chew it. The flavor was great, and my boyfriend was happy with his biryani, but a few days later I had lamb at an Indian restaurant in Austin, and it was leaps and bounds better with excellent flavor, and melt-in-your-mouth tender meat. 

Will I be back? Perhaps, but I&#39;m more likely to keep trying other Indian restaurants in the area instead in hope of finding something better."

The best being the french fries which are very reasonably priced and the chicken wings were absolutely fantastic. They have their own brewery, the jalapeño beer was a hit. It was nice that they did not have a minimum for a party.

a few of the other restaurants that we contacted wanted A minimum that was three times the amount of what we paid for this place.  The service was just about perfect. At times it was a little slow on water refills but I can honestly say the ordering and speed the food came out with was just about right.

The Glorious.
- Although it 3 locations, it&#39;s based in CO and locally owned - locavores rejoice!
- Y&amp;Y&#39;s motto is &#34;Atithi Devo Bhava,&#34; in Sanskrit meaning &#34;our guest is our God&#34; and we felt the attentiveness from the staff.
- If you want authentic Indian and Nepalese food, this is the best in Denver 
- Their vegetarian menu is really top notch and isn&#39;t just there for show or appeasement - they actually delivered in a very delicious, veg-friendly, &amp; high quality manner.
- The restaurant is a converted yellow house with old stairs, traditional decor, beautiful wood floors and interesting seating nestled in all the little nooks and rooms on 2 levels.
- Y&amp;Y&#39;s Malai Kofta is AMAZING. Probably my main reason for going.
- The inner atmosphere is great for friends, dates and in our case a yummy double date!
- Our friends really enjoyed their house brewed IPAs

No real critiques. The pricing is higher than a more basic American restaurant, but it is comparable with other Indian eateries. We will likely be back soon."

I normally have a great experience here but last night was a disaster. The two stars are for the food and beer being delicious. The three missing stars were for everything else.

I&#39;ve only been for the lunch buffets when I worked nearby, and they were always great. As for dinner on a Thursday night at 7:45, not so much.

Three of us walked in and were seated upstairs. Upon being seated, the server immediately asked if we were ready to order. We hadn&#39;t looked at the menu. Instead, we ordered some beers. They took about 20 minutes to arrive, in which we placed our order. From there, it was over an hour until we received it. We didn&#39;t leave the restaurant until 9:30. We couldn&#39;t tell if the food was actually as delicious as we thought or if it was that we were so damn hungry, but it was tasty.

The bizarre part was the waitstaff. They were running up and down the stairs, dropping bussing tubs, throwing dishes into what was their back room area where they were congregating and shouting so loud. It was just this wild experience that I&#39;m normally on board for if the service is good, but not ONCE did someone stop by to refill our waters/apologize for the long wait/give us beer refills, nothing. They just sat and screamed and danced and threw dishes. Really unpleasant to listen to so loudly.We postulated whether or not they were super drunk, it was that bad.

At the end, a manager came up and apologized for the lateness of our food, but nothing was taken off our order. It ended up being $60 for 3 beers, one appetizer, and 3 entrees. Not a great experience overall. Unless I&#39;m invited for the buffet during the week when the food&#39;s already there, I probably won&#39;t go back. Sad."

Quite liked their beers - some of which with Indian accents like their chai milk stout - as well as their huge portions and authentically painfully hot spices (if you ask for it, of course). The lunch buffet is a little small but quite good. Staff are always pleasant and attentive, although sometimes overburdened when the house is full. Did I not mention it&#39;s a house?

Ate at the bar last night and found exactly what other reviewers had been raving about: Engaging Service, Unique and Tasty craft beers (watch out for Lana...she&#39;s a hot one!), really good Indian food, all for decent prices.

The bartender was conversational, but not over the top, and attentive to needs of everyone. Loved the 5 4oz samples for $8; it was the perfect way to choose what beer I was going to have with my meal. The naan was excellent; I got the garlic with a side of green chutney. And lastly, the Tandoori Chicken Wings were excellent; I got it with a cucumber &amp; yogurt dipping sauce, that was great with the wings, accompanying veggies, and even the naan.

Definitely worth a trip!"

We are also highly addicted to spicy food, so naturally we had to try Yak and Yeti while we were in Denver. We appreciate an Indian restaurant that serves up very spicy curries (we like to sweat from the heat) while maintaining levels of flavor from all of the amazing Indian spices and herbs. Yak and Yeti excels at this. 

We ordered a chicken Vindaloo (level 6 Indian spicy) and a chicken Saag (also level 6). In addition, we ordered garlic naan and raita for dipping. 
Vindaloo was my first curry, so I am always wanting to try a new Vindaloo whenever possible. Yak and Yeti serves Vindaloo up perfectly with a generous portion of tender pieces of chicken and potatoes in a delicious broth based curry sauce with onions and chilis. Each bite had layers of flavor while maintaining a heat on the lips that is familiar to any fan of a good Vindaloo. *Also, as a note, I appreciated they refrain from using red food dye in their Vindaloo. Some restaurants add this to give the curry a more &#34;fiery&#34; appearance.*

My wife is to Saag as I am to Vindaloo... So naturally we had to get Yak and Yeti&#39;s chicken Saag. Sometimes Saag can be greasy when made spicy, but not here. Each bite was full of creamy Saag goodness and an underlying cheese flavor not present in all Saag dishes, but very welcome here. The chicken, again, was cooked to perfection. The spice level was just perfect for us and the flavor was present even with all the heat. 

The garlic naan was delicious as well. Not too thin, not too thick; soft, yet crunchy in all the right places; and it was covered in real garlic pieces, not just garlic seasoning. AMAZING bread. The raita was a perfect accompaniment for the spicy food and the bread, however it is not on the menu so you have to ask for it. 

I also had a Yak and Yeti IPA which was memorable, but not as life changing  as some of the other Colorado-brewed IPAs I have had. 
My wife enjoyed a glass of Merlot and she&#39;s still around today so I guess it wasn&#39;t poisoned. 
The restaurant is in an old Victorian era home, which makes it one of the coolest Indian restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to. 
Also, the food&#39;s spice level is customizable to your taste. This is great if you aren&#39;t as heat friendly as my wife and I. 
All in all, we will be back to Yak and Yeti when we return to Denver for sure. This was one of the best Indian meals I&#39;ve ever had, and I will be dreaming about it when we go back to Pensuckola."

It can get busy but if your worried about time there is always the buffet. We normally share two entries with three people and get an order of naan. Which still leaves us with leftovers for the next day. There Chai tea is amazing. The regular is better than the decaf, but if you don&#39;t normally have a lot of caffeine during dinner time the decaf is a good option. This is a great place to come if you or someone in your group is vegetarian or even vegan because they have so many yummy options. They also do a variety of spiciness so if you don&#39;t like spicy food don&#39;t worry they have mild. I highly recommend to anyone."

I felt like I was in an old Mid Western Colorado country house. We were seated upstairs and for lunch you have the option of ordering a la carte or doing the lunch buffet. We opted for the $15 lunch buffet which is a better deal compared to appetizer/ entree prices.

Drinks:
Hot chai - a little more sweet than spicy, reminded me of Boulder in a good way
Mango lassi - thick and yogurt-y, would want to try the rose lassi next 
Beer - they brew their own and they have a unique variety including ciders. I would definitely recommend anyone who enjoys beer to come here and try their selection. 

Everything at the buffet was pretty solid. I can&#39;t speak for the authenticity but I liked most of what I ate and I have a more American- Indian taste. My favorites from the buffet were the chicken tikka and sweet potato masala with white and yellow rice mixed. There was fresh salad and fresh fruit with lots of chutney and side sauces available. Beware the hot sauce is SUPER SPICY. They offered two soups but I didn&#39;t try any.

It was kind of awkward sitting upstairs and having to walk up and downstairs for the buffet food but I guess it burns calories haha. Naan is served to your table and the service was friendly and quick.

Again, it felt kind of weird eating Indian food inside what felt like an old Colorado ranch house to me but the food and drinks were good, so why not? Didn&#39;t see any yaks or yetis but it still made for a unique Colorado Indian food experience."

Unique and flavorful food.  Award winning brewery with a unique range of beers.  Nothing better than a strong IPA paired with the robust flavors of Indian food.  Chai and tea&#39;s are also served. They&#39;ve also got a vegan chai which was an added bonus. 

The food is a mix of Nepalese and traditional British/Indian. Portions are large and we typically end up with leftovers to take.  Lamb Vindaloo is flavorful and has a ton of lamb in it. Someone earlier complained about it being overcooked, I didn&#39;t find it to be.  Chicken Tikka masala has perfect creaminess and flavor, the rice Biryani is flavorful.  Tandoori wings are awesome, the appetizer is huge, a meal in itself. We also like the samosas and garlic-naan.

There is also a buffet option.The buffet is well stocked, clean and continually refreshed. Ordering from the buffet it will be medium heat, you can customize off the main menu if you prefer a spicier variant.  I love spicy food and found the buffet to be just about right.  

Service at both the bar and restaurant is pretty good. I&#39;ve had times where I&#39;ve waited a bit long for my check to arrive, and my water glass has gone down to ice a couple times, but better that, than being rushed through.  It does get crowded on weekend evenings, but not unmanageable. The building itself is oldest Victorian house in Arvada, which adds to the vibe. There is a small outdoor patio that is nice in the summer. Prices are average. Overall, one of our favorite restaurants in town."

I skipped the buffet and opted for some menu items, as personally I never feel like you are going to get a good gauge of quality Indian food from a buffet. We ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and Saag Paneer and both were good. The Naan was excellent! I sampled a few beers, but ended up settling with the Sherpa Porter. It was smooth and chocolatey and perfect for the cold weather!

The lunch buffets are offered Saturdays and Sundays, as eell as weekdays at some locations, and are very vegetarian friendly. They are exceptionally mild, but indian buffets usually are to accommodate a range of heat tolerance. It&#39;s a great place to go to try a wide range of dishes, and see what you like best.

Enter: Yak and Yeti.  We&#39;ve been aching to try it and finally got off our duffs and headed north.  It&#39;s very small inside but not cramped.  We grabbed a spot at the bar and ordered some beer.  We tried a flight and of these we loved the Jalapeno Lena, the Chai Milk Stout, and the Himalayan IPA the best.  

They offer a very inexpensive buffet but we opted to order off the main menu.  Chicken masala and lamb vindaloo were our choices, and while vindaloo is my go-to Indian dish, we really loved the masala.  In fact, it was one of the best we remember having.  You can choose between mild and &#34;indian&#34; hot.  Not wanting to break the love of my life we agreed to go in between on the heat.

I&#39;ve always felt that beer is a better compliment to both Indian cuisine and spicy food than wine, and I&#39;m glad to see someone else picked up on this.  We are hearing rumors that they will be opening one out near our place in Aurora, and if this is true we shall be happy, as they have good beers and great food and the two combined makes for an original and delicious combination."

I love the fact that they turned this home unto a restaurant AND use some space for brewing beer. Overall, the space has charm and character. It&#39;s not exactly the kind of cozy I&#39;d like in my own home, but it works well here. 

They have a good list of beers to choose from, and what piqued my interest was the chai milk stout. It was actually really tasty, and reminded me of chai tea without being overly sweet. The lactose in the beer also made it extra creamy (without being heavy). GREAT complement to my food. 

We opted to do the buffet for $14 and some change per person. The menu looked pretty darn good, but the buffet at that price for dinner was hard to pass up. I thought it was a good opportunity to try a bit of everything (and they have a pretty darn good selection). I tried the saag, veggie korma, chickien tikka, lamb curry, and shrimp vindaloo. Oh and the tandoori chicken was one of my favorites- flavorful and smoky. The rest was just ok. We decided to try garlic naan in place of the plain old stuff, and that was definitely a good decision- it was great naan and garlickity-licious! 

The service as a whole was wonderful. Server and the hostess were fantastic.

He&#39;s English and wanted to think that England had a monopoly on delicious Indian food, but the first time he ate at Yak and Yeti, he realized that the USA dominates, once again. 

USA! USA!

Anyway, going to Yak and Yeti can be a frustrating experience. It seems to always be packed, the wait is always ridiculous, parking is a nightmare, and the staff is always very friendly but VERY VERY VERY slow. By the time I get my food, I&#39;m always furious. And then I eat the food and I forget how angry I was. That&#39;s how great it is.  

And that is why we usually get take out from here. No frustration, quick, and you can eat on the floor of your living room while watching TV. Or at a dining room table with no TV if you like to be fancy. 

If you do go, just know that you&#39;ll probably end up frustrated with the service, but feel comforted by the fact that the food is totally (almost totally) worth it.

Upon first glance, I noticed the nachos come loaded with plenty of cheese. Unfortunately, the cheese wasn&#39;t my preference, and it resembled Velveeta, stadium style nacho mystery goo more than it did real, fresh melted cheese. 

The chips were delicious individually. However, they are on the thin side, which mixed with the abundance of cheese quickly led to several soggy bites. 

The chicken was definitely the highlight of the nachos. It was tender with great seasoning, and this flash of brilliance convinced me I need to come back and give their tacos, burritos, and meat plates a try. 

I&#39;m being critical, but overall the nachos were good but could be improved. 

Atmosphere is new, clean, and fast casual. No wait staff here... order at the counter and wait for them to call your name."

I would go two to three times a week. The last    few times I went I was very disappointed. I always order the #5 with xtra bacon and xtra cheese. But lately all I have been getting is a burrito with very little bacon, eggs and cheese and a HUGE portion of potatoes. I like potatoes but I didn&#39;t order a potato burrito. And there is hardly any green chili. If I pay for xtra give me what I pay for. Today was my last day going there. Bought 6 burritos for the family and have enough potatoes to last two weeks. I really miss when they were Ricco&#39;s burritos. Seems quality is no longer necessary."

The food was delicious. I would order everything we had today again. 

The alcohol seemed to be popular here, there were a few tables getting second rounds of the margarita when we came in and a few more came in to order in the time we were there eating. It was around the dinner hour however. 

The woman behind the counter was working hard to make sure everyone was taken care of the entire time we were there, her work ethic was refreshing to see.

For the most part everything was clean, but the floor in front of the soda machine was quite sticky. 

Since we are in our food came on paper plates, one was a solid thick plate, but the other was the thin and flimsy type that you have to be careful while holding. Just thought that was an interesting choice. 

All in all, solid four stars. It was delicious and the prices were decent. I would definitely go back."

Overpriced
Tasteless

It was not a giant, over-filled with rice monstrosity of a mess but a nicely filled tasty mix of flavors. The young man that took my order talked me out of the fuego &#34;hottest&#34; sauce on my meal and I am glad. The basic &#39;hot&#39; was good enough to give a slow burn and still be enjoyable. Many places&#39; hot tends to be what I would call mild but it was not so here. 

I also love the fact that the chips are fried on the spot; not a 10 lb bag of tortilla chips that are stale because they have been in a warmer for hours. 

Good value and flavors IMHO."

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito which was about half the size and 1/5 the flavor of a Taco Bell burrito, yet it cost about 5 times the price. It was a small store-bought quality tortilla with a sloppy spoonful of soupy refried beans. It didn&#39;t even stay together to eat with my hands. The side was a pathetically small amount of bland over-cooked rice and another slop of beans. Thank goodness I at least got it to go, because the sit down area looked dirty and sad.

It was almost all breading on the inside... and just weirdly wet. 

It would be slightly overpriced EVEN if it was better. But bad food at that price is crazy.

Sadly, every Mexican restaurant I find is just sub-par. This place is no different. I opted for the green chili because if there&#39;s anything Colorado does well, it&#39;s green chili. However, this chili was just bad. To start, I like spicy foods, but the medium was insane. The spiciness overpowers any possible flavor (if there was any flavor to start with). Also, whereas a lot of green chili I&#39;ve had in the past is chunky and filled with meat, chilis, and maybe other vegetables, this is just chilis and a thick...soup? Almost like they used a lot of corn starch to thicken it up (but also made it super bland). I also ordered sopapillas, which were just okay.

So overall, just okay. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back, except maybe for breakfast burritos (based on rave reviews here, maybe we&#39;ll give that a shot)."

Your basic counter service quick Mexican spot.  They have a variety of tacos, burritos, etc... on the menu.  They really like to add bacon to things - which is never a bad thing.  

I got your basic bean and beef burrito smothered.  I though the medium green chile was good and had a bit of heat (you have your choice between mild, medium and hot).  The ground beef wasn&#39;t seasoned so it was a little boring, but they pack it with beans and potatoes.  The ingredients tasted fresh and like I said I liked the green chile so that usually makes it or breaks it for me.

With the word &#34;grill&#34; in the title, I was expecting to see one, but I must have missed it.  I ordered two beef enchiladas with green chili and a soda, and sat at the counter.  The food came out quickly, but I was a little disappointed that it was presented on flimsy paper plates.  The enchiladas and green chili were delicious and came a la carte.  I would have liked beans and rice or some other side (chips), but didn&#39;t know it came that way.

I would love to see this place succeed, but I think they are going to have to be more interactive with the guests, and suggest/upsell items so that the guest has the best experience possible.  I wish them good luck!"

The first two times we went the service was excellent and the food was tasty.  The last two times our orders were butchered!! The smothered burritos were not smothered.  The side of chicharrones that were paid for, were no where in sight. They were stash with the chicharrones that did come in the chili cheese fries.  They mixed up the meats in the non- smothered smothered burritos and mis labeled the boxes causing two people to eat half of the wrong burrito.   We did not complain the first time but when we called in for the second messed up order, the lady on the phone said that the owner told her that we would get one free smothered burrito the next time that we ordered but that we just needed to bring it up the next time we called.  The girl told my co-worker her name but she could only remember that it started with a &#34;J&#34; but could not pronounce it let alone remember exactly what it was. 

Today, we called in to make four separate orders.  The girl who answered did not speak any English and so my co worker had to come find me to speak to her.  First of all, I do not have a problem with the fact that she could not speak English.  One of my problems is that she was the one designated to answer the phone even though there would be a large percentage of clients that she would not be able to communicate with.  How can you take the order from a paying customer who enjoys your business normally and not be able to take a simple order? 

When I proceeded to explain the situation to her in Spanish, she stated that she did not know what I was talking about.  I asked her to go and speak to her supervisor.  She stated she was the only one there with the cooks.  I then asked her to call her supervisor on the phone and that I would call back in 5 minutes.  When I called back she said that her supervisor told her that she could give us the &#34;smothered part&#34; for free on the &#34;smothered burrito&#34;.  

How is just giving the &#34;chili&#34; free on the burrito make up for the past situations.  This is not what was stated previously.  This restaurant has lost 8 customers that have consistently ordered for the past 5 weeks."

They offered hot medium and mild, another plus.. However it let me down, hot but no flavor. For twenty dollars we got two breakfast burritos smothered. They were really small. The potatoes are deep fried. Their sirloin steak was rubbery and not seasoned. Buyers remorse we should have went to Doug&#39;s day diner."

We&#39;ve had breakfast and lunch burritos, all excellent and decent size. A rather large menu that is rather overwhelming, so I&#39;ve been sticking with the tried and true, but will make an effort to try other stuff as well. Good flavor, quality-tasting ingredients and a very friendly staff. 

I like hot and spicy Mexican food, but the &#34;hot&#34; is even too much for me. And get your burritos smothered. You&#39;ll thank me.

One suggestion: Complementary chips and salsa would be a nice touch."

It was bland and overpriced. I usually get my fix at Sabor on Arapahoe, but was nearby waiting for the Sport Clips to open. The burrito here would be the mini at Sabor and would have set me back 3 bucks and some change. For what I paid here, I could have had the big burrito at Sabor: a burrito the size of a chunky baby with a really alarming fever--and it would have tasted like something. Such a shame since this location is so much more convenient to me."

The owner is often there himself (at least I think he&#39;s the owner) and is a very nice guy. 

This place is conveniently on my way to work so I stop by once in a while to grab a breakfast burrito. They are right off Parker and Chambers so it&#39;s a couple of minutes detour and if you call ahead (5 min will do just fine) they&#39;ll have the burrito ready and all packed for you by the time you stop by to pick it up.

Very quick service and reasonably priced for breakfast menu. Tastes great and very nice size.

The place itself is somewhat dark and can use a bit more decor, but I rarely actually stay to eat in these places - they are the best for take-outs. Can&#39;t really comment on dinner selection as I&#39;ve never tried it."

The combo option is a great deal. You can pick different combinations of tacos, soups, etc for your meal. I went with a dos xx battered fish taco and beef empanadas. It came with beans and rice. There was also a cheesy sauce that I used for the taco and dipping the empanadas. I thought all aspects of the meal was delicious. Not often do I see empanadas as an option on Mexican restaurant menus, so that was a lovely surprise.

We were both so disappointed. Then,  we ordered Ultimate Fajitas. Another huge disappointment.  The plate was half full of grilled squash with only a few onions and peppers as you&#39;d expect with Fajitas. It was served with garlic butter, which was weird. The shrimp didn&#39;t seem grilled at all,  while the squash was burnt on the bottom in places. But, worst of all, my entire plate was so greasy, heavily salted and especially peppered, it was inedible. Both chicken and steak were tough. I just got the impression that they were trying to cover up bad food with salt,  pepper and hoped I&#39;d dump that weird butter concoction over the top and call it good.

But that&#39;s about the only positive thing I can say. I ordered fish tacos. The fish was bland and non edible. It tasted like the fish had just recently gone bad. The beans and rice were completely bland. I think one of those premade frozen dinners at the grocery store would have tasted better.

Seriously, frozen and fried, greasy. Chicken tortilla Soup? Inedible as it was so salty. My daughter showed up and had a very expensive taco and regretted she didn&#39;t go to Del Taco as it is actually fresh. Drink menu: Bloody Mary was $8 and it was TINY!

The service is slow and the food is the quality of an el charrito frozen dinner.  The tostadas are on a 3 inch tortilla, what a joke. The fried avocado has 1/2 an avocado and the batter is 1/2 inch thick and hard as a rock.  Save your money and go to Del Taco across the street, same bad frozen food but at half the price.

The tables were decent but the seats and floor was filthy w food not to mention the large spider web streaming from the cieling to the wall and into the booth. I ordered the trio which was supposed to include a starter soup, fajitas and dessert. I got the fajitas. I waited and finally asked and they gave me the soup which was gross and not worth a dollar. Then they sent the bill.   So i went up and asked where my desert was (ice cream and brownie). By the time they brought it out to me the ice cream was melting and running on the plate. I tried to eat it anyway and discovered lettuce in my ice cream. The staff was busy conversing in the back. There were only 4 families in the restaurant and they looked fully staffed so the incompetence seemed undignified. I wont likely be returning by choice."

When my wife and I walked in there was no one at the host stand and we stood there for about 5 to 10 minutes before we were greeted.  When we were seated a very rude female server just dropped our chips and salsa on our table and then proceeded to argue with our male server.  She was at another table still saying degrading comments about the male server while he was trying to apologize for her behavior.  After that the experience was fine.

First of all I have been a bartender for six years before so I know the business and can be very understanding. We ate there today, my entire family. Our server was decent but made silly mistakes. That&#39;s neither here nor there! Took our order... 45 mins passed she wasn&#39;t seen very much. Had to ask constantly for refills and chips. When she came over I asked what was taking so long, she said &#34;sorry we are short staffed in the back it will Be out in no time!&#34; So another 20 mins or so passed by this time we asked for the manager. He came by very unprofessional and frantic and in a rush. Said sorry guys for the wait it will be out on the fly you won&#39;t be having a check today! And walked away, barely made eye contact! So ok we waited and our food came out cold and two orders wrong. I finally told the waitress this was so ridiculous to wait over an hour for food and it come out wrong that this wasn&#39;t necessarily her fault but this is sooooooooo ridiculous and her manager needs to do something. We waited another 20 min for them to correct the order. Come to find out our waitress left and we had a new one... This place is awful, you need more staff, a manager that can make the place look like nothing is going wrong! We don&#39;t care what your problems are we didn&#39;t come to listen to that we came to have a family meal and pay for good service and got nothing... Our food was free but I wouldn&#39;t have paid that much for it... We tipped the waitress a 20$ because unless she forgot to put our order in, it wasn&#39;t her fault...I have never been so dissatisfied  before!!

I ordered the Torta mexicana, something that I thought wouldn&#39;t take that long. Fifteen minutes later my food came. When I tried to take a bite of the sandwich, the filling just fell out because the bread was very hard, like it was left in the hot window for a long time. I couldn&#39;t even cut into it with a knife. So I sat back and ate the fries, waiting for the bartender to stop by to see how everything was. She never came, and the manager just stood at the end if the bar, looked at me, then walked away. Finally I got the attention of the next incoming bartender and he had the kitchen get me some fresh bread fairly quick.

Every OTB I have ever been in seems to have an expansive seating section and the Southlands one is no different.  I have never had to wait and I always get a booth - a plus in my book.  Some of my favorites include: the queso, the margaritas and the guacamole they make fresh at your table is always fun.  As for entrees, the Big Borderito, fajitas or build your own combos are always safe choices.  The food is consistent and quick to come out and the service seems to be relatively attentive.

I wasn&#39;t crazy about the chicken or the beef. The rice was a little dry but had good flavor and the re-fried beans were spectacular. My husband graded the fish tacos at a 3, there was too much cabbage and it needed something like a pineapple salsa to rate a 5. I won&#39;t comment on the corn dog or fries, they were nothing special. We also has the sopapillas for desert, which are another thing I am quite picky about. I didn&#39;t like the cinnamon and sugar caked on them. I would rate them a 2.  Our server was fantastic even when we were talking her ears off as she was holding a tray of dishes.

I like the decor and service here, despite the fact that it took our food forever to come out of the kitchen. Their chips and salsa is alright, the rice is more New Mexican style then traditional Mexican. The beans have a lot of flavor and are decent consistency. This place doesn&#39;t really stand out with any of their dishes, it is truly average Mexican food... not great, but not horrible. On a positive note, Mexican food can be really hit and miss when trying a new place so at least if you&#39;ve been here once or twice you know what you&#39;ll be getting. I am rating OTB so highly because of availability of healthy options, which most other restaurants, nay Mexican food restaurants... ever have. It&#39;s nice to have a place to go that gives you options and that is why I give OTB 4 stars. PS I noticed other reviewers calling this Tex Mex and that&#39;s what it&#39;s billed as, being a place that is run out of Dallas Texas... but I have to say that I&#39;ve spent a lot of time visiting and living in Texas and New Mexico and the food here lacks the kick to really be categorized as either.

We had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table which was to be expected on a Friday night for dinner. Had the create your combo x 2 again. This time shredded chicken enchilada with a house salad with mango vinaigrette. Everything was as good as always. The salad really surprised me. I expected a small plate of salad, but when it came out it was a good sized bowl with romaine and iceberg lettuce, pico and other usual salad fixings. I also tried the house margarita on the rocks with salt. Very strong drink but still tasted really good. My wife had the pick 3 combo, ground beef taco, spinach and mushroom enchilada and a chicken enchilada. She ate about half of it and saved the rest for another meal. 

The combo x 2 is $6.99, x3 is 8.99.  Most other meals range from $7-$16 or so.  The fajitas seem to be the most expensive.  The house margarita was under $5 so that was a pleasant surprise.

I was stuck in the middle of nowhere (which happens to be very near Southlands mall in Aurora) and unless I wanted to drive 20 minutes from the mall to town where I new there were two places I wanted to try I would have to choose.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Chipotle and eat there on occasion but this was dinner, not lunch so I opted for OTB.  I figured they had to have improved since my last time there over 8 years ago.  I figured wrong.  It was the same not so authentic &#34;tex mex&#34;.  They had tacos with onion rings on them!  In 3 flavors - pork, chicken and carne.  All you can eat enchiladas for 9 bucks, mmmm.  Horchata?  - no senior.  Cocktail camerones - nada on the menu.  The overpriced not so good margs were still there as were lots of people who look like they&#39;d ordered the tacos with onion rings on them.  Now I feel gross and remember why I haven&#39;t been there in 8 years.  Would someone please put me in your planner and yelp me in 2017 to keep me from doing this to myself again when I think &#34;heck, they&#39;ve probably improved...&#34;.   I promise I&#39;ll treat you to a good Mexican dinner."

The sesame chicken was mushy and tasted like fish and dirty oil.  The lo mein tasted burnt.  The eggrolls didn&#39;t taste like anything at all, except more dirty oil.  The hot and sour soup tasted overwhelmingly of vinegar.  Even the fortune cookies seemed to be stale.  

The delivery driver didn&#39;t have $5 for change, so we had to double our tip.  I think this was an honest mistake and he was very polite about it, but it still adds insult to injury to pay extra for food this bad.  We literally threw it away and made ramen."

Wans.. family owned since..  since eons ago and my recent visit confirmed they are still owned by the same family.

I had it to go of variety of dishes and 

pros: moo shu chicken, mapo tofu
cons: sesame chicken: over fried.  it was too dark and mushi instead of being crispy,  Neptune delight (seafood combo) had fish that tasted too earthy.

not much of choices around here and I should be happy for what is offered around here."

We have been here a couple of times and each time they&#39;ve had a good number of people waiting for their take out. The first time I had the beef noodle soup, so spicy, so delicious, the second time around I was looking some straight up comfort food so I got the sesame chicken. They have dinner combinations for $12-$13 and you get soup, two wontons and an egg roll. The egg roll was funkalicious (not in a good way) and everything else was wonderful! It&#39;s a nice little family restaurant that has been there for ages. This will definitely be my new take out place!

Their Sesame Chicken wasn&#39;t that bad and the egg roll wasn&#39;t bad either. The big disappointment was the Chicken with Broccoli. It just didn&#39;t have any flavor and looked as though it was served in whatever liquid it was boiled in (I put up a pic). The fried rice was typical of most places. The combination offerings are quite limited in comparison, which is unfortunate because it&#39;s a good amount of food for the price. Maybe we&#39;ll give them another chance in the future."

Usually I like to hit a place a few times to ensure my visit is consistent, if I was impressed.  Not this time!  How I have not heard of Wan&#39;s is beyond me.  The menu is insanely large and the food is delicious.  We had just flown back in town from TN.  Stopped here because I was craving Chinese! 

We ordered the chefs dinner $16/each and a serving of the cheese wantons $5.25 for 6.  
I had the hot and sour soup, egg roll, Hunan chicken, and pork fried rice.  The waitress was very honest when I inquired about what to select.  I LOVE that!  I was NOT disappointed.  I almost ate half of my food before I finally tapped out!  I was stuffed!  Everything was fantastic!  I had a whole extra half to take home and eat for lunch the next day!  Loved hearing all my co-workers complain about how good it smelled, angry I didn&#39;t bring enough for them!  When thinking about Wan&#39;s I can&#39;t help but think it is priced perfectly for the portions!

Tonight our order was placed at 5:30, we were told  to pick up in 20 minutes, seemed reasonable considering the 5:30 dinner hour. we showed up at 6 p.m., our order was not ready, I don&#39;t think it had been started considering how long we had to wait for it to get ready, and there was a whopping -one- person in their dining area that seats 114. Worth mentioning, she was also irritated waiting on her check to be brought to her.

Since I&#39;ve been here,  I&#39;ve eaten at almost all Chinese restaurants there are available to Coloradans,  from franchises to those hole-in-the-wall joints, from downtown establishments to the eateries in mountains.  Wan&#39;s by far is my most favorite restaurant!  

I&#39;ve tasted dishes on their menu and off their menu, and I have enjoyed them all. If you adventurous,  you can ask the proprietors to recommend you a vegetable, soup, or meat dish. I&#39;ve done that many times,  and they had not failed me once. .. always so delicious.

Don&#39;t be fooled by how empty it may look sometimes, they have a brisk business of take outs and deliveries.    I&#39;ve dined there at different parts of the day - when they had just opened in the day,  when my guests and I  were the last customers, or when I&#39;m just dropping in to collect my take outs - service is prompt and efficient, and always with a smile.  

When I have overseas or out of state friends visiting,  I like to bring them to Wan&#39;s because place looks good and I&#39;m sure my guests will be happy with the food. 

My personal favorite dishes are: eggplant with garlic sauce,  crispy duck,  beef noodle soup, walnut shrimps/prawns, 4 season stir fry long beans, etc. Just to name a few. I always try to order one of my favorites and a new dish to try.   I&#39;m looking forward to trying a few specific recommendations from other reviewers here. 

I will highly recommend people to try out Wan&#39;s restaurant."

A couple of week&#39;s ago the food I got food delivered (specifically the sesame chicken) was sub-par. It wasn&#39;t fried correctly, because the inside was still very mushy- the same with the free egg rolls- barely cooked/fried. And it took 1.15hrs to get it delivered. I took one bite and couldn&#39;t eat anymore! Usually their food is good, I LOVE Chinese food so I&#39;ve had several other places in the past, plus I am a culinary graduate so I know when food isn&#39;t cooked correctly. I called the next day during the lunch hours, the lady on the other end was RUDE! CURT! And basically told me I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about and would forward my info to management. 2 Days later I got a call back from Management..I was told the reason for the sub-par food was because I lived too far (almost outside their delivery area) and it was snowing that evening, and that it had nothing to do with how the food was prepared. TOOK NO RESPONSIBILITY NOR LISTENED TO WHAT THEIR CUSTOMER WAS TRYING TO TELL THEM. By the end of the call, I was done!, and she made it seem like a HUGE FAVOR to offer a % off my next meal.WOW
And onto my next and LAST experience ordering from them--I tried to order the same thing about 1.5 weeks later after the above experience. I got the same RUDE/CURT lady as before, she told me &#34;No discount on account, was told no discount&#34;..so i made a fuss until she called her manager, and when she came back on the line she told me &#34;Ok what u want to order&#34;, after I told her she told me &#34;Will take 1.5 hours to deliver, we busy, we can&#39;t get there sooner&#34;..WOW JUST F*EAKING WOW!! DONE FINISHED FINITO!!!! I said you know what that&#39;s fine, I DONT WANT TO ORDER!!!!!

So You want the true Asian Food experience wrapped up with a RUDE ASIAN &#34;B&#34; Fresh off the boat!--Go eat there, and tell them I gave them this crappy review- BC THEY DESERVE IT

BTW- 1st time EVER putting a review up on Yelp- Cause Im that pissed!

Eating here made me feel like I&#39;d just been tossed around more than a cigarette at a biker rally and my stomach felt like it&#39;d been used for Floyd Mayweather&#39;s punching bag. 

This is not someplace you take someone you want to impress, unless they&#39;re a blind, deaf, mute with profound narcolepsy. The decor is Chinese restaurant cheap, old generic pictures on the wall, peeling wallpaper, a bathroom that smells like a construction worker&#39;s armpit. If you look in the kitchen, you more often than not see no one there (at least not ever visible). The music is piped-in dental office hypnosis-trance generic garbage. (Why is it most ethnic restaurants refuse to play music representing their culture or heritage? It makes you wonder if they think every Westerner wants to hear dental office muzak everywhere they go, constantly.) Our glasses had spots on &#39;em, the plates looked grimy, and the food made me feel like Ramen noodles from Wal-Mart was somehow living it up. 

My dear wife and I have been at this location several times, and it&#39;s not out of a special fondness for the place, either; but for the fact that the only decent Chinese food we&#39;ve yet been able to find in Denver or Auora is at PF Chang&#39;s (which requires half a month&#39;s rent just to clear a few appetizers). 

The food took close to half an hour to come out and when I tasted my order of steamed dumplings (which, let&#39;s be honest, is not a difficult dish to compose and cook - I mean you steam it), it tasted like something that had slid out of a donkey&#39;s backside and nearly had me doubled-over, chewing the crunchy mystery meat inside them, trying to summon the willpower to get it down. 

Then I dropped one of the pre-packaged generic fortune cookies on the floor, and it actually shattered into a million pieces like it was made of glass. Somehow, I don&#39;t think fortune cookies are supposed to shatter when they hit the floor. 

Yeah, I know, it&#39;s the Denver/Aurora border, what do you expect, but we had hopes and have since given up on Chinese food (at least in this part of town). Its&#39; back to HMart and cooking their freeze-dried pabulum when we want Chinese, or until we discover someplace decent downtown perhaps. 

I can still taste those dumplings when I close my eyes."

The sesame chicken is to die for and most other menu options are nearly as good making it hard to pick what to have each time I go in. Awesome staff as well!!

They also deliver!!  The food is EXCELLENT! Delivery is fast, but service tends to be slow if you eat in the restaurant (worth the wait because it&#39;s SO GOOD!) I love the jasmine tea, cashew chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice, and egg rolls. The egg rolls seem to be made with fresh, crispy ingredients and they are not like your typical egg rolls. The crab rangoon (cheese wontons I think they call them) are good but need a tiny more filling in them. I can&#39;t remember the name of them, but I think it&#39;s pot stickers... Anyway they are VERY good too! The staff is always very friendly and the decor is nice."

I ordered Mongolian Beef and what showed up was some kind of meat covered in a flour substitute. (Gluten free) which was tough and taste free. Just a few cut scallions and snow peas and that was it. I couldn&#39;t even eat it. So this is the last time I order from this place.

All of you east coasters and midwesterners know what I&#39;m talking about. Fried rice should be eaten as a meal, not a side as far as I&#39;m concerned and I&#39;ve not been able to find good rice this side of Missouri, even living in SoCal. I always get the shrimp fried rice and its excellent. Done to perfection. Not crazy about the chicken. The eggrolls are hot and have good and they have a really good texture. I got steamed dumplings last time and there was something left to be desired so I definitely don&#39;t recommend them from here. Also, they have duck sauce. DUCK SAUCE! I am a bit disappointed in it because its not as good as it could be (granted they are little packets of the stuff-being from Missouri its like gold but theirs isn&#39;t very  good). I&#39;ve not had the other dishes because I&#39;m so in love with the fried rice there; maybe one day I&#39;ll try something different but for now I go there to get my rice fix. mmmmm!

Also, the staff is super friendly, especially the young woman who usually works the front counter. I love going for lunch, although I usually get take out because I have a very active 5 month old who can&#39;t sit still long enough for me to eat. Anyway, go eat there. You probably won&#39;t be sorry."

When guy delivered I received NO utensils whatsoever. And where I am there&#39;s Nooo utensils so the delivery guy had to go back and pick up utensils for me and bring them back. That sucked because I had to eat vegetable rolls until he returned. By the way the veggie rolls were delicious. Sorry I forgot to take pic because I ate them.. lol the basil chicken wasn&#39;t bad. Not that flavorful tho. I added lots of soy sauce and could&#39;ve used more but only had 2!  The miso soup was good. Everything wasn&#39;t worth the $20.00 that I paid but it&#39;s late so whatever.

Just when i was giving up on Colorado on their Chinese restaurants.  This place is t-errific. Close to the house, decently priced and full of flavor. I have not ordered alot of stuff here. But what i have ordered has been fantastic. Pork egg rolls, yum. They are very generous with their sweet n sour sauce. Egg Drop soup ..soothes my soul and their hearty Hot n sour soup. You know its a great chinese restaurant when they can per-fect hot n sour soup.  I have also had their vegetables with tofu. 

The staff is very friendly.  I have not eaten there, i have always taken it to go.  Its not a formal dining area just some chairs and tables..but because its been chilly i cant eat food when cold air comes rushin in from the front opening.  Come here and enjoy the food. You wont be disappointed."

I ordered sesame chicken, pepper steak, and shrimp fried rice. The seasame chicken made me think I was eating nickeloden slime by the consistency of the sauce. The pepper steak was not fully cooked and had some type of film substance on it, not to mention mostly being filled with peppers,onions, and carrots. There was hardly any filmy meat in the container, which was probably a good thing in our case. Lastly, the shrimp fried rice had the worst smell I have ever smelled in my life and to top it all off the shrimp was slimy. I literally took a small bite of everything and threw all $30 worth of food in trash. HORRIBLE!!!"

Pad Thai is good and they make an excellent hot &amp; sour soup.  Also they will make specialty dishes and swap things around in their combo meals.  The actual restaurant is classic strip mall, seating is limited.  Usually has average folks or soliders at lunch at the tables.  The kitchen is readily viewable, and puts on a great show while you wait.  The smell is real authentic chinese...heavy with oil, but makes your mouth water.  Great place, good people."

We got a delivery order last night which consisted of Curry Noodles, Sesame Beef, Szechuan Pork and Tom Yum Soup.  Because our order was over $25, we also got a free order or crab cheese won-tons.

The food arrived QUICK!  I ordered it right after final Jeopardy and it was there before Wheel of Fortune was over (for those of you that aren&#39;t sucked into TV Land like I tend to be after work, it was less than 30 minutes).  It smelled so good!  We tore right through the staples holding the big brown paper bag together.

The beef was OK.  I&#39;ve definitely had better, but it still tasted good.  The pork was tasty, but it was overwhelmed with veggies which were cooked well, nice and crisp.  There just wasn&#39;t much meat in the portion we got.  The noodles had decent flavor, but they were dry and kind of mealy.  There also wasn&#39;t much chicken, it was mostly just noodles.  The crab cheese won-tons were good, but I got two that had hardly any filling!  WTF???  Then, there was the soup... my precious tom yum Thai soup that I love so much... I was really excited that Joy Asian Cuisine even had it on the menu!  It was disappointing.  Watered down, lacking flavor, no mushrooms, big wedges of tomato taking up space in the styrofoam cup and getting in the way and it was greasy.  It also looked like they put tempura shrimp in the soup.  The shrimp seemed to have a soggy batter falling off of it as I was eating it... it was just wrong.  This is the second place I&#39;ve gotten greasy tom yum soup from.  So very disappointing, but it wasn&#39;t horrible.  It just wasn&#39;t great.

Overall, for delivery Asian food, it&#39;s alright and has some good flavor.  I also didn&#39;t feel like crap after eating it so it passed the epic question of &#34;will this delivery menu stay in the drawer under the microwave with the others?&#34;  I&#39;ll probably order from them again, but I&#39;ll stick to simpler things from the menu and steer away from the Thai and noodle items as they don&#39;t really have those recipes perfected."

Although the food got here quick, it was horrible, both times.  The sesame chicken was all burnt breading and very very little chicken.  The fried rice was 99% rice, 0.75% veggies and 0.25% chicken.  My kids refused to eat it..  The crab wontons tasted like they had been cooked three days ago and nuked.  The mongolian beef was lukewarm and again, mostly veggies with very little beef.  The price would have been good, if the food had been good also.  As it was, we were ripped off, twice."

I have been to the Backstreet Tavern a couple of times.  I have always had great service, food, and a laid back experience.  Granted I have never seen the place full, but the waitstaff is attentive, and I never waited for a drink.  The food is pure bar fare, but is well made and executed.  I had the wings, which were pretty good, and the cheese filled, bacon wrapped, jalapenos (real jalapeno poppers)...they were exceptional.  

The bar has live music some nights, but the night I showed up for live music, the band didn&#39;t.  The bar is very clean, and the crowd is friendly.  The only problem I have with this bar is that it is off the main street, and doesn&#39;t have a large enough sign for passerby&#39;s to know it is there.

The Backstreet has been there for a long time but it has undergone a recent overhaul.  The seating is nice and the space looks nice.  The bar looks clean and the food isn&#39;t half bad.  

It seems like it should be a fun little place to hang out, but I think they are a bit tired in what they are trying to offer.  I have been there a couple of times when they had live music but the bands aren&#39;t what I am really in to.  The music is dated and tired.  

The last time I was there I sat with my date on one of the high tables near the bar.  We were there for a while before the bartender came over.  Then when he did he asked my date for her drink order and then walked away seemingly without noticing me sitting across from her!  We called him back and gave him my order.  Then he asks me if I was paying cash or credit, to which I replied that I wasn&#39;t sure and I asked him if I had to let him know then?  He said no but then returned a couple moments later without our order and asked me if I had decided yet how I was going to pay.  I don&#39;t mind paying per round or even giving a card for a tab, but he didn&#39;t explain himself at all.  I felt insulted so I excused my date and myself and left. 

I really doubt I will give this place another shot anytime soon."

The place is clean and has been remodeled recently by the new owners that care about the customer. Bathrooms are clean and stocked. With 2 nice pool tables, a golden tee game, a touch-tunes jukebox and a quarter pusher machine skill game.

The food is good with nightly specials. Some of the BEST chicken wings I&#39;ve had the pleasure to have!!

Good beer on tap, with rotational beer from   a couple breweries. Coctails are averagely priced and averagely poured.

I highly recommend the &#34;true&#34; jalapenos poppers, these things will knock your socks off literally, 3/4 of our group loved them! They are not for the faint of heart. Only suggestion would be to offer an option of no seeds, but like I said 3/4 of our group loved them.

Onion rings were excellent, crispy and real cut onions, great sauces to compliment. Good selection of drinks with great service. Place was also very clean, even the bathrooms. 

If I lived here, this would be my joint of choice. When passing through while coming through DIA, I know where I will be stopping.

Unfortunately i had to give it 1 star..Maybe i caught it on the wrong night. But just found this place across the street from my house. Stopped in after work. And i came in live karaokee. Mehhh!!!!
 Sat at bar for 10 MINUTES. With only 3 other people at bar top. And bartender wouldnt even acknowledge me. She was pretty drunk. Having a really hard time ringing things in and was more interested in talking on her cell phone. And eating a grilled cheese sandwich..i just wanted a pint. Finally the lady i was sitting next to. (Adriana) not sure if she worked there or not. Or possibly off clock. Went behind bar when bartender disappeared for a while and started serving patrons. Myself included. The owner or manager finally came out to take over.. that was the end of my night here anyways..BLOWN AWAY BY THE DISCOURTESY AND LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM OF THE EMPLOYEES HERE.

If you send your cook out with the food and the cook asks if she can get you anything, DO NOT come out and tell the customer not to ask the cook for something (a-how are we to know it is the cook and b-get more staff).  Do not yell at the customer because we ask for service.  The food is iffy.  Fried mushrooms had too much batter and most of it was uncooked; salad was limp and old.  I could go on.

I feel like it&#39;s one of those restaurants that you would take someone to impress them, but not exactly go there on your own given all that Denver has to offer.

Here are the items I liked:
* Shishito Peppers à la Plancha, Sesame Caramel, and Crispy Pig&#39;s Ears: I loved the grilled peppers.  They had a nice spicy and smokey flavor.
* Acquerello Mushroom Risotto, Parmesan Sabayon, and Truffle Brined Egg Yolk: The dish was presented to look like a fried egg -- very creative!
* Spanish Octopus à la Plancha, Fingerling Potatoes Bravas, Herb Aioli, Crispy Veal Sweetbreads, Green Olive Crudité: I just love grilled octopus.
* Grilled Ciabatta bread: This does not come with the meal, but costs extra.  It was worth the few extra dollars.

This was just so-so:
* Pan Roasted New Zealand Sea Bass, Toasted Heirloom Farro, Squash Pesto, and Kabocha Squash Purée: I have had similar fish entrees elsewhere.

5 spice graham cracker, candied pumpkin, pickled fennel. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of pumpkin desserts but I&#39;d eat this any day. Also, check out that presentation

Poached Pear Mille Feuille - 
brown butter, goat cheese mousseline, chai gelato was amazing

So yeah, basically everything you can order here is delicious. My coworkers ended up going back again a few days later to try other things and confirmed you really can&#39;t go wrong here."

The market has some nice products, and I fell in love with their spice wall! There are a lot of different and uniqur spice blends that smelled amazing.

For lunch you order at the register and sit wherever you like after picking up your meal from the kitchen. They ask for your phone number and text you when your food is ready. The atmosphere was very hip but also laid back. 

I ordered the braised short rib sandwich based on yelp reviews, and it was awesome. I was immediately impressed by the baguette which was great quality with an amazing texture. I don&#39;t want to sound hyperbolic, but it reminded me of France. I havent had a baguette like that in a while! The meat itself was very flavorful. I was really hungry at the time and the sandwich looked small, but it was very filling. The pickled veggies on the side were also phenomenal- perfect mixture of spicy, sour, and sweet. Overall had a great meal here in this fun space- would be very interested to try dinner."

I arrived early, so I started with a bourbon cocktail, and some peppers with crispy pigs ear.  Delicious!

When my guest arrived, we shared a couple of salads, notably the Brussels sprouts with pumpkin seeds.  I could have eaten more of that!  We then had the caramelized potato gnocchi with braised lamb racy.  Again, this is something I could have eaten more of, and it went very well with my red wine.

Great atmosphere, great menu, great service.  I&#39;ll be back!"

Because of it&#39;s location to hotels and the convention center, the customer base varies from expense account toting Millennials to tables of &#34;girl&#39;s night out&#34; gals and even a few hippies thrown in for local color.  Its casual and elegant.  

The wine list is very well thought out, and there&#39;s a great selection of  hand-crafted cocktails.  The bistro-like menu is filled with classics like charcuterie and steak tartare to steamed mussels.  But all of these classics have been &#34;updated/tweaked&#34;.  Whether its the house-cured egg and quinoa served with the tartare or crispy pig-ears garnishing the sautéed shishito peppers, your tastebuds are in for a real treat.  

The paella ,  served family style,  included a bit of socarrat  at the bottom of the pan as is customary in Spain.   While it took 45 minutes ( as promised on the menu) the seafood garnishes of rock lobster, scallops, mussels &amp; shrimp were cooked to perfection. The dish also contained rabbit and house made chorizo.  Not an easy dish to produce any kitchen, but they did it extremely well. 

Merc Dining &amp; Provision serves breakfast, lunch and small portion plates.  What&#39;s not to like?  This goes on my list of hotspots in Denver."

The food here was good and well presented. The only thing that was off putting was the staff. We sat at the bar, and when I asked a question I felt that bartender was condescending. But it just wasn&#39;t him, all of the bar people were just not very warm/friendly. Honestly I wanted to leave after my first interaction, however  we came for the food so we stayed.

The restaurant is quite small. There is a large bar, which is where we sat, some tables inside and a few outside. I would definitely make a reservation.

One side of the place is a counter where you can order some pastries, coffee and some other items. 

Our bartender was amazing! He made some some wonderful French 75 drinks! We ordered a charcuterie plate to start. This was amazing!!!!! 

Next we spilt the lamb gnocchi. Wow oh wow!!! The lamb was so tender. The sauce was Devine!

We finished off we a peach dessert.

I was so impressed by their food and service!"

Everything played a factor: the weather was amazing, the service was great, the bustling of the city and of course the sweet companion I had joining me for dinner that night. I will definitely be visiting again. Why? Well, let me begin...

The restaurant is located a few streets away from 16th street mall and all the touristy attraction; right next to the Union Station. We had an hour wait bc the restaurant was packed that evening. We opted to wait at the bar and get a drink to quench our throat and rest our achy heels from all the CO exploring. The bartender was so nice helping us order our drinks. We were also mesmerized as we looked over to our right and watched all the magic happening in the open kitchen. How I imagine myself cooking in my dream, has nothing compared to the sexiness of this kitchen. Lol 

Starting off, the beef tartare is a must try! The way they plated the food, along with the different gelatin sauces will make your tastebuds dance. Next, we had the Pan Roasted Cobia. It was an Asian inspired dish and the shiro dashi was very very good. If you&#39;re a fan of heirloom tomatoes like me, get their popular Heirloom Tomatoes and Melon Salad. The pickled watermelon rinds and puff quinoa (yes, PUFFED) made the dish interesting with the texture of the puff grains! If that wasn&#39;t enough starter dishes, we got the Marrow Bone Brûlée. Oooh weeee! Paired with waffle sticks, oxtail marmalade and slices of Brie cheese, if my stomach had a smile...it was definitely grinning from ear to ear. Mmmmmmm!

We finally ordered the entrée: Maple Leaf Farms Duck à l&#39;Orange. Seriously, just do it. This dish blew it out of the park for us. You can taste the intricate care the chefs put into creating this dish. If I could, I would give this restaurant 2 extra stars. Why? Service. They went beyond the necessary of a 5 star restaurant to ensure our satisfactory. Because of a little hiccup in the service, they gave us complimentary chocolate mousse jars that is to DIE for. Merchantile is definitely my top 3 fav restaurant of the year."

Set in the awesome location of Union Station which already has a great vibe.  You walk in to The Mercantile (literally) which sells spices, meats, cheeses, etc...  Everyone there from the host, wine specialist, waiter were all top notch (professional, knowledgeable, friendly).

The food was divine and the presentation was exquisite.We had every course on our first visit here.
Starters:  Brussels Sprouts - topped with prosciutto, home made feta, pepitas, figs, and so many other great flavors.  The best I have every had.
Mussels - With pearl pasta, tomato base, and fennel sausage was also a joy for the palate.  It was just a little salty, but after the mussels were gone I made sure to eat the rest of the sauce and the pearl pasta.  The house made fennel sausage also had fabulous flavor.
Mains - House made spaghetti with lobster and breadcrumbs - The lobster was cooked perfect and you could tell the pasta was home made.  My husbands only complaint was that he wished there was more.
Roasted New Zealand Sea Bass toasted heirloom farro, grilled squash pesto,kabocha squash purée - Again another pleasure for the tongue.  I was taking small bites of each delicacy on my plate and every bite was fabulous.  Just enough fish for one or a great sharing option....although I almost stabbed my husband&#39;s hand with a fork while he tried to take a bite (of more than I offered for him for a taste).
Pumpkin Ricotta Cheesecake - So light and flavorful on a wonderful bed of ginger graham cracker.
Even the coffee and the cappacino my husband had was great.
The wine list is extensive and the wine specialist extremely knowledgeable

This place isn&#39;t large and on a weekend night reservations I would imagine would be required.  We will definitely be back for dinner as well as I would love to try to go there for breakfast/brunch.  This place is definitely a foodies paradise with chef inspired food on a menu that I am sure changes with the seasons."

This place is LOUD, high energy, busy and very trendy.
VERY easy to drone out a lackluster date or run without being noticed. (Only half kidding) This may be my new favorite. Located right in Union Station so you also get to see lots of fun characters on your way in- a bit of culture, if you will. 

For starters:
Grilled ciabatta smoked eggplant. GET IT

Chopped Brussels Sprouts Salad. HOLY HELL this was the main reason I even wanted to come here. prosciutto, sheeps milk feta, figs and pear butter!? Need I say more..

Entrees
I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the Lobster spaghetti. Not much Lobster at all though the flavor was good. 
The New Zealand Sea Bass was delicious and the squash puree and pesto made it supreme.

We were visitors to Denver, but just about everyone we talked to said we had to go here, so we made a reso. We sat at the chef&#39;s counter where we could see all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen I&#39;ll avoid a full rundown of the food we had since every darn thing we ordered was absolutely stellar - not one miss in the bunch. Just go and grab something from the menu that looks good, and chances are it will exceed your expectations (Fine - if you must know, our favorite dish was the grilled octopus. Spanish/Barcelona street food style and expertly prepared). 

Service too was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable. The sommelier for the evening Abbie was a pleasure to talk to. My partner and I know our wines, but she offered some fantastic insight into their fascinating wine list. 

The best part of the whole scene, though, was the passion that just poured from every corner of this establishment. All the servers, the bartenders, the somms, the managers, the chefs... you can tell they all care deeply about this place and the experience they are setting forth, and as a guest, there&#39;s little that makes you feel more welcome."

We shared the grilled ciabatta with eggplant, which was melt in your mouth amazing, the spaghetti with lobster, which was delicate and delicious, and the lamb gnocchi bolognese, which was rich and warmly satisfying. We were pretty hungry, so we also got the arancini with foraged mushrooms, which was so good that I kept eating even after I was full. My friend got the scallops, which were good, but mine was better.

It says the market is open from 7am-10pm daily, but the restaurant is only open from 5pm on-wards ... but yet they serve ... food like restaurant style.

Anyway, I&#39;m not complaining. We came here for brunch-ish stuff and had both brunch and lunch available to us on a busy Sunday morning near Union Station. The interior is well lit, beautifully designed, and generally pleasant to be dining within. The hostess was helpful and they have temp luggage racks for your giant rollies. 

The menu was limited but good enough. The basics were slightly not so basic, and the provisions were much, much above average. 

The only thing I would dock this place on is that they have TERRIBLE coffee. And I should be able to say that because I cannot remember the last time I had such terrible coffee at such a cute, quaint little place. Great for food, just skip on the caffeine!"

I gave it another shot for lunch yesterday and was much happier than I was after my first visit. I ordered the Colorado Quinoa Salad (added grilled chicken breast). It was very tasty! We sat at the bar and the service was very fast. I think for lunch, sitting at the bar for full service is better than self-service: ordering/picking up your own food.

Very nice and comfortable ambience (country kitchen straight outta Fixer Upper Chip &amp; Jo). The cocktails were very flavorful (and they have an extensive spirit/beer/wine selection). We had the charcuterie plate which was delicious (I think it was called Market Provisions). We had the duck and chicken dish for entrees and both were excellent with crispy, well seasoned skins. The service was also very friendly and efficient.

I wish I had the foresight to do so, but I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t expect them to be so busy, but this place is slammed. Luck was on my side, and someone cancelled their reservation (thank you!!!), so I was able to snag a table.

We tried:
-their little cheese/jam board thing. Delicious jam. If they sold it in their market, I would&#39;ve taken it home w me.
-sea bass: soooo yummy. I forgot what came out w the fish, but everything on the plate was delicious. My favorite of the night 
-pork chop: again so yummy!! Didn&#39;t care much for the accompaniments to the meat, but maybe it&#39;s seasonal. 
-mushroom risotto: my friend said this was good. Heads up that the portion size is small, so consider a double portion if this is your meal.
-pot de chocolate: very disappointing dessert after the amazing meal

Highly recommend this place! So glad I stopped by. Lots of attention to detail in the food preparation and plating, REALLY good service, and great seasonal offerings. This is one of the first times I&#39;ve truly been aware of a place tailoring their meal for the season, and I think mercantile did a great job."

We could not get a reservation at Fruition.  So, co-worker and I were close to Mercantile and decided to walk there after work.  Mercantile is inside Union (train) Station...really.  But there is no reason why I&#39;m bringing this up other than, if you are intimidated by going into a train station for really good food, there are tables outside :). 

We were interested in the pork chop and duck, (since we&#39;re in Denver),  our waiter was so friendly she talked us into going for the tasting menu (thinking yes we could get a bite of a series of plates and see the caliber of The Denver chef Alex Seidel and either dislike his style of cooking or love it).

We were expecting mostly meat dishes but what came out was this exciting, delicious, temptingly succulent seafood plates with flavors refined.  Plus,  there was the beef tartar with tallow powder, the Hamachi sashimi with goat curd cheese and olive reduction, diver scallop with pork belly,  the English pea risotto (reminded me of the now-closed Book Bindery in Seattle), duck breast (was out of this world), the shrimp roll (exceptional), just amazing halibut cheeks (with nori &#39;skin&#39;), and other really delish plates and very nice desserts, see pics.  

Service was the best it could be.  Perfect,  actually.  Loved that the manager and our waitperson came by many times to make sure everything was handled: water refreshed, table wiped down, smiles delivered.  I even noted  that the hamachi reminded me of a dish I had at Formel B in Denmark.

There were a few missteps:  the octopus a bit &#34;jerky&#34; chewy from being overcooked and grilled (the sweetbreads that came with were very well made);  the ragu was a bit bland (needed that slight tart from tomatoes and development from ragu veggies), the pork chop had salty greens accompanying it and the meat, dry.   In the grand scheme of things had the pork chop been a maindish  not a tasting menu item, would have been a more critical.

Verdict?  Loved it.

Coming back.

Visits: 1

Tip: Ask the waitperson about tasting menu if you have time.   We got a great deal with,  dish after dish, of exceptionally well made food except for the missteps. If there are no tables available, there are some in the market section of Mervcantile and of course there&#39;s the bar also."

I arrived on a Tuesday evening shortly before 6pm, and the place was packed, luckily there was someone leaving at the bar so I was able to quickly grab a seat.

Once seated I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which I promptly looked over and decided starting off with the French Bulldog, which was a high west double rye whiskey, served with suze, grapefruit, lemon, and hop soda. The drink was very tasty, and served up pretty quickly too. While waiting for my drink I looked over the menu and decided on going with a pasta and the Caramelized Potato Gnocchi was highly recommended so I decided to give it a try. My order arrived about 10-15 minutes later, not bad considering how busy it was. I was slightly disappointed by the size, as it seemed more like an appetizer than an entrée however the braised lamb shoulder bolognese blended well with the ricotta to form an amazing tasting dish!

Service here was great, prices were high however the quality of the food matched the price so know that you are getting a quality meal. Mercantile Dining &amp; Provision is a unique dining experience which focus on the farm to table experience as much as possible. Overall mercantile provided an excellent meal, however I left craving seconds so keep that in mind on your first visit."

Excellent spot for a date night. We ordered the caramelized potato gnocchi and the sea bass. The fresh ricotta in the potato gnocchi dish was delicious and the sea bass was cooked perfectly. 

Our water glasses were never empty and the server explained each dish when they were brought out. 

We weren&#39;t going to order dessert because the desserts seemed maybe a little too unique for our taste, however we asked the server for her recommendation and had one of the most delicious desserts we&#39;ve ever had; the milk chocolate pot de creme.

The food is delicious but the take out counter, which was what I used for, was simply amazing. The bacon pastry is to die for. There are a number of exceptional pastries that change daily. The spice counters offer a wide variety of spices. This was mentioned in the New York Times May article for Union Station. It&#39;s a bit tucked away so make sure you don&#39;t forget to enter the narrow hallway to get to the restaurant.

I took out of town family here for dinner on a Sunday night. The atmosphere was relaxing and modern. I like the open kitchen concept, it builds into their transparency. The service deserves 5 stars, excellent presentation and knowledge of the menu. The food was unique and seasonal, with a variety or origins. My hesitation comes from the fact that we all left hungry. We all ate vegetarian, but we did have appetizers and entrees, I wish they had advised us to order more food. For the price, you don&#39;t want to walk away needing to get a snack. I will probably be back with people who are not vegetarian because even though they good options, they really are not substantial enough for meals.

Came here on my last night in Denver, hoping to end things on a high note, but ended up being such a disaster it took up my entire night. But to be clear, food was pretty good, I&#39;d probably give it a 5. Service was also good once you actually sat down, but everything else was pretty terrible.

We arrived slightly before 7:00 pm and were told that it&#39;d be a 45 minute wait. So we head over to the outdoor bar at Union Station. I went back in to change my reservation and then they told us they could seat us right away. However we just ordered drinks, so I told them I&#39;d wait the extra 45 for a table outside. Just to be clear, there were empty tables both inside and outside, so I&#39;m not sure what the issue is here. We repeatedly checked in at the restaurant too and fast forward about 2 hours, still not seated. Apparently people who made reservations for inside decided they wanted to sit outside, so then my name got bumped down the list, which I think is absolutely ridiculous. 

Now that we&#39;ve finally been seated and our order has been taken, it takes about 20 minutes for the appetizers to come and then another 45 for the entree to come. At this point I was borderline livid and just really wanted to get out of there. I promptly ask for the check and also to speak to the manager, which I&#39;ve never asked for before. I gave her my honest feedback and she addressed some of my points. As we left, they gave us a parting dessert to apologize for the bad time we had, which I appreciated. But all in all, the damage has been done, and very unlikely for me to make a return trip."

My favorites were the crispy pig&#39;s ears, the potato gnocchi (the lamb and the sauce, oh my!) and my entree, the scallops. Everyone was so happy with their food. The scallops came with pork belly, crispy rice balls and broccolini - which made it the perfect size entree. Sometime scallop dishes are so small, this was great.

I had the Colorado quinoa salad (hold the feta) and it was alright- all arugula which isn&#39;t my favorite but oh well. Hubby had the grilled cheese and we split and order of fried pickles. His sandwich came with a super small side of pickled veggies - about the same amount that came in my Bloody Mary. Sides, such as the fried pickles (very small) and kettle chips were $4.00 each. This to me is kind of a joke in terms of paying for a side when your sandwich should come with one.  Overall ok place."

The place is very busy for good reason, the food is amazing.
The plates are beautifully presented, the ingredients of the best quality. It is comfort food but with a twist, with just the right amount of creativity and sophistication.
We had the Asparagus a la plancha (the ricotta burata was melting in the mouth), the Caramelized Potato Gnocchi and the Chick Pea Falafel, all three delicious. Our chocolate and passion fruit dessert was also very tasty.
The only complaint I have about Mercantile is that the noise level makes it very difficult to have a conversation. But then, it forces you to focus and savor the amazing food :)
We had a wonderful dinner, and I&#39;d love to go back for lunch and breakfast."

The food here was really delicious. I split the bone marrow brulee, Razor Clam Casarecci, and the duck. The bone marrow was my favorite, and the plating was stunning. It was more than enough to share between 2. Both the pasta and duck were also cooked very well, with elegant flavors, and great presentation. So, the food here definitely deserves 5 stars in my book.

However, the service was lacking and we ran into a number of hiccups. My party of 4 went for dinner Saurday night. We were expecting to have to wait for a table, which was no problem since there was a nearby bar to hang out at. When we put our names down, we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. Fast forward to 2.5 hours later, we still hadn&#39;t been seated. I had gone twice to check in with the hostess before being seated. What was confusing, was there appeared to be a number of empty tables both inside and outside. The hostess explained that many people with reservations with inside tables chose to sit instead outside, so it pushed our spot back. That reasoning didn&#39;t seem quite fair, and we were more than fine with an inside table, so I&#39;m still a bit confused why the wait ended up being 2.5 hours.

Another negative was the wait time for food. We were served our starters at a reasonable time after we ordered. But, then it took 45 minutes from when we finished our starters to when our entrees came out. A member of our party did speak with the manager just to inform them of our feedback. They apologized and seemed to take the feedback well to better their establishment. As we were leaving, they then handed us to go bags of dessert to apologize, which was generous and very delicious."

They gave you an amazing white wine glass for free but my gnocchi entree (doubling the price of the plate because the waitress told me it was tiny) was to saucy, something was missing.
I was expecting a perfect entree because the place is amazing that&#39;s why I guess I was a little but disappointed and then I cannot give a 4 star rate :("

I never had a cocktail on my entire trip and so I ordered an old fashioned.  Of course, I wanted some food with my drink but nothing on the menu appealed to me except the blueberry muffin.  Thus I got a muffin and a cocktail as a meal.  It oddly goes together really well.

Both the muffin and my cocktail were tasty good.  Lots of tourists and people who are on the go.  

Most likely will not come back here again since there are a boatload of Union Stations businesses I still want to try."

I think that the way that they pivot between shifts is really innovative. We had trouble figuring out where to line up to order sandwiches. I&#39;ve tried all of the sandwich varieties and they are all quite good.

The most important part of Mercantile is the attention to detail. The food is simply phenomenal. I once sat at the stools facing the kitchen and watched the prep for a dinner shift. It was better than food network. It was so much fun. I&#39;ve been back to repeat the experience and the counter was occupied, my mood went from happy to sad when they told us things were too busy to watch."

I tried to edit my reservation by calling the restaurant but they never replied to my voicemail &amp; it was evident that they didn&#39;t when I arrived @ my table &amp; the # of chairs was for the original party size. Luckily, some people in my group dropped out last minute so we only needed to add 1 more chair. 

This restaurant is in great location right off of Union Station. It is connected by a hallway &amp; they share the same restroom. They have a day market inside where you can buy cheese, meats &amp; spices. They serve breakfast as early as 7AM, brunch, lunch &amp; dinner. I tried the dinner. 

For appetizers I tried the shishito peppers à la Plancha with sesame caramel, crispy pig&#39;s ears for $8. It had a nice kick &amp; crunch. I would order this again for sure. I loved how creative the dish was. I also tried the Marrow Bone Brûlée with port shallot marmalade, poached pears, point reyes blue, herbed parmesan bread for $13. I had never seen bone marrow that looked so white before. It is subpar to the bone marrow @ Acorn but was still good. 

For my entree I tried the Spanish octopus à la Plancha with crispy anson mills polenta, spicy tomato broth, and dried fig &amp; pine nut tapenade for $26. The octopus was nicely cooked &amp; was not @ all chewy. The portion sizes aren&#39;t too big but you end up being pretty full if you order an appetizer as well. I also tried the lobster spaghetti, a dish I would order again &amp; again! It had poached Maine lobster, pancetta bread crumbs &amp; house made spaghetti. It was delicious and spicy because the waiter scissored some fresh dried pepper onto the dish. 

I like how they have a coat check when you enter the restaurant &amp; how all the waiters serve all the guests&#39; dishes @ once (so  you&#39;ll have several waiters come out @ once). The Late for Church cocktail was 1 of the best cocktails I&#39;ve ever had (aylesbury duck vodka, banane du bresil, amaro di angostura, orange, lemon, prosecco $11). I ordered it because I saw that it had banana liquer in it &amp; I&#39;m a huge banana fan. The drink however, was so subtle that I couldn&#39;t really detect the banana. 

I cannot wait to come back for breakfast/brunch/lunch."

Neat concept, modern and unique interior blending fine dining with a casual market concept, central bar, and I love the location in Union Station. 

The Bad: 
We ordered the halibut cheeks, which came out immediately after we ordered them - not a good sign. The pea tendrils were brown and wilting, the fish was cold, and the sauce was broken. My boyfriend asked the waiter if the plate had already been made before we ordered it, and he laughed it off and walked away. After one bite and affirming it was indeed an old, cold plate that had not been made fresh to order, we had to send it back. After about twenty awkward minutes, the manager apologized and bought our drinks which was nice/necessary. Just not sure I&#39;m excited to go back to a place that serves &#34;dead&#34; food when they are reputed to have such high standards. 

The Food: 
See &#34;the bad&#34; 

The Service: 
The first person we saw at the counter by the entrance ignored us and looked away instead of greeting us...
Bartender was not very personable...We would have appreciated a prompt and sincere apology but felt awkward for pointing out their mistake. Adele the manager saved the day at the last minute with a gracious apology and honest explanation and bought our drinks which is the only reason we might go back. 

Overall, disappointed in this overrated restaurant."

Had a nice lunch experience there, but dinner experience put this spot to a 3 stars rating. 

Lunch. Had the chicken salad on croissant.  It&#39;s tasting and big, croissant was nice, not the best I&#39;ve ever had but it&#39;s good, puffy and flaky. Chicken salad is great, not your typical soaked in mayo and scary chicken kind. Also comes with a mini side of house made pickles, delicious. 

Dinner.  Had a lovely service at the bar.  Saw so many amazing photos of the octopus on Yelp, big, plump, fat and juicy octopus like in Spain. Came back to this place for dinner just to experience that.  It&#39;s so disappointing. First, they changed how the octopus was cooked preciously. Second, now it&#39;s much smaller octopus, not big and plump.  The sauce and sweetbreads, potatoes are good on the side but the octopus itself is incredibly rubbery on some pieces. Like tough enough I had to really struggle to cut. Some are ok, but when the size is already smaller, they&#39;re much skinner pieces than before, and now some are rubbery which is just unacceptable.  Regardless to say, huge disappointment on this dish. A lady had the sea bass sitting next to me, I could smell how fishy the dish was when its delivered to her. 

Warning for those who&#39;s tempting to order the octopus dish cuz you saw pretty pic on Yelp, don&#39;t be fooled like me. And I even edited my photos to make it look pretty, but sure doesn&#39;t taste pretty at all."

The space is gorgeous, kinda tight between the tables but not so much that we we a part of the conversation next to us. 

The orzo with faux egg white and smoked egg yolk was the most delightful treat both presentation and palate wise I&#39;ve had in a while. Pork chop was described as the best you will ever have, as I choose not to use such superlatives when it comes to food, it was damn delicious. Duck and scallops, beautiful presentation, were just right with portion offering and flavor execution.  Broccoli cheese soup was such an inventive deconstruct and still the same comforting flavor profile you want from broccoli cheese soup. 

My only regret is this... while knee deep in our 4th course we watched as the next table over had a shot of bone marrow, from the bone. I must have missed that on the menu because I would MOS DEF have chosen to experience that!

The presentation is EVERYTHING- the cocktail is served in a lovely copper glass and the soda accompanies it on a sweet, rustic wooden tray. My boyfriend enjoyed a lovely glass of cab-merlot. We shared the Canadian Mussels and the Marrow Bone Brûlée which came with the most amazing gluten-free parmesan waffles, pea shoot salad and tender prosciutto.

I also love the atmosphere for lunch - but I&#39;m not a huge fan of the ambiance for dinner. Let me explain:

Food: 
I&#39;ve eaten at MD&amp;P twice, once for lunch (at the bar) and once for dinner. Sitting at the bar at lunch time, enjoying an amazing sandwich and a glass (or two) of wine is delightful. The food is fresh the bar service is excellent. Love it for lunch.

For dinner, my hubby and I started with Creekstone Beef Tartare with crispy baby artichoke, tonnato aïoli, lemon jam, marinated radishes, house cured egg yolk. This dish is light (despite the beef) and elegantly served. Amazing. We then shared the House-Made Spaghetti with poached Maine lobster and pancetta bread crumbs. This dish was well worth $17 and included a decent amount of lobster. The house-made spaghetti was perfectly al dente and had that &#34;smooth-slightly-starchy&#34; flavor. I would go back to MD&amp;P for this dish alone. We then shared the Eden Farms Bone-In Pork Chop - smoked pork shoulder, Black lentil BBQ with parmesan and lime corn salad. This was just a yummy as it sounds. Another home run.

Service: 
The service at MD&amp;P is as good as any restaurant I&#39;ve ever eaten in (in any city, including New York, San Francisco and Paris). The hostess, server(s), busers, and sommelier know exactly what they are doing. Water glasses always full, plates cleared and new service for each course, excellent recommendations on food and wine paring, etc. Special kudos to sommelier, Abby, who helped to find the right wine (at a good price) for our meal. She even offered to help us choose some cheeses to take with us and when we decided to skip the cheese, she brought us a complimentary bag-o-pastries to take with us (we were celebrating our wedding anniversary). This was a very nice, and well appreciated touch.

Ambiance:
This is where MD&amp;P falls short for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the whole space with the market, bar, open kitchen. For lunch, sitting at the bar, watching people come in and buy market items, seeing all the activity in the kitchen is fun and energizing. But, for dinner, I personally want a more private experience.The dining room is nice but if you&#39;re a party of two, you sit at a small two-top, which in our case, was about a foot away from the two-top next to us. You really feel like you&#39;re eavesdropping on your very close neighbor&#39;s conversation (or vice-versa). I understand that the space is limited and that lots of restaurants arrange their space in the same fashion, but for me, it lessens the overall experience. Also, it gets loud, very loud in the dining room. We arrive early for dinner per advice from the hostess assuming that it wouldn&#39;t be as crowded (and noisy) but this place is so popular that it fills up early and wow, it can get really loud. I guess I&#39;m just old..I don&#39;t enjoy having to lip-read during dinner. 

Overall, there is good reason for the popularity Mercantile Dining &amp; Provision."

It is located inside of the Union Station building. Walking in, you are entering their &#34;market&#34; which has counters and walls, where the Fruition Farms provisions are for sale. In the middle of the market is a large bar serving cocktails and coffee. You can either sit at their bar, or at the high-top tables surrounding the bar. As you walk further in, you enter the restaurant. Which is very open and calming and rustic. Their dining room was absolutely beautiful, but we asked the hostess if we could sit at the chef&#39;s counter, which looks into their big, open kitchen.

I kept turning around in my chair, looking in every direction because I loved looking around the market and the restaurant, which blend very well together. The entire place was packed on a Sunday night and had such great energy! I felt like we were eating in NYC! It had that kind of &#34;big city&#34; feel.

Dylan was our server and he was very informative and charismatic over their menu. Don&#39;t bother asking &#34;What&#39;s good here?&#34; EVERYTHING is good at Mercantile! From the ambiance of the restaurant, to the presentation of the dishes, you can tell that this place REALLY cares to make a lasting impression and that they pay close attention to every little detail. Grant was our wine sommelier that night, and we had him pick each wine to go with our dishes - he went above and beyond to make sure our drinks paired perfectly with our food! Top notch service!

We started with their iberico which was on special. Oh my gosh. It melts in your mouth and just tasted salty and delicate! Their Pig Face Croquettes were crispy and fatty and came with a 61 degree farmhouse egg for dipping, as well as roasted brussels sprouts, crispy kale, lentil granola, and mustard vinaigrette. The combination of flavors in this dish was insane! The mustard vinaigrette in each bite was the perfect touch. I could eat 3 of those dishes as my dinner and be perfectly happy.

For dinner, I had the Acquerello Mushroom Risotto, with truffle brined egg yolk &amp; parmesan truffle sabayon. If you love truffle and mushrooms, get this dish! It was so hearty, creamy, and rich! Dylan also brought over some toasted bread so that I could dip it in my risotto which just took me to cloud-freaking-9!!! My husband had the Bone-In Smoked Pork Shank which came with vanilla roasted sweet potatoes and coconut emulsion. The pork shank fell off of the bone, and the sweet potatoes was a delicious and unique compliment! The portion size of the dishes were so big but we ate all of it!

To finish, we had the Milk Chocolate Pot de Creme which was salty from the caramel, and sweet from the vanilla chantilly cream. Perfect nightcap. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back here. It&#39;s pricey, but worth every penny in my opinion. Definitely one of the top 3 restaurants in Denver!"

There was a fantastic wine list and the waiter was happy to make suggestions and help with pairing.  I believe he has someone in training with him but we never felt overwhelmed or that either was stumbling through service.  Both were attentive and allowed us to take our time with ordering, eating and relaxing a bit afterwards.  There was a decent-sized crowd on a Monday night so that was appreciated greatly.

The shishito peppers were amazing - sesame caramel?!  Great!
The scallops were well-cooked and quite lovely.

The pastrami sandwich was delectable. I also enjoyed a twist on a Moscow mule called the skinny Dennis, but I think my absolute favorite thing at lunch was a glass of some of the most delicious dolcetto &#39;San Luigi&#39; Pecchenino, Dogliano - Italy (and so reasonably priced at $11/glass).

Great tasting food. Good looking presentation. Awesome waiter Ben. Stiff cocktail with a great sounding name. &#34;Girls Who Smoke.&#34;

We shared their beet salad. My entree was the Spanish Octopus à la Plancha. It&#39;s crispy anson mills polenta, spicy tomato broth, dried fig and pine nut tapenade. $26. This dish was perfectly executed. The octopus was tender but not too soft. It retained its structure. So that when it arrived on the table it was the best looking octopus! Slightly crunchy outer side and seared tentacle ends. The taste? Clean but very much retained the seafood aspect of it. I love it! The fact that it wasn&#39;t stripped of it&#39;s taste made this dish a cut above the rest. 

I needed something equally outstanding to accompany my pretty octopi. Scotch for a cold night. I don&#39;t smoke, but the main star in this drink was Monkey Shoulder Scotch. Perfect hint of smoky aroma and oh so silky. A while back I tried this particular scotch and was caught off guard by it&#39;s unique blend of three malts. Add to this Mercantile&#39;s own addition of de maguey Vidal Mezcal, velenost vistol, martini amaro bass and, apricot brandy and black walnut bitters. End result: Stiff drink that is memorable and can go toe to toe with my equally memorable entree.

So in summary, this is a successful first visit and we know we&#39;re definitely coming back!"

We did find the interior of the restaurant, at least on the busy night that we choose, almost overwhelming. It was very hot and noisy and the huge open kitchen seemed to take over the dining area. We decided to eat on the patio which was a calm oasis in contrast to the interior.

The waiter was very helpful on the menu, but seemed a little out of his depth on the extensive and eclectic wine list. Fortunately this restaurant has a sommelier and she was extremely knowledgeable. Her recommended wine went perfectly with our entrees.

I started with the beef tartare. The presentation was absolutely stunning with little hills of beef scattered across the plate, interspersed with the crispy artichoke, marinated radishes, and other accompaniments. Absolutely delicious.

I then had the grilled sea bass. The fish was perfectly cooked and very flavorful, but I particularly enjoyed the polenta and chanterelles which tasted absolutely fresh and earthy.

I was so absorbed in my food that I really did not pay very much attention to what my friends were eating, but they agreed with my assessment that everything was superb. My friends rarely eat dessert, but we all ordered a variety of desserts and they vanished in short order.

The ambiance is reminiscent of something in the Napa Valley with a bit of an upscale country vibe and farm to table flavor. Loved the muted color palate, all of the windows and the carefully selected fixtures.

The food is the very best part. I could go on and on and on and still not do it justice. The gnocchi with short rib was magically delicious. As I ate each little delicate pillow, I willed the dish not to come to an end. The short rib also melted in my mouth....I&#39;m practically salivating writing about it.

The squash soup is cleverly served with cream an muesli, which adds a unique and flavorful twist to a typically traditional dish. It was so rich and nutty and felt hearty without being overbearing, like a warm hug from a close friend.

I can&#39;t even remember the name of our dessert because it was so good I thought I had died when I ate it. Really. It was some sort of pot de creme, and my husband, who is usually content to let me have 3/4 of our dessert (one of the many reasons I married him) practically fought me for the last bite. On my birthday, no less.

I&#39;d tried to make a reservation for Mercantile in June for our anniversary, but found it impossible to get in. A friend tipped me off that if you show up between 4:30-5, you&#39;re likely to be able to walk right in (That proved to be true for us on a Thursday at 4:50)."

Delicious sandwiches and drinks, generous servings.  Grab a table as soon as you catch one open because they fill up quickly!  My friend and I came here on a snowy weekday morning, and it was still packed.  I had the bánh mì sandwich and root veggie salad, both were delicious, and (I think) all the sandwiches come with a side of pickled veggies which were quite tasty.  My friend had the pastrami sandwich with a side of fried pickles.  The fried pickles were awesome!!  Rather than doing fried pickle slices, this place fries their spears whole.  Somehow they magically retained their crunch despite being deep fried, and the batter was perfectly done.  Loved our lunches at this place!  I&#39;d come back again the next time I&#39;m in town!"

Been here twice so far, the Potato Gnocchi was ordered both times, make sure you get the &#34;double order&#34; because a single order is small-ish.

We went for a special dinner for my birthday. They left a card at my chair that was signed by the entire (I assume?) staff. It was quite adorable. Our friend suggested to us that we do the Chef&#39;s Counter. Now let me be a friend to all of you and say DON&#39;T do it. There really wasn&#39;t any benefit to being seated there and the chairs were supremely uncomfortable. I didn&#39;t have anywhere to put my high-heeled feet, the counter wasn&#39;t quite counter height and the chairs were too tall. It&#39;s always uncomfortable eating from a too-low table. Also, for the length of time of the dinner, my butt was just sore. It&#39;s a nice dining experience (2.5 hours) and you should definitely sit on a cushy chair or bench. 

We started with the hamachi crudo and provisions board. I thought that the portions might be small but these were even smaller than my lowest expectation. When we got the crudo plate, I had to look for the fish. I found a couple of tiny slivers. That said, those slivers were absolutely delicious and beautiful. It was truly a perfect bite - but that&#39;s all it was - a couple of Bites. The provisions board was somewhat similar. There was so little cheese and meat and frankly WAY too much of everything else. Still the cheese and meats were all supremely delicious - but for $21, maybe tone down the giardiniera and jellies and tone up the cheeses. 

When we got our menu, we were told there were two portions of the pastas and vegetables - they had a side portion and an entree portion. Normally when that&#39;s the case, the price written is for the larger portion - not the case here. We asked for the smaller portion only to find that the prices written were for the smaller portion. It was fine, honestly, but I think the waitstaff should point out that the portions on the menu are the smaller portions. We ordered the lobster with homemade spaghetti and asparagus with burrata. The asparagus was a perfect taste of spring. I loved the plate. The spaghetti was super rich and the pasta was a little thick but flavored well and had a nice bite. Overall, the plate was a little dry but still very tasty. 

We ordered the octopus a la plancha to share and it was truly delightful. Having never eaten octopus, I thought it was perfectly cooked :) The polenta served under the octopus was amazing - who knew cornmeal could taste that good. Everything about this plate was flawless. Even if you are squeamish about eating octopus, just order it - it will definitely change your mind. 

We ordered the pot de creme for dessert. A nice sweet finish. A small note for the restaurant is to maybe comp a dessert or something on a special occasion. It&#39;s not a big deal but literally every restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to on my birthday/anniversary has done that. It&#39;s a small thing and goes a Very long way. 

Overall, the food was really lovely. Very upscale, unique, and beautifully plated. The head chef came over from Fruition (one of our Denver favorites) and it&#39;s truly a loss for Fruition. Aside from the food, I wish this place had some type of dress code. This is generally my complaint with a lot of upscale restaurants in Denver. Just a thought."

Impressed by Fruition, Alex Seidel&#39;s inspired Modern American cooking and adherence to concepts of sustainability not only delicious and inspired, but immensely respectable as well, Mercantile Dining &amp; Provisions was nothing short of requisite for a late-morning snack during the last day in Denver, my only regret being sold out bread pudding and the fact that I did not visit sooner as I&#39;d have liked to return for lunch or dinner, too. 

Located in the dining concourse at Union Station, the still-functional downtown transportation landmark in the process of completing recent renovations and featuring some of the biggest restaurant openings of the last couple years, Mercantile Dining &amp; Provisions is one part market and another part eatery, all three meals featuring their own distinct menus while a grab n&#39; go counter proves ideal for folks on their lunch hour, or even those in a hurry to catch a train.

A gorgeous space in the early morning, floor to ceiling windows bathing both dining room and kitchen in the sun&#39;s brilliant rays, those arriving before 11am are encouraged to peruse the pastry counter before taking a look at a small but well-culled menu, the options later expanding to encompass everything from soups and salads to housemade pastas and plates more substantial, 5pm service even including &#34;family style&#34; dinners with offerings subject to the chef&#39;s whim and daily market change.

Listing nearly everything by source, several items coming from Seidel&#39;s own Fruition Farms, it was while watching the open kitchen that I stood patiently waiting in a short line where coffee and baked goods are offered, the eventual order consisting of just four items, though looking back on the day&#39;s later meals I only wish that I&#39;d have bought more.

No doubt infusing Americana with European concepts throughout much of Mercantile&#39;s layout, as well as the bill of fare, breakfast began with still-warm Monkey Bread awash in caramel and butter before moving to a savory riff on the traditional Cinnamon Roll, this one topped bacon shavings atop thick frosting and the tightly curled brioche bun.

No doubt executing the aforementioned well, but even better when turning eyes towards modernized classics from France, both the Pain Au Raisin and Almond Croissant were riddled with nuts and butter amidst arching layers of crisp lamination, the former mellowing yellow raisins with pistachios while the later is not only bigger than most, but also far better with a shell guaranteed to make a mess of any surface while the inside is stuffed with pureed almonds instead of cloying frangipane."

But boy were those bar snacks good. Yes, there is a definite air of pretension at Mercantile, but they do well because of this being located in Union Station.

They have the best sparkling rose wine, and the best olives I have every eaten, and I am an olive addict! I would love to go back for dinner, but their vegetarian options aren&#39;t great (and sadly I am married to a vegetarian. I know, I know.) 

They also have a little store where you can buy cheese, meats and chocolates to go. 

More of a &#34;treat&#34; place, than a restaurant to frequent regularly. But I would recommend."

It was lunchtime (very busy), so I grabbed the Rose / lemonade they had which was refreshing &amp; delicious. Then I had the a salad with fresh heirloom tomatoes, croutons, balsamic vinaigrette, arugula, walnuts and mozzarella buffalo cheese. It was yummy in my tummy!

The restaurant&#39;s concept, of with I am sure everyone is familiar, is an open style layout with a wrap around bar in the middle serving delicious cocktails and coffee. The kitchen also opens up into the &#39;market&#39; style eatery allowing for everyone to see to action in the kitchen. Along the walls, the Fruition Farms provisions are for sale. Everything from cured meats to cheeses. 

Though the aesthetics of the eatery really appeal to me, I&#39;d have to say I love the good even more. The charcuterie (or provision plate) is, without fail, one of the best vid ever had. They load it up with all the essentials, and embellishments, like interesting jellies, jardinière, preserves to make the flanked shine through even more. This most recent visit, I thoroughly enjoyed the cucumber gazpacho (so fresh and crisp - perfect for a summer evening. And topped with puffed grain crumble and a delicious sheep cheese) and the Bucatini pasta. The noodles were perfectly cooked and obviously made in house as they were thick and hearty and robust with flavor as was the sauce. 

Our server was enthusiastic in educating us on each dish and made it a mission to make sure we ordered the right thing for us. He even listened to our specific likes and dislikes and carefully suggested various dishes for each of us. He even took the time to walk me through the cocktail list to happily craft a &#39;mocktail&#39; just for me. It was delicious with mint and ginger. I enjoyed just as much as i would have enjoyed an actual cocktail with a little booze in there. 

I suspect I will be enjoying Mercantile a lot more in the near future."

I would&#39;ve never known to look in the station for such a great meal! 

To start, I had the grilled naan that came with yogurt, jam, and pate--delicious! Then I ordered the Spanish octopus which was perfect and not tough or chewy. It was also sitting on a bed of patatas bravas. The flavors were beautiful together. I had a couple glasses of labrusco and call it a perfect meal. 

I know the menu changes up based on available ingredients and seasonal flavors, so I cannot wait for my next Denver visit because I&#39;ll definitely be back for another meal."

I can assure you, it was worth the wait. The space is fantastic, very clean and crisp. I loved that you could see into the kitchen. We split the market board (a must- as most of their cheeses and meats are cured on site). Then we had the asparagus a la plancha(delicious) and the maple leaf farms duck a l&#39;orange. The duck was cooked perfectly, a small portion though. The wine list is great and of course the signature cocktails. Next time we go we want to sit at the counter near the kitchen. Very very good!"

Get there early because it can fill up quick, but the bar seating is first come first serve, so you can usually squeeze in for a drink and a bite. If you have to wait, there is a standing bar area near the kitchen that gets you prompt drink service. Next time I plan on sitting at the little counter overlooking the kitchen.

As soon as I walked past the area where the food was coming out of the kitchen, I set my eyes in the Falafel dish with crispy kale, Harissa yogurt sauce and spicy tomato jam. I knew that that&#39;s what I was ordering. The presentation was phenomenal and couldn&#39;t resist. The dish didn&#39;t disappoint! I was glad that our server let me know ahead of time that the falafel would have a creamy texture. Otherwise I would have expected the traditional ball of fried goodness with a gritty center. 

My friend ordered the Natural Boulder Crispy Fried Chicken. It was as amazing as my dish. Complex yet simple at the same time. 

Oh wait! Did I forget to mention the other star of the show? The butternut Squash Soup. Definitely not your ordinary presentation or flavors. 

The service was impeccable which only enhances the dining experience. This will definitely be on my top 10 go to restaurants around town.

Not only is the space beautiful, but the service was fantastic (I dug our cashier&#39;s personality!) and the food was worth every penny.  Before grabbing ourselves a table on the outdoor patio, I had a chance to see all the plates of food the kitchen was pumping out and it all looked so beautiful. 

The two of us shared the short rib sandwich, truffle chips and quinoa salad and were blown away by the flavors and execution of it all.  The polenta croutons, lentil granola and goat cheese made the salad, but that short rib sandwich was definitely the star of the show.  Not only do you get a beyond decently-sized sandwich, but they do not skimp on the meat, which was braised to perfection.

Our party of 4 came here after being told by the surly host at Kitchen Next Door (at 9:40pm on a thursday,) that their kitchen was closing &#34;in 10 minutes.&#34;  Certainly a less-than-welcoming greeting. But all turned out for the best. The Mercantile host greeted us warmly, (note that they closed at 10pm that night and by now it was 945pm) and showed us to a table, where the waiter proceeded to tell us about the family style meals which takes up to 45 minutes to prepare (even though they were closing in 15 mins!) It just set off the whole visit on the right foot - that they were willing to stay open should we want that meal. We didn&#39;t end up getting it, but we did take our time tasting various wines before ordering drinks, then getting our food at around 1030pm. I was just so impressed with the patience and welcoming atmosphere at Mercantile. And the food? Divine. Unfortunately by this late hour, they were out of the lobster spaghetti which 2 of us wanted to eat! But we were all so happy with the food we got. Everything had such layers of subtle flavors. We tried the octopus (prepared perfectly - consistency was just right), the casarecci pasta with clams and broccolini (homemade pasta, cooked al dente and served w/ fennel sausage, so good), the risotto (the vinaigrette added the most amazing flavor complexity), and the gnocchi w/ lamb (wow! more lamb than gnocchi!)  On top of that, we had the peaches &amp; cream dessert... the &#39;cream&#39; was actually a subtle goat cheese which offset the sweetness of the peaches and their berry glaze. This meal rocked - our out of town guests (California foodies) were impressed and Mercantile definitely set the bar for good food in Denver. We&#39;ll be back!"

If not you&#39;ll find your eyes darting around the menu in search of something that will suffice.  I ordered the winter salad and the mussels.  Both were very good... but is it enough to make me come back?  Not sure.  I&#39;d essentially have to order one of only a handful of things because the rest of the menu is filled with meat.

The food at Mercantile is amazing. If you are dining there for lunch, they have a community style dining room where you will have to place your order with the cashier, provide them with your cell phone number, take a seat, and then pick up your food at the kitchen once you&#39;ve received a text that your food is ready! The only menu available is the on the wall that is found behind the cashier. At night, they have a more formal dining where you check your coat and find a table where a waitress will take your order. 

The restaurant is located in the Union Station, so you get a taste of both traditional and modern decor. Once you&#39;ve entered (located down the end of the hallway), you will find a bar, open concept kitchen, and the dining room. Again, the atmosphere here is great! The wait staff are all very friendly. 

I ordered the Short Rib Sandwich - $11 and it was great. The meat was very juicy and tender. I was torn between this sandwich and the Banh Mi, maybe I will have to try that the next time I am in town. The sandwich comes with a side of pickled vegetables like celery, pepper, carrots, and cauliflower. It didn&#39;t look like anything special, but after your first bite, you&#39;re going to be wanting more! I also had the Kettle Chips which is another winner. It isn&#39;t very thinly sliced so the edges are crispy, but the middle is still a bit soft which gave it a nice texture. It is also salted, so there&#39;s flavor. 

Overall, this is a great spot to check out if you&#39;re by the Union Station!"

For brunch, try the salmon rillette or the pastrami hash...heavenly.  Sit at the bar and watch the kitchen prep for dinner, it&#39;s fun to observe.
For dinner, try the octopus...it&#39;s absolutely mind blowing.  I have never had octopus prepared better than here, it&#39;s a must have for me.  The scallops are crazy good too.  Their small dishes and salads are very creative and worth a try as well."

I work down near Union Station so Mercantile is an easy place to grab lunch if we have a little time. The only downside is that the line is usually super long - however with that being said they do prep the food pretty quickly and we can usually get in and out in under 45mins (great for lunch). I am a huge fan of the chicken salad sandwich and getting a side of chips. I always put the sandwich on baguette because I am a sucker for good bread. My only issue is that the chips are an extra charge - only a little veggie cup comes with the sandwich.

Dinner is a whole different ball game. This place goes from being a pseudo deli counter to a fancy sit down restaurant. The cheese plates are to die for - they have an amazing selection of meat and cheeses that are completely droolworthy. The entrees are rich and delicious. I ended up splitting with my mom because we were both so full off our appetizers. Finally - make sure you save room for dessert. This changes quite frequently but I have yet to have a bad one. They make them in house and are worth the extra calories.

Mercantile is easily one of my favorite places in the downtown area. Will definitely keep coming here - so worth it!"

Everything we tried was great. The Green Strawberry &amp; Rhubarb Salad was beautiful and unique, but a bit small for $13. The Acquerello Mushroom Risotto with truffle brined egg yolk was so creamy, cheesy and rich but beware, the egg really is completely raw. The Broccoli à la Plancha had the perfect sweet/spice mix and I was truly awed at how amazing this simple veggie could taste! The wine list was immense and had some great selections... But the most memorable drink was the Rumspringa...This thing was like Christmas morning in a cup and very stiff. The hot chocolate pot de creme for dessert was the highlight of this meal. It&#39;s so cute in its little mason jar and tastes divine... I could go back for just this!

Please, just a few more vegetarian options &amp; a little less time talking about the menu items (our server explained (read them to is) each one for about a minute and said each was his favorite, but never anything vegetarian)..."
mercantile-dining-and-provision-denver,Bekah R.,D55irpBmTO9qRh4aXtFx9g,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,113,122,nVedz2qCxXkJrrOrkdVGLw,5.0,2016-10-18,"Great lunch spot!  Plus, being in union station is always fun!"
mercantile-dining-and-provision-denver,Ryan M.,e23xKR5PLLc4aPOZSIPmBQ,"Wheat Ridge, CO",1,1,0,7,20,3kSxX5zNnqs1qfdMts9yPA,5.0,2016-02-12,"Oh, Mercantile. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...

Way the first: Your location, next to Union Station, easily accessible to all but not so far buried Downtown to disincentivize frequent visits. Nestled between Snooze and Hop Doddy, most of your would-be patrons are drawn to the nearby establishments, more conspicuously emblazoned and attention-seeking. But Mercantile, you sit so quietly in stone, a stoic sign your only identification. Yet you are not overlooked.
 
Way the second: Your meal offerings, varied and aplenty. You have better croissants than the nearby French restaurants, which you&#39;d think would boast the best baked, buttery breads. But no! And never before had I seen a &#34;coffee flight&#34;; but there it is, on your breakfast menu, waiting for the connoisseur and novice alike to float along its three cups. And darn good coffee, it is.
 
Your breakfast options continue greatness, from Salmon Rilette to simpler offerings of oats and jams, to a breakfast hash so popular that the &#34;regulars&#34; rebel when it&#39;s unavailable. (True story.) Your attention to palate pleasing is palpable, noticeable, appreciated.
 
Dinner offers plates of swine, fowl, beast, and bottle. I admit, sheepishly, I have not yet tasted the fine evening offerings; I have only admired them from afar... or not so afar, as I sip a beverage at the bar. (More on that later.) But the plating, the presentation, the explanation, the care, the creativity, the wondrous smells... I&#39;ve no doubt they are crowd‑pleasers, a crowd of which I shall become a member, in due time.
 
But dessert! Nothing screams &#34;my night needs a better end&#34; than an order of cream-cheese mousse and ganache, crème fraiche sorbet, and cakes aplenty. I have tasted the carrot cake. I was sad when my plate was again bare. You see, Mercantile, carrot cake is a dessert of my youth, and my expectations were high. You delivered. Though the presentation was fancier than the 9x13 rectangle of my memories, you had my taste buds dancing the night away... while I sat alone, sagging over a bar stool, sipping a drink.
 
Way the third: And those drinks! I had my first Armagnac at Mercantile. And my first Port. And my first Madeira. Now bottles of them all sit in my home. Mercantile, you expanded my drink choices beyond mere wine and beer, cast aside the preconceived notions of what a liquor can do, and served me a fine snifter of liquid contentment. And I&#39;ve but grazed the highest-most tip of the Everest that is your drink menu.
 
Way the fourth: The restaurant and its offerings are but one part of your glorious bounty, Mercantile! I have tasted the cheese by the pound, munched the baguette by the loaf, smelled the meats and teas and preserves. Whether coming or going, the grab-as-you-are options in the market will please all. Collect your things and make the tastiest sandwich you&#39;ve ever had. Or order one prepared by the masters at Mercantile. Sample the jarred, bottled, and canned goods. Wave goodbye to mediocrity in your lunch bag and tango with the kitchen delights you thought only television personalities carried. Forget those phonies! You have Mercantile, dammit!
 
Way the fifth: The fine folks fetching feasts and fluids for the frenzied fans. I have chatted with Stuart, the bar manager and shitshow-handler, extraordinaire. He mans the drinks with creativity and aplomb not always found in high‑paced weekend madness. His compatriots deftly assist; from Nick I have received many a fine recommendation. Never has service been slow or wanting. Nor have I felt turned away from looking, perhaps, less fine than this fine‑dining establishment warrants. No!--that would not be Mercantile&#39;s way.
 
For you see, fine Yelpers, what you are seeking in a night of class, of sophistication, of gastro-enlightenment, you can find next to the train station. Come wanting, leave gratified. It is everything you expect it would be and, also, everything else you couldn&#39;t."

Meh:  Service was  just OK. Staff was friendly and told me to sit down after ordering. Called me back to get my coffee, they forgot about the croissant. Chocolate croissant would have been better if heated so chocolate filling was not hard,
Bad: I love dogs but would have like to see them outside instead of inside. Lady had dog and crate right next to food on shelves. I hope there were no fleas"

I was half expecting someone to come up and try to peddle some &#34;Artisan Firewood.&#34;

Also, if you&#39;re going to have the word &#34;Dining&#34; in your title then maybe it would be a good idea to have more than a snack menu available on a Saturday afternoon. However, there were about 25-30 staff members there milling about and eager to tell you that only their snack menu was available at this time.

Nice patio and ambiance earned a second star but the fact that I couldn&#39;t have a full lunch sort of puts them in the &#34;Incomplete&#34; category."

So we go and check in at Snooze, against my will. I hate Snooze. Their prices are over the top for what appears and tastes to be simple breakfast food. I didn&#39;t think anyone else at Union Station offered breakfast. After hearing that it was a 120 MINUTE WAIT from the somewhat snotty hostess, I turned on my heel and walked out. But wait....Mercantile was open and bright. They serve breakfast?! 

So Craig and I sit down and get chocolate milk and coffee and low and behold....they have house made pickles! We ordered a bacon caramel sticky bun ($4!) the Mercantile Hash ($10), 2 over easy eggs ($3), a prosecco, a Bloody Mary, and the pickles ($3). Turns out...it&#39;s a whole PLATE of pickles! Bonus. 

The bartender/server was AWESOME. We got to watch the patisserie pull the croissants out of the oven, and the barbacks make espressos and lattes. Furthermore....the bill, with a champagne and a Bloody Mary, was $38. YOU SNOOZE YOU LOSE! Who would seriously wait 120 minutes? My breakfast had Fruition farm fresh Brussels sprouts, parsnips, cured ham, a poached egg over house made hash browns and a lemon hollandaise. 

I&#39;ll be back for the bone marrow. xo."

We had been wanting to try Mercantile for a few months now, and finally had the chance to stop in.  There were 4 of us, and Monica was our server.  She was lovely.  It was mom&#39;s birthday, and we noted that in the reservation, and they did so many adorable things to celebrate.  We got tasters of some wine upon arrival, and a beautiful &#39;happy birthday&#39; in melted chocolate on the plate of a dessert we ordered.  AND a card from the staff.  So sweet.  On to the food........wow wow wow.  We all noted how execution was on point.  All of the food ooked amazing.  We started with the king crab and a pork dish.  Both were delicious.  For entrees, two of us had the lamb gnocchi (A+), the seabass, and pork shank.  We finished with the carrot cake and another chocolate dessert.

The space is very nice looking, bright, uniquely furnished. 

The barista who we placed our order with was very very friendly and polite, definitely made us feel welcome. 

The food was top notch. I had the croque madame and my boyfriend had the pastrami hash. Neither were huge portions, but they were definitely sufficient and both very rich, so they were just right, both were VERY delicious. 

I will definitely be back to try out their dinner menu. I&#39;m a big fan. The bread and pastries are all made in house and they have a market that sells some interesting sounding items which I also look forward to trying. 

It&#39;s going to be a little more expensive than your average cafe, but the food was high quality and certainly worth it."

Our waiter was great and didn&#39;t say anything when we stayed and chatted for another 15 minutes after paying our bill.

They had veggie options, gluten free options, spicy bloody Mary&#39;s, and everything tasted wonderful. If there weren&#39;t so many brunch places to try in Denver I&#39;d definitely go back.

We sat at the bar and had the following:
-cider glazed pork benny 
-smoked salmon board
-cappuccino
-espresso
-spicy Bloody Mary
-pink mimosa 

Everything was superb. The smoked salmon plate was an interesting spin on the cold smoked salmon I prefer- it was a hot smoked salmon but still very good. I would have preferred a good cream cheese instead of creme fraiche but that&#39;s just me. My husband was very happy with his pork Benny dish and said the eggs were poached to perfection.

Cool place, great food and drink. We will make a point to come here more often."

A little on the fatty side but that is to be expected with that cut. I didn&#39;t order a cocktail, but their menu was enticing. Not too many to chose from but at least one of each of the basic bar liqueurs. The menu was surprisingly small, so it was hard to decide what to get. Also a bit pricey but the portions were decent and bigger portions than most small plates menus I&#39;ve experienced. I would go back again to try another dish and cocktails."

My group of six descended on a cold yucky Sunday morning in April when it was snowing and sleeting. Duo was bustling bright and festive and warmed us up immediately. Festive napkins and table setting and the bright interior were cheerful on that morning.

We had to ask for the waiter to come over finally after waiting for 10 minutes or so, so that we could get our coffees ordered. We all ordered separately and enjoyed everything we ate. I had the eggs Benedict which were exceptional, and other people tried the eggs in a basket and the specialty omelette and the scrambled eggs and hash.

It was a delightful Sunday morning. I will go back to Duo in a heartbeat."

We got there right at 10 and were seated right away, no problem.  And what else can I say?  The daily pastry was an incredible chocolate chip muffin that they served with perfectly softened butter and my bacon scramble was so well executed.  There&#39;s nothing more terrifying than ordering a scramble and wondering if the eggs are going to be a complete disaster, but Duo knows what they&#39;re doing.  Oh and how fun is ordering a large French Press?  I&#39;ll certainly be back."

The time between breakfast and lunch is too short sometimes. While brunch takes care of both meals. Especially during lazy days. Or weekends.

This is definitely a very cute spot. During Saturday&#39;s a farmers market right outside adds to the festive air. The day we came here it was Saturday. Halloween. The four of us scored a table with a reservation where we had a nice vantage point. Costumed customers surrounded us. Immediately I noticed their cute cloth table napkins. 

I had the Sweet Sunday. It&#39;s poached eggs, grilled ciabatta, greens, shiitake mushrooms, onion confit, white grain mustard cream sauce and crispy potatoes. Perfect poached eggs. Fresh greens. Crunchy bread. Heaven! 

No weekend brunch is complete without a mimosa. Get their Pink Mimosa. You want this. If you like  grapefruit. 

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Food was great and I will say this place is trendy but casual. Great mix of beautiful people:)"

I&#39;ve been to Duo on three separate occasions for dinner and have yet to be let down. Although I was sad their menu had changed during our latest visit since I was looking forward to their calamari pasta appetizer, however the short rib elk gnocchi more than made up for it.

Nice staff all the way around, from the greeters to the wait staff.  I also thought the atmosphere was great with the floor to ceiling windows and cozy-farmhouse feel.  Also, like some other reviewers have mentioned, plenty of room between tables and good for a family to have brunch.

We had no problems with the food.  It was really tasty and I love my french toast with the homemade strawberry/butter compote that was on top. Really good.  The french press coffee was strong and not bitter at all.  They have a really affordable menu all around, including the kid&#39;s menu.

So the menu was small but my boyfriend and I ended up splitting our dishes. For which the staff generously split them into two plates for you - thank you! We chose the lamb and gnocchi dish and the bow tie pasta (with calamari). As good as the food looked, I was disappointed to find that the only &#34;spice&#34; that was used was too much salt and maybe a little pepper? I wish I was still carrying around packets of sriracha like I did in my earlier years (lol). But putting aside the rather salty flavor, the lamb was tender and everything had a nice consistency. I guess I just like flavor in my food instead of bland salt and questionable two sprinkles of pepper."

The menu seems to change seasonally; the menu posted on Yelp isn&#39;t accurate at the moment. Check out the website for a more up to date look at what they offer. We started with the roasted potted squash which really set the tone for the evening. It was served with creamy brie and toasted cranberry bread. The plating was beautiful, it really fit the mood of the whole restaurant. Little things like that really win me over.  And it tasted as good as it looked! Then we shared a salad which the kitchen was kind enough to split for us and serve on two plates, great service. The entrees were delicious and by looking at the plates on tables around us, I don&#39;t think you could go wrong. They all look so good.

Let me suggest that you save room for dissert. We got cookies with steamed vanilla milk. YUM. The cookies must change daily but we got to try the molasses and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. It made me want a steamer at home so I could have warm milk and cookies every night.

Duo is a restaurant inside of a much larger building, that is actually attached to another restaurant.  It is a typical &#34;rustic, Denver restaurant&#34; with an &#34;old brick interior&#34;.  

We showed up a little early for mimosas and Bloody Mary&#39;s.  My wife got the pink lemonade mimosa.  I got a Bloody Mary that was so good, I got two more! 

For my entrée, I got the cider glazed pork benedict for $12.  It came with gently poached eggs on top of a delicious bed of pulled pork.  All that on top of a toasted piece of ciabatta bread topped with a creamy hollandaise sauce.  Golden brown fried potatoes came with the meal.  It was delicious.  Decadent and perfect for a holiday meal.  My wife likes eggs, but they upset her stomach.  She does however, like all of the other ingredients in most omelets.   After having this conversation with our server, she put in an order for an onion, Pepper, mushroom, and potato hash.  Our server brought out some hot sauce and my wife was in heaven.  It was very nice of them to accommodate my quirky wife on a busy holiday.

I got the colorado brisket crock, and it was delicious. The scrambled eggs on top were perfect, and the brisket was moist. Portion sizes were also good.

Cons: We got the bread board for a starter (banana bread, Rosemary scone, cinnamon almond bread). The lemon butter that came with was light and perfect for the board. But, the banana bread was definitely dry, making it hardly edible. Everything else was great. Also, service was slow today, probably because many people were there for Mother&#39;s Day. 

Overall, a neat place to have brunch."

We had a homemade fettuccini pasta with eggplant and zucchini  for an appetizer and it was amazing. We nearly licked the bowl clean. Two of us ordered the grilled salmon and we both agreed it was the best salmon we had ever had. The third person in our group ordered the pork chop, which was also delicious. The atmosphere was very cozy, great place for a small group. The only downside was that parking was very hard to find. Can&#39;t wait to come back here and try other things on the menu!"

Started with corn fritters (delicious!), bean dip (small &amp; forgettable), and rabbit pasta (also small and unremarkable). 

Dinner was pork chops (great smokey flavor) and fried chicken--the biggest disappointment of the night. It&#39;s one fried chicken leg (w/thigh), mashed potatoes &amp; carrots for $22.  

Service was friendly and sloooooow. We&#39;d been seated for a half hour before cocktails arrived. At the one hour point, we were eating our salads.  Two cooks, two waiters, and the place was packed solid. 

I loves me an expensive great meal, but Friday night at Duo did not deliver.  $75bucks per head (drinks, no dessert) and I left hungry."

We were so impressed with dinner that we ordered dessert!  We split the Coconut and Lime (a recommendation from our server) and the Chocolate Hazelnut Torte.  I could not get enough of the torte (perfectly smooth and rich), but the Coconut and Lime was also excellent.

$11 &#34;Sweet Sunday&#34;: poached eggs / grilled ciabatta / greens / shiitake mushrooms / onion confit / whole grain mustard cream sauce / crispy potatoes

$10 chocolate French toast: baguette / hazelnut yogurt / sour cherry glaze

I really thought this place was A-OK in terms of food. The atmosphere was a bit more than A-OK because of their cute/quaint/quirky decorating touches i.e. flower printed cloth napkins w/ napkin rings, brick walls, colored wood frames as a room divider, Moroccan star lanterns, placemats with kids&#39; recipes, Pooh bear quotes in the menu &amp; a magnetic spoon on the bill/receipt. You&#39;ll notice the quirky appeal immediately before even entering Duo because their front entrance door is narrow/small &amp; almost unrecognizable as the entrance at first glance. 

I thought the flavors of the French toast were alright but weren&#39;t too complimentary. Something about toasty bread with sour glaze that didn&#39;t excite me too much. I didn&#39;t think the tartness of the cherries would translate to sour by the level that it did. 

The Sweet Sunday was good but would not make my top ten list for most memorable brunch items. The crispy potatoes had great texture, color &amp; cut (you&#39;d think I was talking about hair) but were too salty."

Winning over my parents and aunt was a big accomplishment since they often do not like neighborhood places. A victory! 

Everyone enjoyed their meal, with the highlights being the zippy cake, French toast, and the vegetarian strata. I got the zippy cake and enjoyed every bite. I was worried that it would be too meaty but had just enough sausage to offer flavor and texture. The eggs, greens and a delicious caper tomato sauce made for a memorable meal. Yum! 

My mom said the strata was delicious and flavorful, with a nice side salad. My husband also really loved the French toast, with its interesting crumble topping and a lemon cream instead of syrup.

We ordered a bread board, which was good for a group although I do think the lemon butter was a bit too lemony (and I love lemon). The pink mimosa was very good, if you like grapefruit. The bacon was possibly the best bacon I have eaten. We even got an extra order after our meal was finished because it was so delicious. Yum! Perfect saltiness and flavor. 

Duo is pretty uptight about reservations, requiring a credit card and then calling with a reminder. I guess too many people must cancel but that process felt a little arduous, especially if it had only been for two of us.
Still, I would happily make another arduous reservation because the meal was really good, service was friendly, and I succeeded in finding a non-chain that my parents will tolerate."

The menu is pretty complicated and filled with words that a table of 7 well educated people didn&#39;t recognize. Not to mention there are only like 8 entree plates on menu ! Finally 4 of us decide on the lamb meatballs, they come back and tell us they don&#39;t have it. Then we all switch to pork and they only have 3 of it and then they come back and tell us now they have the meatballs .... 

For all this complication the manager went above and beyond and brought us like every app on the menu! Really nice of them! The octopus was amazing! 

Finally my fiancé got the lamb and I got the pork. My pork was way undercooked so I sent it back. It came back at a much nicer temp and tasted ok but the hubby&#39;s meatballs were way better then my plate! Both are attached in pictures!

We didn&#39;t get drinks bc the beer menu didn&#39;t have enough variety for our tastes and the wine list was too expensive!!

We showed up as they were opening given a tiny table. The rest of the dining quickly filled up so I can see why you&#39;d need a reservation. 

The ambiance is great, the do a lot with the small space. The only downside is the lack of a patio.  The food is fantastic! I really enjoyed the habañero infused bloody mary, I just wish there was more of it for $8. Same thing on the french press coffee. The breakfast bread plate is a little pricy at $10 but it&#39;s also amazing!

They have a bar right when you walk in with a knowledgeable bartender. The brunch menu has more  savory offerings than sweet, but they did have chocolate brioche french toast and daily pastry rotations. Seems like a nice place for a brunch date or girls/bro brunch.

Shared the Raspberry crumble with their lemon curd and something-grapefruit jam. Delicious! Eggs in the Basket was comforting but not too heavy. Who doesn&#39;t love a runny egg in the am. The benedict was also delicious. French press coffee to order is also a must on a cold morning. 

Service. Prompt, knowledgeble, and friendly without being overly intrusive.

The beet soup has a very distinct flavor. It&#39;s light but yet flavorful with a hint of brussel sprout. Lamb was alright, but the portion was filling. The best entrée was the pork shank. Very tender and flavorful. I had the winter veggie dish and it was right on! 

The food definitely lives up to its expectation although I wasn&#39;t blown away or anything. Well, after dinning at so many awesome places around the globe, it&#39;s hard to knock my socks off now. But I will definitely go back for its food. 

Now onto the service and décor. That&#39;s where I took a star off. The service was slooooow. We were ignored for like 10 mins. Not one came to greet us until I said something. The restaurant can sure use some creativity and artistic remodeling. It felt like an old Highland bar instead of a trendy restaurant. 

But hey, if you are going for the food, it&#39;s a good place to go especially when they offer such a good menu for just $30.

It&#39;s probably because of the star ornaments hanging from the ceiling and the &#34;walls&#34; within the restaurant compiled of windows. It divided the big space into two compartments in a very interesting way. In addition, I loved reading various 4 year old&#39;s recipes for breakfast items on the placemats we used. It provided a lot of things to look at while we waited for our food. 

Now let&#39;s talk about the food. I ordered the orange mimosa which was delicious. At first I was intrigued by the pink mimosa which I thought was blood orange but turns out it was grapefruit so I didn&#39;t get it since I am not a big grapefruit fan. Glad I went with orange though, very refreshing and quite strong actually! My boyfriend tried the sunrise and omg it looks girly but it&#39;s so strong! For starter, we shared the bread plate which was absolutely delicious. I loved the butter it came with as well as the jam. my favorite breads were probably the sweet muffin like ones. It was a lot of bread so we took some home to allow room for our main courses. I ordered the jalapeno chicken burger which was absolutely delicious! The chicken was crunchy but not overly oily. I loved the sauce it came with which was the pink sauce on top of vegetables that topped the chicken. I love me some jalapenos and there were plenty. It wasn&#39;t overly spicy though which I am glad. It was the perfect amount. I wish, however, that they would serve the burger with parmesan fries or some kind of specialty fries rather than the weird big thin chips it came with. My boyfriend got their special sweet sunday which was meh. There wasn&#39;t anything special about it except maybe the potatoes which were pretty good. 

Bill for all this came out to be around 70 dollars with tip which if pretty hefty for brunch but we did get drinks. I was definitely very full and happy =)"

It has a terrific brunch and has unique dishes that taste divine. But... how many pieces of dirty flatware/dishes do you have to find before you wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen? Does it take the staff that much effort to look at the silverware, cups, and plates as they set tables?

My friend and I sat down eagerly for brunch this past Saturday. We&#39;d been looking forward to brunching together for weeks. As soon as we sit down, we notice that one coffee cup isn&#39;t quite clean. Ok. Fine. We ask for another. No big.

Then, we ponder the delicious offerings and our nice waiter clarifies for us some of our questions. Then we notice that her fork has some dried food on it. EUW.

But our food (we ordered the applewood smoked bacon scramble, the cider braised pork benedict, and a side of cheesy grits to share. And a large pot of french pressed coffee. There was not a speck left behind, so I assume my friend&#39;s dish was as delicious as mine.

Thanks for being fancy, yet down to earth. You made my young family feel at home and welcomed a toddler&#39;s charms, rewarding him with a bag of blocks and abundant smiles. 

The hubby and I came here for a nice early dinner out, baby in tow. Staff and service is stellar - despite the high end look there is no high brow attitude. From hostess to prep cook, everyone was engaging, friendly, and attentive. That says a lot, and guarantees our return.
I ordered a cauliflower salad and the bison slab of the day (sirloin). The cauliflower salad, with shavings of hard cheese, perfectly toasted nuts and roasted cauliflower over faintly dressed spinach was a perfect start to the meal. I was eagerly anticipating my steak!
When the bison came out, the first thing I noticed was the sad lack of mushrooms. The pairing of meat to mushroom was absolutely exquisite, but only occured every third bite or so. By itself the meat, though perfectly cooked, was a little bland. The scalloped potatoes at the side also felt underseasoned - promises of horseradish unfulfilled left me confused and slightly crestfallen. I wanted to like it as much as my server, but alas it was solidly okay. (#firstworldproblems)
My husband made a meal out of the apple cabbage salad and Celery leek soup. He thoroughly enjoyed it and was satisfied, although to my snobby palate both dishes felt forced in their flavors; the cheese in the salad overwhemling subtler earthy and sweet notes, and the soup being sweet and complex yet missing something I cannot put my finger on. 
I adore the chef&#39;s willingness to use earthy flavors throughout - the menu and the meal was full of earthy, rooty flavors which are so perfect for a chilly November evening. Many kitchens fail to showcase this robustness, instead relying on reliable salt and sweet to carry the meal through.
Speaking of - the Chocolate semifreddo was gorgeous both to eye and tongue; it&#39;s cake bits deep and chocolatey, offset by cool, creamy mousse-like semifreddo and sparkling zings of candied ginger and holiday spices in the pools of chocolate sauce. I enjoyed it with, surprisingly, the best cup of decaf coffee I&#39;ve ever had. If anything, heading back to Duo for dessert and coffee is a must do while Im in Denver.
In summation: Service was stellar; kitchen, waitress and hostess very friendly, dessert is divine but the creative menu needs a little more attention in execution to earn 5 stars in my book!"

Farm to table vibe with high quality ingredients - I&#39;d highly recommend the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. They have a kids portion of the sourdough french toast that my 2 year old devoured. Also - great selection of brunch cocktails!
duo-denver,Riza H. C.,e3fX7_qkoSm-6-yTdlwcXw,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,359,4,31jW7vILOBD1XuaxDjg80g,4.0,2013-11-08,"I have been to this establishment many moons aka &#34;YEARS&#34; ago, for Brunch.  Made a Dinner reservation for our meetup group to have a feast on what Duo can offer.  

Take note if you make a reservation more for 12 people, unfortunately you cannot do it online but just leave a message thru Duo phone number.  Someone definitely will return back your call.  The lovely staffs, indeed answered several of my queries what nots especially if you have Food Allergies in your party what nots.  

Do take note, they also require your Credit Card Number in order for you to make your reservation.  They will charge $25, if you have a NO SHOW for your reservation etc etc.  Yes this are some of the protocols that I have to undergo.

Thankfully, when I arrived early like about 17:05hrs ish on Saturday Evening October 26th 2013, my name is on the reservation list.  One of the staffs said she will get our table ready while she very politely ask me, if I could seat while I wait at the Bar in which I obliged.  The bartender, also offer me water while I wait for abit.

That evening, we had a party of 9.  The reservation was for 17:30hrs.  Once our table is ready which Duo situated us nearest to the Kitchen, where all the Action Begins NON-STOP.

Our main Server his name is Nick.  He is indeed prompt, welcoming, inviting and very efficient.  He explained thoroughly all what we need to know from the Duo Menu and even go to that extra length when I ask specifically about Pork, or Ham or Swine products in their Menu. 

From the Menu, this were the items I ordered that evening :

Appetizers : 
*  Braised Octopus ($12.00)
*  Chicken Liver Mousse ($9.00)

Main Entrée :

*  Lamb Mixed Grill ($26.00)

I did not expect the Octopus dish for an appetizer to be too tomato-y, and only a few of Octopus found in the dish.  The Flavor was robust but the Octopus tend to be on a tough side.  The Octopus dish comes with white beans, san marzano tomatoes and bread crumbs.  I was hoping to have more Toasted Breads in order to dip, those Tomatoes &#34;stew&#34;.

As for another Appetizer of Chicken Liver Mousse, yes it was indeed Divine, and I shared with everyone at the table.  The Chicken Liver Mousse comes with pistachios, pickled apricots, smoked mustard, apple gelee and Irish butter toast. Some of my friends like it, some don&#39;t.  Though I cannot deny, for the leftovers I had of this Chicken Liver Mousse, it tends to get more salty and the smell can be nauseating if you are not used to it.

Now for my Main Entrée of Lamb Mixed Grill.  Actually this dish is cooked in 3 ways aka Lamb in 3 ways.  The actual dish comes with Lamb MeatBalls, Shredded/Braised Lamb and Lamb On The Bone with some vegetables.  When I found out that the Lamb Meatballs is mixed with Pork before the Dinner, Nick, our Main Server, suggest that I can substitute the Lamb Meatballs with Sweetbreads.  My Oh My, I am in love with my order of Lamb Mixed Grill.

The Lamb Mixed Grill comes with celery root &amp; potato puree, sheep&#39;s milk yogurt,  young carrots and lamb jus.  Once again, the portions are tiny and the pricing were high but I like my dish ALOT!  Especially the sweetbreads in which I was hoping for more.  The Lamb on the bone, I opt to be cooked well done. 

Food portion can be tiny for some.  Some of my friends like what they ordered though some thought it was A-Okay, and some did not fancy with little vegetables in their Main Entrée or the Pork Cheek were FRIED hence the Flavor did not come thru.

By the end of our Dinner, some of my friends order the Desserts.  Once again, some like it, some said it was just A-Okay...  By the evening that went by, this establishment is packed to the Brim.  So RESERVATION is DEFINITELY necessary.  Good in my books they allow separate checks for our group.
20% Gratuity was Included in our check.  

Then why the 4 stars??  Coz everything is good, from the staffs, our Main Server Nick, the food, but NOT the pricing and the portion.  Kudos to the Chef, and everyone that made this Dinner a success.  Yes, its FARMED to Table Dining experience, and you have to pay for the price to eat this well.  I&#39;ll stick to 4 stars since these were my observations.

Unfortunately, you need to have either really tasty/interesting small portions with many components or alternatively larger plates that are executed well to compete in the Denver food scene. Duo didn&#39;t accomplish either. I dined here during restaurant week, which should be the time of the year when restaurants are showing off their best food to attract new diners that usually wouldn&#39;t go there. Unfortunately, it seems as if Restaurant Week is now over-hyped and just a scheme to serve sub-par really small plates and make alot of money.

Our meal started off with a red leaf/endive salad which was terrible. It was plated on what would be comparable to a tea saucer. There was about 3 large pieces of lettuce, 2 figs, and some shredded cheese. The dressing as essentially olive oil without any flavor. Absolutely terrible for a restaurant who boasts unique and high class food. The entree of arctic chard was surprisingly good. Fish was cooked nicely and so were the beets/potatoes on the side. The only problem was the menu described Trout with roasted vegetables. Like....WTF?! How can you have something on the menu and then bring out an entirely different dish. Amateur hour. Dessert was some &#34;homemade&#34; sorbet that was worse then Ben and Jerrys. 

I&#39;ve eaten here once before and thought it was OK. After this time, I won&#39;t ever return or recommend it to anyone I know.

Advice to the restaurant - Step up your food if you want any chance in competing with all of the great restaurants we have here in Denver."

The service is pleasant and helpful. We came in on a packed Saturday morning and the place was crowded and the kitchen was slammed. Our server was very nice and brought us a small sample of their breakfast pastry as we patiently waited for our food to arrive. Once our food got there, we were more than happy to wait for it. I had the pork benedict and it definitely delivered on taste! 

We also really liked the bloody mary and the bellini and  mimosa."

First of all this place is located near the trendy shops and bars in the highlands so afterwards you can get a drink with your friends or ice cream at little man!  I was also surprised at all the parking.

Once we sat down the service was awesome.  Cocktail and wine list was satisfying and the food was delicious.

-English pea Brushetta.  A runny egg on top of goat cheese? Perfection.
-Cornmeal crusted rabbit: Need I say more? Tangy mustard dipping sauce to go with it
-lamb meatballs.  I honestly ate every last bite.  The lamb was tender and the sheep&#39;s milk yogurt sauce just zoinked up all the flavors!! Still drooling over this dish.
-My husband got the flank steak which was meh.  After my taste buds went gaga over the lamb meatballs, this tasted pale in comparison. 

It&#39;s a cozy small restaurant with plenty of drinks and dining options.  Heck yes I&#39;ll be back!"

The service is another story. The first time was dinner (not a busy day) and the server seemed aloof. Fast forward to brunch and bar seats- the bartender should rethink his career. If it wasn&#39;t for the nice dish I enjoyed I would never consider going back.

As some of you know I was having a heck of a time finding a place that would take a reservation for 8 people at 6:30pm on a Wednesday for my birthday dinner. Duo accommodated us, and we got the very nice table in the front by the window.

I immediately ordered the Highland Underground, which was a beet infused vodka martini with blue cheese olives. I loved it. It was earthy and refreshing, and who doesn&#39;t love blue cheese olives? 

For an appetizer I ordered the Gruyere Gougeres which are essentially cheese pate a choux filled with sauteed mushrooms. They were phenomenal. My friend was lucky I shared 1/2 of one with her... I was feeling greedy... it was my birthday after all. The server said that was probably their most popular appetizer, the braised bacon steak being the second most popular. I tried my husbands braised bacon and found it way too soft and fatty for my liking, but he finished the whole thing.

For dinner I got the brisket. It was melt-in-your-mouth cut-with-a-spoon delicious. This was also paired with beets and spaetzle. I&#39;ve never had spaetzle- the crispness was a lovely compliment to the tender brisket. I had a gluten-free friend in attendance, who ordered the sea bass, and they happily substituted the breaded polenta cake that came with the dish with a gluten-free side dish of roasted root vegetables and lentils. 

We brought our own birthday cake (they charge a $3pp cake serving fee) and ordered coffee, and certain friends ordered more wine...

We never felt rushed, and our server did a great job with our party and answered our questions thoughtfully. He explained things thoroughly and checked on us frequently without being overbearing. It was a fun, intimate celebration and not colossally expensive.

I&#39;m going back for brunch ASAP. And ordering a martini. That&#39;s what 30-year-olds do."

I booked a reservation and was seated immediately upon arrival. The dining room has a lot of energy, but you&#39;ll have to exercise caution getting to/from your seat because they packed the room tight with tables. Having had the food, I can see why!

My dining companion and I began with a cocktail and fresh pastries. I had a gin pickler cocktail. I&#39;ve never known how nicely pickle brine pairs with gin. The pastries are made in-house by their outstanding pastry chef.

Don&#39;t let the name fool you, Sweet Sunday is a great savory brunch dish. Their crusty bread just begs for the poached egg yolk and creamy sauce.

This happens to be in my neighborhood, but it&#39;s a brunch worthy of a drive. Because they take reservations, it&#39;s a great brunch place for late-risers who don&#39;t want to wait an hour for a table."

My friends and I were here for the weekend and staying nearby so we got to walk over here. We were seated quickly which was awesome since we were a large party. 

The service was great and the food was fantastic! We shared one pastry platter though it was so good I could&#39;ve eaten a whole one by myself. The chocolate muffin tasted like a fluffy brownie. The breads were really good and the poppy seed scone was delicious. 

My husband and I shared the Colorado Brisket Crock and the Kirby Cake. Both were really good. The Kirby Cake was different with the fried grits, spinach, and perfectly poached eggs with a tomato caper sauce. The Crock was great with bell peppers, brisket, and cheddar scrambled eggs. Yum!

Their dinner menu looked tasty too. Wish I had known to go while I was there. If I make it back to Denver, I&#39;ll definitely come back!"

I love the exposed brick and the unique tea cups for each guest. The individual napkins and napkin rings added a personalized and welcoming touch! 

We came as a group of 7 and seating and reservation was not a problem. 

Like most reviews the sweet Sunday was delicious and as an FYI is similar to their Benedict just different meat. Their salad was fresh and light for the health nuts as well a their quiche of the day. But their bacon of the day was amazing with a kick of jalapeño!! A must try! Overall, everything was flavorful and you can really taste the difference of a farm to table restaurant. 

Service was warm and welcoming like their ambiance. If I&#39;m ever back in town I will have to try some of their sweet dishes too."

I like how they take reservations because that seems to be a dying service at some restaurants in the Highlands. We went for Easter brunch and it was packed! You have to get the pink mimosa. Trust me when I say I know my mimosas and if I recommend it then it must be good. Though it was only filled to half the glass.. A heavy pour runs in the family so I&#39;m just used to more. I got the Pork Benedict which was so good. It was on the smaller side (which I think is a good thing!) and had potatoes. I&#39;m a big fan of the smaller portions so I don&#39;t have to unbutton my pants to walk afterwards. The atmosphere was really nice too, it looks like an old house (maybe it was).

That being said, I&#39;m a fan of Duo. I&#39;ve been there twice and never had a bad meal (minus the aforementioned wilted greens, but that was my own fault for ordering them). While cramped, I do love the space. It might be hard to navigate the space, but once you&#39;re seated, there&#39;s plenty of room.

My favorite thing about this place though is the placemats. They asked kids to tell them their favorite recipes and then wrote them out and put them on the placemats. And they are absolutely hilarious. For example: A recipe for Chicken with Cheese: &#34;Put chicken in oven for 5 minutes. Then put ketchup on chicken. Enjoy.&#34; They make me smile and giggle every time."

Bacon wrapped dates--always delicious, if a bit on salty side. The pistachio crumble was a nice added touch.

Everything on the menu looked good so it was hard to narrow it down.  Our waiter gave us feedback which helped to narrow it down.  We tried a lot of items on the menu due to the size of the group:

Potted Roasted Squash - The addition of the burrata made this dish awesome.  I would have liked a tad more sage in the squash

Sardine Crostini - Light, fresh flavors

Fried Pork Cheeks - This was my husband&#39;s favorite dish of the night.  Crispy fried pork with really smooth sweet potato puree - fantastic!

Warm Autumn Salad - I just tried a bite but the fig and dressing combination was spot on

Chicken Liver Mousse - VERY good!

Pork Porterhouse - This was my favorite dish and luckily what I ordered so I got to eat most of it.  The fried brussel sprouts with the saltier pork was a fantastic combo

Lamb Three Ways - My husband enjoyed his dish except for the sweetbreads (only one person liked them).  I thought the rib eye was the only thing I could have eaten on the plate which was good.  The meatball was very gamey to me.

Sticky Toffee Pudding - I was ready to lick out the pot it came in - so, so good.

S&#39;Mores Cake - I just had a bite of this but the chocolate was rich and deeply satisfying.

Lindsey K., Chris K. and Sam S. plus myself ventured to Duo for brunch, late brunch.  I highly recommend reservations since at an 11:30 arrival on Sunday we were quoted a 60 minute wait.  To there credit we were actually seated within 45 minutes.  Always nice when they over deliver on seating times.

Being the Yelpers that we are I think most of us had already perused the menu a bot before being seated, I definitely did.  Our waitress was sweet and I always love a place that leaves a bottle of water on the table.  Saves time for the waitstaff and keeps me with water for my meal.

I really enjoy the smaller menu.  It had variety but not 10 pages of variety.  I think a smaller and better executed menu is the way to go.  Our table enjoyed:

Pink Mimosa - Made with grapefruit juice
Coffee - Served in a mini french press
Bloody Mary - With some minor alterations that were followed perfectly
Cider Glazed Pork Benedict - Yolks running down the side, crispy side of potato&#39;s and melt in your mouth pork
Stuffed French Toast - Stuffer with cranberries and apples, you say wha?
Pork Hash - I didn&#39;t order this but I wish I had, Lindsey K. had this and I could have eaten her entire plate.  The house made pork sausage was to die for.  Make me some anytime!

We had an outstanding meal with very good service and drinks.  I really enjoyed getting to go out with my fellow Yelpers and have a nice brunch I think many more are to come.  A new place every time let&#39;s say.

With a drink a piece give or take the meal turning out being $20 or so a person which is a great price for the quality of food you get.  I think an hour wait is long for some places and might go somewhere else, I think I would actually wait the hour for this brunch again!

Started off with the lemon gnocchi which was cooked perfectly. I loved the creamy sauce and the gnocchi literally melted in my mouth. It was the perfect start to dinner and great portion size.

Take reservations? Check. Has bomb diggity bloody marys? Check. Boasts a solid brunch menu? Check. Has a trendy atmosphere that makes you feel like a special person brunching with all other trendy people? Check!

To start off, the bloody mary is stacked with all the right ingredients. Spicy Bloody Mary mix, celery, a hearty amount of olives, and just the right amount Worchestshire and Horse Radish. If it weren&#39;t for that damn responsibility thing I could have downed three more of those. My entress, the Salmon Nicoise salad is straight up delicious with a fun unexpected ingredient: radishes! A huge chunk of salmon accompanies a bed of fresh greens. It&#39;s an aesthetically beautiful and colorful plate that is equally delicious. A definite recommend in my book!"

We had made a reservation on OpenTable and were sat immediately upon arrival (granted, our reservation was for 5:30p and they didn&#39;t start getting busy until after 6p). We were offered complimentary olives and crackers to tide us over as we waited for our food to come out. Got several appetizers to share: Warm Asparagus, Crispy Fresh Chickpeas, Buffalo Carpaccio, and Beer Battered Spring Veggies. All were delicious, although a bit small to be sharing with more than 2-3 people.

I got the Lemon Ricotta Dumplings for my entree and was blown away. The dumplings had just a touch of lemon that was enough to make your mouth water, but not pucker. The confit was perfectly savory. I think this may have been the best pasta dish I&#39;ve ever had!

For dessert, we got one of everything - make sure you order the Mijao Chocolate Mousse, if chocolate&#39;s your thing. I had to hold myself back from licking the cup clean.

Service was wonderful. They didn&#39;t have any busboys (as other reviewers mentioned), but our waitress was extremely prompt in cleaning up our dishes as soon as we finished. Water was regularly refilled, and she would pay attention to when we finished our cocktails to offer more. I don&#39;t think we ever had to get her attention for anything!"

About half way through our lunch the wind picked up and no one at the table really noticed until the umbrella at our table fell out of its stand and hit me directly on the head!! It hurt quite a bit but I was fine. The host came out and was frantic about the umbrella falling over but didn&#39;t even ask me if I was OK at all or needed anything.  It wasn&#39;t too hot of a day so we didn&#39;t want to put the umbrella back up in case it fell back over again but the host insisted that he could fix it and get it secured back in place. We just wanted to finish our lunch but he spent about 5 min leaning over our table to try and fix the umbrella and not listening to us saying we didn&#39;t want it up. We finally just let him put it up so we could finish eating.

It was still windy out and the umbrella started to rock again so we took it down because clearly, the host didn&#39;t actually do anything to secure it back in place.  About 5 minutes later, the umbrella from the table next to us blew over and hit me in the arm!!

I was pretty ticked off at this point but I&#39;m not one to make a scene so we just asked to be moved inside to finish our beers. Again, I wasn&#39;t asked if I was OK (luckily that second umbrella didn&#39;t hurt as much as the first) and they barely apologized for what happened and didn&#39;t offer to make it up to me in anyway.

I will not be returning to Rhein Haus."

They have bocce courts inside, which I have not partaken in, as I have read in a few other reviews it can be difficult to reserve a court. I am more interested in beer and food, which rein haus does very well. 

The last 2 occasions we have ordered the pork schnitzel. It&#39;s excellent. Perfect for us to share as usual, they always split it up for us so we get our own plate. The schnitzel is topped with a lemon butter sauce with capers and a green apple slaw. The flavors mend together so well. This is pretty much our &#34;go to meal&#34; at RH. We have also sampled the pretzels with obatzda and the mini sliders. Every thing has been great. 

Beer is beer, they have quite the list of German beers of course, but I also saw a gal at the bar drinking a dry dock apricot blonde, so they don&#39;t just serve &#34;rein haus beer.&#34; They have some special cocktails that they&#39;ve created and I can highly recommend the Voodoo one."

We waited until happy hour (starts at 3) to order any food. We got the currywurst, pretzel bites, fries and an order of mini brauts. The currywurst was unique and delicious. The fries were fries. The mini-brauts, in my opinion had too much bread to meat ratio. I found myself eating the meat and fixins with a fork and not eating the buns.

We were quickly greeted upon entering the establishment and promptly seated on the 2nd floor near the windows.  I love the feel of being taken away, as if I was really in a mountain resort somewhere in Europe.  The details of the interior design was so beautifully done!  

Great beer selection, huge stein glasses too!  Feeling like working out my biceps while feasting on big beers and delicious food.  We didn&#39;t get to try their dinner menu and just the Happy Hour menu.  I was a little bummed that they were out of the slider buns so I couldn&#39;t experience the chicken schnitzel slider sandwiches that our server raved about, but the little mini-wurst in the mini hot dog buns were delicious and adorable.  

Fries with the curry ketchup and also the currywurst were really delicious as well.  Of course, we had to try the pretzel bites and they were great with this dipping sauce that resembled pimento cheese, my mouth waters just thinking about it.  Our server Josh was awesome and so was the pretty bocce lady (didn&#39;t get her name but she had a Viking&#39;s t-shirt.) Great recommendation on drinks and food from Josh and he also pre-taught us the game before we went up to the bocce court.

I can see this place having the need for on-site security when mixing drinking and bocce (competition) people might get really loud, or rowdy, especially near a college campus down town.....  but with the fun and friendly staff, great food/drinks, I can see Rhein Haus being really successful here in Denver!

We started with the House pretzels, and three different dips. The pretzels were good, not too crunchy, not too soft, just right (baby bear would have loved them!) These were small enough, yet large enough, just the right size for an appetizer.

For dinner we split a FLAMMKUCHEN - a German flatbread. We had the Romesco, which came with romesco sauce / house made Canadian bacon / fontina / mizuna. This was large enough for two people to split. Along with the two pretzels, it really was a good meal for my husband and I.

Service - good. Our waiter was overly enthusiastic, but I think it was the end of his shift, so we won&#39;t hold that against him. All of the staff seemed happy to be there.

The interior is comfortable, clean, and very welcoming! The minute we walked into the restaurant, we knew that we found the place to have a burger and a beer. 

Parking - meter on the street, or in a near by lot.

Atmosphere - casual and fun!

Prices - good prices. 

Will we go back, oh most definitely!
I want to try the Späetzle, the Beef Goulash, the Bratwurst, the Polish Kielbasa, the Schnitzel, an so many others, too many to name here!

So, see you there! And watch out Bocce Ball, I&#39;m pretty good at it!

Yum!"

The cheese that comes with the pretzel is delicious. Loved the Hot German Sandwich too. Curry ketchup was perfect with the fries. Really nice management and server - glad to know there&#39;s a location in Seattle where I live. Ok and you have to check out the upstairs - it&#39;s epically huge!

Right when you walk in you feel like you&#39;re in another country, almost like a Disneyland ride! That made it a completely different dinner experience for sure, and I really enjoyed looking around and noticing all of the cool stuff on the walls. There are games on the first floor that makes grabbing just drinks a much more entertaining and fun night.

Their food is out of this world, the table tried a little of everything appetizer-wise and I couldn&#39;t get enough. Every single thing was absolutely delicious. I ended with the Caesar salad and it was pretty amazing. I was skeptical about pretzel pieces in there but it totally worked.

The only thing is that this place is pricey. I think our bill for 2 was $80 (we got 2 drinks each, also), which makes it harder to just stop in if you have a craving. However, if you are planning on going out for a nicer dinner you will definitely not regret coming to Rhein Haus!"

Okay, I totally Google translated that, but I do love me some German beer and the tap list did not disappoint. Being able to choose my size was also great - I chose a couple 12oz-ers, but many friends went for the liters (33oz), which looked both ridiculous and delicious. 

We played bocce ball as a group of 8. The intensity was real: spectators, cheering, prosting. It was great fun! It&#39;s $5pp up to $25 for an hour. Reasonable, in my opinion. 

We ordered some schnitzel sliders - I thought they were tasty, maybe not super authentic, but did the trick nonetheless.

Good beer.

But...

The food misses the mark in several of the fine details.  The crust of the flamkuchen is too thick and they use sourdough when the real thing should have a slightly sweet taste.  The half chicken has BBQ sauce on it!  What the?!?  The real thing should be krispy on the outside and NOT saucy.  The pretzels were good, but they were kinda tough.  The cheese spätzle was greasy. ...and the list goes on.

I would describe this as 75% traditional german with 25% modern/fusion influence.  Now, despite this, the food was pretty good anyway and I would not mind eating here again, but it is not the same as eating in a traditional restaurant in Germany.  The schnitzel had an apple slaw on it, and capers I believe, with a lemony sauce.  The pretzels were SLATHERED with butter (ala Auntie Anne&#39;s).  They were tasty and all, but that is not a real german pretzel.  Did not get to try the streudel because they were all out.  They make their own sausages apparently and the bratwurst was pretty good, although it looked more like a coney island dog.  Overall, the food is tasty, just know what you are getting."

During our trip to Denver to celebrate the Broncos Super Bowl win, we came across Rhein Haus. It sounded awesome and reviews were good so we gave it a shot. Boy, I&#39;m glad we did. First off, the decor is amazing. Felt like we were in Bavaria from the minute we walked in. 

I usually prefer cider over beer, but they didn&#39;t have the one I was hoping for so our waiter recommended a beer he thought I would like. I was skeptical, but now I have a new favorite beer: Ayinger Braü Weiss. Great recommendation. 

On to the food... You must start with a pretzel, they&#39;re very good. The cheese dipping sauce made them even better. For our main we went with the Sausage Sampler. It was huge! For two people and $28 bucks we thought it was well priced based on portion. If you want to try a bit of everything, you can&#39;t go wrong. The real horseradish on top was a nice touch.

The food was simple and delicious. I got a pretzel app with dipping sauces, my favorite of which was the horseradish cream cheese. The pretzels are done right, and paired perfectly with the beer!

First, the German biergarten feel is right on, and the folks milling around the bocce courts were entertaining. Starting with a tall mug of draft and pretzels (the spicy honey mustard is incredible!) completed the feel. The falafel dog was great - I&#39;m definitely stealing the idea of a sausage-shaped falafel.

We were here the 3rd night it was open and the bar was still working some kinks out.  We brought in a table of 12 and were immediately accommodated.  We were seating on the 2nd floor with bocce courts, a huge bar, and gleaming polished wood everywhere.  I would bring a date here and bring a group here.  The architecture is beautiful.

I am by no means the end-all authority on German food, but I lived in Munich at one point, so I like to believe that I can provide a decently informed evaluation of a place like this. 

Food - The dishes are all essentially German classics with subtle modern foodie updates. For instance, my Schweinshaxe was a very tasty, but not 100% &#39;authentic&#39;, take on the classic German dish. I&#39;m used to it being served with a crispy crust, covered in gravy and a side of potatoes. The Rhein Haus version was served w/o crust  and on a bed of spaetzle/yams/celery root, with a tasty mustard sauce slathered all over it. Very tasty, but also maybe not something you&#39;d find in a traditional Munich beer hall. My wife had the Hirschwurst and it was very good too. One thing to beware of: there aren&#39;t a whole lot of &#39;light&#39; options - think meat, potatoes, sauerkraut, gravy, etc. There are a couple of vegetarian/salad options, but they are the exception, not the rule.

Beer -  A solid beer list that offers a lot of popular styles, but with a focus on the kinds of beers that you might find in beer halls across Germany. If you insist on an IPA, you will be able to find a couple on the list, but the focus seemed to be on wheats and lagers, just like one would expect in Germany.

Service - Very good all around. There were a couple of times that we were left with empty water glasses, etc, but for the most part, the staff and our waiter were kind and helpful.

Atmosphere/Space - the environment/decor/space is pretty cool. It&#39;s an old brick building in LoDo, and they&#39;ve done a good job finishing it out, with nice warm tones and dark hardwood everywhere. It&#39;s like someone took an old German beer hall that&#39;s been around for 200 years, and hipped it up with some Edison bulbs and a smattering of other trendy touches.

All in all, this is a solid option for anyone looking for hearty food and good beer in a cool but relaxed setting. Bonus that it&#39;s a 5 min walk from the Pepsi center, which makes it a great option for a pre-game beer or meal."

When we get her the waitress has absolutely no idea what I&#39;m talking about. I pull up the DENVER menu where the item is clearly listed. She apologizes and says says it must be at the Seattle location only.

So we move on to the other part of the happy hour menu. I have to say my pretzel bits were a little over cooked, but still good. The cheeses sauce was damn good and probably the best part of the meal. My german wheat beer was very good too. My friend did enjoy the house red wine.

For my meal I ordered a cheadarwurst. It was good, but it didn&#39;t seem to blow me away. It was not overly cheadery for my taste. The spatzle was just fair tasting and kind of greasy. As  a big cabbage fan I ordered the red cabbage as a side. It was down right horrible, I don&#39;t know what it was that made it so bad, but after one bite I wasen&#39;t eating more. My friend also did not like it.

My german friend ordered currywurrst, and the schnitzle sliders. She said the sliders were bland and dipped them in the curry sauce. The currywurst sausage was kind of mushy and on the cold side. Not good. 

So this place has a really nice place to come relax and chill and have a drink. I would not recommend eating here. The food is not up to par and happy hour for the 2 of us was $55 before the tip not to mention the price for parking.  Had high hopes, but that&#39;s all they&#39;ll ever be."

This building has done an entire transformation and they&#39;ve brought a concept to the neighborhood that LoDo&#39;s never seen before. Sure there&#39;s great breweries and restaurants all over Denver and the Metro area but this place is unique with their bocce ball courts (upstairs too..cool) food and beer list.  

Contrary to what another Yelper said about their beer list not having authentic German beers, my wife and I had several glasses of Ayinger Brau Weisse (Hefeweizen). The last time I checked, this brewery is located in Bavaria and produces great beer.  I also liked how there&#39;s some US craft breweries on the list, with selections offered indicative of the &#34;old world&#34; beer styles.

Pretty cool place, they&#39;ve done a great job overall. I can definitely see this venue not only being a great meet up spot before concerts or games downtown but an awesome restaurant to go on a date, have a really large party or just meet up with friends/family for a night out."

Also, I felt cheated when I got the bill and had been charged for a 1/2 L beer. I would have been fine with a 12oz beer but hadn&#39;t been given an option when ordering....

I&#39;m always seeking out new eateries in Denver and am willing to reward them appropriately. That said, when I read about Rhein Haus in the Westword showcasing its focus on beer, bocce, and old world food, I had to go and try it! 

Right off the bat the great beer selection of unique American and European beers in a wide variety of sizes (12oz, 20oz, 1L) is enticing. We didn&#39;t play Bocce but two of the lanes are right as you walk in and add to the great ambience of the establishment. The menu is full of innovative interpretations of German/Bavarian/Austrian classics.

We had the pork schnitzel sandwich served on a delicious pretzel roll with tomato, pickle, slaw and fries, as well as the schweinshaxe with spätzle.

Overall we were disappointed. It was not one thing in particular but rather a combination. it started with mediocre service. First being told that the menu on Sunday would be the brunch page, then when we saw the neighboring table order full meals, we were told the whole menu is available. We ordered beers and received one wrong one because there are two types from the same brewery and the waitress didn&#39;t clarify.

This was followed by the lack of execution of the dishes. The schnitzel, while nicely flattened, ended up on the dry side. The schweinshaxe and the spätzle were bland, lacking savory flavors and salt. The spätzle did benefit from the creative addition of diced and roasted carrots and celery root. Westword called the dish a &#34;mountain of meat, surrounded by foothills of spätzle.&#34; Somehow I must have ended up with a shank from a young piglet as my meal had maybe 3-4 oz. of meat on the bone. 

Talking about portion size, disappointment was crowned by dessert; a delicious apple strudel with crispy flaky filo dough, filled with a mixture of apples and golden raisins. Where it turned sour was when for $8, all the server dropped off at the table was two 1/4&#34; x 2&#34; slices with a dollop of whipped cream in the middle. Not the ending to a meal you expect from an almost $70 bill (with tip). 

Rhein Haus, your idea is good but you gotta shape up!"

I have eaten here 4 times, and the only thing that was good was the schnitzel. The quality was good some days and not great others even with the schnitzel. One of my favorite things is spatzle, and it was absolutely awful here. I think they pan fried it after cooking and it was dripping with grease and a awful flavor which I could not quite identify. I have gotten a pretzel twice and both times they were 1/2 hard. I did like the Obatzda sauce. The apple slaw that comes on the dinner schnitzel has been good once and the other times tasted like shredded apple drenched in lemon juice. The lunch sandwich comes with a nice pickled fennel, cabbage and sage slaw, but the bun was not great. I really wanted to like this place, but have been a bit disappointed."

We arrived, no waiter, no greeting, no water, no anything after reaching our table. About ten minutes later a manager noticed and took our drink order. Our waiter came.

Such a bummer about last night. What a disaster. Not sure what happened.

Despite calling the manager yesterday morning to confirm our arrival and lane reservation at 5 pm, everything was a mess! When we arrived at 4:30 for our 5 PM reservation, the bocce lane was scheduled from 4-5 only. What? The situation makes no sense. After dealing with a few of the personnel, everyone was extremely confused/baffled by the reservation mishap. The only reason we booked a reservation at the Rhein Haus for our going away party/birthday celebration, was to play bocce. Plenty of places in Denver can pour an expensive pint. However, said bocce court was not available again until 7:45. At that point, many of our party had left. Not only was the court reservation messed up, but our table was so far away from any said bocce court that the given table completely voids the entire concept of hanging out and playing bocce for a gathering. Other parties had &#34;reservations&#34;, they had less people, but were taken care of! What happened? 

We probably would have spent over 1k easily if everything had actually gone according to plan, so a bummer for your financier that we spent $250. My wife and I both worked in the restaurant industry for over 7 years as have many of our guests, none of us have encountered anything like this ever. We won&#39;t be returning.

I feel like Jerry Seinfeld should make an appearance and talk about &#34;taking&#34; reservations for your staff.

Their toppings / salsa bar was the freshest of all that we tried, with very fresh diced cucumbers, radishes, onions, limes, and of course a variety of salsas.  My favorites are the two Salsa Verde options: One with chunks of Avocado and one that is slightly spicy.

Here we sampled only 2 tacos:  Al Pastor and Pollo.  

This was my favorite Al Pastor, though the pineapple was canned, I have a weird love for canned pineapple and there was SO MUCH of it in the taco!!  The Pollo was the Tinga type, with a mildly spicy paprika type sauce.  Definitely liked that, too!  Very, very large portions of the meats on the freshly made tortillas, too!  These tortillas were heaven, and we watched them being rolled and pressed by hand as we waited for our tacos.  Talk about temptation!

El Taco Veloz definitely wins the BEST TORTILLA Award for Taco Crawl 2016!

Admittedly, I lived in Mexico for a bit and got used to my tacos al pastor being beautifully and traditionally seasoned, cooked perfectly and always fresh. The two al pastor tacos I ordered (after reading glowing reviews here) were overly greasy, barely warmed and not very visually appealing with a few chopped onions, little cilantro and tasteless CANNED pineapple!  Ugh!  To add to my disappointment, I didn&#39;t find the bright green salsa I tried even close to hot enough so I  tried mixing in others until the taste became muddied and confused. I ate both of my al pastor tacos, but a return visit to this UNAIRCONDITIONED and not very clean joint is highly unlikely.

Then they will call your order and one of the staff send it to you.  Just make sure you have your &#34;ticket&#34; and remember what you order.

My order of Taco Lengua and Taco Tripa.  It came out piping hot.  Nice HOT!  You get the servings of hot sauces, salsas and what nots from the self serving counter at the left side of this establishment.

I sat at the right side of this establishment where the high stools is located.

It was pretty decent. They have a cute al pastor spit behind the counter (I need one of these) so I ordered and al pastor, a buche, and the owner recommended the asada so I went with that. It&#39;s a single small tortilla that&#39;s doused with oil so it crisps up and is stronger. The al pastor I think was a little too heavy on the achiote for my tastes, the buche was good but might have been a little bit marginal (restaurant rule #4 - don&#39;t order something that is seldom ordered.), the asada was very tasty. Their little salsa bar had a nice variety of salsas and was all pretty fresh looking.

At first I was hesitant to go in as it was 10:30 a.m. so I figured we would be the 2 lone weirdos who wanted Mexican food at 10:30 a.m.  But we wanted tacos so off we went!

First of all - the guy who was there and helped us? SO awesome and sweet.  He chatted with us for a bit. Everything is homemade. From the salsas to the tortillas to the flan.  He took a lot of pride in this and I just loved him.

My dining companion got a taco plate - a barbacoa, al pastor and asada taco that came with rice and beans. The refried beans were too die for as were each of the meats although I have to say the al pastor was my favorite.  

I had a carnitas torta and it was awesome.  Loaded with the right amount of everything - tons of avocado (and other toppings) and tons of carnitas were the highlight of the sandwich.  The torta roll was delicious, a little crispy on the outside, chewy and yummy on the inside.  The carnitas were melt in your mouth delicious.

Yes. On. Colfax. From. A. Truck. It is, hands-down, the best Mexican I have ever had. Sure the menu is limited, but what is on there is the best. 

On that note, when I tried El Taco Veloz, which is closer to my residence, I compared it to &#34;burrito truck&#34; (BT). And I have to say that El Taco Veloz falls short of BT. Not that it isn&#39;t good, it is but comparatively it isn&#39;t as flavorful. I had the Torta with carne asada and felt like it could have used more seasoning/been more salty, the portion also should have been greater (BT gives you much more food for less money). I also had two tacos of the al pastor flavor, which were both muy bueno. My total was 10 bucks. Good stuff.

I&#39;m a Mexican food affecionado. The type of Mexican food I go after is small, one-handed tacos with just the right amount of meat, herbs, and no extra sauces on top. This place nailed it. I ordered 2 carntias tacos and 2 al pastor (pork). So through the roof delicious and not overly stuffed like a majority of mexican places seem to leave people. 

The price was less than $9 for 4 tacos, beans, rice, and chips. I couldn&#39;t eat it all and didn&#39;t need to as the tacos were perfect. 

Tip: Learn some Spanish before going, even if it&#39;s just the types of meat/dishes you like (or maybe don&#39;t like). The menu is all in Spanish, which isn&#39;t too hard if you&#39;ve had a few years of high school Espanol."

We had the carnitas, al pastor, asada and lengua.  The lengua, on this particular day was my favorite of the 3 stops.  The al pastor was also fabulous.  I can&#39;t wait to get back here again."

Parking is sort of sketchy being across the street from what appears to be a chop shop.  However food is great.  Store made tortillas which are then griddled.  Tried the carnitas and the al pastor both very good.  Carnitas were a bit on the greesy side which is just the way I like them.  The salsa bar was impressive with 9 different varieties.  No gringo salsa here, they pack heat.  They also have all the other standards like pico, jalapenos and limes.  Interestingly, on the tables were bowls filled with dried chiles.  wasn&#39;t sure if these were here for decoration or consumption."

A place I usually can&#39;t wait to go enjoy a meal at. I&#39;ve always had great meals and great service here. After today, however it no longer holds the same luster it once did. 

We arrived and were seated by a younger teenaged boy and were promptly brought water. Great. We selected what we wanted to eat and placed our orders. I ordered my usual, Eggplant Florentine and asked that the sauce on the spaghetti be substituted for the alfredo. The teenaged server says sure, just pay $3.00 more. I have never been upcharged for it any other time so I asked him if he was sure. He stated yes, but he can confirm with the Head Chef. I said Okay no problem. He walks a few steps over to the bar where a man is sitting having a drink and promptly returns to reiterate the $3 upcharge. Ok. No problem. The server leaves and returns a couple minutes later with our garlic knotts. I reach in to grab one and the rolls are hard and cold to the touch. 

We wait a few more minutes and finally approach our server to let him know due to the lack of service &amp; cold bread we will no longer be needing dinner. 

I&#39;m extremely disappointed. The usual experience is a warm &amp; welcoming staff and the food is always hot and delicious. It was the complete opposite today. I will not be coming back or recommending to friends anymore."

I have taken all of my family here when they are in town. I routinely get the baked ziti with a meatball (or two).  It&#39;s definitely in my top two for baked ziti! The meatballs are HUGE! And so tasty! When my sister and I last came here we had an offer for a free cannolli, which we gladly redeemed. That was delicious as well! How can you go wrong with sweet cream wrapped in a wafer and drizzled with chocolate that&#39;s free? Oh that right... You can&#39;t!

I chose this restaurant because it is close to our house and we had a $10 off coupon. Food is really good for the price you pay, there are lots of menu options and pretty extensive drink menu, kids menu is good as well. I had the seafood special...came with lobster, scallops, salmon and stuffed shells(spinach and ricotta). All the seafood was cooked very well and the pasta was very good. Everybody enjoyed their dishes and really don&#39;t have anything to complain about. Service was prompt and very upbeat. I gave this restaurant 4 stars because it just doesn&#39;t have the 5 star quality to it.

Seems more of a neighborhood comfort place in this new location. Less as a place in a strip mall atmosphere. Although it wasn&#39;t in a strip mall before, it&#39;s location always gave off those vibes.

Food is typical, but good, Italian fare. On a cold, snowy day it is a nice place to hunker down and enjoy a warm hearty meal and friendly service. Being inside reminds one of small neighborhood places on the East Coast. New York, New Jersey. Where friends get together and share a warm Friday night meal. 

Only thing I don&#39;t like about this new location are the high bar tables.Why is it necessary to climb up to a table. Just sit down. Also, could use tablecloths to add a little warmth.

Definitely will go back next time I am in town visiting family. Good food and service."

Apps: calamari and mussels- both were very good, hubs really enjoyed the lemon aioli with the calamari. The garlic knots were fresh out of the oven and delicious.

Caesar and minestrone were good. Nothing spectacular about the soup so I&#39;d probably get a salad next time. 

Entrees: chicken parm- very good would order again. Chicken piccata- needed more lemon to brighten up the flavor as it was a little bland. Not bad but we&#39;ll try something else next time.

The new location is much nicer inside but because it&#39;s way in the back of the shopping plaza now it is less busy from what we&#39;ve noticed. I guess that&#39;s a good thing for us since we don&#39;t have to wait."

The lunch portion size is perfect, and my Penne Bolognese was done well.  The garlic bread was over cooked, but I was able to look past that as I am not a bread guy.  Overall the food was good for the price.

The service on the other hand left a lot to be desired.  The waiter did not seem to be knowledgeable of the menu, or what was in the speciality cocktails.   He definitely had never encountered the free cannoli for checking in on yelp.  

The drinks are a bit pricey but the restaurant has an ombiance that was very pleasant and the lighting was intement,  probably a good place to take a date.

On the way out, a man who had been busy in the back office,  put down his work and thanked me for coming in.  For that reason I will come back in a few months to see if the restaurant improves. Plus, I did get the cannoli, and it was good."

I have had happy hour on the patio, dinner in the dining room and dessert in the bar area.  It&#39;s generally a busy place.  The service is usually friendly and efficient.  The food is generally fresh and hot.  The dining room can be a bit of a maze as they have a few different sections and what appears to be a place that can be closed off into a private room for any occasion.  

They also have started entertainment on the patio.  We came for dinner on Saturday and they were advertising live entertainment on the patio.  They are tucked in a back corner of the shopping center for this location so there is plenty of parking and access to Parker Road if you want to go North is pretty easy.  

The garlic knots were especially tasty on this visit.  It could be because I had not had them in a while.   Lasagna and Veal Parmesan were the dishes of our evening meal and they happily substituted penne pasta for spaghetti on the Veal.  Dinner didn&#39;t take long to arrive and was very filling.

I really preferred the old location off of Smoky Hill (it had been there since as long as I can remember, and I have been living in that area since 1990). It was smaller, but it was like a crowded small mom and pop place, as opposed to now. Sure it&#39;s bigger and brighter now but it also lost a lot of its charm.  On a Saturday night, you might have had to wait an hour in the old place but it was worth it. Classic old style Italian the way my family makes and eats it. Big portions, gooey cheese and sauce everywhere. 

They never did make their own ravioli (boo) but now ALL of their food has a slightly manufactured feel.  That being said, I don&#39;t think it is.  Maybe it&#39;s the atmosphere, I don&#39;t know. I just can&#39;t get over the atmosphere maybe They tried to class the menu up a bit I think, but they also lost a lot of what made them great...Italian they way my grandmother used to make, while eating it in a place that could have been just a larger version of her house.

First off service is exceptional--it seems everyone that works here is very friendly. Our waitress, Luciana, was very nice and had a great sense of humor. The bartender even came to the table at one point, and we had the door held open by the chef as we left (it was almost closing time). 

We started with mozzarella cheese sticks that my husband ordered on a whim. I don&#39;t recall the last time I had freshly made cheese sticks. They were great. 

I had the Fettuccine Alfredo, as I guess it is my litmus test for Italian restaurants. Oh My God! I know I have never had such a freshly made, light, Alfredo sauce, and Armando&#39;s has likely ruined me for most, if not all, other places. I added broccoli to my pasta, and it is about as close to perfect as I have ever had.

He had the Chicken Parmesan, with homemade spaghetti noodles, and wished he could bathe in the marinara sauce. The chicken was tender and the breading crispy throughout, even where covered in cheese and sauce. 

We shared Creme Brulee and it was a delight. 

I don&#39;t mean to be overly generous with my compliments, it was just nice to find a family owned business in this area full of chains, and it really was a great meal. Look for a follow up, as I am sure we will be back soon."

We went there after searching Yelp for some suggestions in Parker. Yummy! The garlic knots were awesome, and much better than &#34;Here&#39;s some bread and butter&#34;

The house pino grigio was delicious - not bad at all. I had their salmon, and it was cooked TO PERFECTION. Absolutely delicious. Vegetables were cooked well, too. My father in law said his eggplant was slightly chewy, but other than that, no complaints. I tried a few bites of the husband&#39;s gnocchi - yummm.  The food did take a looooong time to reach the table, but it was worth the wait. Also, after I told them about the two birthdays at the table and requested cannolis, they were brought out and were DELICIOUS. I love a good cannoli. 

I&#39;d come back - I want to try some pasta!"

My guy and I got garlic knots, not very garlicky.... caprese salad which was good, an overcooked calzone with all the ingredients listed in the menu along with a few unexpected additions. And manicotti. The noodles were barely stuffed, very little cheese and definitely not enough sauce on top. The atmosphere is cool, plenty of staff were scheduled,  very friendly and attentive service and engaged us in pleasant conversation.  If the quality of the food improves, we will definitely come back. Otherwise I doubt we will go there again unless it&#39;s just for drinks."

This is a family run restaurant that takes pride in their food, service and reputation. Every time I visit, there is a new selection of specials which I&#39;ve tried a couple times and were great! Staff is friendly and always suggests wine pairings with my order.

- The Veal cut: Bomb! 
- Chicken Parm or Piccata: Delicious, not as lemon-y as I like it, but that&#39;s personal preference
- Chicken Parmesan is top notch! Contender with the way mom used to make it
- Lasagna - Thick, creamy and piping hot, really delicious

Highly recommend Armando&#39;s. I&#39;m an Italian food snob so Armando&#39;s had their work cut out for them."

I&#39;ve always had good service here (I used to frequent their old location a lot as well) and the food is yummy.  The new location has way more parking, but the restaurant seating area is a bit smaller.

My favorite dish is the carbonara.  I also love the spaghetti and meatball.  The bruschetta is really delicious and filling as an appetizer.  The garlic knots could use more garlicky flavor, but it&#39;s still a great accompaniment to your meal.  If they offer the lamb osso bucco on special, I suggest you order it.  The meat is very tender, well seasoned, and falls right off the bone.  When you&#39;re done stuffing your face with your entree, try the tiramisu for dessert.

This is one place I don&#39;t mind getting fat at."

The stuffed mushroom appetizer was all soggy breadcrumbs, the ceasar salads were limp and tasteless.  It took nearly half an hour to get our actual meals, with an excuse from the waiter telling us it takes longer for the stuffed mushrooms.  HUH? That was our appetizer.  When we did finally get our meals it was only to get dry chicken parm, and my pasta aglio e&#39;olio was a bunch of raw garlic on dry pasta.  Luckily, the kids were only interested in how much cheese was on their ravioli&#39;s and stuffed shells, but I was disgusted.  Will be going elsewhere for Italian next time, thank you!"

However, the service is always a disappoine my and last night was no different. The waiter was upset about have a reserved group table and getting annoyed with the people coming in and out. I told him I couldn&#39;t drink alcohol and he literally walked away from me. I had to shout over the table I wanted a coffee and some garlic knots. It was just awful. Then, part of the group had to leave and wanted to pay for their portion and he was incredibly rude and dismissive to the woman trying to pay. I can honestly say the service will now prevent me from going there on my own. Before I went last night, the service was just ok but now I just won&#39;t go. They really need to focus on pleasing the customer. Oh! And the busy boy spilt diet coke on my friends white shirt and cleaned it up with a towel without consulting him first and made for a horribly awkward moment. Tips are their money maker, customers make that choice, be nice and flexible because it pays in the end!"

We have been twice. The last time we went it was very hot in the restaurant, and we had to wait 5-10 min to be seated because the host was on the phone, taking a to-go order I think. The host was nice enough and observant enough however to make sure we were next to be served when a couple who came in after us expected to be helped before us. The wait staff is always very slow. I ordered the manicotti last time but was very disappointed as I have had better frozen manicotti bought from the grocery store. The garlic knots have no garlic flavor, they should just be called buttered knots. And we love creme brûlée, but whenever we order it here it comes out burnt. I would choose to eat at Olive Garden over this place in the future."

Regular spaghetti and meatball came and when we questioned at the waiter said that they traditionally served angel hair at lunch. It wasn&#39;t angel hair it was regular like Box spaghetti. The Caesar salad was good but the soup was cold. The garlic knots or hard and cold. This location was disappointing.

This place was great once upon a time and was our &#34;go to&#34; place when we had guest. But they&#39;ve reduced the menu, it does not match the online menu that we would show our guest before taking them. The portions are smaller than ever. We purchased the combo appetizer that should have calamari, fried zucchini &amp; shrimp for $12.95. It had 6 calamari mini rings, 2 shrimp and the rest was fried zucchini. Not impressed. The chicken Parmesan was cold and cheese on top was not melt on 3 of our orders. Quattro Formigo had no flavor, just cheese &amp; noodles. And the spaghetti and meatball- spaghetti sauce/marinara is bitter and the meatball was dry hamburger meat with no flavor. But the upside was they serve wine. For a $200 bill, we should have done SaltGrass."

Before they relocated to the current place I really loved the food, service, even the crappy run down building they occupied.  

The only reason they got 2 stars is for past service.  On my recent visit I got the baked ziti.   I thought this would be nearly impossible to screw up.  However I got a runny uncooked noodle bowl with a slab of cheese that could be folded over to dig out the unsavory noodles from under the worst cheese I&#39;ve ever seen.  How do you have cheese that acts more like a thin slab of tofu?.  No melty stringy goodness...

The Caesar salad was marginal at best. 
My lady was unimpressed with her meal as well.  I did enjoy the garlic knots so I didn&#39;t go totally hungry.  

Why the waitress wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t/didn&#39;t acknowledge that I barely touched my $13 bowl of garbage was very disconcerting.   I don&#39;t moan and groan and expect a free meal, and proceeded to pay for it. But I think it&#39;s their job to ensure patrons enjoy their food.  I don&#39;t think I could have been any more obvious if I threw it against the wall...

The Parker location burned my gnocchi last time (waitress did give me a free slice of cheesecake for the trouble). I don&#39;t like cheesecake but she tried at least.  

Armando&#39;s may have lost my business at this point."

Food was great and the wait staff was amazing just as it always is at the Parker location.  Louis was our waiter and I can&#39;t say enough about how attentive and accommodating he was.  The Aurora location is quite a bit smaller than Parker and can feel a bit stuffy.  You can&#39;t beat Armando&#39;s for Italian food and the pizza is out of this world, easily the best on this side of town.

The Caesar salad is great- my 3 and 11 year old gobble it down. The cannolis are yummy and they even have chocolate covered cannolis- which I love! We were even right beside a very large party table, but our server never missed a beat- even when we had four requests at once: another beer, milk refill, more marinara, and 2 meatballs.

To start we had to wait 40 minutes (expected on a Friday night) but a wait usually means good food, not this time. I got some pasta and ravioli combo, the whole meal seemed like it was laying in water, i asked the waitress why was it so watery and she said they didnt put enough cheese in the sauce, huh? If you know your sauce isn&#39;t right why would you put it out, and also thats not a good reason you didn&#39;t simmer long enough, then I tried my pasta and it was hard, an Italian guy came over and asked how it was, i said the pasta is hard, he said its cause its homemade, HUH AGAIN. Its cuz you didn&#39;t cook it AT ALL! Then I tried my ravioli which was horrible NO TASTE! My daughter ordered a cheese calzone that she said had no taste surprise surpise, but thankfully the waitress kept giving her cokes like its smart for a kid to repeatedly given coke after coke on a Friday night. My mom got the eggplant which was greasey, yet no meat so I guess it was oily. After the complaints did we get a sorry or a discount on our bill NO! Then to top it off on our way out the owner was at some tables he obviously knew and giving them fresh grated parm, WTF! No one else got offered fresh parm just a shaker filled with old parm, what kind of place is this, not Italian I promise you that, cause I am Italian and I know that were family people, I guess they are only nice to people they know. DO NOT UNDER ANY MEANS GO TO THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT GOOD FOOD. It deserves negative reviews.

The new place on Parker Rd. lacks some of that ambience and they seem to be working out the kinks of moving, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  That said, a good friend was visiting from out of state and we were looking for a good place to eat that would enable her to eat vegan. We went in, explained that our friend had a dietary preference and they were very helpful in offering suggestions.  We all had a very tasty and enjoyable meal.  The service was just right. Attentive, without being underfoot.  We will continue to enjoy dining at Armondos."

The staff was super nice and friendly. The food was overpriced and questionable at best. Overall for the quality of what we got is expect to pay 30% less easily. My veal marsala&#39;s sauce was good though rather oily, the actual cuts of beef were thin and slimy. My wife sent back her first ravioli dish and it was replaced by the saltiest penne primavera I&#39;ve ever heard of or tried. Decent atmosphere but unless the food makes a remarkable improvement we won&#39;t be back."

My date and I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. What a let down. The place was loud and an unappealing moldy smell like a dirty rag when we got to our table plus dirty carpet was enough to make me want to leave even before we got water, but my date wanted to try it out.  Our boot was small and cramped. Even the waiter had trouble moving dishes and things to put stuff down. The dinner rolls were cold and hard. The menu we looked at on the website was totally outdated to the prices and menu we were given. The calamari appetizer I had was chewy, and when I picked up a still cold, partially frozen piece I knew it was bagged frozen food. The second course I had their Minestrone which I was hoping was a fresh soup, but it was obviously canned and I stopped eating it after a couple of bites.  The only decent part of the meal was my meat lasagna which came out super hot and I had to wait some time for it to cool down after burning my tongue twice attempting to eat it. Once I could bite into it the meat was just a mix of burger and sausage, the ricotta was way to wet. The portion wasn&#39;t even that much. As we ate I witnessed a floor manage be a bit snippy to customers that ordered out, and staff texting phones.  No wonder the place was mostly empty at 7pm. I&#39;ll never go back."

I went to Civic Center eats on the earlier side though, and the line was manageable enough for me to wait for a falafel. I love falafel, and my standards are pretty high. I got the regular falafel cone and I was not disappointed. The falafel was flavorful, and not overly greasy. I liked the typical accompaniments of tomato, lettuce, and pickles as well. I ordered the spicy tahini, but definitely didn&#39;t feel like the cone had much heat. The portions are on the small side, so beware if you&#39;re a big eater."

As a food truck lover, I get super stoked when I come across one I&#39;ve never heard of. So when I saw Baba&#39;s at the South Denver Beer Fest I knew I just had to try it. They had a limited menu going on but it works, I got the falafel cone and they asked if I wanted it regular or spicy and I went with spicy. It was up in a few minutes and while they were making it, I chatted with the guy and girl running the truck. We talked all things food and social media and they even have me some suggestions on where to find legit middle eastern food in the area (excluding their truck of course) , superfriendly folks.

And the falafel cone?

Omg, it was an instant mouthgasm in the form of a cone! The falafels had perfect consistency and flavor and the tahini was smooth and rich. They made it spicy and it had just enough spice to accent the flavors but not overtake it. I was a sad panda when I finished it. If you see them around, definitely check it out and get some balls in your mouth!!"

I greatly enjoyed my falafel cone and my friend&#39;s cheese chicken taco.  The cheese Chicken taco seemed like mostly mayo to me, but the chicken was delicious.  The falafel cone was good, but small.  The prices were a little high: $19 for two tacos and a falafel wrap.  I would eat here again."

And even if you aren&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t matter; it&#39;s just damn good food. Their falafel is excellent--very flavorful and delicious. And they have come up with some very inventive ways to use it. For example, they have created a falafeldilla and nachos,both using hummus &amp; falafel. I got the &#34;nachos,&#34; and the spicy sauce they use is soooo good. Plus, the people are nice &amp; friendly, which is always important. 

I will definitely be paying them another visit in the near future. I can see me becoming a regular customer. If you&#39;d like to know where to find them, check out their website for their schedule."

I&#39;ve had bad falafel-- dry, chalky, sticks in your mouth like peanut butter, and makes you want to cry. And, I&#39;ve had delicious falafel, moist, flavorful, so yummy it makes you want to cry. Baba&#39;s makes such falafels. And, they serve them in the most creative of ways. My beau and I shared the falafeldilla-- like a quesadilla, but pitas replace the tortillas, and hummus and falafel replaces the cheese. It was so amazing that I wish I would&#39;ve ordered my own. It paired perfectly with my tasty beer at Our Mutual Friends-- just another reason to spend more time here :)"

And yes, it&#39;s insane how amazing their food tastes. These guys officially nailed the art of falafel and modern Mediterranean food. My wife ordered the Caprese Falafel Cone which was a completely different flavor falafel. It was to die for. I had the pleasure of trying their traditional Falafeldilla with the chicken shawarma. Good god it was beautiful. Hands down BEST falafel in Denver!"

I could eat falafel and hummus every day and I actually DID eat falafel and hummus every day this past summer when I spent two months living in the Middle East. I am not exaggerating. 

Luckily for me my home is Houston, the most diverse city in the United States of America, yes that&#39;s right, we are now more diverse than the lovely NYC. That means I can get some pretty tasty falafel back home whenever I feel like it!

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t say the same about Denver.... until now! This is seriously the most authentic, and delicious, falafel and hummus you&#39;re going to find in the state of Colorado. I am so grateful for it&#39;s existence. 

Next time I&#39;m in Denver, I&#39;m going straight from DIA to Baba&#39;s Falafel."

I like, but don&#39;t love, falafel generally: I often find it to dry.  But not here:  the falafel is moist and the falafeldilla is complex, featuring hummus, tabouli, tomatoes, pita, and, of course falafel.  And it&#39;s filling.  Also, at Civic Center Eats, this tends to be one of the shorter lines, so the wait isn&#39;t too bad."
