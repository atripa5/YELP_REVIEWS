As soon as you get there, you can see a lot of memorabilia all over the place with flags, decorations and typical music of Colombia.

The menu is pretty straight forward and it&#39;s compiled with just a few dishes and drinks. I ordered the typical bandeja paisa and it was very good! Very tasty.

The attention was alright. It was just one person for the whole place. It&#39;s not really a complain. 
I would recommend people to give this place a try!"

I was there for an early lunch and ordered a tamale with a side of yuca. The yuca was not seasoned. The Colombian tamale was quite substantial, it had a chicken thigh, a piece of pork, half a boiled egg, a slice of potato and carrot, wrapped in leaves and steamed. One would expect the flavor should be concentrated in the cornmeal of the tamale but it this case, there just was not enough cornmeal to soak up the flavor. The whole tamale was dry and I had to wash it down with water.

It appeared the majority of the customers ordered the bandeja paisa, maybe that is what I should have ordered. 

The two waitresses were friendly. The music was loud like in a bar. When the restaurant began to fill up, the service became quite slow."

I made the 45 minute drive to visit, and was not disappointing. We got the Picada Pequena as an appetizer, it had so much food on it. The fried yucca is probably my favorite part of the plate. I had the Bandeja Paisa and my wife had the Sancocho de Res (beef stew). I won the food comparison battle this time. I love the chicharron that comes with the Bandeja Paisa and the sausage.

The restaurant isn&#39;t huge with three or four booths on the left side and three larger tables on the right side. The decor is very enjoyable with vibrant color reflecting the Colombian flag amongst lots of other items presumably from Colombia. 

Los Parceros serves Colombian food &amp; drinks. We started with the empanadas, which typically use flour but are made with corn here. This is great for my wife who is gluten-free. They come five to an order and were fresh, delicious and hot.

For entrees we tried the churrasco steak, which is big enough for 2 or 3 people. It comes with fries and  cooked to order. It was seasoned well. 

We also tried the Arroz con pollo, which is chicken and rice with various vegetables mixed in. The rice had great flavor and chicken was shredded in small bite size pieces. It comes with a side salad and it was a big enough portion there were leftovers for a full lunch.

The last item we ordered was the vegetarian platter. It is not on the menu. It comes with fried plantains, small potatoes, a side salad, avocado, yucca, black beans and a fried egg.

Everything was good and the server was polite and helpful.

Support this tasty restaurant on Colfax. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

We arrived around 7:20 p.m. and waited until around 7:45 p.m. to be seated.  We were told right away that they were closing so we had to order right away. 

We ordered a &#34;bandana Paisa&#34; but they said they had just made the last one, so we had to order something else.  We wondered why they couldn&#39;t make another bandana Paisa, our conclusion was that they simply wanted to leave and didn&#39;t want to make it, that simple.

We also ordered two &#34;ajiaco&#34; soups which were advertised as having chicken, three different types of potatoes and corn.  We received instead two small bowls of &#34;corn in the cob with broth&#34; and a couple of slivers of shreded chicken.  

Be aware that this ajiaco soup is $12 each.  It had no potatoes, only traces of chicken, it was just broth!
We told the lady that served us why it had no chicken, so she went back to the kitchen to get more chicken, but she came back saying the had no more and if the owner of the restaurant was there, maybe he could have discounted something from our bill.

We ate our broth and left feeling very disappointed and upset.
I do not recommend this place.  The service from the waitress was decent, but the food availability, quantity and price was just unacceptable.
We will NOT be back."

My folks just moved to Arvada from CA and haven&#39;t wasted any time getting acquainted with Denver. My mom made friends with the owner Joaquin and his two sons, all of whom work at the joint. We had a huge family dinner, 9 total in their tiny intimate restaurant. They handled it gracefully with smiles on their faces. While everything on the table was tasty, I have to highlight the appetizers. Their empanadas are incredible and gluten free. Compared to other spots, like the Chiva food cart, these are most and flavorful, paired with a spicy green sauce. Next, were the patacones, which some may call tostones. This is my single favorite latin dish.

You take a green (immature) plantain, cut them into small cylindrical pieces, deep fry on both sides, take them out and SQUASH them, then put the back in the hot fat one more time to fully crisp them up. mmm. They are what I call Latin Fries, because they are treated like French fries often. At Parceros, they presented these with a salty, acidic and sweet chunky tomato tapenade. Increible! Make sure you try these if you go. 

What&#39;s more is the owner took my whole family and I out on the town in their Chiva bus. A very authentic experience and a great party idea!"

Keep in mind that Colombian food should by NO MEANS be confused with our perception of Mexican food (which is not too authentic...).

Lucky for myself, the hubs and my parents we got to try and in my parents case, walk down memory lane on Christmas Eve. The restaurant is small and cozy with bright colors. The service was very good as well which made the night all the more enjoyable. 

We started with the cheese arepa and the empanadas with aji sauce. The empanadas were hands down the best part of our meal. Crispy on the outside with creamy potato and beef drizzled with the incredible aji sauce. We all agreed we could eat just a plate full of those for dinner. We all got the passion fruit juice which was incredible and hit the spot. 

Forgive my lack of Spanish with our entrees. We tried:

Arroz con pollo - this was good except for the slices of hot dog that my mom picked out

Beef flank - my dads dish which was very tasty

Fish with rice, fries and salad - the rice was incredible. The fish was a bottom feeder related to tilipia so it did have a little of that dirty flavor associated with catfish 

Traditional Colombian meal with chicharrones, sausage, egg, plantain, beans, rice and avocado. This was a HUGE amount of food. My husband ate half and sadly left his to go box on the table. We realized later that night when we had already left :(

We also got churros that were incredible and totally unique with a caramel style filling. 

I&#39;m ready to eat Colombian again and make up for lost time!"

We were lucky to snag the last table inside when we arrived. The restaurant is relatively small with a few tables. I had a margarita with some of their speciality squeezed juice and my boyfriend has solely the juice. They don&#39;t give you water unless you ask for it. We had some empanadas to start which were very tasty and large. I had one of the soups made with corn, meat, potato, and more. It was very flavorful and soothing.. Yum! Overall it was a good experience and the ambiance inside is very cute and makes you feel you are actually in South America. The door wouldn&#39;t shut all the way unless you pulled it close, which was a bit annoying since we were seated near the door and it was cold outside.

A friend &amp; I went last week &amp; were thrilled with our experience. The restaurant is small, homey, &amp; brightly decorated. When I arrived, of the three other full tables, I was the only native English speaker (always a good sign). I know they opened about 6 months ago, and I think they are working out a lot of the &#34;kinks&#34; I read about in some of the other yelp reviews. The owner&#39;s son talked with us extensively, and answered a lot of questions for us. We started with empanadas &amp; fried plantains (don&#39;t remember the dish name).The empanadas were stellar. The plantains were great! We both got fresh juices, and it was as if milk &amp; fruit made sweet, sweet love to one another in a blender! They were wonderful! We split the Arroz Con Pollo, a common chicken &amp; rice dish, and it was good, not great, but good.

They keep the menu simple with about a dozen things to choose from. They have several Colombian sodas &amp; we were told they are in the process of getting their liquor license &amp; will also carry Colombian beer! 

I will say, the entree prices are a little higher than I expected, running about $12-$22, but overall things were great."

I had a soup called Ajiaca that was so delicious I went online looking for recipes after I got home.  Essentially, it&#39;s a very filling chicken and potato soup with such a depth of flavor it&#39;s difficult to describe. Let&#39;s just suffice it to say that I would most definitely order it again.  The Hubs had the Bandeja Paisa which was a huge plate of food.  I think it consisted of a sausage (chorizo?), red beans, rice, seasoned ground beef with a fried egg on top, chicharron, arepa, fried plaintains and avocado.  He said it was good and would order it again, but only if he was really, really hungry.  He tasted my soup and said he would most likely  order it next time.

The restaurant is small (maybe 8 or so tables and booths inside, and a few small tables outside), but cute.  It&#39;s brightly painted and decorated and is very festive, especially with the fun (although very loud) Colombian music (I&#39;m assuming) that was playing.

All-in-all, we had a good experience once someone noticed we were there.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving them four stars instead of five.  After we walked in, we seated ourselves and waited.  And waited.  It was a good ten minutes before anyone who worked there noticed we were even there (or at least acknowledged we were there).  One of the staff was busy serving other people.  One guy was fiddling around with the stereo.  Another was seated in the dining area eating his own lunch.  It would have been nice if someone had just looked up and said they&#39;d be with us in a few minutes.  Frankly, we almost left.  I&#39;m very glad we didn&#39;t though.  I will say that once we were noticed, we did have very good service and excellent food.  We will be back!"

She found this place because the Chiva was parked outside. When we tried it for the first time the food was good but nowhere near as good as the Colombian restaurants we had tried on the east coast. My wife ordered an arepa with cheese and they gave her an arepa that was the same size as the one on the bandeja paisa which are very small but good and the empanadas are just ok. The bandeja paisa plate is pretty good as well. The workers are very friendly, and I believe it is family owned and operated. Also, the atmosphere is very nice, but the prices are pretty high for what you get.......but then again they are the only Colombian restaurant in the area so it&#39;s almost justified.

Unfortunately no alcohol but they have an extensive juice list tho I recognized the apple soda which Ive had before so settled for that. I asked my waiter what he recommedned  and I was given quite a few choices but luckily the menu aint that extensive like sat a Mexican one so figured I would start with the Empanadas which were crispy and stuffed with beef &amp; potato $7.50 for six wasn&#39;t too bad. I then had the Ajiaco which is basically a potato and chicken soup served in a clay bowl. Three different types of potatoes, lean chicken, not sure on all the spices and other veggies, oh and a little corn on the cob, hearty stuff and for $12 it would of been plenty enough on its own!

The flavors were excellent. The meals come with quite a bit of starch (rice and french fries) and I&#39;d be glad to exchange some starch for veggies/salad. But overall the meal was great. The fish was not greasy at all and had great flavor.
We each had one of the marvelous fruit juice drinks. For mine I had them make it with water. My friend had a mix of half milk and half water as suggested by the waiter.

This is as truly authentic Colombian cuisine as you can get in Denver.  I am Colombian and was raised eating Colombian food.  I have been here a couple of times and the menu was reflective of typical dishes you would find in most restaurants in Colombia.  I frequent Colombia and can say that the food at Los Parceros is like ordering from a restaurant in Bogota or Medellin.  My personal favorite is sancocho and Los Parceros did not disappoint.  I had the sancocho de Carne which was excellent and made just like I have had it many times in Bogota.  My favorites off the menu include sancocho, ajiaco, and bandeja paisa.  All were excellent.

Not much salt and little spice everything else.  I have never had Columbian food before so nothing to benchmark it too but was surprised to learn Colombian food typically is not spicy.  There was not even pepper on the table which I thought was interesting .  I would like to come back and try some more items,  maybe sneak in some hot sauce because to me would be better with some kick.

Kenny our server was very nice and took very good care of us. We had coffee which Kenny made sure our cup was never empty. We staterd with some empanadas which come with a very delicious sauce that looks like chimichurri sauce. I also had the Bandeja Paisa which is a traditional Colombian plate, very good for the carnivorous person. The fried plantain and chimichurri sauce complements every item in the dish.

I opened the door to Colombian music and cool light energy. I was greeted by the manager I think. Everyone was dressed nice and it had a family-run-feel to the way it operated from my angle. Anyway he asked if i ever had Colombian food and when i replied &#34;no&#34;, he lit up like a tour guide who loved their job ( i really appreciated the enthusiasm) needless to say, I was an eager student. (since lunch was my favorite school subject and I was on the honor roll for it).

The decor is about as authentic as you can get outside of actually being in Colombia.  Vibrant colors, on point artifacts, and they even have a fully outfitted &#34;Colombian style&#34; bus that sits across the street.  Stopped in today for their lunch special, which fills you up nicely for about $10 (with tax and tip), but more importantly gives you a nice offering of what you would expect in a typical Colombian meal.  Soup, grilled chicken, rice and beans and a salad were what the lunch special consider of today, and it varies daily.  Also, a nice variety (15+) of fresh juices from fruits that are not common to America, such as Passionfruit.  While giving it 4 stars, I know this place has the potential for 5...I just did not get to taste enough of the menu...yet!  Service was excellent- the girl helping me out was super friendly and helpful.  Plus, she continued speaking to me and letting me practice my Spanish LOOOONG after she knew it was not my first language."

I had a lunch special and it consisted of grilled steak, rice, salad, fried plantain and a soup for $8. Any foodie wanting a hell of a deal needs to run down here as fast as possible before they raise their prices. The food is basic Colombian fare but it is well executed. They don&#39;t have a menu yet and it helps if you speak Spanish but try this place out anyways as you will not be disappointed. Be careful with the empanadas. They have five empanadas for eight dollars which is fair but I would have rather have had a couple as an appetizer. This kind of small misstep comes with not having a menu. That kept it from getting four stars.

So be sure to ask. The Yakki Nikku was cooked perfectly, and it made a great starter. It comes with a side of fresh veggies and limes. Basically, short ribs with sautéed veggies!! I love Shrimp and crunchy bites, so the Crispy Shrimp with mild sauce is a good appetizer that I went with. Their sushi, I think, was very impressive. Some days I&#39;ll feel so-so whenever I eat sushi, but Osaka really killed it. 

It&#39;s a very romantic spot with candles and roses. A full bar with Ozeke Sake at the tips of your tongue. They had a special if you complete a very, very, very spicy roll, they&#39;ll reward you with a bottle of Sake! Cha-Ching! 

The Rolls: 

The Dragon Roll has always been a mere favorite of mine, and I enjoy the way it is topped off with the basic avocado and it goes well with ginger. Get this if you&#39;re a fan of crab meat and cucumber. (&amp; Unagi and Masago, which is my total fave) 


Ichiban Roll comes with spicy tuna, Masago, Spicy mayo and sweet eel sauce. 
I think this one we won&#39;t consider getting again. It wasn&#39;t balanced. 

The best roll is the Avalanche Roll! It&#39;s stuffed with hot Tempura and crab meat. It&#39;s very saucy and creamy, if you&#39;re into a MouthGasm adventure. It has Tobiko and Unagi with White Sauce and baked salmon. 

The dessert is the best here: Seriously, the whole dessert menu is a castle of fun. I fell in love with the Tempura Icecream at Katsu Sushi, but Osaka has eye-popping selections. I mean. Everything. Is. Eye. Popping. 

We got the Berry Paradise, which at first I wasn&#39;t rooting for, but thanks to Kay, our very beautiful server, convinced us that it was amazing and it really worked. 
I chose the Tiramisu cake which looked like a sunrise beach painting . It was so cute I couldn&#39;t take it. Please come here. It was a stunning experience."

Our dinner was 7:45 on a Tuesday night. After being seated at the Sushi Bar, we sat for another 15 minutes before we decided to leave.

Other than being handed a menu, we weren&#39;t offered a drink or even given any water. Both  the parties seated on either side of us were given drinks and appetizers during that time. 

After spending over 20 min inside the restaurant and no service it was time to move on.

Other than the poor service...and having plenty of time to look at the menu, their prices seemed to be high especially for the local market! I was going to order their medium sashimi plate and at the $30+ price tag, I definitely know you can find better options in the area. Probably with better service too...

This was a first and last kind of visit. I would not recommend an attempt by anyone else especially when there are so many other options within a mile or two."

Lunch: This is the most recent experience of mine. I walked in at 11:15am since they have lunch specials that run seven days a week from 11a-3pm. I thought it would be empty but there were already a few tables sat and even so, it was pretty tame and quiet. I sat at the sushi bar since the sushi chefs looked lonely and was promptly greeted. From beginning to finish the experience was perfect. I got the sashimi lunch combo which came with soup, salad, two pieces of a sushi rolls, six pieces of sashimi and about five or six pieces of tempura shrimp and veggies. OMG, it was like food-gasm city. Everything was delicious and the salmon sashimi practically melted in my mouth. It was so much food for $12, you really can&#39;t beat a deal like that for all that food plus the quality of the food. I was chatting with the sushi chef and he said not to spend the money on the AYCE lunch special, you definitely get more bang for your buck ordering the lunch specials or various rolls. 

Dinner: Well, this was about two and a half years ago but it was a completely different experience atmosphere wise. It was like a party! We didn&#39;t have to wait for long but it was a full house on a Friday night.  We stuck with mostly rolls that night and did family style with some friends but the thing I remember the most was there being free sake bomb shots for all throughout the restaurant. There was music blasting and they stopped the music so everyone could unite in the name of alcohol and do a shot. Yep, this is definitely my kind of place!"

And its very fresh too.  I was not happy with the tempura oysters, super greasy and definitely NOT coated with tempura!  The seaweed salad was teeny tiny for 7$.  The service was average to slow.  Our food took forever, but the cold sake choices were plentiful so we were happy.  The place had no ambiance, its like a shack.  Overall I liked the fish but not a great experience.

First off... I&#39;ll never understand how a land locked city like Denver has so many sushi places. I just don&#39;t get it. 
Surprisingly, some of them are actually pretty good - this being one of them. 
From the outside it looks kind of shady... like... oh this is not going to be good... but then it is. 
Fresh fish. I always get yellowtail sashimi when I go for sushi and this was pretty good... not the best... but relatively fresh tasting. They have a huge selection of rolls... all of which were pretty delicious.

Our hotel was right down the street in cherry creek so we decided to take the 5 minute walk.  Eye appeal from the street isn&#39;t going to get you to walk through the door, but the food will keep you coming back.

We had a fantastic experience here.  From the start we were greeted warmly and with a smile.  We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs were quick to say hello.  We decided to order a Cupid roll, a Avalanche roll, fresh oysters, red snapper (both) sushi and sashimi, and wahu sushi.  In addition, we ended up having a couple bottles of Nigori Sake which was fantastic.  

The food here was served quickly and it was all delicious.  Our favorites of the night were the red snapper sashimi and the fresh oysters.  Both very fresh and large portions too!  The rolls were creative and the presentation was flawless. 

I enjoyed it here and if I&#39;m ever in Cherry Creek again I&#39;d have no issue stopping in for a second go around."

Started off our meal with gyoza and weren&#39;t disappointed! Some of the best dumplings I&#39;ve ever had and they came out of the kitchen fast, which was an indicator that the service would continue to be top notch (which it was!!).

We then ordered two rolls: Avalanche and Spicy Crunchy. The Avalanche had a lot going on, but was warm, fried, and filling. The Spicy Crunchy was like a spicy tuna roll 2.0 and I&#39;d highly recommend both.

Saw another reviewer telling people to try the Nuclear Roll, but we very quickly ruled that out as the description said &#34;very very very very very spicy&#34; :)

If we ever come back to this part of town, we&#39;ll definitely be back to sample some more sushi rolls!"

If just judging off the rolls it would be the best sushi in Denver. However I would say the sushi itself wasn&#39;t that impressive. We had tuna, fatty tuna, and yellowtail.

They started with a bit of kimchi and some miso (I like both, and both were good here).
Anywhere I go, I always get one specialty roll and some mixed nigiri and sashimi, and was not disappointed in either at Osaka. The yellowtail was awesome!

They don&#39;t take AMEX, this hurt my heart. They don&#39;t give out mints, but instead cappuccino candies, which were a nice twist.

Not super amazing great, but reasonably priced and good. I wish they had more non-mayo, non-tempura, non-crab special roll options. The reason it gets 5 stars is for customer service. We were there last night, and asked if they did anything special for our friend&#39;s birthday.

First of all, I don&#39;t get all the reviews that rave about this place.  I mean it&#39;s entirely possible that the &#34;all you can eat&#34; menu has completely different food than the regular menu, but if the former is that much worse then they shouldn&#39;t even offer it.

So, about the food... We had some nigiri sushi, I ordered tuna and yellowtail, and my friend ordered crab.  Crab was imitation crab, and the tuna was a tiny sliver on a big piece of rice.  You couldn&#39;t taste the fish if you ate the whole thing in one bite.  Same with the yellowtail.  We ordered &#34;dynamite&#34; which basically ended up being a bowl of mayonnaise with I don&#39;t know what else in there.  Green mussels, which I don&#39;t like to begin with, came with more of that &#34;dynamite&#34; mayo. The roll, tuna crunch roll, also had way too much rice, you couldn&#39;t taste any of the filling.  The tempura was on the greasy side, and the udon was bland.  We ordered quite a bit of variety, yet there was nothing that I would characterize as &#34;good.&#34;

One would think that this was a good deal at $17 per person, but for the quality of food I received, I certainly don&#39;t think it was."

Tucked away off Colorado behind Rubio&#39;s Baja Grill, I wouldn&#39;t have known about it. The place is kind of tiny and not good for large groups. I ordered a California roll, a Colorado roll, yellowtail sushi and miso soup. Everything was great! The Colorado roll was a Cali roll covered with baked salmon and smothered in a sweet sauce. I actually ate everything, and that typically doesn&#39;t happen. The server was attentive and quick at refilling my iced tea. I will be back for sure.  Great sushi place!"

This seems silly to be so excited about, but it goes to show how much they care about their customers. Apparently, the fresh fish menu on the wall behind the sushi bar is amazing. I had the vegetable tempura, seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, and playboy roll. All of which were amazing as I said above. I highly  recommend this place. Plus, it was packed and the atmosphere seemed really fun!"

It&#39;s tiny inside and got very crowded right after 6 on the Thursday I was there. I can see why it got so crowded! The sushi is very good, as is the service. My family and I enjoyed every roll we tried. To top it off they have green tea ice cream (my favorite) and they give you a generous serving. 

If you love spicy rolls they have something called the nuclear roll, if you finish they give you a bottle of sake! I&#39;m too chicken to try that, I can only handle tiny amounts of wasabi. But I&#39;m sure there are plenty of brave souls out there that would enjoy this challenge.

I&#39;m always skeptical about sushi places in Colorado but this place was worth the price and the wait! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back."

I have tried several of the other sushi spots around here and this is absolutely the best. This place honestly gives my Houston sushi spot a run for its money. 
I had the seared tuna sushi - THE BEST I have ever had, hands down no hesitation.
Philadelphia Roll - some places in Denver seem to put cucumber in philly rolls and exclude the avocado and that is so wrong, Osaka does it right. Salmon, cream cheese and avocado. 
Ichiban - OMG. I had them add cream cheese (which can sometimes be confusing but these guys totally got me) and it reminds me of the first roll I ever fell in love with. Amazing. 
I cannot believe this place is landlocked. 
Osaka has an atmosphere that I love. I feel completely comfortable going in alone and enjoying a nice relaxing dinner but they have plenty of space for large groups. It seems to be family or personally owned, I felt like everyone that worked there cared. 
The service is fantastic (this was my second time visiting - they were extremely busy my first time) and the guys behind the sushi bar were fun to chat with. It really reminds me of my go-to sushi spot at home and that&#39;s why I&#39;ll be visiting Osaka every time I crave sushi in Denver."

So now the food. The fish barely covers the rice! If you don&#39;t eat the rice than they will charge you for individual pieces. The edamame bean was under cook. That is why my daughter only ate one bean. The regular sushi on the other table looks good, but I didn&#39;t order any. After they rip me off by charging my daughter. Never ever going back.

My teenage boy and I always leave the table stuffed. Knowing that we just stuffed ourselves with fresh, high quality food is also very important to me and I know I get that at Osaka.

It is, hands down, the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. The staff is very friendly, the presentations are attractive (some even beautiful), and the prices are reasonable. I know my selections will be fresh, prepared properly and that the flavors will be on point. 

As other reviewers have noted, the exterior isn&#39;t notable. It&#39;s tucked away from the street in a strip mall in a corner unit, it&#39;s not spalshy in the least. I don&#39;t find this an issue since I use the internet to find restaurants, and that&#39;s exactly how I found Osaka Sushi. Seating is a little close, but it&#39;s a small establishment. It&#39;s very clean, which is a big deal for me, and ups the appeal (and my likelihood to recommend it to others) quite a bit. I place a lot of importance on cleanliness. If the dining room is sparkling, chances are the kitchen(s) are, as well.

Sushi lovers, I believe, will not be disappointed with their visit to Osaka Sushi.

It&#39;s only Thursday Friday and Saturday and when I called to ask about it they told me the Sushi pieces were quite a bit smaller if I&#39;d been there previously for dinner. I was told the rolls and appetizers were roughly the same size as dinner. I was a little concerned looking at some of these earlier reviews that said there was absolutely no fish and it was all rice. After reading this I ordered heavy on the rolls and 4 pieces of the sushi. I also ordered a seaweed salad. Seaweed salad was very good. When the sushi came to be honest I was expecting even less fish. I was fine with the portion. I ordered 5 more pieces. There was a lot of rice but hey this is all you can eat for $15.

I wasn&#39;t feeling sushi that night but they had a great selection of rolls and the menu has pictures so that is a plus.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu (my fall back aside for Udon soup) and it was good, I didn&#39;t like the fact they put the katsu sauce on top of my meal. I&#39;m use to the side of sauce.  Putting it on top made the panko crust soggy.  My boyfriend ended up getting the chicken yaki soba noodles.  The miso soup was good. The mochi was ok, a little freezer burn.

We found this place on Yelp, and decided to try it since it was a mile from our hotel and the reviews looked good.

It is behind Rubio&#39;s (same building), but we saw it right away. There is ample parking in the strip mall. We were greeted and seated immediately at a table in a cool little glassed-in area. It overlooks the parking lot (oh well), but was cozy. Ambience is pretty basic. Linen tablecloths and napkins, but not super-fancy.

I had a cup of green tea and the Super Bowl (spicy) - basically hwe dup bap (or Korean chirashi, I like to say to make my Kor-Am friends angry). It was a large bowl, and really delicious. Rice, greens, a generous amount of sashimi, lots of colorful tobiko, and the sauce on the side. I would go back for this.

My colleague ordered three rolls and said they were amazing. He couldn&#39;t finish three pieces of the spicy tuna roll, and the server asked him, &#34;Was something wrong?&#34; He said, &#34;No! There are only three pieces left, so obviously not.&#34;

They have creative rolls, which I love, and the fish is clearly fresh. The atmosphere is what makes it unique though. The servers are very friendly and I have a great sushi night story thanks to Osaka.

My boyfriend and I came in to Osaka a few months back.  He had never been before, but I had visited a few times. We&#39;re immediately seated and notice a large party in the middle of the dining room.  As we debate what they&#39;re there for, the owner (or who I&#39;m assuming was the owner) comes out and makes the longest line of sake bombs I have ever seen. It was all the way down the sushi bar, twice. The whole time he is singing and laughing, and the whole restaurant is into it. They proceed to pass out the sake bombs to EVERYONE in the restaurant, not just the party in the middle, who were celebrating multiple birthdays. Everyone cheered as we toasted the birthday people and drank our free sake bombs. The owner continued singing and dancing around the restaurant, and it was a blast.  My boyfriend fell in love with Osaka that night, and we try to come in regularly.  Haven&#39;t had another experience like this yet, but we&#39;re always hopeful!

Osaka has the best roll I have ever had. It is called the Colorado Roll and it is unlike anything I have had elsewhere. It has Crab Meat, Avocado, and Cucumber topped with baked Salmon and the baked salmon is the kicker. Melt in your mouth buttery taste that is out of this world. 

Don&#39;t miss this roll! The service is good and the prices are fair. The only two complaints I have is there is no wine special on happy hour and they don&#39;t open until 4:30 on Sundays.

But I&#39;m a realist and 5 star reviews are only saved for the best of the best. So this place gets a 4, a high-five, a you-should-go-there and a this-place-is-awesome.

I love Osaka. First time there the owner was celebrating something and called us into a sake-bomb train. Needless to say, we didn&#39;t need to be asked twice. How fun is that?

Service can be hit or miss, though I go here so often I notice that the poor servers tend to not last long. So overall it&#39;s generally pretty good.

The sushi is good. It&#39;s not the BEST in the world but it&#39;s definitely one of the best sushi spots in Denver. I&#39;ve reached out to other yelpers who&#39;ve left negative reviews about Osaka to ask where they prefer to eat, because honestly I&#39;ve had a hard time finding better sushi than Osaka for the price, and no one&#39;s been able to provide anything worthwhile. I honestly think they might&#39;ve just had a bad single experience and wrote this place off. Big mistake.

Osaka isn&#39;t the cheapest option in Denver. As a matter of fact, it might be a bit over-priced. But all sushi is in Colorado, and for the quality they provide and the atmosphere it&#39;s in (super laid back, wear whatever you want, ultra friendly owner) I always enjoy myself eating at Osaka.

Hint - sit at the bar. You&#39;ll get faster service and a free small pickled snack :)

Osaka is my go-to sushi joint and I recommend to everyone it become theirs."

If you&#39;re somebody who loves hole in the walls and sushi, you absolutely have to try this place! We love the rolls but my favorite dish is the Super Bowl! It&#39;s a bowl of rice, fresh salmon and tuna, some vegetables and a spicy red sauce. The pieces of salmon and tuna are amazingly thick and fresh!

I have to say one of the best things I&#39;ve had for a long time is the Cupid Roll which is a basic crab roll topped with a deep fried scallop and Unagi (eel) sauce. The balance of crunchy and melty is phenomenal! 

I was also impressed with the Caterpillar Roll which is eel and avocado. Finally, a decent place that gives you a hearty portion of eel! I also enjoyed the octopus which was just the right combination of chewy and yummy.

As I mentioned, the prices here are bit more expensive than I normally like but for the quality of sushi I would be willing to pay a tad bit more for this mouth watering experience.

There are a ton of seating options for such a small place. You can sit at the bar, a table, a booth or even outside on the patio. I plan to enjoy some outdoor sushi upon my next visit - even if it&#39;s in the dead of winter!

Employees here were really quick and nice. I believe it was the owner who asked us about the meal as we were leaving. He was funny and really showed that he cared about his customers and their experience. Quality service for sure!

This is a great place - it&#39;s well hidden from the main drag of Colorado Blvd. so only the Yelpers in the know can find it. Go get you some!"

This is the first place I&#39;ve been too in Denver that wasn&#39;t confused by the question &#34;what&#39;s fresh today?&#34;. That&#39;s probably because they already have that information listed on their specials board. They had a great selection of fish that was brought in the day I was there (red snapper, black snapper, baby yellowtail, spanish mackeral, halibut, and more). 

The service was also great here. My server was friendly and knowledgable. She made great recommendations and really added to the whole experience.

I would recommend this place if you are looking for fresh fish. It&#39;s also great for Americanized sushi lovers since they have a menu with pictures and all the regular deep fried saucy rolls. There&#39;s definitely something for everyone here. I will definitely be coming back!"

Ordered yellowtail, salmon, eel nigiri and playboy roll. It was very fresh and I especially liked their yellowtail.  The only thing was that half the rice from the nigiri pieces would fall out when I picked it up with chopsticks, but the fish was so fresh it didn&#39;t bother me as much.  Prices were good for the quality you get.  This is a traditional Japanese sushi place where you go to enjoy fresh sushi, not to go to a trendy place.  Would definetly come back again."

The prices for their regular sushi rolls are pretty nice, in the $4-6 range.  Their prices for their specialty rolls are a bit more expensive than average, $10-14.  That being said, their specialty rolls are great.  Prices on nagiri are pretty standard.  If you eat a combo of basic and specialty rolls, you&#39;ll probably spend about the same amount as you would anywhere else.  And their house salads are HUGE - it&#39;s a 9&#34; or 10&#34; plate - so plan for that if you&#39;re getting soup, salad, and sushi.

I unfortunately haven&#39;t had any of their other menu items, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;re great.

A word of warning, if they have their sushi challenge while you&#39;re there, DON&#39;T DO IT!  I eat a ton of hot things.  Most things that people think are inedible, I think taste a little spicy.  Their challenge is to eat a (forget what the name is) roll.  It&#39;s spicy fish of some sort - it really doesn&#39;t matter, because you will taste no fish - with a couple types of hot chili sauces.  And it&#39;s not a dab, it is several tablespoons-full.  What do you get?  A small, cheap bottle of sake if you finish it.  What did I leave with?  A shirt with pit stains, chest-sweat stains, and we&#39;ll just say &#34;a lower GI tract&#34; that wasn&#39;t happy with me and burned for 12 hours.

PS - the service is great always.  They even cheered me on a bit when I was all sweaty and gross from the aforementioned roll."

I get it rice is cheaper than fish. but if you appreciate and respect the art and balance of quality food , you will not want to dine here. 

Lastly and kind of a funny story.  When I was leaving the owner came up to me with a bowl of half eaten rice that I removed from the bottom of the paper thin sushi and said you must eat this.

I ended up ordering a lunch combo, which included simo soup, salad, 2 california rolls, tempura veggies and salmon. It was actually a good deal for the price, but the rolls were rather small and the rice was just bad, which gave the sushi a weird texture that I particularly didnt like. I&#39;ve tried a lot of sushi, and these rolls were the worst I&#39;ve ever tried, not because of the flavor, but because maybe the way they cook the rice or the type or rice they use isn&#39;t the appropiate. My brother in law ordered a 2-piece white tuna rolls and they were tiny too and he was so hungry and he paid around 25 dollars for the rolls and 1 beer. He was actually dissapointed and so was I  I had high expectations and this place is not at all a good or excellent sushi place as I read in the previous reviews.

Next Door is a good lunch spot for those who work in LoDo and want something a little nicer and healthy. I use it often for staff lunches as a nice place to reward people for doing a good job that doesn&#39;t break the bank. I do think the lack of french fries is a bummer but the potato smashers are delicious and the food is always clean and tasty. 

I recently took Claire C and my family here for dinner. I like it even more with a beer in my hand an a happy hour menu on the table. I absolutely LOVED the fried pickles. Sliced thin with a distinct flavor they are my new fav. The dates too. Wow so much flavor in such a delish package. Well done to whoever created both of those.

The smashers were tasty and properly cooked. The bacon wrapped dates were also good and the spicy sauce that it came with paired well. The sliders were average; cooked correctly but flavors were so-so.

The service was terrible. We came in with our kids and friends kids on Sunday afternoon. We sat outside and waited a prompt 20 minutes for a waiter to come by with water and to take our drink order. Brutal considering there were three other tables outside that he was going over to frequently.

The outdoor patio is simply the best spot for people watching and enjoying the view of the water features in the square!

Starters: 
* Chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates (3 per order $6.95) - Mouth-watering dates with crispy bacon, so flavorful.
* Crispy Garlic Smashers ($7.95) Absolutely scrumptious!
Sides:
* Balsamic Beets with almonds and feta crumbles ($3.95) Sweet &amp; Tangy (wish it had more almonds)
* Quinoa Salad ($3.45) My favorite! with the raisins. So refreshing, I could have this dish every day.
* Italian Polenta ($2.95) Even though it wasn&#39;t as flavorful as the other dishes, it definitely did not disappoint.

It was in a Fantastic spot.. Just across the street from Wynkoop Brewery AND Union Station.. Because who doesn&#39;t want to check out Union Station!!!
I thought the menu leaned on the pricey side. It was a bit upscale bar food with low key atmosphere! The waitress was very nice and accommodating. We had 6 adults and a toddler. We were able to sit outside enjoy the scenery of the splash area for the kids and still be shaded by the umbrellas and buildings!! The food was decent. I actually ordered off the kids menu, got the slider burger with garlic smashers.. I thought the burger was the right size for me rather than an adult size.. It was still a lot of food. If you super love garlic, order the garlic smashers. If you are so so on the garlic don&#39;t get the smashers, they are pretty heavy on the garlic and high on the indigestion scale.
Overall was good. The others with me thought the burgers were decent.. But two of them were made incorrectly and we didn&#39;t want to wait for them to be remade.  So it&#39;s decent I thought.. But the scenery was pretty fantastic!!"

I got a burger with &#34;smashers&#34; (lazy cut fried potatoes) and my wife got a salmon salad sandwich with roasted cauliflower in a curry sauce. The burger was fine, nothing special, but the smashers came out tough and stale. My wife was expecting chunks of grilled salmon with lettuce or something in the sandwich, ended up with essentially a tuna salad sandwich made from canned salmon plopped on a burger bun. The cauliflower wasn&#39;t cooked well and the texture was soggy and gross.

Sent back the smashers, the cauliflower, and the salmon sandwich. They redid the smashers, which were better but now crazy greasy. The wife ordered a burger slider but by the time we got it we were both ready to just leave. 

Wouldn&#39;t recommend it, wouldn&#39;t come back. It comes across as trendy and hip with their gluten-free and vegetarian offerings but the execution was just all wrong. Walk 5 minutes outside of Union Station and you have a plethora of better places to grab a bite to eat."

Plus, a killer wrap patio that has the most amazing Union Station People Watching. 

Lunch is also super solid; a concise, well-executed menu. It&#39;s a seated restaurant downtown, and priced accordingly.

They were quite happy with their dry salads - mission accomplished!

I&#39;m not sure where I heard it, but rumor held that TKND had Fish and Chips and it was rather good indeed. To arrive and find it not on the menu brought me a great deal of sorrow - my quest continues. I opted for a Salmon Salad Sandwich which had good flavor, but the sandwich needed some flair - some lettuce, tomato, and red onion would&#39;ve really set it off.

I stole some tastes of the Caesar Salad - tasty - and the Tomato Soup - creamy! Our waitress was delightful, so I&#39;ll be back around for some tourist watching."

Ordered the tomato soup and side of roasted cauliflower.

The tomato soup had very good flavor, actually, but was room temperature at best.

The roasted cauliflower was cold (served that way on purpose, but it didn&#39;t actually say that on the menu), and it had some kind of VERY UN-TASTY curry mayonnaise all over it. It was actually one of the worst dishes I&#39;ve ever had! :-("

We actually came to Union Station on a prior day for coffee and drinks and knew we had to come back to one of the restaurants for a meal. There were several options but we ended up choosing The Kitchen due to their varied menu. We literally waited until the doors opened at 11am to come in and got to pick a primo spot in the dining area across from the bar. Our server was really great; very friendly and continuously checked on us regularly. 

We ordered a variety of items. The Chorizo Stuffed Bacon Wrapped dates were amazing! The only downside was that there were only three. Crispy Garlic Smashers were basically a deep fried small smashed golden potato rolled in delicious garlic and herbs! These were absolutely delicious! I would order these over french fries any day of the week! The Italian Polenta was very good but was sort of bland. We actually mixed the red sauce that came with the dates in it and it was actually very good that way. The Quiona Salad was delicious. I didn&#39;t expect it to be served cold but I guess since it&#39;s listed as a &#34;salad&#34; I should have. I also ordered the Merlin&#39;s Carolina Pork Sandwich per our servers recommend. The BBQ sauce was a tad too sweet for me; I prefer more of a spicy sauce, but the pork was delicious and was perfectly shredded. The only thing I didn&#39;t enjoy was the type of bread/bun it came on. I actually ended up eating the BBQ pork, slaw, onion straw, pickle mixture naked without the bun after a few bites. The slaw that came on the sandwich also stood out to me. I enjoy a good cole slaw and this was great! The sandwich was also served with a side of arugula salad which was good mixed with the pork as well. They have a great wine and local beers list, as if that would be different from any other restaurant in Denver! If you&#39;re in the Union Station area and are looking for a great place for a meal, definitely recommend a stop in The Kitchen."

The beet sliders were delicious and big. The BF liked his pulled port slider so much that he ordered a second one.
The roasted veggie salad we shared was quite nice. It had lots of beets and carrots, with beans to up the protein content. What it lacked was a dressing to add a bit of tanginess. 

Nice place for lunch, dinner or happy hour."

The only area of improvement are the drinks, I&#39;ve been here numerous times and the cocktails seem to be a little too complicated. The sangria was too sweet with cinnamon, margaritas didn&#39;t have that tangy punch and the Moscow mule was over saturated with ginger syrup. Stick to a beer if you are getting drinks."

Union station is a great platform to host these weary travelers (or tourists) who are looking to kill some time. The Kitchen Next Door is a community pub within the station that is reasonably priced especially during happy hour, 3:00-6:00 pm everyday. 

This would be a great place to meet up with friends or co-workers after a long day. The happy hour menu has your typical pub food as well as a number of draft beers. Gluten-free options are numerous. The bacon wrapped dates ($3) come in threes and was on the sweeter side. I found the cheese burger slider ($4) to be quite lackluster and flavorless. However, a couple of highlights include the salt &#39;n&#39; pepper calamari and the honey sriracha wings (both $5). The Thai butternut squash soup was a little on the bland side, but I did enjoy the sunflower seeds and it&#39;s another gluten-free and vegan option. The Odell &#39;Loose Leaf&#39; is a nice session ale to wash everything down. 

I would stay for a few beers and some of the items on the happy hour menu, but probably not your best option if you want a good sit-down meal."

I ordered the mushroom rag-out and shared a plate of garlic smashers with the rest of the party. The garlic smashers came suspiciously quickly and were lukewarm. My boss suspected that they were a misplaced appetizer. However, even in their subpar state, they were crazily addictive. After all, who can resist fried fingerling potato slices doused in Parmesan and garlic? The mushroom ragout was yummy, even more than yummy. The juicy, thick mushroom slices were smothered by a large helping of creamy polenta and topped with tangy, bitter chard. The meal was flavorful and unique, but somewhat lacking in the subtlety and finesse that would make it 5-star worthy. Still, this was a very homey and tasty meal, and the service was quick and polite. So yes, I&#39;d go again to order another helping of garlic smashers and try their burgers."

I went to ask the bartender if we could just sit because there were lots of open seats but no one was actually available to seat us. The bartender quite rudely told me to continue to wait in line. We ended up getting lunch elsewhere after seeing others in line do the same and after waiting for 30 minutes to be seated despite them having available tables. 

After walking around Union station, we stopped by on the way back for a beer and dessert. The place was totally empty by then. We had an encounter with the same rude bartender as before. She proceeded to tell us that the dessert we ordered would take &#34;a while&#34; since she had to make it herself. Then she practically threw down empty glasses and the glass bottle of water in front of us that it made a startling noise. Did the same with the menus with the couple next to us. Let&#39;s hope she was just having a bad day and isn&#39;t the norm, but the place seemed pretty uninterested to win over their customers for a return visit. Disappointing."

Wasn&#39;t a particularly memorable experience. Apps and entrees were fine. There were a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options. We ordered everything from beet to burgers to garlic mashers to vegetarian ragout. Everything was fine but it was nothing we couldn&#39;t have made at home. Desserts were dense and boring; we ordered five different ones and only liked the lemon cake (it was called Kim&#39;s Cake or something close to that). Cocktail menu and beer list was small but fine. Two of us had the feature margarita and the others had beer and wine. There was a good seasonal pumpkin beer. The margarita was good, nice and strong, but again it wasn&#39;t anything that we couldn&#39;t have made at home or ordered at another restaurant. Hosts were not friendly (one person in our group made a comment about the host&#39;s &#34;snooty attitude&#34;). The worst part for me was the service. The server did the bare minimum, was not attentive, and made mistakes with both our appetizers and drinks. Overall, the server made us feel like we were an inconvenience. We are an easy group and always try to make things as easy as possible for wait staff when we go out, so this was particularly disappointing.

 On the plus side, the atmosphere is great! It has a refined-casual feel and is a great place to socialize with friends, family, and colleagues. Also, the hand soap in the bathroom smells really good.

We expected more from a Kitchen restaurant, especially having gone to The Kitchen on 16th Street as well as The Kitchen Upstairs in Boulder and having a great experience at both locations. We&#39;ll have to give this location another try in the future (and hopefully update this review with more stars)."

I will say my most unpleasant experience of this place is that the male host who usually seats us, seems to be very unhappy. Never smiles, greets you with a halfhearted &#34;Hi. 2?&#34; and then just lays the menus on the table as he slinks away from your table without even making eye contact or bidding you an &#34;enjoy your meal!&#34; I think he needs a major attitude adjustment.  :-/"

The service and food was phenomenal! I&#39;m not a fan of warm pineapple on just about anything but took a chance on the Pineapple Express burger and it&#39;s to die for! Balsamic pineapple = genius! Brought the whole family and all of us give it 5 stars!

We had two phenomenal servers who were excellent and quick on their toes. They made awesome suggestions and brought us out beer samples galore. I&#39;m not Really a beer drinker- but who better to get drunk in front of than the people you work with LOL. It was kinda funny because the server started at one end and when he finally made it to our end, we asked if anyone else had ordered alcohol- apparently the whole table had. So gauging on that- we were really here to celebrate and have a good time (nobody got drunk btw... We were just sipping)  their passion fruit beer is outstanding!! I don&#39;t even drink! I&#39;m the type of person who&#39;s a lot a fun but once you get a couple of sips in me I am laid out on the floor and that&#39;s no fun. For me to order a whole beef and not a sample will tell you how much I liked it. It was crisp, zesty and cold- the way a beer is suppose to be. I may start ordering beer at every meal ;) the pumpkin beer was light with some pleasant notes. And I felt just the right amount if alcohol.... &#39;Twas a good time. We got kale chips, calamari and honey sriracha wings as an app. Kale chips were good but drenched in oil, calamari was just ok- they give you tentacles and all. I usually just like the rings because ever since a I was a child I  was scared those tentacles may come back alive and start sucking on my tongue the minute I put it in my mouth. Honey sriracha wings we&#39;re pretty tasty.they were grilled but lacking a little spice.i ordered fish and chips as the waiters had suggested. I couldn&#39;t have picked a better meal. I think mine looked the best out of anybody&#39;s. Fish was white and flaky with just the right amount of golden batter. Chips were real potatoes smashed down, seasoned nicely and fried. Shrimp taco came out in soft flour tortilla with cabbage and pineapple. Looked good but was very bland. Shrimp to tortilla ratio was mismatched. Some tacos overflowing with shrimp while the other one was skimpy. I really like the environment of this place. Sitting on the patio- people watching and enjoying good food. Just the fact that it&#39;s right by union station makes it even better. Union station is breathtaking since the remodel. All In all- this restaurant is pretty good. We always go somewhere with healthier food options when we go with our company. I&#39;m definitely going back for a beer and I&#39;m bringing my husband next time. He loves those citrusy beers. His current favorite is some crazy grapefruit beer but I&#39;m excited for him to try to passion fruit."

The menu was also limited but interesting selection of appetizers and sandwiches that you don&#39;t see on a normal menu.

I had a Cuban sandwich (minus the pickles of course).  It came with smashed garlic potatoes that were outstanding.  I haven&#39;t eaten potatoes on years for health reasons but I ate these and remembered why I liked potatoes so much.

According to three of us, the mussels were very good.

It is a busy place and you would need reservations on the weekends or you would have to eat at the bar.

I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the service was great."

Today was a different story.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, an entry on the menu ($14.95).  It took too long for our lunch to be served and when it was I was more than disappointed.  They must have looked all over the ocean for the smallest shrimp they could possibly find and then deep fried them until they were hard, dry  and tasteless.  I would have sent them back if I wasn&#39;t so hungry.  I hope the next time I go there I make a better menu choice."

I came here for dinner on a Friday night..table reservation for 10 (they dont do smaller reservations FYI). It was pretty busy but not jam packed. We were seated immediately due to the reservation. I noticed some other smaller groups waiting a bit but nothing more than 10min it seemed.

The space is great..a bit industrial, a bit new, a bit retro (awesome green booths), and that amazing neon sign over the bar...I love it. Our table was one of the large high tops since we had a large group.

We all started off with some beers. I had a local Porter from Hogshead brewing. The tap selection was pretty good. Not massive but some really nice local choices. Service was great the entire time..especially with it being a pretty busy friday night after their grand opening. 

I ordered the beet burger with feta. I am not a vegetarian..but this thing was awesome! The combination of the beet and feta was perfect. I also got a side of garlic smashers..kind of like potato wedges but a million times better. I split an order of bacon wrapped dates with a friend..those were also really good. The bacon was amazingly smokey on it. I had a small taste of my friends mushroom ragu..also another tasty dish. Some others at the table got the burger and fish n chips. Thumbs up all around on the food. I cant wait to go back!!"

The first experience went really bad, but the owner and his team reached out to me, listened to what I had to say, and won me over on my next visit. Honestly, these guys care about their customers, their restaurant and their team. That&#39;s 4 stars in itself.

Food was excellent. The chef and his team made every dish flavorful and perfectly seasoned (seriously Chef, if you read this, it was a great service. High marks). We were even lucky enough to enjoy a couple dishes that the chef creatively created and successfully executed to perfection. Our server was extremely friendly and very attentive. We were even greeted by the manager who was super friendly and I really felt like she listened to everything we talked about instead of providing &#34;lip service&#34;. Their garlic smashers were probably my favorite :-)

While I&#39;m sure there was a little extra given due to my bad first visit, they could have easily just told me &#34;thanks for telling us, have a nice day&#34; and instead they took the time to just talk with me like a human being and listen to what I had to say. They didn&#39;t wave free stuff in front of me to make me happy, they just went out of their way to listen and make sure everything was how it should have been. Thanks guys! You won me over."

Easy to get a large table together. The on tap drinks were a bit weak, though they tasted good. The peach whisky drink was good. The smashed garlic potatoes were good. I&#39;d say its above average bar food, but not amazing. The burgers were ok. Two within our party were undercooked. It was ok, likely good for happy hours and large groups. The service was quick.

Ordered the Greek salad with lamb and my significant other had a hamburger (medium). It took forever to get our food (the entire visit took 90 min+another hour dealing with the aftermath) and the hamburger was well done and super dry (nothing like the first experience).  So I told the waitress and she asked if we would like another. We asked if it would take forever to get back...her response was probably given they were swamped. Now if you order something, and it isn&#39;t correct, shouldn&#39;t you be placed ahead of the queue to get what you ordered? That is what a nice burger place did for us last week in under 10 minutes. Not at this place. The manager came over and asked us about the problem and offered another hamburger too. Again, she didn&#39;t know how long it would take, but you could tell it was going to the end of the queue. We were tired of waiting and just wanted to move on with our evening, plus I was done eating my super small tasteless salad that was not worth its price in gold.  At the end of dinner, the waitress returned and asked us if we&#39;d like dessert. At this point, you&#39;d think they would at least give us a dessert for free, but that was not offered. At this point I told the waitress about our previous experience and she said &#34;see we aren&#39;t that bad.&#34; That is not what you say! You ask the customer what you can do to make their experience better at that moment...you don&#39;t sluff it off. They gave me two comment cards...I&#39;m guessing that was a hint.  I left a comment discussing the situation, but after we left it just kept nagging at me how much we had paid for the food and their response to the overcooked hamburger.  So I called and spoke with a different manager. I figured they needed to know how we really felt about the situation (not a few lines on a comment card).  Needless to say, that call got us nowhere and he kept trying to get off the phone with me. He did offer a free meal at the end (probably a way to get me off the phone given the impatient tone), which I declined and then requested a refund. He said he&#39;d comp it as long as I &#34;trusted&#34; him  with the credit card over the phone. Why would you say that to a customer! I hung up the phone, we decided to forgo our the plans for the evening, and proceeded back to the restaurant. We discussed everything with the first manager we saw (not the one on the phone), she requested the receipt (strange not the credit card given Mr. Impatient&#39;s request on the phone), and refunded us.  It is not clear to me if the managers are just naive, and haven&#39;t been properly trained, or the owner (who apparently is &#34;running all over the place and cannot be spoken to directly, but you can leave a comment on a comment card&#34;) has requested that they not compensate customers for their mistakes. Generally customers don&#39;t complain, they just don&#39;t come back; but given our first experience, I wanted to give them a chance to make it right. However, you need to make it right asap.  Ruined our evening out and we are both going to bed hunger :-(. Major bummer!"

Pros: 
- service was quick and friendly
- the spaces is great. Fabulous patio, huge windows, high ceilings, and a plethora of booths and various tables 

Cons:
- calamari was like salty battered and fried paper
- fish and chips were so soggy they tasted like they were wrapped in pancakes
- chicken on the salad tasted like it came out of the fryer

I came on a Tuesday and the daily special was fish tacos.  I get that it is a &#34;fresh&#34; kitchen.  But if your chalk special board item is that, and your out of that at 5:15pm, erase it!  There were a couple of other printed menu items they were out of which was disappointing and made the limited item menu even more limiting.

I settled for the pork sandwich and don&#39;t remember what it was served with.  Neither were anything more than just ok.  

I would skip this place since downtown is horrible for parking, the atmosphere was nothing special."

The fried kale, the bacon wrapped dates, the happy hour offerings, the kids menu, the patio and the sheer speed of things coming out of the kitchen.

First off, service and the waitstaff are professional, friendly and speedy.  Compared to many establishments, it&#39;s refreshing to find a staff like this one that seems to enjoy their jobs and make you feel at home.

Food:  Even if you don&#39;t like things like kale or beets, you really should try the kale chips and beet slider.  Seriously.

Standout items include the calamari (very light on the batter), meatballs and polenta, and the cheeseburger slider (or go all out and get a full size burger).  And as we said, get the kale chips.  

We do suggest steering clear of the garlic mashers and the wings.  The pork sliders are tasty but dry: save your calorie intake on the other items.

Overall, Next Door has been consistent in service and food across all of our visits, and we highly recommend stopping by for a happy hour or casual lunch-dinner."

I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s reasonably priced or else I would have been very upset over the mediocre meal I received there today. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich, thinking it would be a &#34;grilled chicken breast&#34; sandwich. It was not. It was dark and light meat, had no seasoning whatsoever. I asked for a honey mustard sauce or something to give it some flavor. I ultimately sent it back and ordered the chicken and quinoa soup instead. It at least had flavor, but I didn&#39;t see a bit of quinoa in the soup. My friends ordered the burger and were not impressed, one of them compared it to a burger you would get at a BBQ and &#34;assemble yourself&#34; so something you could most definitely make at home and do a better job. 

The service was good, I did appreciate our waitress taking my below average sandwich off our tab. But that alone would not bring me back to dine at the kitchen again."

My tomato soup had a sour taste, and my roasted vegetable salad was mostly greens: tiny bits of vegetables and a sprinkling of quinoa were hard to find amidst the greens, and the dressing was barely discernible and tasteless.

My mom had a pork sandwich that was so greasy she could barely eat it. Our server indicated that some of the liquid was vinegar but it was obviously not, making it unseemly to hold and leaving a large pool of dripping oil on her plate.

My husband ordered the beet burger which was interesting but certainly not amazing. My dad&#39;s hamburger was good, but at this point there was relief at the table that at least one thing was good.

Here&#39;s how it went down :
We have about 20 minutes to wait for a table, so I go to the EMPTY spot at the bar and order a beer. As I am about to order, some giant bearded bartender walks between the tiny girl I was about to order from, and GOES MEGA-BRO with his buddy standing next to me. I&#39;m all for fun and seeing a friend, but that was strike one and fantastically RUDE! The girl apologized and I order. Mind you, I order a beer for me and a water for my pregnant wife. 1st.....she leaves me standing there with the beer (no water) having NOT paid, and starts to help other people. I leave the money on the bar with NO water, and walk over to a serving station and get it myself.

I bartended for over 8 years and i find that the new batch of tenders in this town pretty much SUCK! You wanna make your money or have fun and goof off!? Do your fucking job! My wife and I decided, we&#39;ll probably go to any number of other places in LoDo next time and hopefully skip the lame attitudes at this over-hyped trendy establishment.

The beer list was short, sweet and to the point.  It was 10 beers long and included only Colorado based micro-brews.  Hogshead brewery was a highlight for me since they are harder to find in bars and restaurants.

The menu is not to big, not to small.  There is an assortment of salads, sandwiches and entrees along with a number of sharing/small plate dishes.  I tried the bacon wrapped dates, which were out of this world.  (It had been so long since I have seen dates on a menu!)  I also tried the garlic smashers.  Basically these are small potatoes, whole with the skin on with sections sliced into them and garlic seasoned.  They are very similar to truffle fries, but the whole potato.

For my main meal, I had the Salmon Salad Sandwich.  The sandwich itself was pretty basic, but amazing.  It was salmon salad, topped with arugula and an aioli.  Let me just say the sandwich did not last very long....

Unfortunately, I did not try any of the desert items.  Included on the menu are cookies, ice cream sandwiches and a few other items including an Adult Shake. (This tempted me the most for obvious reasons!)

I arrived first and went to the west side doors. Locked. With no sign to indicate where to go. I walked around and found the entrance on the north side. Easy if approaching from the north but any other direction and it&#39;s confusing. 

I sat at the bar to order and the staff was really friendly. I was brought water and it tasted really weird. No biggie just weird. I waited and waited. Got the ticket but the server realized he had charged me the wrong amount. I didn&#39;t see the itemized receipt to know what was charged incorrectly. Brought it back and it seemed to be right. 

Finally got our sandwiches and left. When we ate them my husbands pulled pork was SOAKING in what we think was olive oil. It was practically dripping off his fingers yet the pork was dry. Weird. He couldn&#39;t finish it. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it too had a lot of mayo on it. I didn&#39;t finish either.

They weren&#39;t 100% on top of their game this time. My husband got the fish and chips. Immediately, he knew the dish had been sitting and must have been reheated. Definitely NOT fresh. But the manager was on it. Gave us the hummus appetizer while waiting for them to redo the fish and chips. Appetizer was nice. I had the tomato soup and Learning Garden salad. Both were excellent. 
But it was a bummer that the place that should be serving fresh food, would reheat an entree. Bad decision on someone&#39;s part."

As many have noted, some of the food is clearly prepped well in advance and kept warm and/or reheated. Our garlic smashers were quite dry and were not very good or very bad, just okay, but the lack of moisture was a give away. You do expect more with the way this restaurant presents itself though. The Greek Salad was very good acording to my friend who had that. The burger I had was ordered &#34;medium&#34; but came out well done. There was no pink at all in the meat. Nice Beer selection.

The most telling review response for me is, I will not be coming back if I am picking the restaurant, but I will not object to going again if my friends want to."

Visited for a last minute happy hour with a coworker who was in town for a training and I was pleasantly surprised! 

First off, the decor and atmosphere of The Kitchen Next Door is awesome. It&#39;s got that casual Denver vibe with a large patio outside, which is great on those warm winter days and obviously PERFECT come summertime!

I think their community hour menu is one of the best values in town. Drink and food specials from $3-6 with plenty of options to choose from. Even for only $5, their food portions are impressively big and well suited for sharing. I thought everything we ordered was delicious - I&#39;m still drooling over the KALE CHIPS. Seriously, don&#39;t miss out on those, even if it&#39;s not community hour. Ours were warm, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. They were so good, I forgot to get a picture of them! If they could just make those for me every afternoon, that&#39;d be great.... thanks... We also tried the beet burger, hummus, and bacon wrapped dates, and I don&#39;t have a single complaint. Even with drinks, our bill only came to $34 pre-tip. 

While I can&#39;t speak for their full menu, community hour hooked me - I&#39;ll definitely be back soon."

When a friend was visiting recently we went to The Kitchen in the newly-remodeled Union Station in downtown Denver.

Our first impression was when we tried to order drinks from the bar - red bull &amp; vodka, Coors Light, and vodka/soda. They didn&#39;t have red bull or Coors Light, haha, but that&#39;s when we realized we weren&#39;t in Kansas anymore.

Now that we&#39;d gotten a hang of the vibe, which was full of hip young, bearded Denveriites and their athletic dates, we settled into our table and ordered a round of bacon-wrapped dates and honey sriracha wings to start. For dinner I ordered the wild sockeye salmon salad, which I&#39;d seen being served to someone else on my way in. The waitress warned the salmon comes out almost like tuna, pulled apart. I happily shook my head as that&#39;s what turned me on to the salad in the first place. :) I don&#39;t usually even like arugula, but it was so mild and balanced among the other ingredients that I really enjoyed it.

The guys with me enjoyed their meals also, but I can&#39;t remember what they got. I would definitely come back! The main reason I&#39;m not giving this a five is that we felt like we were being watched when we walked in, and most of the servers seemed really awkward every time we interacted with them. It was probably just growing pains with a new staff."

After all, the dish is listed up high on the wall in the main terminal. If you are advertising like that, it has to be good. Unfortunately, my hopes and dreams of a great pub fish and chips experience was dashed. Should have headed on over to GB on Broadway. They are the best. 

So what is wrong with the Kitchen&#39;s version. The fish itself was ok, beer battered and crispy. 3 small pieces of fish. Hardy a fish and chips size portion. The chips, we all know when you say Fish and Chips in America, you get fish and fries. Nice crispy golden brown fries. Maybe some slaw on the side. Nope, not here. Here you get some kind of potato mush. They are seasoned well with Parmesan and garlic. Again a small portion. But nothing to yelp home about. The dish was accompanied with some kind of Mayo. Not sure what was in it, but there was definitely not a lot of flavor. I think it was suppose to be spicy. Maybe we got the part that did not have much mixed in with it. Who knows. Regardless, the quality was not there. It was like someone was trying to elevate Fish and Chips, but they just did not think it through. At a Pub, really! Some things should be as they are expected. 

Service was nice and friendly. Nice atmosphere. Great location. 

I doubt we will be back. It is a bit of a drive for mediocre food."

Big bummer on us! The hostess w/ the gauged ears was our first interaction. She said very bluntly, &#34;all we have is seats at the bar. is that fine?&#34; and given the occasion, i asked if it would be ok if we waited for a table.  This obviously displeased her and she said it would be 20 mins. (presumably just to see if we would change our minds.) As predicted, our table was ready shortly after.  Our initial waiter was friendly and helpful, but a second waiter chimed in while we were still deciding on food and was obviously eager to get out order in.  He was rude in his approach and we both thought he was weird.  When my cuban came out, it was sloppily thrown together and the cole slaw was measly.  Every employee in the restaurant looked pissed off to be at work.  We were in by 8:15 and out by 9.  Very disappointed! We typically suggest this place to visitors.

Not my choice, but I wasn&#39;t going to be picky. We arrived to a pretty busy dining area, and were given two options-wait for a proper booth/table 20+ minutes-or dine at a community high top. The group chose the community high top, again not my choice, after a long day on your feet who wants to sit on a stool without any back support, not me. The service we received from our server was very helpful and professional, happy hour had been over for 15 minutes but he still allowed us to squeeze some food and drink from the menu. This is probably the only reason for 3 stars and not 2.
 I&#39;ll explain why, the appetizers were nice. Hummus with carrot chickpea salad was probably my favorite thing...and come on, hummus being the favorite thing at a non-middle eastern place is kind of sad. The wings were nicely flavored and a decent portion for HH pricing. The mussels, oh dear, more sadness. The broth was pretty flavorless and the mussels themselves were tiny, smaller than &#39;baby clams&#39; from the can. I ordered the bangers and mash and got no bang from it whatsoever. The sausage was bland as were the dense mashed potatoes, and the greens-barely sauteed, again no flavor and I could still taste dirt/grit on them. The gravy tasted of the instant kind, so I just ate more hummus and carrot salad. The food did come out in a timely fashion, but we were probably only there for an hour when a hostess came over to &#39;politely&#39;  share that our &#39;community&#39; table&#39;s party was arriving and they needed the space cleared and ready for them. She did offer to seat us at another spot when &#39;one should become available&#39;. Ugh, maybe a heads up upon seating that we were only going to be allotted a certain time frame to dine. There were two in our party that had just received their second round of beers. Plus we were with a toddler, even more of a hassle to move. We just decided to slam the beers and get out of there. This was a disappointing dinner indeed, except for that hummus plate, that carrot and chickpea salad really is good, maybe the only thing to go back for."

Keep in mind this restaurant is Mexico Mexican food and I am from Texas, so prefer Tex-mex, but also like Baja-mex, New Mexico-mex and mountain-mex. anyway, the menu was large but many items seemed very similar with just one ingredient difference. I had a hard time figuring out what to order and went with the waitress&#39;s suggestion. 

The guac was very good. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had (I&#39;m picky) but above average for restaurant guac. They also bring you 4 salsas complimentary. The avocado/jalapeño and tomatillo ones were decent but not great. The other two were just spicy with very little flavor. 

My husband had chili rellenos which were poblano chilis (he prefers them to Anaheim which are more common so that was a plus) They admitted they were premade/prestuffed so instead of adding chicken to the inside they added a very flattened chicken breast on top. He says they were above average. 

I ordered the Tlacoyos which were oval shaped thick corn tortilla like things covered in onion tomato cactus and beef. They tasted good but I was full from chips etc so only ate 1 of the 3. I&#39;m looking forward to the leftovers. 

The main reason I am taking stars off from this restaurant is the ambiance and cleanliness. If you prefer authentic Mexican, the food is decent, but I would recommend take out. the dining room experience was subpar. The building was old and outdated and it showed throughout.  You can tell they have done a couple of &#39;updates&#39; but they were cheap and haphazard. Mostly, I just felt like everything was dirty, like they never bothered to deep clean or in cases like the bathroom, might not clean very often."

Good. 

The portions seem bigger, the flavors are all there what a huge improvement! 
Congrats carboncitos , you guys have shown that you really give a damn! And judging by how packed you get for lunch everyday, other patrons have noticed the changes too.
There have also been some menu changes as well, you now get Guacamole with your burrito, and some new and delicious items were added to their menu.

The chilie rellano burrito is the best! There are now 2 stuffed rellanos inside instead of 1. Its huge!!  Love it

While we could have hung around the Source &amp; had an overpriced plate of $4 per tacos, we chose the authentic route &amp; headed to Los Carbs. This place has been bookmarked on my page for a year...a YEAR, but it was finally time to try it. As a taco fiend (I see you there, Doug), I HAD to go with 1 taco (a tripita) + a coctel de camaron (that&#39;s a shrimp cocktail for all you non-bilinguals out there), while hubs got my favorite, Chicken Mole (that&#39;s why we&#39;re married...he feeds my glutinous tendencies).

The taco was muy delicioso (delicious), and exactly what I was craving. The coctel on the other hand was lacking the spiciness that I crave, but nothing that a little Tapatio couldn&#39;t solve. Fair warning - the onions are hovering down at the bottom so mix it up real good. The mole was a little gritty but still great. Hubs didn&#39;t like that they shredded the chicken because it creates a soupy texture, but I don&#39;t care - I gotta get my fix!

Huaraches.  I don&#39;t really see these commonly anywhere, and this place is the first place I ever tried them.  Tried them the first time ( with steak) and then again this time ... with steak and shrimp ( had to add some variety  LOL) .  They are soo good.

The salsas are SPICY!  Take your breath away spicy, but I liked them quite a bit.

The entree was filling, unique, and perfectly put together.

The staff was polite, friendly, helpful, and prompt from start to finish.

My only complain was that is was freezing cold inside!  It felt as if the heat wasn&#39;t on at all, and we kept our heavy winter coats on the entire time.  It really felt like we were outdoors in late December.

I&#39;ll be back at some point though!"

The first time I came here on a taco tour, hosted and arranged by the taco connisseur Doug Y. Los Carbs (haha. yes. LOTS OF CARBS) was stop #3 and made me very glad I had showed restraint at stops #1 and #2.

A little nicer than some of the other stops, we were seated at tables with menus here. The waitress will bring out a carousel of four HOT AS HELL salsas, plus one mild cup... and a basket of hot, salted, greasy, and crisp tortilla chips. BE CAREFUL and do not dip your entire chip into any of the CAROUSEL OF HELLISHLY HOT salsas. Even if you think you can eat spicy, do a taste test before diving in. All of them are delicious, but they could burn your taste buds right off.

Then, you&#39;re faced with the difficult decision of what to eat. During the taco tour, I ate... tacos (duh). The carnitas here are tender crispy and flavorful. I had mine plain (no cheese) with onions only. I dabbed on a bit of salsa and I was in heaven. The second time I came, I had more tacos (this time, carnitas, bistec, and al pastor... with the carnitas still being the favorite), with the griddled cheese. Mmmmm. I was in heaven. The third time, I made myself order something that wasn&#39;t a taco. My friend ordered the sopes, which she devoured. I ordered the huerache, which is a giant oblong griddled tortilla, topped with refried beans, queso fresco, onions, and ... carnitas. I was full after eating about 2/3 of it, but enjoyed the last bite just as much as the first (and yes, I finished it. I have no regrets). Plain taco is $1.50. Taco with cheese is $2. The heurache was $7. Seriously folks... please keep your expectations realistic when you&#39;re paying so little for so much flavor. No shi-shi decor here, mmm k?
 
I can&#39;t wait to try other dishes... but I would expect that every other visit will be for tacos."

First off, I&#39;m a first generation Mexican and I know great authentic Mexican food. I can make it and my mom, aunts, grandmothers etc are / were all amazing at cooking and rock authentic Mexican cuisine. This place was Terrible with a capital &#34;T.&#34;

I book marked it due to the great review, one of my good friends (who is a Yelp Elite extraordinaire) raves about this place, and because of the sopes on the menu. I recently became a huge fan of sopes after learning to make them in a cooking class. I asked our waitress for her recommendations and the three top dishes that are most popular here. I was excited as she stated the sopes were indeed one of the top 3 dishes. 

If the sopes were one of the top three dishes here, I don&#39;t care to try the other top dishes. The sopes were so bland. I tried three different toppings for each - al pastor, steak with nopalitos, and chorizo and all three were flavorless and the pork and steak were on the tough side.

What&#39;s even more disappointing is that I took a friend who was visiting from out of town to this awful restaurant. He ordered the chicken flautas and a side of Mexican rice and beans. When they served us, and saw the unappealing presentation, I became really nervous about whether he&#39;d enjoy his meal. I&#39;ve never seen such a sad plate of flautas. If I can make a better Mexican meal and my presentation is better, (and I consider myself to be an average cook in my family), it leads me to believe that the meal is going to be disappointing and it truly was. 

We were both really hungry, and usually when you&#39;re really hungry, it can make what your eating taste even better. This was not the case. I didn&#39;t even eat half my meal as I was so put off by the blandness and toughness of the meat on the sopes."

My favorite part was the cheese - instead of just putting shredded cheese on the tacos, they sort of made it into a little pan seared cheese pancake (without batter). It made for an extra crunch texture to the taco while still giving the cheese flavor. I only tried one of the 4 table salsas, as I was told they were extremely hot, and the &#34;mildest&#34; one was too hot for me. Other people at the table were loving them, though. Atmosphere is a little bit cramped, but not bad."

I love the tostadas de tinga and the chicken mole is dark, classic, and spicy. It&#39;s the slow heat that builds and pours out of your soul. Your tastebuds will never know what happened. 

The portions are huge and you&#39;ll definitely have leftovers. The service can be a tad slow at times, but it&#39;s completely worth it. 

Try the mango juice out of the tap, it&#39;s wonderful!

When we finally did get the food, it was burnt and thrown onto the plate. 

It took 15 minutes to get a refill on a soda, and when we asked about where the soda was, we were met with a defensive attitude saying it would be out soon. Really?!

 It took 35 minutes to pay the bill, and she mistakenly charged us double the amount we were supposed to pay. 

We never received an apology for the slow/terrible service, but were met with a defensive attitude like we should be grateful she was paying any attention to us at all. Our server never asked how the food was, forgot to bring a leftover box multiple times, and the other server was walking around on her cell phone the entire time.

We were very disappointed in the atrocious service and are bummed that we wasted 2 hours and our business at this place."

I&#39;m trying to be as objective as possible because the harsh reality is that I didn&#39;t like this place because it&#39;s too authentic. I know that sounds crazy, but as a Denver transplant who was born and raised in Texas when I want Mexican food I really want Tex-Mex. So it&#39;s less about me not liking it and more about it not being what I wanted. 

I ordered chicken enchiladas which came with tomatillo sauce. Red sauce is not even an option here, verde or mole is what you get. The quality of ingredients are really good and the fresh queso blanco was delightful. However, because what I really wanted was Tex-Mex, I was super bummed when the rice, beans, and inexplicable pile of iceberg lettuce were missing from my plate. So even though the chicken was crispy and delicious and contrasted the soft corn tortillas perfectly, I was not satisfied. 

My husband ordered (I can&#39;t remember the name) what was basically a hash-peppers, meat, cheese- that came with tortillas. Again, well prepared and delicious... But &#34;Where are my beans and lard?!&#34; I shouted silently to the heavens, but sadly no one responded. So he ate it sans beans. 

The service was fine, not great and not bad, and everyone was super friendly. 

So in conclusion, if you are craving authentic Mexican food then you should totally go here all the time. However, if you prefer Mexican food that has been exploited by white people and topped with cheddar cheese... Than you might leave a little disappointed."

The fact that it was packed at lunch gave me the idea that this must be really good food.

I wasn&#39;t familiar with a lot of the menu offerings so everything seemed over priced to me.  The long wait after we ordered gave me time to notice that the place feels like it could use a good deep cleaning.  

Then the food came:  my 3 little carboncitos were fantastic!  Real charred steak and cheese plus they honored my special request for some shredded lettuce on top.  Hubby had an enchilada/mole dish that he exclaimed over.  Total cost was about $25 for those and a couple of sodas.

Probably won&#39;t go back since I&#39;m not a fan of Mexican food generally, but we came away satisfied.  Another place checked off the list of places to try."

When you walk in you are greeted with a basket of chips and five different kinds of salsas. There are two green and three red/ orange salsas. The green are relatively mild while the dark red and the Orange are spicy. 

We ordered the chicken verde enchiladas (the chicken was a little dry), 5 tacos, and an order of the churros. The tacos were definitely a steal, and utterly delicious. Out of the tacos we ordered chicken, steak, al pastor, carnitas, and the chorizo the best one was hands down the chorizo. The meat was tangy and flavorful and all around delicious. I highly recommend trying the chorizo, even if you aren&#39;t a chorizo fan this will change your mind. Lastly, the churros were amazing. The ice cream that comes with the churros is to die for (and this is coming from someone who doesn&#39;t like ice cream).

1.  Nothing is ever consistent here.  In the short 2 months we have been coming here, we have had problems with orders 4-5 times.  Once, we got a steak burrito when we ordered 2 chile relleno burritos.  Our side of guacamole was with the steak burrito, and they never replenished when they took the wrong food away.  We have been charged for smothered burritos when we never requested smothering.  We have been provided chips and salsa, but not the 4 special salsas, and most recently were given all 5 salsas, and our guacamole, but no chips.  Everyone around us had chips...finally we had to ask after our food had already been brought over.  No refills on water, ever.  

2.  The salsas and chips are recycled should you not eat all of them.  I saw one of the staff take a half-tray of chips from one person&#39;s table, fill it with more, and then give to a couple next to me.  The 4 salsas are dumped out into new tins to &#34;fill&#34; them for new patrons.  What all this means is anyone&#39;s guess.  Perhaps Chuck has nasty bathroom habits, and pisses all over his mitts prior to shuffling through the chips.  Perhaps Jimmy likes to lick the spoon, and then insert it back into the salsas.  Nonetheless, these things should be considered.

I will add that the burritos are still great, and I appreciate the kitchen staff Wearing Gloves, a lost art."

The quality of the meat is *horrendous*. I got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas and ended up only eating the mole sauce and the tortillas. The meat was either overcooked, incredibly low quality, or both - completely inedible! The chicken was like dry rubber and had to be chewed extensively while suppressing the gag reflex.

The green one was spicy enough for me so I didn&#39;t try the hottest one. 

We ordered the chorizo queso fundido to start. Presentation was plain but they were so delicious! We also ordered the enchiladas verdes and three fish tacos. The enchiladas were a huge portion and tasted good. The tacos were the best dish - the fish was flaky inside and nice and crisp on the outside.

We used to go at least twice a month. I usually get tacos or their ceviche. The last time we went their ceviche was bad! It was tough, chewy and didn&#39;t have a great smell.. I told the waitress something was wrong with it and I no longer wanted it.  I told her I would still pay for the cerviche and I wanted to order tacos too. We could tell the server was pissed. She asked me if I wanted to pack up the rancid food... No, thank you?? When the tacos came out our waitress, along with the other waitress took turns coming to our tables every two minutes to ask if it tasted okay. We got the hint, time to go! We paid for all our tacos and the ceviche.
Also, I&#39;m sure I probably ate a good amount of saliva or whatever special ingredient they decided to add to my tacos. 

The food was great, but the service was a disaster. Go enjoy their delicious cheap tacos, but beware if there are any problems do not tell the servers!!"

There was a group of us and we got to have a bunch of different things, which I am still not sure if is was a good thing or a bad thing.  We got apps and that with the chips and salsas I was full by the time my food showed up.

The salsas were great, and they had some for real kick.  Mmmmmmmmm  I like the spice.

The queso with chorizo was excellent and so was the horchata,

Everything that I had was pretty good.   The service was functional.

I put a thread out on Yelp talk looking for a place in this area where I could grab some take-out for a few guys.  Mark T. recommended Los Carboncitos.  I am glad that he did.  It was only a few blocks from my destination, so that made it very convenient.  I found a nearby parking spot and put in my order.  They did not seem terribly busy, but it took a bit longer to put my food together than I anticipated (but, not too long).  I was a bit disappointed that they do not have a salsa and condiment bar here.  I really enjoy being able to pick out my own salsas, onions, peppers, etc.  I asked for a variety of salsas with our tacos, and they did oblige. 

We sampled several tacos in our order, including: AL PASTOR, BISTEC, CHULETA, and CHORIZO.  The Al Pastor was a tad disappointing. The Pineapple on these particular tacos reminded me of canned (it may have been).  The chunks were rather large, and it made the taco way too sweet for my taste.  The Bistec was a straightforward steak preparation, and it was just fine.  The Chuleta was equally good (how do you not like pork chop?).  I thought the Chorizo was decent, but my one friend loved it and gobbled them up quickly.  I was a bit sad that they did not offer Carnitas on the tacos (my personal favorite).  All in all, these were solid tacos at reasonable prices.  They may not have been as much to my liking as say TacoMex 1 on Colfax or El Taco Veloz on Federal.  But, I would put them on par with Tacos Junior on Federal."

Other times, you have a few randoms here or there dining but I come for take-out. 

This place is from Mexico City, so it&#39;s a bit different than what I&#39;m used to (GDL). However, I appreciate the differences and I just know what to expect.

As you might expect from a place called Los Caboncitos, grilled/charbroiled food is the specialty here. You can&#39;t go wrong with an order of carne asada or just some tacos served up with one of their four super-spicy salsas.

I also really like the huaraches here because they aren&#39;t found at most Mexican restaurants in town. Huaraches consist of a masa (sort of tortilla) base with a variety of toppings on top. I got one with grilled beef, charred nopales, and queso fresco. It was quite delicious.

Two friends and I stopped by around 10 PM on a Friday night, and we were seated immediately; it wasn&#39;t particularly busy, and there is ample seating. The chips that they have to start while you wait to order are just meh, but the different salsas they come with adds nice variety to the starter. We ordered a few things a set of head and tongue tacos to split, the Super Carbonara, and the bistec huarache. The head tacos were deliciously fatty and flavored, while the tongue had an odd flavor and texture; I would definitely recommend the former over the latter. The Super Carbonera was just sort of a jumble of meat that was decent but not amazing, but the corn tortillas that they provide are outstanding. Fresh and soft, those were the real stars of the night. The bistec huarache was also decently flavored/cooked meat on the long, hardened corn tortilla which was not as good as the soft tortillas.

The service was pretty poor as we had to essentially serve ourselves/pick glasses that were actually cleaned over others. For a cheap, solid, no-frills Mexican meal, Los Carboncitos will do just fine."

When we came in there were only two other groups seated, but the place quickly became busy with other tables seated all around us. We grew suspicious when tables who came in after us, and ordered after us, got their food first. We were about to say something when one person in our party finally got her two simple tacos placed in front of her.

I, and the other person in our party, sat there without our burritos for another ten minutes. Finally my burrito arrived. I had ordered a steak burrito, not smothered, but after several bites I discovered I was given a chicken burrito. The other person in our party, who still had not gotten their food, had ordered a smothered chicken burrito so we let the server know I must have gotten their food.

They took the burrito back and about ten minutes later finally came back with both of our burritos. The person with us turned their plate around, which was a smothered burrito as ordered, but we all discovered several bites out of it! My bites!! They actually took the chicken burrito back that I had started eating, smothered it and brought it to another person at our table! Wow...wow, is all I can say!

We alerted them of this but they clearly did not understand the issue! This is a health issue and completely appalling. 

We didn&#39;t receive even the smallest discount for this blatantly horrible experience, nor did we receive an apology; truly, they just didn&#39;t get what the issue was. Again, still in shock!"

I first shyed away from this place as I was afraid that they only had offerings catering towards the carnivorous types.  Not so.

Enter the Alambre Vegetariano.  It&#39;s basically a bunch of veggies/fruit (nopales, pineapple, mushrooms, and onions) scrambled with a bunch of cheese and served with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  They also obliged the boyfriend&#39;s request for a meatless burrito despite one not being on the menu (it was HUGE) and only charged $5 for it.  I asked for a side of guac to eat with my meal and it was the variety that all other guacs should strive to be: bright green and chunky with ample amounts of red onion and cilantro.  At $3 for a big side it was a steal.

Warning about the salsas: they are hot.  All four of them.  I went to El Diablo recently and was able to eat their hot salsa like it ain&#39;t no thing after singeing my taste buds with this stuff.

I&#39;d probably go back and give it another try, but I was really disappointed in the tacos el pastor, since that&#39;s the main reason I went.  But, some of the dishes I saw being delivered to other tables looked pretty tasty, so maybe I&#39;ll try something different next time.

Ladies:  If you use the restroom to wash your hands, as you probably will after eating tacos and salsa, be careful.  The knobs on the sink are reversed and the hot water is scalding hot.

Here are what we order for that day :

*  Carbonicitos ~ Bistec y Queso.  These comes with 3 toastada shells, steaks and white Mexican cheese, some onions and some cilantro.  We share this dish.  Hubs ate 2 and I ate 1 piece of the toastada shells.

*  Enchiladas En Verde ~ This dish comes with corn tortilla, filled with chicken and topped with tomatillo sauce.  Hubs&#39; order.

*  Camarones Emapanizados ~ This dish comes with breaded shrimps, beans, rice and salad.

Hubs give his order of Enchiladas En Verde 4 STARS.  While for the Bistec y Queso, he gives it 3 stars.

As for my main entree of Shrimp, I give it 3.25 stars.  What I like about my Shrimp dish, was that they did not skimp on the shrimp itself.  The flavor of the breaded shrimp is just norm with salt, pepper and some seasoning in which I am still trying to figure out what kind of seasoning they used.

In addition to this, I am still trying to figure out the 4 Salsas that were served to us @ our table in order for us to spice up our food.  

The service is prompt.  Hubs told me, this place reminds him of some place he ever ate in Mexico and some restaurants back in San Diego, Cali.  Mostly, run by the family.

The decor of this restaurant is simple, bright and clean.  We might return to this restaurant or perhaps try the other locations, if we are in the neighborhood."

Let me direct the spotlight for a few moments to their alambre.  Diced beef onions and peppers grilled amd topped with....  bacon. and cheese....  The buttery goodness lingers on lips as I write this review.  So good.

Now imagine replacing the beef with al pastor.  Sweet and tangy pork mixing with bacon.  I might stab someone to get another al pastor alambre.  Really.

This place is so good my significant other loves Mexican food now.   She normally viewed going for Mexican cuisine as a bargaining chip to go something else she wants.  Now she starts begging to go to Los Carboncitos around lunchtime.  No joke.

Are some of the other things here not the greatest?    Absolutely.   Viewing the menu as a whole might only rate this place three stars.  But the things this place specializes in (huarache, alambre, tacos carboncitos) are worth driving across town for, which is my definition of 5 stars."

We knew some yelpers were working their way thru town eating tacos and thought &#34;Well we&#39;re not with them, but we can go eat at one of their stops&#34;

and so we showed up to Los Carboncitos. 

Glad we did.

I love hot stuff. Every dish we make at home has kick. THe more the better.
This place kicked my butt. All 4 salsa&#39;s they brought out, HOT.

Before my meal even arrived, my mouth was on fire, my eyes were watering, my nose was running.

Then my food arrived. Best mexican dish I&#39;ve had in a long time. I of course put more salsa on it, and suffered, but loved every minute of it.

Go there, eat good food."

Not that I&#39;m a Mexican food junkie like a lot of people....it&#39;s usually pretty far down my priority list. However, authentic Mexican food like the stuff this place serves is a whole different story. There is pretty much no gringo-ized food on the menu. We asked the waitress what region the food was from since I had no idea what most of the stuff on the menu was, and apparently it&#39;s Mexico City style. 

The first time we tried both the alambre and the huarache, and both were excellent. Full of flavor, and not so unhealthy tasting like a lot of Mexican food that is drenched in cheese and oil. They also bring you 4 different salsas which are all excellent. The second time I had the mole enchiladas which were literally mind-blowing. By far the best mole I&#39;ve ever had and tasted very fresh. 

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to enjoy standard &#34;Mexican&#34; food again. This place is one of my new favorites."

One of my favorite things here is the shrimp cocktail, which is giant. It comes in a large cocktail glass like most mexican restaurants however this has the most amazing flavor. I love it! The alambre de bistec is also quite good and a regular on our rotation when we dine here.

Simple delicious homemade corn tortillas, topped with your choice of about ten meat preparations, cheese, onion, cilantro, their fresh table salsas and I am in heaven.

It was a gorgeous and unusually warm day in October so we were pleased to score a comfortable booth near the windows. We both really enjoyed the atmosphere. There&#39;s a lot going on!

We started our lunch with a dozen raw oysters to share. They were from New York and of a moderate size (no gulf coast fatties). For the entrée my husband had the market chicken salad, and I had one of the daily specials - the cheesesteak sandwich with fries.

The service was spot-on, and everything was tasty. Nothing stood out as being excellent, but nothing stood out as being bad.

It&#39;s a pleasant enough atmosphere and our server was polite and attentive, but the food was mediocre at best. 

I had the sushi bowl salad, and it was wayyyy overdressed. Part of the allure of having sushi is being able to taste the fish and feel its texture. It was lost in this salad.

The brussels sprouts were okay, and the sauce was good, but again, there was far too much sauce. 

Worst of all, the small pour of beer I got was twelve dollars. Twelve dollars for a small pour. That&#39;s absurd, and it&#39;s part of a broader trend happening here in Denver. Yes, it&#39;s a microbrew. Yes, it&#39;s probably worth more than your standard pint. But $12? Gimme a break.

The deserts were unimpressive. My wife had the Key Lime Pie and the filling was good but the crust was bland. I had the cheesecake, which was also somewhat bland. Both tasted like they had come out of a freezer. 

We ended up spending over $100 for our meal and it was just mediocre. We won&#39;t be going back."

For 3 people, the lunch bill was $70, (two of the three had water to drink and one iced tea, 3 sushi + salads). I think they probably get a lot of business from people leaving the convention center (as we were), but as a local I would not come back here to eat."

Before I get to the food I want to say that Whitney our server was one of the best I&#39;ve had in a long time. She was friendly, had a ton of personality and took care of everything we needed throughout the meal. A great server really does make a meal better.

The atmosphere is bar like in one area with high tables and TVs, a big bar with mussels/shellfish, several tables and booths in a more restaurant style. It was very busy on the Thursday we went so any table was good.

The only item I wouldn&#39;t order again is the ceviche. It came in a cup surrounded by white and blue tortilla chips. You had to use a fork to get the ceviche out. The ingredients were a ton of onions  (should be chopped up not large pieces ), lime, a type of whitefish and cucumber. Ok taste but nothing special.

What was amazing is the social burger. They cook it to order (I went for medium rare) &amp; the burger has a ton of good spice and flavor and is high quality. The social comes with pork belly, onion straws, jalapeño raspberry jam, lettuce and aoili. With a side of seasoned fries this was out of this world good.

They have a ton of beers and cocktails and what appears to be a great happy hour.

Will definitely be coming to stout street again."

Overall this was a good place, we ordered a few rolls which I found very tasty, a couple of prime-rib sliders which I kept to myself and a few glasses of wine. Everything was very good including our service.  My only complaint is when I place says they have sushi they should somehow indicate that what they really mean is rolls and they only had a few of them to boot, we would have probably gone somewhere else because we were really in the mood for sushi, but at this point to hungry to continue on in our search for food."

We stopped in for a late dinner after arriving here for the weekend. Grabbed a seat at the bar. For a Thursday, the place was hopping!

Great selection of beer and wines. In fact one of the best wine selections I have seen for a causal place. I noticed a new Orin Swift wine by the glass I had never tried. the bar tender let me have a sample even! He said it was a label that is usually reserved for wine club. Super cool to see it on the menu! 

They have some interesting menu items: kimchee fires, muscle fries, fresh oysters. The food is upscale for a place I thought would be standard bar food. 

We split the Brussel sprouts, kimchee fires and Mac and cheese.

The Brussels were crispy and wonderful! The waiter said the kimchee fries were his favorite, but he warned me the kimchee was not spicy. I thought there were very good even with mild kimchee. And the kitchen was so awesome, they split our Mac and cheese for us!

The wait staff was so attentive and fabulous. We just loved the place!!!"

They have a menu that has the most random things on it &#34;to appeal to everyone&#34; says one of the bartenders. We tried the mussels with fries and garlic aioli on top... because we like fries and mussels so why wouldn&#39;t they be good together? And they were good! The mussels were big and tasted fresh, and the sauce was very well seasoned. The fries still retained their crispness and didn&#39;t get soggy. 

Tip: ask for extra aioli on the side for your fries. Because, yum. 

As for drinks, they have a fairly wide selection of Colorado beers. I especially like the Floozy and Rob&#39;s blonde. 

We also came back one morning for a bloody Mary  (it was just too convenient). My friends really liked it but I&#39;m a bit of a bloody Mary aficionado... it was okay. A bit too tomato juicy for my taste. Juice being the key word there. I need more substance in my bloodies. 

Anyway, good place to stop by if you&#39;re in the area, but don&#39;t go out of your way to visit. Also gets really crowded as it&#39;s right next to the convention center."

I thought that was very sweet. My friend was so impressed and decided to take us back here to use the gift card. 

My friend called and booked for happy hour for Saturday afternoon, Saturday morning Stout Street got in touch and let her know that they made a mistake and Happy Hour is only Mon - Fri. So we went anyway and had some drinks and apps. 

My hubby and I arrived first, and it was my fault for not hearing the girl when she asked if we wanted a booth or high table, but I replied with &#34;if we sit outside can we move in after if our friends don&#39;t want to sit out there?&#34; I didn&#39;t really get an answer, she just took us outside and sat us right in the sun - didn&#39;t ask if we wanted to sit at the vacant table under the umbrella or anything. After about 15 minutes of roasting my hubby went in and asked if we could move into the shade, so she came and helped move us over, didn&#39;t seem very happy about it.

The guy who was serving us was really friendly. Bought us beer samples when we having trouble deciding. My hubby ordered one of the two beers that he sampled and was given the wrong one. I told him to send it back but he drank most of it then just ordered something different after. I had a few different cocktails, they were all really nice. The Sakitini was the best I think. The apps were kimchi fries and calamari. They were really tasty, you don&#39;t get much calamari for $12 and the kimchi could use a little more spice but other than that they were really good. 

With so many places to go &amp; try in Denver, it won&#39;t be my first place to go but if someone else invites us along then I won&#39;t say no either."

We all agreed that this was good. If you like Kim Chi and you like fries, you would definitely like this item.

*Left Hand Black Jack Porter*
I&#39;m a fan of Left Hand Brewery and porters, so this was right up my alley.

*Grilled Salmon Salad*
The main ingredients where kale, quinoa, salmon, and apple. It was a pretty interesting and different salad, but there was a bit too much kale for my taste.

*Clam Chowder*
It was a surprisingly good bowl of clam chowder! I usually only expect it to be good in New England or up in the Pacific Northwest.

The appetizers were all awesome as was the service. 

This tavern has a wide selection of tapped craft beers so everyone should be able to find there favorite type of beer if not the label. I settled for a porter and the followed that with my favorite bourbon, Bulleit. 

I really liked the table arrangements too. There was plenty of space between tables so you don&#39;t feel like your joining the party next to you. They also have many tv screens so you can catch a game during breaks in conversation.

Okay now the food and drinks:
Coconut French toast: GET IT. Sweet deep fried crunchy goodness (that didn&#39;t taste too much like oil). Cinnamon cream cheese and maple syrup on the side. Definitely a great vacation treat!!!

Ceviche: chef&#39;s selection of seafood each day. Small portion (maybe an 10oz cup) that was mostly onions, jalapeno, pineapple and liquid. I had to dig for the fish. Flavor was tart with some tequila, balanced by the sweet of the fruit. Came with 3 large puffy wonton/tortilla chips (yum) then a whole plate of regular tortilla chips. Probably could&#39;ve done without the regular ones cuz the puffy ones were way better and all I needed for the amount of fish. 

Bloody Mary with oyster: decent bloody. Old bay seasoning and an oyster on top. Used to much more out of the box Bloodies but this wasn&#39;t bad.

Ruby Mule: do not order it. I left the full drink on the table. Yuck!"

However the Tuna Tower is pretty dang good. I had the Salmon salad that was also simple yet great.  

This place has a neat atmosphere, but they should probably leave the garage door for the patio closed on hot days, or even just open at night, as this made the rest of the restaurant extremely hot. 

Overall, not a bad option, especially for visitors in town near the convention center."

It wasn&#39;t too busy, there were plenty of TVs, and we were seated right away. We requested a spot with a great view of the football game, however, she sat us next to the basketball game. So, we had to move ourselves and eventually our server did change the channel to the football game after multiple requests. Other than the game, our service was great. She checked on us often and it didn&#39;t take long to get our food and drinks.

For appetizers, we had the kimchi fries and deviled eggs. We really didn&#39;t find the fries to be that exciting. The deviled eggs though were so good. If you like deviled eggs, these are a must. The amount of truffle on them is perfect. For my entree, I had the green chile mac &amp; cheese and that was so creamy and the green chile adds a nice flavor to it. I was worried that the green chile would be spicy, but it is not spicy at all. It is served in a pretty big bowl/plate but it was so good I ate it all! For drinks, I got the blueberry collins which is OK. I really couldn&#39;t taste the alcohol, so for my next drink, I had the Breckenridge basil which I enjoyed more. 

Others in the party had the brussel sprouts (really good as well), the bison burger (only OK, but the bacon on it was amazing), the fish tacos (a bit spicier than expected), the clam chowder (amazing), and the chocolate cake (rich and delicious). 

If you&#39;re looking for a spot to watch some games with tasty food, I&#39;d recommend Stout Street Social. It looks like they have some good happy hour specials as well."

I went with a group of eight ladies on a Saturday night prior to a show at the Bellco.  Luckily,  we had reservations,  and we were seated quickly.  Our waiter,  although nice,  seemed to be either overwhelmed or indifferent to us.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food,  especially the roasted Brussel Sprouts and sushi.  The problem came with the drinks.  Three of us were immediately served red wine,  the two who ordered white wine were not served for approximately 15 minutes,  and those who ordered beer... Oh my!! Exactly how long does it take to pour a beer?  One of my friends waited through the ENTIRE dinner to be served!!  That included multiple friendly reminders to the wait staff from us,  which led to one bus boy rolling his eyes at us.  Not OK.  As far as food and atmosphere,  I would recommend this restaurant.   However,  the terrible bar service negates said recommendation.  I would like to think this was a isolated incidence,  but when I read other reviews I noticed multiple bad reviews regarding the service."

We decided to try the special: shaved roast beef tacos ( one of us liked, one of us didn&#39;t), green chile Mac and the Cuban. While we waited, we tried the chicken nachos, which were recommended here in the reviews. 

A few notes- our service was SLOW. It took a long time to get drinks, despite being able to see the bar, and it not being that busy. Our food came out really slow too. Not sure what that&#39;s about, since a lot of the reviews here say that service is so fast. The nachos were probably the best of our dishes. Tacos were full of filler (fries) and that was really disappointing. Atmosphere here is good, and our waitress was very friendly. Just disappointing that food wasn&#39;t better."

Stout Street was off the hook. We started with two delicious bloody marys topped with fresh shucked oysters, they were spicy and delightful. I then had one of the best scrambles in my life. What was so special you ask? Fresh ingredients! Spinach, asparagus, cheddar cheese, cherry tomatoes, crispy potatoes, and hollandaise sauce (and I typically abhor hollandaise sauce but this was velvety cream dream). My bf got the green chili biscuits that had chorizo gravy, it was good but no comparison to my scramble. 

Nice atmosphere, great patio and right across from the convention center. 

If I lived in Denver this would be my go to brunch spot. It was awesome"

We love sitting directly at the bar because it usually means faster service, but we sat at an awkward place of the bar where we couldn&#39;t be served by the bartender as drinks would have to be served over their seafood bar -- weird, just weird + we felt in the way and bumped into -- and it still took forever to get served -- so as soon as available, we took regular seats at the bar -- we of course got served immediately, just about in all ways.

KUDOS to the manager (3/16/16, 6:30pm) as he noticed that we were visibly disturbed and asked how we were doing; we kindly and gladly shared our situation and he apologized. 

I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos -- just ok, fish was a little dry, and they only offered flour tortillas, whereas 100% of every other place I&#39;ve been also offers corn tortillas (healther, better!) and I had the seasonal veggies, which were all root veggies -- again, just ok and were actually way too salty.

I truly enjoyed the Hump Day Happy Hour special of the $1 oysters and 2-for-1 beers... just hope this restaurant doesn&#39;t decay to a Colorado Convention Center customer-only way of serving customers; this place could really be a gem for Denver.... great decor, setting, seating areas -- all awesome -- just speed up the service + change the weird bar seating at the seafood bar."

Really enjoyed their version of New England clam chowder (as a Massachusetts native, this dish is important to me) and found it to be much more authentic than many other imitators out of my home state. Gained extra points for having Lagunitas, one of my favorite brews, on tap. Can&#39;t recall the exact fish entree that I had, but definitely know that it was tasty and generously portioned.

I had their Cuban sandwhich and The Angry Bird Cider. I will have both again if in the area. The Cuban was well prepared with enough meat and they simply made the meat the star. Well the cider is my favorite of the night.

The staff were really great with an occasional forgetful moment.

Coming here for lunch was so easy! We were quickly seated and the service was really attentive the whole time.

Deciding what to order was such a challenge! And not just because none of us had slept much and just gotten off a plane. The Ahi Tuna Tower looked very tempting, and I saw it being delivered to someone later on and boy, did it look yummy.

I ordered the Prime Rib Sliders (from the appetizer menu) as my entree. The meat was just melt in your mouth good. I normally hate onion rings but these (called crispy onions) were so delicate they added to the meat in such a great way. The combination of the two sauces, the au jus and the horseradish aioli, was just a flavor orgasm. I just wanted to mix them together and drink it. Both guys I was with ordered the Colorado Bison Burger and customized with cheese, one Swiss and one pepper jack I think. Both were really, really happy.

The fries that came with the burgers were really out of this world, and I&#39;m not much of a fan of fries. They are so well seasoned and crispy without being dry. They went so well with the horseradish aioli and au jus from my sliders as well. The meal from start to finish was the perfect thing to bring us back to life after the flight and get us ready for the day.

Everyone we interacted with at the restaurant had a smile on his or her face and seemed genuinely interested in making our dining experience great. I have no idea when I may be back in Denver but if I am, I&#39;ll make a point to come back here, not just for the service but for the tons of things on the menu I still want to try!!!"

I enjoyed the brusel sprouts - so amazing - and a glass of wine or 2 waiting...
When we started to enjoy our meal we went for a schmorgasborg - loaded wings, a sushi roll and a bowl of mussels...

The mussels - would not do it again...  sushi roll was tasty - but i think other things are better here and the sushi should be enjoyed at other places, and the wings were tasty!

Definitely a varied menu,tons of seating, and if i go again i&#39;ll enjoy the bar area instead.

Japanese, Thai, American, Latin...whatever your stomach craves for, you&#39;ll find it here (actually, many other restaurants in Downtown Denver serve fusion food too!). 

My table ordered a few appetizers to share: Fresh Shucked Oysters were very good - I did not have a bite, but my coworker seemed to enjoy them (MK price but they had a shipment from Canada for $2 each, it is typically $3-$4.50 each). Ahi Tuna Tower - $13.95 - had some good flavors. The spicy crab gave the dish a little kick, whereas the tuna was tender and gave a balance from the spicy crab. I personally liked the crispy rice because it gave some textures, but they put a bit too much on the plate. Lastly, the one appetizer I highly recommend is the Crispy Brussels - $7.95. It was such an interesting concept to see rice krispy cereal added, but I didn&#39;t taste it all too much. It had a great flavor! 

For my entree, I ordered the Braised Beef Short Rib - $18.95. Boy was it amazing! The short rib was very flavorful and tender. Below the short rib is a mix of mashed sweet potato and cubed sweet potato. I enjoyed the mashed sweet potato, but some of the cubed potatoes were a bit raw still. 

Overall, the staff was friendly, the ambience was on par, and the prices were great. I would recommend this place to a friend."

Kudoos to everyone who posted reviews so I could choose a good place to eat that was close to both the Denver Art Museum, where we spent the afternoon, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, where we went in the evening for a show at the Buell Theater. I wanted the whole day to feel special, as I don&#39;t often go to Denver anymore, especially with my daughter. It wasn&#39;t a special day for either of us, I mean it wasn&#39;t anyone&#39;s birthday or something like that, but I don&#39;t often go out with her, so when I do, I like to make it interesting for the both of us. Luckily, the weather was lovely, and we managed to get everywhere we wanted by walking. Big cities have a lot to offer, ye&#39;know.

I wasn&#39;t 100% sure we would get in to Stout St. Social without a reservation, but we did. We sat at the bar, where we both met lovely people working here, and sharing the bar with us. It&#39;s a fun place, but it&#39;s big and it was very busy. Despite all that, we got all our drinks and food items quickly. 

I ordered a wonderful, special, dark, rich beer for myself (I so love flavorable beers), but I can&#39;t for the life of me recall the name (ugh, I really hate that), and my daughter ordered sake. For my entree, I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and my daughter had the Ahi Tuna Tower. Both were fantastic, and huge! We barely managed to finish them. For the prices, you get a LOT of food.

You only have limited choices on the rolls and we got the spicy tuna roll. We also ordered the kimchi fries because seems like other yelpers have liked this.

We sat at the bar last night and had some hh drinks and food while watching the sushi crank out &amp; the drinks fly. There is 2$ off sushi during happy hour and people were ordering enough to keep two guys super busy! 

They have a huge selection of beers on tap. Some are more costly than others, we were told there is currently a $15 sour beer available. When hh drinks are three or four bucks that is what we went with instead. That includes Manhattans and Martinis!

The joint is family friendly and has a large bar/high top table area. We even sat outside on one evening when the weather was nice. There are a lot of large flat screens in the bar area as well.

We had an issue with our server spazing out on us at the end yesterday, but a manager looking fellow hooked us up with some complimentary tequila shots so that was cool. Not sure what happened, but she went from friendly to missing and rude. She likely had some external issue unrelated cuz we are supercool. All other experiences had decent service so hopefully this was an isolated incident.

At that last minute I had to switch open table reservations and try this place (a fire at a nearby pizza place).  

In a previous review about a different restaurant I complained about where when an order had to be returned/remade, the other restaurant failed in follow up  (no manager to apologize, no check to see if the second try was right, no offer to buy something -- no nothing).  

At Stout Street Social, I also had to return a sandwich.  My customized cuban sandwich was incorrect.  In fairly quick turn around, the manager delivered my corrected sandwich, said it was on him and later checked to be sure all was OK.   That is the way service should be.  

Thank you Stout Street Social.  The food was fine, they have a good beer list...  Even Chimay on tap (though I didn&#39;t have any).  The staff could be a bit better educated on the beers, but that is minor.  My family and I enjoyed our lunch and when we need a lunch near the convention center we will consider it again."

Everything else was 1-2 star. I went for happy hour and at the beginning, the service was fine. As soon as the joint became moderately busy, everything went to hell. My server was no where to be found and I continually had to find other servers to get my orders in before HH was over. 

They had a Gluten Free menu which was very promising for the sake of my wife. However, you failed miserably. They stated a tempura sushi roll was gluten free. They said we had to just omit the crunchy stuff on top. It came out with the crunchy stuff. Sent back. They then came out with another roll brought by the manager who then said the roll was not gluten free at all. What a pain in the ass. He said the GF menu was &#34;not up to date.&#34; What the heck does that mean anyway?

He ended up comping us a roll and the tab was still really high since a lot of the orders that I thought were put in before HH did not happen as such. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there. Its a real shame because the food is delicious, but I would be incredibly hesitant before coming back.

Lastly, the way they have the outdoor patio set up is with a counter with chairs that don&#39;t even fit. That was the first strike since you cannot put 3 next to each other; it is too tight by like 1 inch. That is just a dumb mistake."

When you walk in, there is a small raw bar so I thought I&#39;d try some oysters. Hump day specials was $1 per so I got 1/2 dozen and I admit I was a bit disappointed. Although the flavor of the oysters were good, they were pretty small and shucked poorly - oysters were torn up and I got several bit of broken shells.

Having said that, the rest of our experience redeemed the oysters. Great beer and craft cocktail selection and the Brussels sprouts were reason enough to come back. The menu seems a bit all over the place but again , it&#39;s interesting and keeps you curious."

We were greeted by the happiest host I&#39;ve ever met. He gave as a tour of the raw bar and told us about the menu. 

A few of us in the group ordered dirty martini&#39;s, we asked the waiter if they had blue cheese stuffed olives and unfortunately they didn&#39;t. However when the drinks came the waiter appeared with a cup of blue cheese stuffed olives. He had run back to the kitchen and made some for us. seriously so nice!  

For food we started with spinach and artichoke dip and crispy brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were really good and my favorite of the two. For dinner four out of five of us got sushi which was really well done. And the other person got the wedge salad with chicken which looked great as well. 

As we were leaving I overheard the host saying how happy he was to see guests leaving happy. 

Stout St. Social is right by the convention center so a great stop if you are staying nearby and in town for a conference."

I sampled a bunch of different foods and they were either average or under whelming. The wings were average, the skins on them were crispy which was actually really nice, the fried brussels sprouts were average, the artichoke dip was average, their mac &amp; cheese was not very good, and the nachos were average. For my entrée I had sushi which, again, was average. Overall my experience fell short of my expectations and I would not go back to this restaurant again, definitely not a repeat."

First time to Stout after searching for restaurants nearest the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and so happy to find this spot (open since December)! How many times have I cut short a fancy dinner at Teatro, Kevin Taylor, Oceanair due to tight theater timing? 

Stout Street Social fills that in-between spot in that it is casual, yet refined...you can expedite your meal and still enjoy quality food prior to the theater here. 

We enjoyed the happy hour nachos, tuna roll, salmon with mango roll, prime rib sliders (WOW, btw...WOW!), Olive Oil Cake. 

Our server, Ian, delivered competent, professional service and told us all about the other great dining opportunities at Rialto, Hotel Boulderado...I cannot wait to see what they offer at those spots.  

HOWEVER...after returning after the show for a nightcap...

We love the $1 oysters from 6p to close (which seems to be at about 10p) but CONFIRM that the ones that you order are, indeed, the &#39;$1&#39; oysters. We had a surprise when the second server (yes, we came in twice in one night!!) presented us with a bill for $42/dozen. Ouch. When asked, we thought she sort of glossed over the price as none of us (three adults) caught the bit about us NOT ordering the $1 oysters. 

Our second server...I may not be back after that experience. If not for the experience with Ian earlier in the eve, I&#39;d give this spot 2 stars. However, our experience earlier in the eve seemed more representative of what we think this restaurant strives to offer, so did not penalize them with a &#39;meh&#39; review. However, lose your late night server. She did not do you any favors.

This is crowd-pleasing food. Nothing exotic, but each item is dialed in: items range from sushi to nachos to Italian-inspired country desserts."

Despite the oyster bar, its mostly salads and burgers with a few fish options. The food was fine, but not particularly memorable. 

The bar area has been packed every time I&#39;ve been with big groups. So plenty of space if your looking to reserve happy hour tables for a lot of people. The downside to that is that you almost struggle to get to tables on the other side of the bar area."

As was the food. We had (over the course of several days, mind you) mussels and fries, chicken nachos, a bison burger, kimchi, sushi, and oysters. So. Many. Oysters. The first few days we were there, whoever was shucking was incredible. They were some of the cleanest, perfectly shucked oysters I&#39;ve had. Delicious and fresh. The last night, the guy wasn&#39;t quite as good, but they were still tasty. 

And of course, the drinks. Good selection on tap, and the cocktails were crazy strong and yummy. Our bartenders made great recommendations based on what we liked, and they were pretty spot on.

I tried the biscuits and gravy which also included bacon, egg, and pork green chile. I really enjoyed that. I also tried the cinnamon roll pancake which was too sweet, the chilaquiles which were good according to others but I&#39;m not big on chilaquiles, and the short rib burrito which was good and there were hash browns in there.

Came here in July 2015. Huge place. I enjoy the decor. 

I had made a reservation for my younger brother&#39;s birthday. He likes whiskey, beer and trying new things, so I thought this place was a good choice. 

The hostesses looked confused when I said I had a reservation. We had a party of 5. 3 walk-in parties got sat before us, none of them outside. Then she asked if we wanted to sit outside. It was pretty hot so my brother said, &#34;No thanks.&#34; Then we waiting another 10 to get our table right by the server station. It was like we were being punished for having a reservation. There were plenty of other tables open. We were carrying presents so they should understand it was a special celebration. The situation didn&#39;t sit right with me. 

Maybe we came in the day before their new deliveries. Everything was out. The first two beers I ordered were out. The first beer my brother ordered was out. The special the server told us was great... they were out. A little disappointing. 

That being said, the oysters we had were the perfect temperature and delicious! I also have the ahi tuna tower appetizer as my entree and it was really good. Everyone else at the table liked their food, but not as much as I did. If I was rating just the AVAILABLE food, I would give this place 4 stars, but the customer service and lack of availability just gave me a bad taste in my mouth. 

I want to try this place again. I want to have that amazing Ahi tuna tower again. I just don&#39;t like how we were treated for our special occasion. I might go back and give this place another try, just not for a celebration."

My friend grabbed us a seat on the patio. Word to the wise, it can get a bit glaring if you don&#39;t have one of those nice big umbrellas like at some of the tables. We were excited to try this place, as they had great specials.

Both of my friends had martinis which they liked, and the beer selection was pretty good. In terms of food, we had the deviled eggs, crispy Brussels sprouts, spicy tuna roll, and kimchi fries. The spicy tuna roll had nice chunks of fresh tuna and was very flavorful. The kimchi fries were probably the table favorite. I could have used maybe a sprinkling of scallions and cilantro instead of the one long piece of cilantro, but the flavors were strong regardless. The deviled eggs were sort of disappointing. It seemed like they squirted truffle oil on top at the end which gave it all of that metallic grossness people dislike. I think it would have tasted better if the truffle oil had been mixed into the yolks. The crispy Brussels sprouts had good crispness, rich umami flavor, and spice. They were however drowning in the sweet chili sauce which was really overpowered the truffle oil and made everything gloopy and soggy. I think a bit less sauce would have really made the dish sing and helped to preserve a crisp texture.

They were very &#34;creamy.&#34;  Wife enjoyed them more than I did.  I ordered medium-rare prime rib and wife ordered the short ribs.  Timing of service was lousy.  We had just gotten our oysters when the entrees arrived.  Not the end of the world. But then... While the rib dish was well done, the prime rib looked like it had been sitting out for a while.  And when I cut into it, it was cold - like it had been out for a while.  Rebecca did not come around for a while so I flagged down another server whose name I did not get and who quickly addressed the issue by taking the cold dish and replacing it.  I ordered the salmon.

The menu was across the board with no rhyme or reason. Are they Japanese, a gastropub, a sports bar? I guess I didn&#39;t quite understand inclusion of sushi rolls amidst deviled eggs, kimchi fries, and burgers. They strike me as a chain eatery but with a few random sushi rolls thrown in for good measure (or to set themselves apart). 

I had the grilled salmon salad which for $16 was diminutive in size and stature. If you decide to give me what my guess would be a 3 or 4 oz piece of salmon, make the other ingredients more substantial. Flavor was fine, but I left still hungry and for $16 at lunch, that shouldn&#39;t be the case.

It also took us the entire meal to get the requested ketchup that my coworker asked to accompany her fries. The ketchup came with the bill after we were done. It was far from busy so there is no excuse.

It came with crispy won ton chips and were made up of a blend of tuna and crab. Coming from Hawaii and California, I&#39;ve definitely had better towers but this was a unique blend and still tasted good. The fish tasted fresh.

I tried it once for a family reunion we were having in a near by park. It was so good we have been going back for over a year now. They have never disappointed me! Their homemade sauces are to die for! 

They are truly nice people and you can tell they take pride in their business. 

They do take credit now and that is good as before they were cash only.

You have to try their sides!! Everyone of them are a 10!! 

I would rate this a 9 out of 10 BBQ joint!"

Most of  the sauces were good, there others were OK. The beans and coleslaw were excellent. The meat was a tad dry but not enough to worry about. 

I knocked a star off because I didn&#39;t think the prices are in line with the value of the meal, the menu wasn&#39;t clear about pricing, and when I ordered the same meal a 2nd time they tried to charge me a higher price. They did adjust it when I mentioned it, and that speaks to the lack of clarity on the menu. 

If I&#39;m in the area and have a BBQ craving, I will stop in, but I won&#39;t be making any special trip to the area since there are better options in Denver"

Last visit we sampled the baby back ribs which were so delicious and full of meat, as well as the hot link and it was equally as delicious as the ribs. I recommend the Mac and cheese and potato salad for sides. The Mac and cheese is traditional in a nice cheese sauce. The potato salad was not your traditional mustard potato salad, it almost tasted like a baked potato with sour cream. I loved it.

For sides we chose macaroni and cheese, baked beans and green beans. And both of us had the buttermilk pie for dessert. The meat was smoked to perfection and the sides were delicious! Not to mention the buttermilk pie which I had never tried before. I think the best thing about this place was their choices of sauces. Memphis, Carolina, Georgia, Sweet and Hot. My personal favorites were the Memphis and the Georgia.

Price is very reasonable for the portion sizes, o have a full meal of leftovers. 

The potato salad is to die for, it&#39;s full of dill which I love. Another great thing is none of the meat dishes are cooked in BBQ sauce that has gluten! It&#39;s so annoying to go to a BBQ restaurant and not be able to eat half of the food because it is soaked in a sauce that has gluten.

I ordered two meat combo, ribs &amp; burnt ends. The order was taken, I received ribs and pork meat. I was there before noon and the burnt ends don&#39;t come up till later in the afternoon but this was not communicated to me. I did over hear her tell the guest that walked in after me the burnt ends not ready till later in the day. 
I didn&#39;t like the flavor/taste of the ribs or the pork meat on my plate. Very bland, they do have 5 or 6 different kind of sauce on all tables but the meat on its own is bland. The sides were baked beans and slaw. The slaw was average, nothing fantastic and I thought the beans were below average.

I stocked up on all their sauces to give them all a shot and some of them were quite exciting. Again, not an expert so I really don&#39;t know the difference between city styles.

Now the reason I love this place so much. The sandwich was pretty good and it went really well with the sauces I liked. The potato salad was AWESOME. Mac n cheese was good. But what is buttermilk pie and why is it so good? That was a very pleasant surprise.

Variety of BBQ sauces which were good, but you shouldn&#39;t need sauce to make the meat palatable. Tasted like restaurant depot meat, smoked with an indoor electric smoker.

Like I said, maybe it was an off day, or their meat all got delivered without any fat, but I ended up giving away everything to the hungry people downtown, and ordering delivery from somewhere else instead."

For those of you that know, the best BBQ is usually found in these type of places; not the prettiest to look on the outside, but great food on the inside.

We had hot links, pulled pork and brisket with mac n cheese, potato salad(probably the best i&#39;ve ever tasted), cole slaw and baked beans.  The meat was all very flavorful and the sides were all delicious.  The fact that they have a great selection of different style of sauce is really what sets this place above the rest.  Too many BBQ places insist on only one type of tomato based sauce but the true BBQ joints know that you need at least three.  In this case, Ragin&#39; Hog offers up six!  The only knock was that the brisket was a bit overcooked and that kept me from giving the fifth star.

We almost went to the eatery right across the street just because it looked so much nicer from the outside; however, that would have been a huge mistake. 

Upon walking in we were greeted by the most heavenly smokey aroma one could imagine. The smell brings a smile to your face, life to your taste buds, and the satisfaction of knowing you are about to experience some true smoked BBQ. Upon ordering, I went with a two meat plate choosing their chopped pork and their special of the day, burnt ends. The combo also came with the choice of two sides, a dessert and a drink all for $16.00. It was an incredible deal. For my sides I went with mac-n-cheese and corn bread. For my dessert I chose their buttermilk pie. 

The food in just about every way met or exceeded the high expectations that came along with the smell we had experienced walking in. The chopped pork was cooked to perfection, juicily and down right tasty. They offer 5 different home made BBQ sauces and their Carolina sauce complemented  the chopped pork like a horse complements a cowboy. It was a pairing made in heaven. The burnt ends where very, very good; however, I did feel they were over shadowed by the chopped pork. Furthermore, I was able to give their baked beans a try in additional to the two sides I had chosen and they were sweat and cooked to perfection. As was the mac-n-cheese. The cornbread was a little dry for my liking, but that didn&#39;t matter ... the rest of the food was so good I barely even noticed the cornbread was even there. For me the baked bean and mac-n-cheese as the two sides I will choose if I ever get the honor of eating at Ragin&#39; Hog BBQ again. 

I ended my meal with their buttermilk pie. I have never heard of buttermilk pie so I wanted to give it a try. Man, what a way to end a meal. It was absolutely delicious! The BBQ at Ragin&#39; Hog was some of the best I have had. The service and southern hospitality was amazing. The price point and value took them to a whole other level.

It was excellent.  It&#39;s not a fancy place; it&#39;s a Mom and Pop in the best sense of the expression.  The &#34;Mom&#34; is listed on their business card as the pitmaster.  When I asked, she told me that she is from Arkansas and is doing Memphis-style barbeque.  They pride themselves on not reheating anything -- everything is fresh out of the smoker, and it shows in the quality.  The ribs were tender and flavorful, not steamtable-ish.  They also pride themselves on sides made from scratch.  I loved the slaw and baked beans.  My husband liked the mac &amp; cheese.

The prices are reasonable.  They only take cash in an effort to keep prices as low as possible.  For instance, a half rack of ribs, 2 small sides, a drink, dessert and tax is $15.

They have a wide variety of homemade sauces.  She (I think her name is Colleen) recommended a combination of the Memphis and the sweet on the ribs.  I thought it was great.

Small, family-run dive with a 100% homemade menu.  Solid BBQ and sides.  World Class sauces.  Buttermilk pie is to die for.  Fantastic service.  Fast takeout and a comfortable little dining room.  Bathroom is literally spotless.  I&#39;ve been 5-6 times and the food and service are extremely consistent.  5 Stars any questions?

ps.  They concentrate on the pig here.  If you want brisket why would you come to a place with &#34;Hog&#34; in the name?

---------LONG STORY
Very good pulled pork, amazing beans, and world class sauces.  I grew up in the deep South (GA and TN) and spent lots of time in Arkansas (where the owners originally hail from), and this place is spot on......not perfect, but top notch for Colorado.  These little joints are a dime a dozen in Arkansas and Tennessee, but I give the Ragin&#39; Hog an HONEST 5 STAR rating since it sits up against the Rocky Mountains.  

As others have said, there is a small degree of blandness to the food but a little S+P and BBQ sauce takes care of that and then some.  The sauces are WORLD CLASS.  They have big, fat bottles on each table.  There are 5-6 to choose from and they&#39;re all distinctive from one another.  Their &#34;Georgia&#34; mustard sauce is my favorite.  The Carolina is almost like a sweet N sour and it&#39;s incredible.  The Memphis is whatever.......all the sauces kick major butt.  

The only meats I&#39;ve had were the burnt ends and pulled pork.  The BE&#39;s are awesome.  It&#39;s hard to screw up crisp pork fat.  Burnt ends can be tough to find, but they gotta em here!!!  

The pulled pork is slightly bland but is kissed with just enough oak + hickory that the sauces make it all good.  I&#39;ve heard the complaints about the pork not being &#34;smoky&#34; enough.  I get sick of places that over smoke the heck out of their meats.  If anything the pulled pork at the Ragin Hog is just a hair under-smoked, but it&#39;s juicy and very tender.  A little fatty too sometimes, but they give the pork a nice chop on request and the fat just melts in with the sauce.........Awwww yeah!!!! 

Beans - 5 Stars, some of the best I&#39;ve ever had
Potato Salad - 4.5 Stars, Mad-good with lots of S+P
Slaw - 4 Stars, a little runny but very good
Cornbread - 3 Stars, &#34;meh&#34; but good enough
Mac N Cheese - 1.5 Stars, disappointing

And then the Buttermilk Pie.  5++++++++++ Stars.  It&#39;s homemade and top notch.  If you like crème brulee, you&#39;ll melt when you sample this.  They bring it out warm right as you&#39;re finishing your BBQ meal.  Amazing.  

Service is always fantastic.  It seems to be all the family kicking in (Mom, Dad, and a very polite, teenaged son).  Sometimes these little joints only have cans of soda, but they have all the favorites on the fountain machine, so bonus there.  Free refills and someone checks on you every 5-6 mins - very good.  They seem to do a good takeout business and are thusly well prepared for it.  When call ahead folks show up, they never have to wait longer than a minute or two. 

You like good pork BBQ?  Hallelujah, you&#39;re home."

Ragin&#39; Hog was right up there. They didn&#39;t have brisket (they mentioned having it on Saturdays, so I&#39;ll be back to try some) but the pork ribs and pulled pork are some of the very best I&#39;ve ever had. Anywhere. 

I&#39;m not a sauce user, so I can&#39;t tell you how their sauces compare, but the three I tried were very good.

I got cole slaw for a side, and it reminds me of my grandmother&#39;s. Could use a tiny bit of black pepper, but that&#39;s just me.

You can tell they slow smoke their meat. They do it the hard way, and it shows.

The sausage was good. I&#39;m used to the coarse grind that central Texas sausages have, and the links here are a fine grind, but perfectly spiced. They pack a great punch.

All in all, I&#39;ll be back very often. It&#39;s really wonderful to have found good BBQ. Not good BBQ. Great BBQ. Really, you should try them today."

First off, the atmosphere: it&#39;s a craphole. Pretty depressing even by hole-in-the-wall standards.

I got a two-meat meal with brisket and &#34;hot&#34; links, BBQ beans, potato salad, and buttermilk pie. At ~$17 this was quite spendy, so I expected everything to be awesome.

* Brisket: Bland and dry. Even Dickey&#39;s is better.
* Hot links: No hint of heat whatsoever. Again, worse than Dickey&#39;s.
* BBQ beans: Pretty good.
* Potato salad: Probably the best potato salad I&#39;ve ever had. Yay!
* Buttermilk pie: AWESOME.

If I hadn&#39;t ended the meal on the high note of the buttermilk pie, I would&#39;ve felt totally ripped off. Nonetheless, it&#39;s quite sad that the only two items that stood out were a side and a dessert, rather than the meat."

Someone in the office mentions BBQ and a few seconds later Bite Squad sends me a coupon for free delivery from Ragin Hog. It was fate. While I had leftovers from the day before and even brought an additional lunch, it&#39;s probably been at least a year since I&#39;ve sank my teeth into tender, smokey ribs. I&#39;m sure most would agree it&#39;s hard to find good BBQ in Denver especially ribs, but after reading the Yelp reviews and feeling a bit sponteous, I decided a salad wasn&#39;t going to suffice. They do deliver, but only in their hood. Thank God for Bite Squad and their free delivery coupon! While delivery time was estimated to be two hours it showed up in 1 hour. Pretty amazing! The ribs were perfect. Smokey, tender and juicy. The only cons were the sides. I believe I&#39;m an expert at mac n cheese so I  might be a tough critic. I liked that they added red pepper, gave it a little punch, but the cheese sauce was watery. It may have also been due to condensation from the warms ribs. The potato salad was very tasty but had very few potatoes. I have a feeling maybe I got the bottom of the bowl. So I would give the ribs 5 starts and sides 3 1/2. All things considered lunch today exceeded my expectations and I got to stay inside, warm and cozy!"

Ragin&#39; Hog is a mom and pop hole in the wall restaurant with good potential. The location is not in the most attractive of locations and the inside is quite simple with four tables accommodating 4 people each. I ordered the hog pile (chicken + 2 sides) and overall it was good.  The food is not presented in any fancy way. The chicken was tender served as small chunks, however, I was expecting more of a smoked smell or flavor.  Fortunately, the selection of BBQ sauces helped add flavor. The Memphis sauce is by far my favorite in combo with the sweet sauce. They have other sauces, which will have to wait another day. The two sides chosen were Mac &amp; cheese and the slaw! I am a huge fan of both sides and normally I always forgo slaw thinking it&#39;s a waste of money, but not the slaw at Ragin Hog - I wish I knew the precise ingredients.
The next time I come in I&#39;ll have to try the ribs and pork.  I personally would forgo the chicken next time, but if you&#39;re on a health binge then chicken is your healthier meat option available."

A-OK

+ The ribs are top of the line. Cooked perfectly. Moist and tender. Bursting with flavor. A pig that gave its all. Highly recommended.

You need to go early as they often sell out. And, when they do, they close for the day.

- No Wi-Fi.
- Cash only!
- No beer.
- No website.
- Atmosphere is stark and uninviting.

Customers obviously love the food (see the myriad 5 star reviews), but the owners need to deal with with their success and step up their game."

The Food, I eat all over and love BBQ! This place is true to what BBQ is supposed to be. The smoke ring, the flavor, homemade sauces all full of flavor. the ribs were cooked perfectly, the chopped chicken was moist and jucy. the links were spicy and just amazing. the sides were all perfect, flaverfull and fresh! 

Desert was spot on buttermilk pie my first try at this delightful sweet desert.

Had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw &amp; mac &#39;n cheese with buttermilk pie. My dad had the ribs, coleslaw &amp; baked beans. Coleslaw was great very cold and crunchy.

First off, they have about 5 homemade sauces to choose from, HOT, Georgia, Memphis, Sweet and Carolina. I got some of each as my order was to go. They are all really good, my favorite was HOT.

Both the pulled pork and ribs were moist and flavorful, the sides were pretty good my only complaint is that the portion was a small.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the small business atmosphere and family run vibe. They have Square so they take credit cards and cash.

Give them a try, especially for lunch. Mmmm that buttermilk pie is so yummy and is included with the sandwich meal, how can you go wrong."

I ordered the chicken, which was the best part of my meal because it was actually moist and tender. Also ordered the collard greens, cornbread, and Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was okay and the cornbread was decent, but tasted like it had been hanging out in the refrigerator. Everything seemed like it lacked seasoning.

I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was cooked right and you got to place one of the various sauces on it.. All of them were very tasty and not overbearing.

Smoked pork, hot links, baked beans and a variety of sauces is a winning combination.  Everything was delicious and smoked well!

A few quick stand outs.

~ They serve the meats dry.  Meaning you&#39;re an adult and can add how much sauce you want.  
~ The baked beans + a little BBQ sauce = a flavor explosion.
~ The Carolina sauce was outstanding.  A hint of spice but all flavor.
~ Cash only.  Hit the ATM on the way over.
~ Limited hours, make sure you check before you head over.

If you even half like BBQ this place is worth checking out.  The smell from the parking lot will guide you to the Hog, and the rest of the smoked goodness."

If there are only a few negative reviews I generally expect the people writing them to be haters or the kind of person that thrive on contradiction but that&#39;s not always the case. It depends on their argument. If a person qualifies their negative remarks by stating where they&#39;ve lived or been as their argument about what makes them an expert, I tend to be judgmental about the person writing the review. That&#39;s fine if you know what the hell you&#39;re talking about. Do you think that everybody that lives somewhere has an exceptional palate or knows all there is to know about a cuisine? Okay end rant.  For now.
I thought the ribs were pretty good. Decent rub with enough hickory smoke coming through. Not falling off the bone overcooked which a lot people think (in error) is a good thing. Smoke ring? A smoke ring is no longer an acceptable criteria for judging competition BBQ because you can falsify a smoke ring with additives. The pulled pork was moist and tender with enough bark mixed in but was a little underseasoned. They aren&#39;t doing brisket because of the cost? I&#39;ve never heard of this happening but with the sparse decor and the banner sign out front, maybe they are struggling a bit? The sauces might have been the stars with all 6 varieties being pretty good. My favs were the Memphis and the Hot. I thought that the sides we had (baked beans and slaw) were okay. I&#39;d prefer a little more bite to both.
The location is in a tough spot to find but worth it. My only question is, &#34;Where&#39;s the Wonder Bread?&#34;.  :)"

The buttermilk pie makes you laugh at the reality that this comfortable eating situation is not quite over yet.

Tried the &#34;brewster  stew?&#34; as a side today. It&#39;s not on the normal menu but it had more meat in it than some other BBQ places have in their sandwiches. Loaded potato salad was very light and tasty - and I don&#39;t like potato salad. The slaw is wet but perfectly seasoned. The baked beans were excellent. I think the best part of the meal is the BBQ sauces. They have Hot, Sweet, Memphis, Carolina, Georgia. They are all custom developed and made on premise. 5 unique and wonderful flavors. I don&#39;t usually get desert but one came with the meal so I tried the Buttermilk Pie. I think I got an instant cavity it was so sweet but I must admit I liked it a lot and will get it again. 
The service is very low key and friendly. Small area for dine in and I believe 1 table outside.

It&#39;s in the building in the Safeway shopping center that is closest to Lowell and runs parallel to it. 

The lady that runs this place is really cool and makes some amazing BBQ. She told me that she gets up at 4am every day to start smoking meat. I&#39;m really glad that people decide to do this kind of thing so that I can benefit from it. Her food is delicious - across the board. I had the pulled pork, links, slaw, potato salad and all 5 types of her homemade bbq sauce: Memphis, Carolina, Georgia, Sweet and Hot. I felt like I was traveling around the country to different BBQ havens just by changing my sauce every few bites. She encouraged me to try them all with my to-go order and stuffed large containers of each in my bag. 

Customer service is 5 stars too. I didn&#39;t have cash on me at the moment and she told me I could just pay her later. It was my first time in. She doesn&#39;t know me. That&#39;s pretty darn cool. I jogged over to safeway and pulled out cash, but I really appreciated the gesture. They don&#39;t take credit cards, which I totally respect for this type of mom and pop business. 

If you like BBQ the way that it&#39;s supposed to be made, you gotta stop in. She said she&#39;s expanding hours and the menu soon as well which is great news. Just don&#39;t buy her out of something before I get there, as she says she closes when she&#39;s out of food on most days.

Thanks to Ragin&#39; Hog for coming to the Highlands. I see a long relationship in our future."

Overall, the meat was bland, but was not dry.  No smoke ring on the ribs, although they were tender. No bark on the pulled pork.  You can achieve tenderness on ribs and pork butt without a smoker- when I eat bbq I want tenderness AND smoke flavor.  I will visit one more time in hopes I was just there on a bad day.

I will also agree with Doug Y&#39;s assessment that living or visiting a certain are of the country doesn&#39;t mean you are an expert.  However, the simple fact is this: barbecue at an average place in Texas tastes better than it does here."

When I saw the menu, I texted my husband to say &#34;I hope you&#39;re hungry!&#34; Got our food to go and wanted to try a little bit of everything. The brisket was the winner in the meat department, but the ribs and pork were also very good. Love the homemade sauces -- just a heads up that the Carolina style is more specifically a Western Carolina style, with tomato and vinegar, not the Eastern Carolina style I prefer (vinegar and pepper only). 

And the sides. We gorged on mac and cheese, cole slaw and potato salad. Would be great if they&#39;d add a few healthier sides (maybe some green vegetables? Succotash? Collard greens?), but it was good southern cooking - tasty and fresh. Note they take CASH only -- no credit cards.

The pork was my favorite meat, all were delicious, ribs had great flavor but could have been more tender.  The collard greens were better than the slaw but the slaw was still really great.  I&#39;ve never had buttermilk pie before but it was great!! Good enough to where I&#39;d go swing through there just to grab dessert.  At first we were disappointed at the quantity of food but it was plenty for the both of us.  Also, the selection of sauces is really fun and they are great!

After struggling to find this place, I blustered in all frustrated and hungry.  Upon ordering, I came to realize they only accept cash-- and I only had $4.  The owner very generously decided to take what I had (a mere 1/3 of the actual price of my meal), since I had such trouble finding the place.  Talk about great customer service, this is how you build loyal happy customers.

Now to the real point of the whole ordeal, the food.  Food was excellent, I haven&#39;t had a pulled pork sandwich that good in years.  Pork is tender, juicy, with good smoky crust.  Carolina BBQ sauce was exactly what I was hoping for.  Mac n cheese did not disappoint.

It came with two side, dessert, and a drink, but the very nice owner offered to me an extra side as I was uninterested in the drinks they had available.

The cold slaw and mac and cheese were average, but the baked beans were really good.  The sandwich, however, was disappointing.  I have high standards for pulled pork after living in the Kansas City area and found the pulled pork here to be pretty flavorless.  I did like the large variety of sauces available and found the cold slaw went really well with some of the mustardy bbq sauce mixed in to cut the sweetness."

I didn&#39;t wanna be a Yelp hypocrite and only eat Shushi, but not something new! 

Fiiiiine, I said. We enter it, it&#39;s dead as a cemetery, we saw two very generous workers prepping in the early morning for an eager audience and us. Their menu and specials are translated from Spanish to English, English to Spanish. Mexican music is traveling in each direction, it reminded me of my roots. I was proud to be from Latin America. 

We took forever to finally order something: I&#39;m giving credit to the nice lady at the counter for her level of patience. We took so long, we let a man behind us order first. At first I wanted to try the Colorada:  which had scrambled eggs, chorizo, franks and melted cheese. But at the end of the day, I finally surrendered my curiosity and went with the Hawaiiana Sandwich: with Pineapple, veggies, ham, melted cheese, and chipotle sauce/or jalapeños! 

Two of those, and sweet, sweet orange juice!! It tasted just like mango, but it had fruit in it. The sandwiches were made by a very talented cook who used a grill to perform in front of us. The sandwiches took less than 15 minutes to cook. I spoke Spanish to both of the current workers there. I felt blessed. 

They cut the sandwiches in half for two. They are giant! It took me the whole day to finish the Hawaiiana! I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t try out this place sooner."

I was greeted immediately by the very friendly and helpful cashier.  She walked me through the menu and helped me pick out a pork free torta.

My sandwich was grilled immediately and I took it to go.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember the name of the torta I chose but it was dressed with chicken, ham, and cotija cheese.  The bread was thin, which was both good and bad.  Good, because the torta wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by the bread, but bad because the freshly grilled meat, onions, and cheese wrapped up in tin foil during the journey home made the sandwich pretty soggy.  I took the offer of chipotle sauce on side, which turned out to be a good decision.  If the sauce had been on the torta during the trip home, I would have had to eat with a knife and fork.  And since the chipotle sauce is so flavorful, I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to leave it off.  The chicken was tasty but I was a little disappointed by the one thin slice of grocery store deli meat ham.

The restaurant is a nice, clean open space filled with high-top community tables smartly outfitted with rolls of paper towels.

I keep this place in mind not just for lunch and dinner, but for breakfast as well, as there are several egg-based sandwiches.

This is a sister location of the much-busier Las Tortugas on Alameda in Denver. On the occasions I&#39;ve been to the Monaco location, there have been no more than a couple of other people there.

You can have anything from a satisfying normal-sized sandwich (e.g. lambada) to an absolute gut-buster (e.g. super cubana) that you could split with someone else. The bread is exactly the right size in my opinion -- as large as a turtle, but not so thick that you&#39;ll fill up on bread.

They also have chips, horchata (cinammon rice milk drink), liquados (fruit drinks), fruit smoothies and desserts.

The sandwiches have Spanish names but, as you can see from the menu photo, the ingredient list is printed in English. You can call your order in ahead, or just show up and wait a few minutes for the sandwich to be prepared on the grill."

The windows face due west and around sunset the sun blazes through the unshaded windows and ricochets off all of the bright stainless steel tabletops and is really bright and unpleasant. It also got pretty loud with some yelling kids and the cook chopping stuff.

The menu is somewhat confusing, alternating between Spanish and English and it&#39;s not clear which items are which. Pretty much all the tortas are meat-centric -- like 3 or 4 different kinds -- but not much for veggies.

Took about 5 minutes to get, and it was searing hot. The bread was decent size, however the middle was pretty slim with thin breaded meat, avocado slice, too much chipotle sauce that dominated everything, and that&#39;s all that can be remembered. Definitely had much more satisfying and generous tortas elsewhere."

With regret hanging on me like an iron-chained-cloak, I can only imagine the emptiness of staring out the 9x12 window thru my 6 inch reinforced cell door, across the narrow hall looking at the muted glass window watching the glow of what can only be the sun, slowly fading into the deepest, darkest, shadow, of passing time when it would hit me.
(Slap!!) I forgot to add Chipotle sauce and Jalapenos for that extra spice!! This would have been the key component to help me prepare for what life I have left to live with only faded memories instead of the soul-nourishing sandwiches from Tortugas.

It already comes with life-saving tomato, onions, avocado and mayonnaise all delicately placed on two pillows of toasted, crispy, perfect, tortas. 

This incriminating combination left me licking the wax paper the sandwich came wrapped in for anything that may have dripped off.

I usually get the Enmascarada torta. Its so delicious!! It&#39;s filled with small grilled chicken pieces, ham, avocado and a delicious melted Mexican cheese. It also comes with onions and tomatoes. 
I prefer my torta with chipotle sauce instead of the jalapenos, but you can get both. The chipotle sauce adds a very good and smoky flavor to the torta.
Also, make sure you try their horchata or one of their fresh fruit milkshakes. They make everything right in front of you, so it&#39;s easy to see that everything is fresh."

So despite my consternation with the original Chubbys at 38th and Lipan, I thought what the heck. I will try this spin off and see how much they put into making a decent chile verde. 
So in I went and ordered  a hamburger with green chile . The burger was medium sized and everything was pretty awesome. Meat, buns, lettuce and tomato were all fresh. I then critically evaluated the green chile sauce, which was ordered hot as opposed to mild. It came on the side as a sauce  which was great for dipping and not just straight canned green chile plunked on top ,(although that is ok anyway as very little food can be said to &#34;not&#34; be improved by green chile !).  It passed just fine and was adequately spicy and tasty enough to merit pride methinks to any decent  green chile lover. Tad heavy on the cumin and a little light on actual green chile flavor, but that is only under a microscope and coming from a lifelong chile eater who has tasted the best including ABQ NM cuisine (and believe me those Albuquerquiens don&#39;t mess around when it comes to chile). So it passed muster for me and if I am in the area and the budget permits- definitely will try something else there. Gracias."

I generally stick with the basics here, either a Mexican Hamburger or a Beef/Bean Burrito.  It isn&#39;t earth shattering, it is basic stick to your ribs Mexi-American fare.  Like  I said, when I am in the mood I love it!  

This one is off Parker and Belleview and is a pain to get into.  You really can only get in by going to the light and entering the parking lot from the back (no turnouts from Parker).  I guess this isn&#39;t a biggie, but it seems like it should be easier!  I must say there was plenty of parking in the strip mall and this Chubby&#39;s was the cleanest Chubby&#39;s I have ever been in - seriously - it was immaculate the day I was there.

New Year&#39;s Eve on our way home called to order and was told they closed at 3pm. Why?? So we were directed to the Abilene store who has to work. They didn&#39;t even know this location closed that early. Apparently they were supposed to be open until 8, but decided on their own to just close when they wanted.

I was pleasantly surprised to find it adequately lit, very clean, and the staff was friendly. Now I noticed someone complaining about the entrance, the entrance is super simple and is not at all a pain. If anyone has driven on Parker, you know exactly how the traffic is so the entrance is to be expected.

I was here about a month or so ago and it was nice to see they added some specials, which is much needed since they don&#39;t seem to get too much business, probably due to the overall location(nothing to do with entrance). I won&#39;t say this is the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had, but I like it. It&#39;s quick, easy, and it tastes like it&#39;s cooked to order(whether or not it is, I don&#39;t really know)."

I have been a Chubbys fan since the first time I ate at the Abilene location. I thought this food was above average for Mexican but I think the food is better at the Abilene location. The green chili is pretty good, maybe just a tad bland. Def packs a lot of spice.

I recently noticed this new location not too far from my house, so I decided to give it another go. I figured if they have the money to be opening new locations, they must have fixed their problems and revamped the menu. WRONG. Just as terrible as I remember it, almost in a nostalgia sense. The refried beans smell like a dishrag, the rice was crispy, and my burrito contained mostly fatty undercooked pieces of meat. 

Probably TMI, but I spent that night waking up every couple of hours to have some horrible experiences on the toilet as a result of eating this crap. 

That&#39;s not to mention how rude and uncaring the staff was. I stood at the counter for quite a while waiting to have my order taken while meanwhile the guy working the counter was chatting it up with his friends who were in the restaurant. He seemed very annoyed that I came in wanting to give them my money, how dare I!

Bottom line, if their prices were similar to Taco Bell&#39;s prices, this place might be acceptable. But take your $10 and get a decent meal elsewhere, your stomach and your wallet will thank you."

I first arrived at the restaurant about 11 am. and there was nobody in the restaurant and for a while there I didn&#39;t see any employees either. I waited about ten minutes and finally seen a lady way in the back. So I waved to her and she contacted another person in the back to let her know i wanted to place an order. This young girl came out of the back and she looked very upset, like i woke her up from a good nap. Right before she took my order the phone rang and she answered it. So I waited a few more minutes until she hung up. Now it was my turn to order. The first words out of her mouth were &#34;what do you want?&#34; I begin to ask about the breakfast burritos and she responded they have three different kinds. I asked her what was in them. She told me to look at the menu. That was a rude response. So I then ordered a breakfast burrito and then she replied &#34;is that it?&#34; I said no. I wanted to add a mexican hamburger. She asked again &#34;is that it?&#34; I said yes. I than paid for my order and waited again. I could see back in the kitchen area and no one was working on my food. Then out of nowhere another guy comes into the restaurant.  I thought he was a customer but then he asked me if I gave been helped. I said yes and then he contined to walk back to the kitchen. I then saw him begin to prepare my food. Once he finished preparing my order him he called me up to the window behind the cash register and said &#34;here&#39;s your food&#34;. So I had to go behind the register because the cashier was nowhere to be found. I took my order and when I opened that to go container the chili on the mexican hamburger had a sour smell. I cut into the mexican hamburger and the burger tasted old and the beans were cold. The breakfast burrito had a small amount of the sour chile. Both items we awful tasting and thrown away after the first bite. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I could understand why I never saw any customer at this restaurant. Don&#39;t waste your time or money at this place.  The one star I gave this restaurant was way too many stars. I don&#39;t think even Gordan Ramsey could save this restaurant on kitchen nightmares. I think Fox 31 should have this restaurant inspected and shown on their restaurant report card. I would be very curious to see what grade they would recieve."

Excellent food. We had wine, the cheese plate and arugula salad for an appetizer. The brie and goat cheese on the cheese plate were excellent. The arugula salad with the fried oyster mushrooms and truffle oil: I could eat this every day.
I had the duck for an entree, and it was fantastic. Dessert with Palisade peaches and a butterscotch sauce was delicious.
Our server was really nice, and the atmosphere was low key.
I am so glad I finally ate at this restaurant and cannot wait to return."

My party of 4 came to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday. Johanna was our waitress and we couldn&#39;t have asked for a more wonderful experience. Three of us ordered the duck entree and the third person ordered the scallop entree. We all enjoyed our meals and raved about how fresh everything tasted. Two of us had the Caesar salads which were also tasty.

The Yelp family also raved about the mussels, so we decided to give them a try. I am a seafood connoisseur so I was excited to give them a try. They. Were. Delicious. I even got two of the people at the table who swear they don&#39;t like mussels to try them and they raved about how tasty they were.

They were sweet enough to bring the birthday guy a limoncello shot. It was a little too strong for him but it was a super sweet gesture!

Don&#39;t let the strip mall location fool you, this is a top notch restaurant with top notch service.

We will DEFINITELY find our way back out here soon!"
the-wooden-table-greenwood-village,David T.,qN99XGjaVlyJs17mx5iFEg,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,425,71,QNvMv9cs4Zwd7cH0mvOPOw,3.0,2016-04-21,"I have a good friend who lives in Cherry Hills that I don&#39;t see very often and thought I&#39;d take her out for a nice dinner - she gave me a short list of place in the area that she&#39;s heard good things about.  The Wooden Table gets generally good reviews and surprisingly for fancy area of town not that many to choose from.  

So, the elephant in the room is the total lack of ambiance.  As you&#39;ve read it is in a strip mall and the entire front of the restaurant is glass floor to ceiling so you have an unobstructed view of the parking lot and Sally&#39;s Beauty - lol.  Concrete floors make it very loud until the crowd thins out which is early because it&#39;s definitely an older demographic.  I could be OK with the meh atmosphere if the food blew my hair back but alas it did not - especially at this price point.

Started with a couple of perfect Hendrick&#39;s martinis - best thing of the night - icy cold - flawless.  For starters I had the Chicken Liver Mousse Crostini with Currants, Pickled Chilies ($11) - I was hoping for something like the silken deliciousness I had last week at Acorn.  Nope.  Hard, dense little pecan shaped nuggets on way too fragile toasts slivers which disintegrated if you tried to spread out the &#34;mousse&#34;.  Not a fan.  She out ordered me with the Fried Ricotta Polenta, Red Sauce, Melted Fresh Mozzarella ($12) - delish but an entree sized portion - even with me helping half got left behind.

For mains she had the Roasted Duck Breast, Acquerello Risotto, Duck Leg Confit, Roasted Fennel Puree, Orange and Fennel Salad ($31).  It wasn&#39;t bad but the skin was pretty flabby and the presentation left a lot to be desired.  The risotto, of which there was a huge portion, was an unappetizing gray.  I got to taste the duck and it was pretty flavorful.  I&#39;ve been craving good lamb (not much to be found in Mexico and much of what there is is from New Zealand and gamy).  So, I had Rack of Lamb, Fava Bean &amp; Herb Vinaigrette, Baba Ganoush ($32).  First, two rib chops does not make a &#34;rack&#34; in any restaurants I&#39;ve ever been in.  Second, the fava beans were in scarce supply and kind of wrinkled and tired.  Finally, the lamb looked as if it had been done sous vide - no crust, the fat inside was white, and overall it lacked the juiciness I was hoping for.

We washed this down with a bottle of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano ($75) - they decanted it which was a nice touch.  I&#39;m not generally a fan of Italian wines (and their list is 90% Italian) and so I let her choose it.  Didn&#39;t finish it so I hope our lovely sever got to sample it.  She was terrific and worth a star on her own.

I passed on dessert but she had the Affogato - Espresso Poured Over Vanilla Bean Gelato ($8).  Pretty hard to screw that up and they didn&#39;t - lovely presentation.

So, it was an OK but not great meal and, hold on to your wallet, $275 with tip.  Ouch.  At that price I expect an extraordinary experience and this simply wasn&#39;t.  No rush to return.  They&#39;re very proud of their pasta so not having it might have been our mistake.  If there&#39;s a next time (doubtful) I&#39;d go that direction."

He works nearby and was craving Italian! The Wooden Table is a gorgeous spot with great contemporary decor. Had it been dinner time, we would have loved to get wine. But since we both had to go back to work, we had waters with our pasta. 

I ordered the Ricotta Cavatelli (Duck Confit Carbonara, Pancetta, Egg Yolk) which was so tasty and just the right portion for lunch. He ordered the Pappardelle (Venison Bolognese) which he loved. The waitress offered to give him a free dessert and recommended the Tres Leches Cake. Like all the reviews say, the cake is so delicious! It&#39;s a huge portion too and together, we couldn&#39;t finish it. Really generous of them especially since most restaurants don&#39;t give away anything for birthdays anymore.

Sadly, the restaurant was empty during our entire meal, but hopefully it gets more visitors for dinners and on weekends. Highly recommend! Definitely want to come back and try other menu items like the mussels and scallops."

I&#39;ve made several attempts to be here so when we finally made it, my expectation had been built up so high. Good thing The Wooden Table met it!

The dinner menu was simple but I&#39;m happy that they present two different entrée sizes. I gotta say, the prices ain&#39;t cheap, that&#39;s why it behooves you to join their mailing list and get in on the 15% loyalty discount! 

I was glad to have hung on to the bread because the pastas turned out to be a little on the salty side but I sure enjoyed mopping up the sauces! Definitely loved the Parpadelle with venison Bolognese. At first I saw these super wide noodles and thought they&#39;d used lasagna sheets. It wasn&#39;t until a week later when I made lasagna at home using the boxed dry stuff that I realized their Parpadelle was probably fresh pasta!

The Carbonara had an interesting flavor to it, I thought it tasted bitter, some folks might like it though... The Scallop dish was both pretty to look at and wonderful to eat! Don&#39;t expect leftovers here, the portion sizes aren&#39;t that huge but that&#39;s what a classy place should be! We managed to make room for dessert and per next table&#39;s recommendation, we got the lemon curd cake. Personally I&#39;d love to lose the curd and have just the cake and eat it too! :-D

Service was spot on, our waitress was very sweet and I promised her she&#39;ll see us again!"

I&#39;m not clear on why one would name a restaurant after that fact, but, nonetheless, it&#39;s true.

Hmmmm. Perhaps it is supposed to show that it&#39;s an informal neighborhood spot and isn&#39;t trying to show off by using any of those really expensive onyx tables. If that&#39;s the goal, TWT met it: It&#39;s a nice strip mall dining spot with one big open room that has an inviting atmosphere and is peopled by professional and cool servers who tend to a monochromatic Cherry Hills clientele. 

We made the drive down south for 3 reasons: first, we have a Denver Dining coupon book that TWT is in and it gives you 2-fer entrees with a deadline that is fast approaching; second, I was crazy hungry for medium rare roasted duck and on a Monday night TWT was the only place around we could find that has ducky-poo on the menee-you; third, we&#39;re moving out tomorrow to do major renovations on our house and there&#39;s nothing in the refrigerator/freezer other than a bottle of wohdka (and that didn&#39;t sound like it&#39;d be the right thing to do for dinner on a school night:).

Got to TWT and couldn&#39;t have been more pleased. We both had their duck and it wasn&#39;t that sweet &#34;a l&#39;orange&#34; thing. More savory and very well prepared. Started with an arugula salad that was nicely presented and had a good glass of vino nobile that was the perfect reasonably priced accompaniment to the game. The only thing we weren&#39;t wild about was the in-house carrot cake with toasted coconut. The cake was too dense and not particularly carrot-y. The frosting, however, was very good.

All-in-all, we&#39;d probably go back if we were in the neighborhood. If we actually lived around there (and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll give us a passport stamp to live that far south of the city) we&#39;d probably hit it up more often.

The food is consistently better than average, including the home-made pastas and meats, that often include very well-sourced lamb, venison, duck breast, and other cool things.    However, I onnly can give three stars overall, and here is why:

Portions/value - portions are tiny.  Especially for the pastas, and at lunch.  One other example, we had sides with the lamb rib chops recently... it came with 6, count em... SIX... fava beans (they were more for looks than anything).  

Wine - thanks to a prior Somm who worked at Wooden Table, who brought up the wines considerably, there are really cool and different wines on the list, including an Etna Rosso (Sicily) and a Pinot Noir from Suditrol (very cool, both!).  However!   ANd this is a BIG however... I have had to send wines back more than once BECAUSE THEY ARE OXIDIZED.  There is really no excuse for sending out wines that have been open too long, as a knowledgeable wine person (like me) can tell a bad wine or a corked wine just by smelling it.

Overall, the food was good, including the cheese plate, and the desserts, also the coffee, and the service... for out in burbs, this is better than most all chains and a nice find.  Just PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS and DON&#39;T BE SKIMPY!"

Calina and I came in about half an hour before our reservation and were immediately greeted by Robert, such a friendly and personable Host. We were able to enjoy a Walnut Manhattan cocktail before dinner. We used the Yelp check in to get a BOGO for the cocktail.

The Walnut Manhattan was so yummy and my taste buds were happy.

We then ordered a bottle of red wine and proceeded to attack the delicious mussels--Yum, Yum, Yum. The broth is so tasty and could eat it as a soup! Also ordered the delicious Arugula salad (a must get each time we come in to dine).

For the entrees we ordered the duck, the veal osso buco, the cod, the tortellini, and beef platters. We all tried each others entrees and once again, taste buds were jumping and happy!

You would not expect the quality of food served here to be located in a strip mall.  We went with the recommendations of our server and the sommelier.  We had the mussels to start which were really good enough to want to find every piece of bread in the place and dip it in the broth.  The wine the sommelier suggested was very good and reasonably priced.  We both got pasts dishes since they are made in house.  These were both quite good.  I had the Ricotta Cavatelli which was really good, but note it is rich.  There were too barley cooked eggs on top to stir in on your own which was a nice touch.  My hubby had the linguine, which as good as mine was, I think I liked it even better.  It had a nice kicked to it but not spicy.  

We opted not to have dessert because we were so satisfied with the flavors we had at the point, we didn&#39;t want to change it.  We were also crazy full.

The Groupon ended up paying for the two entrees with the appetiser and desert being free.  It was a fantastic deal.

We started with the polenta which was a blast of creamy and savory flavors.  For our entrees, I ordered the duck with herbed risotto and my wife had the hanger steak with diced potatoes.  Like the appetiser, our entrees were spectacular.  The flavors worked perfectly on both dishes.  My duck was crispy on the outside and medium rare on the inside.  The risotto had large pieces of duck in it which complimented the flavors of the herbs.  Her steak was perfectly seasoned and prepared and the diced potatoes were like nothing we had previously tasted.

We ordered the tres leches cake for desert and were somewhat disappointed in the dish.  The appetiser and entrees, however, more than made up for the lackluster desert.   

From an ambience standpoint, this is a no thrills restaurant which was slightly disappointing given the menu prices.  It does, however, have an excellent wine cellar.  The only other downfall is that the service was slow.  We spent over two hours on our meal.  Plan accordingly."

Chicken liver appetizer was awesome. Signature cocktails were average (lemon drop and hello zacher) but it was fun to find a BOGO Free with a Yelp check-in. 

Arugula salad was good.  Service was good. 

Lamb was $30 but it was like eating 2 pieces of leather. I asked for another steak knife as I hoped the knife was dull, but it only slightly helped stop the table from violently shaking. Halibut was average, at best. Sauces for both entrees were yummy but neither salvaged the dish. The Gnocchi actually had a hard texture. Hard gnocchi?

Despite having a free cocktail, dinner totaled $113 before tip. 

I almost gave 3 stars, but we can find several other restaurants to enjoy at that dinner price."

My meatball sandwich was bland.  I like the meatball sandwiches at Firehouse Subs and Subway much better.  The sandwich came with freshly fried rosemary potato chips.  My husband liked them.

My husband ordered a pasta appetizer which was the portion size available with the Groupon for lunch.  There were 7 small tortellini like pastas in a bowl with some broth.  He was still hungry and asked for another plate of complimentary bread.

This place was pricey even with the Groupon and we will not be back."

My husband got a promotion at work, so as a last-minute thought, we swung by The Wooden Table for a celebration night. It was a Thursday evening, a little bit before 6:30. They had five open tables. 

The hostess asked if we had a reservation and we replied, &#34;No... but we&#39;re hoping we can get a table!&#34;

The manager (I believe-- baldish guy with a big beard) coughed at her &#34;BAR!&#34; and thus we were seated at the bar. I did ask her if any &#34;reservations&#34; for those five open tables cancelled, if we could please be moved. She agreed.

The tables remained open. We were not moved. (By the time we left, around 8:00, there were four open tables, with a horde of people wrapping up to go as we were). During our meal, we heard the manager complaining openly about walk-ins and it sounded like the kitchen was unprepared to handle a half-full dining room. I believe his mother was sitting next to us at the bar, and he was loud and talking about burping in people&#39;s faces. A lovely young couple, obviously out on a date, came in with a Groupon, and we heard him complaining LOUDLY about that as well. 

Despite the food being decent, there are much better places to drop $150 for 2 for a night out. And I will say, dessert was NOT good. The molten chocolate cake tastes like a cinnamon bomb. It&#39;s hard to taste any cocoa because your mouth is on fire from the unwieldy amount of cinnamon.

I get that reservations are helpful, but to feel sized up, deemed less than, and shunned to the bar when you have open tables is BAD BUSINESS. We were so hungry and my husband was so excited about his night out that we didn&#39;t leave, but I wish we had. 

We will never step foot in that restaurant again."

Both times using a Groupon deal and both times we had a fantastic dining experience. There were new items on the menu the second time we went and I was told that they change their menu a few times a year. Their wine list had some interesting and fun choices, and their food was amazing. The first time we went we had the lamb chops and scallops, the second time we had the venison chops and braised veal shank. So delicious. And we ended our meal the last time with the bread pudding. Amazing.

Service was always friendly. The space is small, intimate, and it&#39;s great for groups as well as a romantic dinner for two. I&#39;m a fan. While they are a little on the pricey side, they have groupons often which makes it an awesome deal. I recommend  having reservations ahead of time for this place."

We were all very pleased! We all got different salads, I had the Caesar, and they were all tasty (for those who are anchovy shy, the Caesar does come with them) I had the tortelloni and it was great, portion is on the small side, but with the salad that worked out just fine. One of my girlfriends had the beef and that will be what I get next time I go.

We loved how the waiters didn&#39;t come by and basically push us out the door like so many do in the US in order to get one last tip before closing.  We loved that we could order dessert because we ate so slowly that we had room for the top-off course before going home. 

The Wooden Table gave us that European dinner that we&#39;ve missed. We ordered the polenta to start- I never thought a little appetizer could make me so happy!  It was fried, smothered in cheese, and then topped with a ladle of marinara.  I need to figure out how to have more of that polenta in my life- without having to buy new pants. 

I ordered the beef with creamed potato and bacon, and haricot verts.  The beef was perfectly tender and so flavorful. The potatoes had the perfect texture- as noted by my texturally picky husband. 

We ordered the volcano cake for dessert, paired with peppermint gelato.  I think it&#39;s safe to say that it was the best dessert I&#39;ve ever had. Ever. Also, The Wooden Table gave us our dessert and night cap on the house when they heard it was my birthday, which added to the deliciousness. 

Every bite of our dinner was perfect, the service was prompt but not pushy, and the atmosphere allowed us to relax and enjoy good conversation. This will be our go-to date night spot from now on!"

We had the strawberry basil martini and the Papa Doble. Both were good and definitely strong though I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re worth $12. The balsamic rim on the SB martini was great.
We shared the polenta appetizer which reminded me of a really fancy mozzarella stick. So good. We almost ordered another!
I had the spinach salad which is studded with butternut squash, bacon, Gorgonzola, and walnuts and the dressed in a lovely apple cider vinaigrette. Definitely worth $9. 
Hubs had the gnocchi with rabbit and the parsnips and truffle oil sauce was to die for. Fantastic dish.
For our mains I had the scallops. It comes with 3 large scallops that sit atop pork belly and then underneath that us a brandade- which is a salted cod emulsion reminiscent of a really fancy hot tuna salad. If your mom ever made bunsteads (which she probably didn&#39;t, could be a Midwest thing!) the filling flavor is very similar. Anyhoos- yummy!
Hubs had the lamb. The flavor profile is definitely my cup of tea and is how I often prepare lamb. It was tasty. It came with a spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese turnover and was served over a cheese sauce.
This good food does not come cheap and they&#39;re probably a couple dollars overpriced but to have something so delicious in the neighborhood is definitely worth it."

The greatest drawback is little sense of *place* -- the strip mall setting, the boxy room done up with understated elegance but still feeling like a storefront. That doesn&#39;t interfere with the dining so much as recalling the restaurant the next time you&#39;re thinking of going out."

Fine dining Italian. Was highly impressed! Great, and friendly staff. We had a late reservation and called to see if they could work us in sooner which they accommodated. We started with a couple of the salads which were tasty. Then had a couple of entrees. The veal was so tender and delicious and the scallops were great as well. Then we finished off with the chocolate covered pear which was not my favorite but my sister absolutely loved it. Definitely would like to return to try some of their pastas!

Last night we went with another couple and ordered a total of 10 things on the menu (2 apps, 1 salad, 3 app portion pastas, 1 dinner pasta, 1 entree and 2 desserts). Every. Single. Thing was delicious. I agree with our server, Holly...The pastas really are something special because they are all made fresh in house. The pappardelle is mind blowing. 

I wish I could come here more often (once a week would do it!!) but it&#39;s definitely on the pricier side. Totally worth it though!

We went in last evening to celebrate our 7 year wedding anniversary and we felt so taken care of by the staff. From start to finish, the service was immaculate and impeccable. I love that every server you see on the floor is smiling, and working together as a team. As a guest, you can tell everyone working takes great pride in the food and beverages they serve. As well they should, because the food is to die for. Our Mussels came in a mouthwatering Saffron broth with Fennel. They were the best Mussels we&#39;ve ever had. The Chef puts extra love and flavor into every dish. Even the classic Caesar stood out as special and unique. I&#39;ll be dreaming of the Venison Pappardelle for a long time. The beautiful house made pasta, the mouthwatering perfect sauce. We couldn&#39;t stop talking about it. Sadly, we ate so much, we had no room for dessert. We will just have to visit again soon. A very special thank you to Robert, who is the kindest, most knowledgeable  Maitre D/Sommelier. Robert deftly paired all of our courses with beautiful wine selections. As a former server in restaurants, I love it when I can learn new things about food and wine. Robert really knows his craft. We left there so happy. Everyone at The Wooden Table should be proud.

I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way really -- the food is overall very good (especially their pasta), but I don&#39;t think the overall experience is $100 good (see breakdown below). Also, it&#39;s a bit strange that a restaurant charging these prices is located in a strip mall. But I digress. 

Sweetbreads ($14) -- crispy, great sauce
1/2 order of Agnalotti ($14)-- nice pumpkin flavor, subtle sweetness
Colorado Lamb ($33) -- juicy and tender
American Red Snapper ($29) --smelled super fishy, tasteless (maybe that&#39;s a good thing in this particular case), regardless I was very disappointed
Tres Leches Cake ($8) -- fresh strawberries, some parts of the cake were too dry

Total w/ Groupon: $98 (of note, no drinks were ordered)

I can&#39;t really seem to put my finger on it, but I don&#39;t think the meal is worth the price. Substituting another entree for the red snapper, I&#39;d gladly pay $60 for all the above (coincidentally what the Groupon costs). Any more than that loses its value though.

The service has always been great. 

I would consider returning but only with a voucher."

There was a 16 person group in the restaurant that seemed to suck all the energy out of the place. We showed up with a Yelp coupon for a free cocktail and had to go through several levels of management  to have it honored. I ordered lamb chops at $33, which came out lukewarm to cold after sitting in the kitchen for 20 minutes.  One came back nicely done after a complaint. A few good things: bread, chicken liver pate, scallops. But after raving about the quality of this place in previous reviews, I must say our experience tonight was sadly disappointing and closer to what one might expect at a chain restaurant in the burbs. Going to be a while before we return, if we do return. It is certainly difficult to make every dish great every night, but I expected more from this place."

We were delighted by the wine he chose for us and the knowledge that came along with the story of the wines history. 

Then the appetizers came...WOW the food. You know that moment when you wish you were alone so you could lift the bowl to your face and lick the plate? That nearly happened!

The layout of the restaurant is intimate and inviting. Our server, Moana, and the entire staff was very welcoming and excited about the work the restaurant does. You could tell everyone loves the food! 

The wine list was well chosen, with something in everyone&#39;s price range. We ended up with 2 bottles of one of cheaper malbecs which was absolutely delicious.  

Started with the Sweetbread with grapefruit - with a genius cheese sauce to blend the two. Well seasoned, juicy, and something I&#39;d order every time I come back. I never would have imagined how well grapefruit and cheese go together, but this was one combo worth writing about! 

The venison rack was cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a plate I could lick clean. 

We finished with some desert wines and an apple tart topped with caramel sauce and cinnamon ice cream, and I couldn&#39;t imagine a better dessert! 

We&#39;d been eating in several restaurants in the area over the course of the week, but what a mistake. This is absolutely a repeat restaurant - we&#39;re going to just come right here next time we visit! 

Regarding price - this restaurant was about what you&#39;d pay for in New York for a nice up-scale meal. For 2 bottles of wine, one app and entree per person, two desserts and an after-dinner cocktail for everyone, we ended up at about $100pp. Definitely reasonable for a nice night out!"

We went on a Monday night where they feature 50% of wines, which is a wonderful deal and allows you to either save some bucks or splurge on a wine you wouldn&#39;t normally order.  

For starters, the eggplant dish was phenomenal.  It was very creative, seeming to be a hybrid of the flavors of Eggplant Parmigiana with the shape of Arancini.  It was full of flavor and cooked perfectly so the cheese melted just write when you cut it open.

The Prosciutto salad with grapefruit was also well plated and full of flavor.  It was quite larger than others in my party, and the price explains that ($12 vs $7-9 for other salads).  But it was worth the price.

I had the Duck entree and it was delicious.  I will rate it a 4 only because of the accompaniments.  Although the duck was delicious and cooked perfectly, the accompanying gnocchi was sparse and the butternut squash was diced too small and tasted undercooked.  I would have liked a puree or more of a sauce as well to dip the duck in.  I had a similar dish at Bittersweet Restaurant and it was far superior.  

I will definitely go back and next time I will try the Lobster Linguini.

To finish the meal they bring out complementary limoncello.  This was a very nice touch and it was a delicious palate cleanser. 

Desserts were also beyond exceptional.  We shared the cheesecake, the pot de creme, and the tres leches.  I couldn&#39;t pick a favorite because they were all so heavenly.  I would say, however, that the tres leches is a contender for the best I have ever had.

The service was outstanding and Gary is a a wonderful host."

Has the feel of a neighborhood bistro and you get the impression that many of the customers are regulars.  Definitely not a cookie cutter dining experience, and the menu changes seasonally!

We almost always start every meal with an appetizer of their mussels.  The broth with these is simply to die for ... packed with flavor that has you sopping up every drop with toasted bread, and it&#39;s always a hunt to see who can get the last little chorizo meatball at the table.  We&#39;ve had mussels at a number of places around town, and you&#39;ll never find grit in these like we sometimes have had elsewhere.

The husband invariably orders one of the house-made pastas.  His favorites usually center around the bolognese sauce; sometimes made with pork belly, other times he&#39;s had it with venison.  Always yummy.  I usually go for one of the main entrees. Lately this winter my favorite has been the lamb, and I&#39;m hoping that this summer the chef will bring back my old favorite - a halibut in an asparagus broth that is to die for.

To top it all off, you&#39;re offered a complimentary limoncello apertif that&#39;s made in-house.  Can&#39;t wait to go back.  

We visit the Wooden Table fairly regularly, but if you keep a sharp eye out you can find great deals via Groupon or restaurant.com which gives you a little extra spending money for the wine list."

After a great first experience at this high-end, rather pricey restaurant, my husb and I decided to splurge for our First Wedding Anniversary in August 2015. I made a reservation for two on Open Table and wrote that it was our anniv in the comment section. About two hours before our res, I got a wonderful, polite and warm phone call from a gentleman, confirming our reservation. He wished us a happy anniversary and offered either a free dessert or champagne. I asked for champagne. I was so excited for a special night! When we arrived, a women with long, curly red hair and zero-personality vaguely greeted/welcomed us, led us to a table for two and ended up being our boring waitress. She didn&#39;t seem to have a clue about our wedding anniv, She certainly didn&#39;t know about the complimentary champagne we had been offered. And I got so knotted up about it, I couldn&#39;t even begin to ask or explain to her. Which I regret. That champagne would have been really nice and she might have sweetened up her mood a bit. But it&#39;s over. I said nothing. My husb and I ordered a ridiculously expensive appetizer, a glass of wine for me and a beer for him. We each ordered pasta entrees (we might have splurged on higher priced fish or meat, but by this point, I think we were both deflated about the state of affairs...). The acoustics in the restaurant were awful and we had trouble talking to each other. The place was packed and with so many people talking. With insufficient insulation in the ceilings, this is what happens. My husb didn&#39;t love his vegetarian pasta. He felt it was overpriced since it didn&#39;t have meat. My pasta had sausage and was quite savory and tasty. We were asked about dessert, but we declined -- just wanting to get out of there. I followed up two days later by making a phone call to the restaurant. I spoke with a gentleman (I think the Manager on Duty??) named Brad. He was unconcerned about our issues and said that he would pass a message to the owner.  Never heard a single word after that. We won&#39;t be going back. Very disappointing experience and obv some huge communications problems between management and the owner. I would bet money that Manager Brad never relayed the message to the owner."
the-wooden-table-greenwood-village,Sherri S.,9N6r_1nqHqVS1h4QbGCZfQ,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,19,39,Qgaf0AfOiQAfWpwqDPVdPQ,3.0,2013-12-09,"This review is a mixed bag.  The food was great, the drinks were great, the service decent (great for others), but the location was a little odd.

The decor inside is nice but something about staring at a lit Ace Hardware sign through the window while eating in an upscale restaurant threw me off.  There was also the fact that we were the youngest people in the restaurant.  It&#39;s not a huge problem but we are in our 30&#39;s and everyone else was double our age or more.  It could just be the location and the demographics of our &#39;hood but it we felt a little out of place.  The owner was making his rounds the entire time we were there talking to each of the 17 tables, which I found endearing...I love those touches.  Until, he never once came to our table.  Was it because we are not gray haired?  We did drop $200 on dinner in his restaurant.  We actually had a bet going that he wouldn&#39;t say a single word to us, but as we were walking out the door, he did thank us for coming in.  Also, we saw other diners get to chose from a yummy looking cheese/wine cart that their server brought by after dinner.  I have only seen this done at Tru in Chicago, which is a Michelin star restaurant.  Great touch, only we were not offered the same display.  We were only given the desert menu.  This could just be something that specific server did as his finishing touch.  Our server did not offer the cheese cart to any of her tables.  Big miss in my opinion.

Anyway, negatives out of the way...we tried a little of everything on the menu.  We started with the pork belly appetizer.  I found it a little dry (over cooked?) and the white beans were very al diente,  but the flavors were good.  This was my least favorite dish.  Next we had the Cesar salad.  We both agreed that it was dry and under-dressed, but the fresh Parmesan was tasty.  For the main course (yes we stuffed ourselves) we split the half order pumpkin tortellini, the hangar steak, and the lamb chops.  All three of the main courses were  delicious.  For desert, I had the cheese plate with a sweet port aperitif.  The brie that they pared with the pureed dates was so good that I would go back just for that.

Overall, we wanted to get the full experience.  We live down south and were excited to hear about a non-chain, fine dining option in our area.  We would return and do it on a smaller scale.  I&#39;m just not sure why we weren&#39;t treated the same as the other tables in the restaurant.  Other tables were offered an off the menu apple pie desert and a glass of lemoncello.  We asked our server what they were having and she said oh that&#39;s not on the menu.  Yet everyone else had it.  She did let us order it though and even said the lemoncello was complimentary.  It seemed weird that every other table was offered this &#34;complimentary&#34; item, yet we had to ask for it.  Maybe the entire restaurant was a group of the owner&#39;s personal friends and we just came on a night when he was hosting his colleagues and aiming to impress.  It was just really noticeable that we were not included in this effort.

In case you were wondering, the tables are in fact made of wood."

This experience was with a group of 6. The first course was clouded by one of my guests finding a balled up paper in his salad. The second course, duck, was clouded by the plate presentation &amp; lack of imagination. The food tasted as it looked, all brown. Mono-flavor, mono-pallet, mono-experience. And the dessert course was sadly interrupted by a persistent fly that literally bounced off of my face before claiming the remained of my Tres Leches cake. I normally really enjoy this place. This experience was just poor all around."

The Wooden Table serves up what one would expect at a downtown or Capitol Hill establishment in an unassumming strip mall in the burbs.  Unfortunately for me, this place wasn&#39;t around during my youth and is now halfway across town.  Eitherway, it was so worth the trip back to the old stomping grounds.

I ended up here on a Saturday night and began the evening at the bar to partake in their pretty awesome happy hour.  $3 well drinks, wine, and beer as well as $5 house martinis are a great accompaniment to their $6 food options.  We ended up with the mussels and frutti di mare crudo.  Not only substantial for only $6, they were immensely full of flavor, especially the mussel broth which contained chunks of sausage!!  

After partaking in happy hour, we moved to the formal dining room for our dinner.  I ordered the black cod which was highlighted by the accompanying cauliflower puree and shrimp and scallop quenelle.  My mom, being a pasta lover, ended up ordering the caesar salad and the ravioli.  Even with just a half portion, she was fully satisfied.  

To finalize the meal, we were each given complimentary shots of dessert liqueurs.  These shots were awesome ways to cap off the entire dining experience.  Overall,I&#39;ll gladly return here as it appears they change up their menu regularly to capitalize on seasonal produce."

They had a deal on living social that I purchased that included a shared appetizer two mains and a dessert, pretty good deal!

I&#39;d seen the restaurant reviewed on Yelp but had no idea where it was. Nestled in a strip mall off Orchard &amp; University, The Wooden Table does a good job of staying off the map. It&#39;s not difficult to find, but secretive enough not to attract an overwhelming crowd.

The interior is somewhat intimate, but the one-room dining and bar area, with two and four-top tables, doesn&#39;t quite set the most romantic atmosphere. Still, the set up is not entirely distracting. Though I could overhear the conversation at other tables, I wasn&#39;t completely distracted from my own dining experience.

Many of the dishes are made in-house, including mozzarella, bread, and pasta. Appetizers ranged from said mozzarella, to mussels, to pork belly, with options to enjoy the pasta dishes in appetizer portions as well. Entrees include salmon, scallops, duck, veal, and hangar steak (among others). We settled on the pork belly to start, with duck &amp; scallop entrees.

Our meal was amazing. The pork belly was divine, tender &amp; full of flavor. THIS is what I&#39;d call gourmet &#34;bacon candy.&#34; The scallop dish features three large scallops atop a shrimp cake, a decent serving for myself - and fairly standard for a scallop dish - but possibly too light for someone with a larger stomach. The duck entree was larger, with duck served two ways. My boyfriend devoured it, but was kind enough to let me sample. The duck sausage was amazing!

We followed dinner with chocolate frangelico cheesecake &amp; Irish coffee. 

Service was at the level expected for this calibre restaurant, and the manager stopped at every table post-meal to follow up. 

We&#39;re looking forward to visiting in the future &amp; highly recommend The Wooden Table."

The food was overall very good. There were some absolute standouts such as the pork belly, the duck cavatelli, and the duck with butternut squash gratin and brussel sprouts. 

With their complimentary bread they serve an incredible mix of EVOO, rock salt, and an herb. I can&#39;t remember whether it was thyme or rosemary, but the combination was great. It really complimented the delicious bread they receive from Trompeau Bakery.

Surprisingly the lobster entree was somewhat tough and chewy both in regards to the lobster meat and the pasta it was served on top of.

Unfortunately we did not leave room for desert. We both will be back for the Tres Leches and their signature Manhattan cocktail. (but we will most likely sit at the bar.)

Similar to other very good restaurants in the Denver area, the maitre d offered us a substitute bottle of wine at the same price when it turned out that the restaurant did not have in stock the bottle we wanted.  The substitute was very good.

The service was unfortunately pretty lacking.  After we were seated we waited at least 25 minutes before anyone came by to check on us. If we had not placed our food order when we ordered our wine I am honestly not sure what time we would have eaten. 

There was a larger &#34;business&#34; dinner occupying the center of the restaurant with a solid &#34;middle manager&#34; type that wanted everyone to pay attention to him. If anybody is interested this guy had great recommendations for hotels near the red light districts in Dusseldorf and Antwerp. Our guess was that they were all from Visa and half the table was trying to impress their out of town colleagues. To say that their carrying on was distracting is obvious. (Not really something you would expect in a restaurant where the average bill is likely $80.00 per person.)  I believe that the reason we were left isolated for so long was simply that the server decided it best to focus on the &#34;big ticket&#34; table and was unable to split the burden of waiting on them and us.

Additionally, that night there were a lot of regulars as well as the red light district aficionados. Maybe we were just lower on the priority list being new. I guess when the food is this good they can get away it.

The Wooden Table is a smallish nice restaurant in a strip mall in the suburbs. The food is overall good and a refreshing surprise in the midst of such a mediocre environment. The setting reminded me of the original Nobu in Malibu. Among the surrounding area this restaurant is definitely a bright spot. Just be prepared to wait and don&#39;t forget to make the most of the limited attention you receive from your waitstaff.

On a final note, depending on the size of your bank account, don&#39;t be afraid to show up in jeans, sneakers, and t-shirt. It is Colorado!"

We chose the patio as it was our only option. The food was great, I had the duck and my wife had linguini. The service however was sub par for the prices they charge. 
We had to ask for bead after being sat for over 15 mins and for refills on our empty drinks. We were never offered fresh pepper or grated cheese for our dishes (as one would expect at a semi-fine dining restaurant). 
We finished with our mains and we&#39;re left unattended for 30 mins w/o drink refills or being offered desert, the interior tables didn&#39;t start seating until 7:30 leaving us pondering why we weren&#39;t offered a table inside over an hour prior. 
Overall it was not worth the $150 we spent. One would expect a certain level of attentiveness from staff in a semi empty restaurant especially with the prices they charge. 
Two stars for the food (as it was excellent) and minus three for the lack of service. They would have gotten five.

They advertise as a fine dinning place but act with the mentality of a small cafe in a strip mall. I made on line reservation for dinner and got an email confirmation but when I arrived a rude person at the front desk denied my reservation and insisted to have me seated at the bar. 
 I explained to him that I make reservation to have a nice dinner in a fine dinning place at a table not a bar but he kept on his unprofessional behavior saying that I can&#39;t have a table to myself and have to sit at the bar. Also I explained that I like to experience the service before I bring business group events to restaurants but he didn&#39;t care. He pretended that he would speak to the manager and came back saying that there is nothing they can do. When I insisted to speak to the manager he claimed that the manager can&#39;t speak to me and he&#39;s the one calling the shots. 

Obviously all the basic customer care manners are violated without fear of consequences. Restaurants with such manners should never be allowed to stay in business. I have never had such experience in any fine restaurant. I would strongly recommend that this restaurant should be off the list of option if anybody is looking for a nice dinner in a decent place. They&#39;re rude and disrespectful to customers."

Our server, Brad, was quick (but never hurrying) and courteous, and was not only our server, but also doubled as the bartender -- and apparently a cocktail artist! He quickly brought around our drinks, which, for me, was a perfectly crafted Whiskey Sour...the prettiest I&#39;ve ever seen!

Then on to dinner! I was expecting a good meal, after reading that the chef once worked at Luca and Osterio  Marco -- and I was not disappointed by any measure! Me and my two friends each selected a different pasta dish from the many delicious sounding plates on the menu. We decided on the Roasted Pork Belly Linguine, Agnolotti with Shrimp Scampi in a Tarragon Mascarpone Sauce, and Braised Lamb Shoulder Gnochhi. Each of us portioned out our pasta and shared so we could all enjoy each of these amazing dishes. Every dish was transcendent and perfectly cooked. Though each dish wowed us, the Lamb Shoulder Gnocchi definitely stood out as the star! Meat so mouthwateringly tender in a creamy sauce that did not even hint of too much butter or salt (take THAT Olive Garden!) 

Overall, service, drinks and food were amazing and a treasured find in a suburban strip mall (albeit a more upscale one!) The only thing I wouldn&#39;t say was &#34;perfect&#34; was the minimalist and open dining area. The open layout and tight seating made for a fairly loud room once the restaurant was filled. And for some reason the sylvan vision in my head of &#34;The Wooden Table&#34; was an idyllic rustic provincial restaurant (like Potager or Duo) with a  hand carved community table tucked in a corner. Alas, my musings set me up to be disappointed. However, the service and food is so exceptional, one can completely forget about  the decor as they are transported into pasta nirvana!"

We were immediately greeted by the very friendly owner, which made is feel very welcome. The service was superb. Our server was friendly and attentive and often took care of our needs before we could even ask (like when my son dunked his car in my husband&#39;s water glass and our server immediately brought him a new water without being asked). 

The list of homemade specialty cocktails was fun to look through, and I ordered a sage lemon drop. It was a little light on the sage, but otherwise very nice. 

For appetizers we ordered pork belly and polenta. The polenta was rich, creamy, and full of fresh herbs, and topped with a flavorful homemade tomato sauce and gooey melted mozzarella. The pork belly was a little over done, but I had an end piece which may have been over cooked. Everyone else loved it. The beans and slaw served with the pork belly felt a little out of place, but they weren&#39;t bad. 

For my main course, I ordered the lobster tortelloni and LOVED it. The homemade pasta was cooked perfectly, the lobster broth was light and decadent at the same time, and there were generously large chunks of lobster claw meet amongst the pasta. The filling was a bit mushy for my liking, but even so it was extremely flavorful and delicious.  I would most definitely order my meal again.

The rest of my group loved their meals, too. Among the other dishes, the scallops were cooked nicely, the crab cake included very large chunks of crab, the duck breast was tender and melted in your mouth, and the homemade pasta was satisfyingly rustic. I thought the venison bolognese could have used some extra glamour in its presentation, but the flavor was not lacking. My husband found it to be somewhat salty for his taste, but I thought it was perfect. 

I was a little disappointed with the dessert menu at first. After such a well planned menu, I expected a bit more creativity from the desserts. However, the execution of the desserts did not disappoint. The cheese cake was marbled chocolate and something else (caramel?), but was refreshingly not too sweet and perfectly cooked. The molten chocolate cake had an intensely rich dark chocolate flavor that tasted amazing with the vanilla gelato. 

After dinner we were offered a homemade limoncello, which was a fun and tasty surprise and a great way to cap our meal. 

Some people have commented in other reviews that they didn&#39;t like the location. I agree that looking out at a parking lot isn&#39;t the greatest, but the trade-off for me is that it&#39;s great food close to home with ample parking. I love eating in trendier neighborhoods, but parking is always a challenge and the locations are rarely convenient. I love that this is 10 minutes from home and a 40-second walk to the door.

Overall, I loved this restaurant and will definitely go back."

I ordered the linguine and the  duck cavatelli. I  returned the linguine dish because the clams did not taste very fresh and was very chewy. The broth was kind of meh. The duck cavatelli dish I would order again as i thought it was their best pasta dish. I asked for the ravioli to replace the linguine. Good dish but nothing special. Ravioli filled with cheese with a sage brown butter drizzle. Nothing really stood out with the ravioli dish.

My wife ordered the tortelloni and the spinach salad. She really enjoyed the salad and thought the tortelloni dish was ok. I tasted the tortelloni dish and did not like it. They stuff the pasta with asparagus (puree?) and did not like the combination. The  very little lobster that was in the dish was chewy and the overall flavor of the dish was lacking.

I would give the desserts about a 2 star rating. The molten lava cake was dry and left a powdery bitter aftertaste. I&#39;ve had much better at chain restaurants. They charge $8 for that??   At first I really enjoyed the tres leches cake until i got to the middle of it. The middle and edge of the cake was dry and not moist. I could see the cake being one of the better desserts if it is done right. The ice cream is good but it&#39;s not really a scoop of ice cream--more like a spoonful. Pretty skimpy on the ice cream proportions.

Overall, the servers are enthusiastic about the menu and service is good but the food quality is lacking and overpriced for what your getting. I would be back for the  duck cavatelli and maybe give the tres leches cake another chance. The cake has to be done right for the high price. I would give the service about 4 stars and the food about 2.5 stars."

The food was superb. Perfectly seasoned, well balanced, and great wine pairings. We tried the mussels as an app, I had the Lobster with Tagliattele (WOW!), my wife had the beef, and we split the Makers Mark peach pie with vanilla bean ice cream. The server David was well-versed on the entire menu and provided first class service. The cocktails were plentiful and well made. The GM was a true gentlemen, referring to my wife as &#39;Mrs. Atencio&#39;. The attention to detail was spot on, and the food was that much better!

Thanks to you all at The Wooden Table, we have found our new favorite restaurant and we WILL be back!

the-wooden-table-greenwood-village,Doug H.,x4oWeIl2HdTtALEq4y0raA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,53,1,K1FPTQQtILN51_3em5AvYA,3.0,2012-08-27,"Really vacillating between a 3 and 4 star review for the Wooden Table.  The food was definitely up to snuff, and on that basis alone it should be a favorable review, but there were just enough things to detract from the experience that I have to take it down a notch.

First, the food.  Wooden Table has an excellent selection of pastas, salads, and entrees and while nothing is particularly innovative or original, they&#39;ve clearly got a talented chef.  The pastas in particular are fresh-made, and I tried one of the new items on the menu, a pork belly Amatriciana.   It was excellent, very porky, with two thick pork belly slices over the fresh spaghetti tossed in a pancetta based tomato sauce. I was however expecting something a bit spicier to live up to the Amatriciana name.  For my entree, I had the duck, which was a breast served over crunchy croutons and a split pea base.  It was interesting but I didn&#39;t especially like the pea puree paired with the duck.  One niggling issue was that the menu item said that the duck was both breast and confit, but there was no confit, as far as I could tell.  I even checked the menu again afterward, to see if the confit was part of a sauce or shredded and I just missed it, but no, it was supposed to be a leg confit.  Oh well.  My wife had the scallops and they were three fat scallops nicely seared and served over a crab cake.  Others in my party had a halibut served in a brodo.   They all looked excellent and got good reports, but I didn&#39;t taste them.  

Service was nice and friendly, but it was mostly young servers.  Complimentary limoncello and amaretto were offered as after-dinner drinks, which was a nice touch.   

Now for the detractions.  First, the prices are pretty steep for a suburban strip mall.  The entrees are all mid-$20s and up, and if you really are going to get three courses as the menu seems to suggest you should do, it would easily be a 50 dollar per person bill (excluding drinks).  Even the pasta half-portions were 15 bucks or so, which as a second course is steep.   The food quality probably justifies the prices, but it can be a surprise for someone looking for more economical options.  Maybe all the Cherry Hills crowd can afford dropping $100 per couple for dinner, but for most of us it&#39;s a reach to pay that much when the next place over is a Pancake House.   Second, the location and ambience of the place feels pretty suburban strip mall; there&#39;s something cheap and Pottery Barn to the decor, maybe it&#39;s the cheap lighting.  The bathroom door is very close to some of the tables, and the size of the restaurant is so small, everyone can see when you make your way to the toilet.  It certainly is not going to impress a date.     

Finally, I also found it odd that the namesake wooden table in the middle of the restaurant never had anyone sitting at it.  We came in late for dinner, so I thought maybe that they would offer us the community table to liven up the place, but they didn&#39;t.  It sat empty the whole night.   So the wooden table is really a dead space in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by the all the other tables of eaters.  Kind of defeats the purpose, doesn&#39;t it?"

We went based on Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews. Not only was the food superb but the service provided by Jordan was exquisite. The variety of ingredients was unusual for what is essentially an Italian themed restaurant.  Rabbit, duck, venison, lamb and lobster to mention a few. We went on a Monday and were lucky to get in without a reservation.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got there for lunch date. I did my pre-dining scouting on their website and of course the menus. I am a huge fan of sweetbreads and I noticed that they had them on their dinner appetizer menu. They indulged my sweetbread fetish by allowing me to request this item off the dinner menu. Awesomeness!
The salad and sandwiches were packed with flavor and definetely not lacking in portion size.

Well prepared foods, but sort of a boring menu. The service was good. The wine list was heavy on chards/SB blends and medium body Italians. Their menu deserves a good Syrah or a Zin option.

The food was outstanding - the service not-so-much. Being the seasoned Yelper, I did my homework and read the reviews. We forged ahead. The place is small and loud but comfortable. We had reservations and were seated as soon as a table was available. We were told that our waiter Ramon would be with us shortly and shared that he is an expert at the wine list. Turns out that&#39;s all he was interested in. Once we passed on ordering wine - he lost the love. We had to ask for several items more than once and when the check came he hovered until a credit card appeared and snatched it up like a hawk. 

We&#39;ll be back for the yummy food. We&#39;ll just make sure our reservations are for another section. I had the ravioli and it was spectacular! My sister had the mussels and she really liked them. This place is a gem in the burbs - just steer clear of the wine expert!"

However, consistent with other reviews on here, the service is always slow, and not only when it is packed. Last Saturday I waited 40 minutes for 3 tacos when there was only about 6 people in front of me in line (that is a very short line for the Saturday crowd at torchys which often goes out the entrance). There was  only one food runner consistently delivering food, and she looked stressed out of her mind! You would think given all the feedback on Yelp they would have more people running food.

Also the bar could benefit from placing orders right after they get them, as they have forgotten tacos in my orders twice now."

You can order drinks at the counter and the bar will bring them to you- how convenient I thought. No. When we received our chips and queso about 10 minutes after sitting down I asked our food runner if he could check on our margaritas. He said thats the bars job to bring them, but Ill check.  I watched him walk right past the bar and continue to run other peoples food. Ok, whatever we can wait a little longer. Received our food after about 15 minutes run by the same food runner. He said &#34; oh you still haven&#39;t gotten your margaritas&#34; Nope.  Basically finished our meal and still no margaritas in site. We had probably been there for at least 45 minutes.

I went up to the manager to explain situation and asked if he could take it off our bill since we were basically done eating and didn&#39;t wan&#39;t them. He took them off right away and even took a little bit extra off our check, which he didn&#39;t have to do.

I would hope with the high volume this place receives it could hone down on its service a bit more to be a little more efficient. I think I would try a bunch more places before coming back, but not ruling this place out for good."

The tacos are amazing! The brushfire taco is my fav! The diablo sauce is aptly named so if you don&#39;t like spice, be careful. The sauce comes on the side so you can put on as little or as much as you like. Queso is one of my favorite foods in the world and I have been having withdrawals for the five years that I have lived in Colorado. Torchy&#39;s queso is so great and is definitely the reason I keep coming back.

The downside with this place is the staff. They are inconsistent, not helpful, not friendly, and overall do a poor job. Sometimes they have call ahead phone orders and sometimes they don&#39;t (and they are very rude when explaining this, with no rationale). I would really like to see more consistency and improvements with the staff (it would be a 5 star place if the service improved). IMO the food is worth the long line (which is a given so expect to wait), but there is no excuse for rude, unknowledgeable service. I thought it was just an issue when they first opened (totally understandable with a new restaurant), but it hasn&#39;t improved."

DECOR: spacious and well-lit dining area with 2 bars and multiple flat screen for watching sports.  It&#39;s very modern and minimalistic.  

FOOD: we had the Baja shrimp, chick &#39;n and the Democrat tacos along with some chips and salsa.  The pickled onions in the shrimp taco definitely got some heat.  The poblano sauce was a bit intense for the spice level.  I liked the option for corn/flour tortilla.  Pretty average chips and salsa.  The Lil&#39; nookies was very crunchy when you bite into it and then the gooey chocolate center just melts in your mouth - delightful!

SERVICE: average for counter service.  Our server did seemed unsure of our orders when she brought out the food and we had to confirm with her.

VERDICT: I&#39;ve had better tacos than this in Denver!  I did like the spacious dining area, 2 bars and plenty of seating for large groups.  They need to have better signage for the Happy Hour menu.  I thought the price applies to food as well but it was just for beer.  And not all their beers listed on the HH menu are $2 as advertised."

With so many Texas transplants in CO, I can see the appeal of Torchy&#39;s Tacos. For me, it was an A-OK. 

FOOD: Brushfire and Democrat. I got these two based on a friend&#39;s recommendation (UT Austin fellow, Hook &#39;Em!) and must say that I was not as impressed as I would have liked have been. With so much hype by my friends in CO, I was hoping for something a bit different or more traditional Mexican. The meat was not as flavored as I would have hoped (where&#39;s the grill taste, smokiness, the rich meaty taste) and really was the salsa that carried the dish through. Also, where are all the vegetables and extra lime to cut through the meat taste? One lime is not sufficient! I wish the portion was smaller and the meat was more flavored to give it that umph taste that I know Mexican and Tex-Mex food can have and then I can try a larger variety. 

SERVICE: A little slower than I thought it would have been, but nothing to gripe about! 

Overall, maybe I&#39;m used to California-Mexican food now. Maybe I&#39;m pickier when it comes to my Mexican-American food. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I know Torchy&#39;s could deliver a better punch to such a wonderful cuisine."

Was driving by Torchy&#39;s, wasn&#39;t hungry but had to stop.  Line was short, menu looked good but I came for one thing...brisket.

I ordered and took my seat in anticipation,  and waited.   And waited.  Then waited some more. Let&#39;s get this straight, I ordered TWO tacos. TWO!!! It was a solid 25 minutes until I received them.  Waaaaaay to slow during down time at a place like this.

The food you ask?  The brisket taco came with jalapenos, shredded white cheese, cilantro and avacoado wedge.  It was a good size taco ( bigger than Fuzzys but twice the price) and it was good.  The brisket was good but a little over cooked.  But this is a good taco.

A really great combination would be if Torchy&#39;s used feta cheese like Fuzzys with the brisket or if Fuzzys used the avocado wedge like Torchy&#39;s. Which is a great touch.  I guess you can&#39;t have it all.  But one thing is for sure, the service on this day was much too slow in spite of getting me a very good taco."

The wait to get the food was a different story and took about 15 minutes to get our order, but I don&#39;t  mind waiting for them to put together fresh ingredients and a tasty product.  

I ordered the Democrat which was shredded beef, cheese, onions and avocado served with a side of their homemade salsa.  I also ordered the street corn which had a nice flavor of sweet from the corn and smoky with the chipotle cream.  To top things off, I ordered a side of black retried beans which was on point.  My god, those beans were so smooth, creamy and perfectly seasoned!

My husband ordered the Democrat, Trashy Trailer Park with fried chicken and a poblano cream sauce and the Crossroads which was a beef brisket taco.  He said he&#39;d order the Trashy Trailer Park all day next time.  

So that&#39;s a lot of food, right?   We can&#39;t possibly eat anymore, right?   WRONG.  We ended the meal with an order of Lil&#39; Nookies.  OMG, who knew deep fried chocolate chip cookie dough rolled in corn flakes could b so good.

Luckily, the line when I arrived wasn&#39;t too long. By the time I left, it was out the door..and tables were much harder to come by. 
Started with the chips and mild salsa. Chips were ok-you could tell they were made in house and fresh, but they definitely could&#39;ve been warmer. I will say, I don&#39;t know what it was, but I loved the salsa. Like really loved it. Probably the best part of my meal. 

I ordered the democrat and the green chile pork-and both were just ok..I feel like the meat lacked flavor. I&#39;ve had tacos where you can tell they marinade their meat and really spice it up, and it&#39;s a flavorgasm when you bite into it. These were just alright-some flavor, but not enough to be out-the-door-line good. I did like the side of salsa verde. 

If I bought anything here, I&#39;d go back for the salsa. It was full of the flavor that the rest of my meal lacked."

All we really need are two, small, corn tortillas, a decent filling, onions, cilantro, and a nice salsa on the side. 

We had heard about Torchy&#39;s for awhile, and finally had the opportunity to try them this past weekend:

1. As a principle, we always order chips and salsa with our meals, and we thought the chips were unusually excellent. The salsa was good, but on the hotter side, and came out in a large bowl - almost a tureen! 

2. The tacos are large. Their tortillas are equal to two &#34;traditional&#34; tacos, which is a good thing, but just remember that one taco is probably good for a snack, and two tacos is pretty damn filling. Or maybe chips and salsa, and one taco is a good meal. 

3. We tried the Brushfire, which looked really different with jerk chicken and mango (!!!), and it was hot and tasty. The best part of this taco, in my opinion, was the side of the Diablo salsa, which is hot, but not in a melt-your-face-off kind of way. I actually used it in all my tacos.

4. The Fried Avocado was good, but didn&#39;t blow our minds. Again, lots of filling, but a tasty combination of ingredients. 

5. The most disappointing taco was the one we thought we would love the best - the Democrat. Usually, I am all about shredded beef, but my girlfriend was disgusted to find not one, but TWO large chunks beef fat in the taco. I get that fat is savory, but not huge chunks in a taco. 

All in all, I would definitely return and try their other creations, but I think the tacos are hit or miss. What works are the extras: the Maine Root soft drinks; the portions; the space and décor; the quickness of food brought to the table; and of course, the chips and salsa :)"

Being from Houston, this is the closest thing that Denver has to quality tacos. I would recommend ordering or calling ahead to place your order because it can get really crowded. The staff is always super helpful and nice; they know the menu well and everything on the menu is cheap! Also, you get a lot of food for the price, one taco filled me up and I eat a lot!

I really enjoyed the migas taco for breakfast and then I got a pork one for lunch and my total was $6 so your money goes pretty far there. They have a good happy hour as well so I would absolutely check this place out if you like yummy tacos!"

I had just finished having a wonderful massage with Bradley at Chasing the Wind and since Torchy&#39;s was right across the street (with free parking), and I was hungry, decided to try them.

The place was vibrant and packed. There was already a line but it was moving quickly and liked the fact they had menus right at the front of the line so I was able to quickly give my order when it was my turn. They have 6 salsas to choose from so don&#39;t forget to order the one&#39;s you want at the front counter. I chose the Roja and that was yummy!

The cashier was friendly and efficient. I ordered the Green Chile Pork with a flour tortilla and The Independent with a corn tortilla.  I was given a number and sat down at a small table and my order was brought out within 5 minutes.

Both tacos were huge and freakingly delicious!! The location kept getting more and more people but it was organized chaos. They also offer margaritas, the usual sodas and tea to choose from. I like they have a roll of aluminum foil where you can take items you haven&#39;t eaten home to enjoy later.

They have a full bar and you can order by phone or online to skip the lines. All in all, a very good lunch experience at a good price!"

The tacos vary (both in ingredients and taste), but I appreciate a place that takes chances on flavor combinations.  Sometimes you lose, but sometimes you win big in tasty new taco!

Was a little busy after they first opened, but now it has calmed down and is definitely a good spot to stop by for some tacos and drinks."

I visited this place after a Rookies game a Sunday night. While the overall appearance of restaurant looked great, the food presentation was a huge disappointment. I understand the restaurant was quite busy but that shouldn&#39;t be an excuse to just throw stuff on a plate. 

Service wasn&#39;t that friendly. Even sitting in the bar it felt that their goal was to get you out of there as soonest as possible.

Food has potential. I ordered 2 different tacos and the taste was not bad a at all but since my plate was a huge mess; it was really hard to understand what I was eating."

On my first visit I was picking up breakfast tacos for the office. I was able to call in the order the day before and arrange a time for pick up. When I arrived at 7:15am, our agreed upon time, everything was ready. The tacos were individually wrapped in tin foil and stored in a disposable aluminum container, and they had included tons of individually packaged sauces in a bag. Everyone at the office was happy that day!

The second time, we wandered over for lunch. This bleeding heart liberal went with The Republican and the Trailer Park. Both were excellent, and my leftovers heated up well hours later. 

Staff have always been friendly, and prices are great. I will definitely be back."

Had to try the new Denver location. I tried to visit on opening weekend but it was a madhouse so I left. Good choices. Tasty. It is hype. But delicious. Super busy at this location. Always a line. Young hipster crowd. Loud environment. 

Long wait in line to order. Long wait for the food. I recommend calling ahead. The people next to us had problems with their tacos, a human hair inside, and had to send them back. So there were hushed raised voices. But they got refunded.

The corn tortillas basically disintegrated and fell apart making for a messy meal. The sauce selection is good. The Diabolo sauce is yum and hot. Sweating hot.

Free parking lot. Lucky enough to find a spot despite how busy it was. They must get a lot of foot traffic due to the great location on Broadway. 

Overall a good place. Comparable fare to local businesses founded in Colorado. I am glad I came. You&#39;ll be glad you did as well. Try it."

I double checked my receipt in case I overestimated and nope. It took this long. There was no warning of the long wait when placing the order, and there were many frustrated customers dining in and getting take out that were also waiting too long. I felt bad for the servers who had to bear the weight of the complaints. They checked on everyone&#39;s order multiple times and still no sign of our food. Then when I got my food, I took it to go and found out later that they got part of my order wrong. Too late for me to go all the way back and too hungry to chance the wait time again. 

3 stars - Dirty Sanchez Taco. Scrambled eggs with a fried poblano chile, guacamole, escabeche carrots and shredded cheese. Served with poblano sauce on a corn tortilla. The filling is generous for the taco and it&#39;s a big size taco. I think one would have filled me up nicely. This was like a breakfast taco, which I was looking for. Sometimes you just get that craving for breakfast for dinner. 

2 stars - The Independent Taco. Hand battered and fried portobello mushroom strips with refried black beans, roasted corn, escabeche carrots, quest fresco, cilantro, and avocado. Drizzled with ancho aioli on a corn tortilla. Too salty. The mushroom must have had a heavy handed sprinkling of salt before it got out in the taco. 

2 stars - Rice and beans. I found this to be salty too. The rice was a little undercooked to me too. 

Overall, the food is just not worth it for the long wait. If you&#39;re looking to try take out here, maybe call in your order and then use the wait time to do something productive before picking up your food."

Torchy&#39;s has a great vibe - I&#39;ve also been here for a bday dinner, for pre-softball grub and it&#39;s consistently good - the best part is trying all the tacos.. sooner or later you&#39;ll find one that you can&#39;t get enough of!"

I kept hearing from friends who had been to Torchy&#39;s in Texas and swear by it. Of course between that and the fact that it is a taco place, I had to go! I studied the menu before we arrived. Even after studying the whole menu, I couldn&#39;t decide on which tacos I wanted.  We arrived around 9:20 in the morning and boy am I glad that we did. The line became horrendous after we ordered.  Got there right in time! There were 3 of us and we decided to share the well known queso and chips. That queso is legit! Not only is it gooey queso, but it was filled with green chile! We ate every last bit before our tacos arrived.  I could have licked the bowl.

I ended up going with the Democrat (barbacoa taco), the chicken fajita taco and the fried avocado. My favorite was the fried avocado. I was told that these tacos were like street tacos, so I figured between the queso and the 3 tacos, I would be full.  LIARS! They are much larger than street tacos.  They are jam packed full. I could only eat a half of each of the tacos. I now know 2 are my max.

My words of advice: 1. If you like avocados get a fried avocado taco. 2. Get there early to avoid waiting in line forever. 3. Don&#39;t order too many, or be ready to eat a ton of leftovers. 4. Sit at the bar before ordering.  They take your taco and drink order and you can avoid the line. You&#39;re welcome!"

We didn&#39;t wait more than ten minutes in line and were lucky to find a table being vacated as we were looking to sit - the place was packed (around 6pm on a Tuesday). The one girl at the cash register was the most miserable, unhappy cashier I&#39;ve come across in recent memory - despite us being upbeat and cheerful towards her. She soured the initial experience. The other people working there seemed pleasant enough - perhaps she&#39;s just not suited to running the register. 

The portions were massive and the queso was good. I&#39;d come back for the queso. The tacos were okay, but the Trailer Park was crazy (unpleasantly) salty. The salsas were okay, but lacked spice. My margarita was pretty good. 

It honestly didn&#39;t live up to the hype. Definitely not worth waiting 30+ minutes in line, in my opinion."

The food:
Great tacos! Tons of variety - and the portions are huge. I haven&#39;t had a bad taco - breakfast or lunch/dinner varieties. Two tacos are definitely enough for me - and I always ask for corn tortillas instead of flour. If I had access to a Torchy&#39;s in my city, I&#39;d be in trouble.

The experience:
There is ample free parking. You walk in, order at the counter, and they carry your food out to you. There was a bar though (with a bartender behind it) but I&#39;m not sure if he can take food orders too.

The atmosphere:
This restaurant feels much cooler than any other Torchy&#39;s I&#39;ve ever been to! It&#39;s beautiful, modern, large. And has a beautiful bar! There are also garage doors to create a patio-like space when the weather is warm."

We were very excited to have the Denver location and it feels like they just think people will just a come even when the food sucks.  
We ate there this afternoon and with a very empty restaurant @ 3 PM on a Saturday, we waited over 40 minutes for our food... And when it arrived it was terrible.  The tortillas were so dry they were crumbling in our hands.. The salmon was dry and crusty and the temperature overall seemed like it had been sitting in the kitchen for 20 minutes waiting.

The restaurant temperature was set at about 50 degrees with ice cold air blowing, that it felt warmer on a fall day to be outside.  I asked if the air could be turned down and was told no.  

The only positive thing about this experience was the delicious Michelada- made by a very nice bartender Josh.  

If this were my first time at Torchys it would definitely be my last.. But I&#39;m hoping this was an anomaly that can be corrected."

My daughter had the chicken strips kids meal with the fried avocado bites. The space is pretty neat. They have a bar as well and there were plenty of folks imbibing while we were there. My tacos were so dang good! The dirty sanchez (eggs, fried poblano, guacamole, escabeche carrots).. Yum, Yum, Yum.. So good!

I was super impressed with the decor. It was completely beautiful. The perfect mix of modern/flashy/eclectic without overdoing it. I was a little skeptical - I thought torchys would be another hipster overpriced taco joint but I was pleasantly surprised.

What can I say? Tacos are amazing! Kind of tough to screw them up unless you over cook the meat or over spice them. What I loved at Torchys were the veggie options! YES! FINALLY someone thinks of the grazers of the world. VEGETARIAN REFRIED BEANS! Thank you you wonderful Torchy chefs for thinking of this!

That being said, 2 tacos will fill you up. 3 and you are in a food coma. The guacamole is fresh to death and the corn was off the charts buttttt a too much for one person to consume. 

Do I even need to say the selection of beer is awesome as well? This is Denver after all. 

Pro-tips: this place is uber popular so expect to wait BUT, seats at the bar get you full service so keep an eye out!

Cons: parking. Blah. Street, meters, and tow away zones. Be prepared to search."

The hype had gotten to me, so I finally broke down and went on day when the line was reasonable. The selection is pretty good, and the naming of the tacos was cute. I got a Pork Green Chile and a &#39;democrat&#39; taco. Both descriptions sounded good, but they were just so-so. The &#39;democrat&#39; was filled with beef, and it was a little dry and over cooked. Stringy is what I would say. The Pork Green Chile was moist and tasty, but I didn&#39;t really get the green chile flavor. Again, so-so.

The drink policy there is weird. You can&#39;t order a drink if you one in front of you. If you don&#39;t like what you ordered, you can&#39;t order another one until you either finish, bring it back or dump it. There are many times when I order a beer, and it&#39;s not that good, but after a different beer, the first one tastes better. I can&#39;t explain it but if you&#39;ve ever had a &#39;flight&#39; of beer, and didn&#39;t like one, but came back to it later and it tasted better, you know what I mean.

Being a fan of Moontown I was sad to see it go, but I heard Torchy&#39;s was very similar. It definitely is, but more packed. I&#39;m not sure why there is a line out the door. Don&#39;t get me wrong the tacos are good, but they aren&#39;t great. They lack spice and flavor like an authentic taco would have. I get that these are non-traditional tacos, but the salsas were not hot and lacked flavor. 

We tried the Barbacoa which was filled to the brim with meat, the Pork Carnitas which was less full, but essentially the same taco, the &#34;trashy&#34; taco, and a Veggie with the fried mushrooms. I think the street corn was the best item we had, gave me a fond reminder of Moontower * sigh * 

The atmosphere is one of a Chipotle &#34;slow fast food&#34; which is great if your looking for a fast meal, even though it likely won&#39;t be that fast because of the lines. Once the hype slows down I think this will be more of a quick fix for you taco lovers. Until then, I don&#39;t think its exactly worth the wait. Check out Pinche&#39;s on Colfax- a little more authentic and sit down. 

I&#39;ll give it another try once the lines die down."

My business associate and I met there early, knowing how crazy busy this place gets, and one of us even scored a parking space in their lot (yessss!).

We waited in a short line, which was fine, because we had time to peruse the menu. I had the Green Chile Pork and the Fried Avocado tacos. The pork was really yummy!! Will probably pass on the fried avocado one next time, and try something different next time. My business associate had a Republican, a Crossroads, and a Brushfire, and she enjoyed them all. She was able to get them all on corn tortillas instead of flour to adapt to her gluten-free diet, which was really great! We also ordered the queso and some chips and salsa. The chips could be better (perhaps I&#39;m wrong, but I believe they&#39;re pre-made out of a bag and I love me some homemade chips), but the queso is pretty tasty. The salsa? Meh. Not a lot of flavor and not much spice. 

The service here is really amazing. Everyone is super friendly and despite them being really busy by the time we sat down and got our food, the manager still found time to come around and say hello and check in, as did another higher-up. They also had a couple of other employees helping bus tables, which was nice. Overall, it was a very pleasant visit, and I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Torchys Tacos to Austin is what I imagine that Illegal Pete&#39;s is to Colorado, which is to say that it&#39;s kind of a big deal.

But I encourage you to wait at least a few weeks.

I got lucky, and was able to get inside on the line.  To the far back, but I figured it would be about as long as Illegal Pete&#39;s/Qdoba/Chipotle.  No, took about fifteen minutes to get to the front, and an additional fifteen to get my tacos.  When I left, the line was out the door, and about twenty people deeper.  Crazy.

The tacos are very good.  Slightly bigger than a street taco, but very flavorful.  If you want to seem like a Torchys elitist, look up the SECRET MENU.  I asked the cashier, and she&#39;s well aware of it too.  

Good stuff, but do not wait half an hour guys.  With a few more locations opening up this year, it&#39;ll be good."

I ordered the fried avocado on a corn tortilla and a trashy trailer park on flour. They were delicious. The soft, warm avocado was amazing. The trashy trailer park taco was everything I&#39;d hoped it to be from the many reviews I read about it. The menu had several more offerings that caught my eye, so I hope to return to try them.

The only negative point was the cashier. I paid in cash and handed her a large bill and said I&#39;ve got the change. I got the change out of my pocket and handed it to her, and she said she&#39;d entered it as a whole dollar amount and she handed me back my coins. She started to count out the change and I explained to her that I&#39;ll just give her all the change in exchange for a one dollar bill. She then closed the drawer and said &#34;sorry, I just closed the drawer.&#34; I feel sorry for the poor girl when life hands her something more complicated than 28 cents to deal with."

Six tacos at $27.00. Ouch. The salsa was amazing that they included with them (cilantro heavy, yum!), but the tacos themselves were disappointing for the money.

If you are looking for tacos in Denver then your options are moderately limited. Not many places are solely committed to tacos. When you order tacos in Denver you often order it from an establishment that doesn&#39;t specialize in the food.

Torchys specializes in tacos, and you can tell. You can tell based on the variety and the taste. If you are a taco lover, than give this place a try."

It&#39;s like Denver&#39;s never seen tacos before...geez.

Well to be fair, Torchy&#39;s makes a damn fine taco. I remember them from my days in Austin, where Torchy&#39;s was among the many (though certainly not the best) Texas-style taco joints. I preferred Las Manitas, Porfirio&#39;s or Juan in a Million. But Torchy&#39;s was good for late-night after-bar tacos or a nice morning breakfast tacos (which is far superior to Denver&#39;s ubiquitous breakfast burritos in my opinion).

Torchy&#39;s rarely had a very long line and was always a pretty quick meal.

For some reason it&#39;s always a long line here. It was so long last time that I nearly missed my lunch hours standing in line.

But again damn if that taco ain&#39;t delicious. I especially like their breakfast tacos...everthing from the simple bacon, egg and cheese to the migas. They have a great migas, served with avocado, tomatillo sauce and corn tortilla crunchiness. I would love it if they also had a red-chile sauce migas, but the tomatillo is distinctly tart and wonderful in combination with the rest of the ingredients.

The rest of the tacos are also great...love the Dirty Sanchez, the Baja Shrimp, the Democrat. Though I have to say some of the &#34;BBQ&#34; style tacos I don&#39;t care for as much.

Service for me at this place has been a bit spotty. I&#39;ve gotten the wrong taco two of my three visits. And the way they do the service here, makes it kind of complicated/awkward to get it fixed, though to their credit they did it each time

And maybe I am impatient, but I don&#39;t care to wait in line for tacos. But sometimes when the taco craving hits, you simply must."

Parking here can be difficult depending on how busy the place is. My friend and I came here around 4:30p and it was still a decent crowd in here.

You go up to the counter to order before seating yourself. Maybe it&#39;s because this place gets busy, the cashier seemed a bit impatient at my indecisiveness when ordering. My friend and I ended up sharing a queso dip with chorizo &amp; chips and I ordered a Mr. Orange taco. Each taco ranges from 3-5 dollars depending on what you get. 

The chips and dip came out pretty quickly after we sat down, but our tacos came out about 20 minutes later after (we only ordered one each). Overall the food is decent, but the service can definitely use some improvement."

Right after we entered Torchy&#39;s, the line went out the door! That&#39;s how popular this place is. It took a little while to get to the counter, since the place was packed, but as soon as we got there, the server was friendly and quick to get our orders. 

I ordered the Queso and Chips (which were amazing), a Democrat taco (shredded Barbacoa), a Brushfire taco (Jamaican Jerk chicken), and a Grande Burrito (What can I say? Our Brunch plans got canceled and I was starving!). My wife ordered the Mr. Pink (seared ahi-tuna), and the Baja Shrimp tacos. Needless to say, all of the tacos were superb! 

They also have a full service bar, where you can sit and order food, without having to stand in line. Which works great if you don&#39;t have kids, and need a little hair of the dog to go along with your tacos! The Bloody Mary I had was great and it only cost $3! 

This is a great place for a quick meal, as well as a Sunday Brunch with the family. Torchy&#39;s is opening locations in Greenwood Village and Stapleton, which means that I can get my taco cravings during the week!"

There really isn&#39;t anything special here, besides the large amount of options. I&#39;ve had plenty of better street tacos at dumpy little hole in the walls.

Every time I come, I try to order something different, working my way down the menu. The taco of the month is usually my favorite, but you seriously cannot go wrong with any of them. My personal favorite is the trailer park, the fried chicken is amazing. 
The Broadway location always had a line out the door and for good reasons, but it goes fast. I try and sit at the bar when I come, usually for brunch and able to always grab a seat. There is ample seating and I love the bar in the middle that wraps around the middle.

I&#39;ve also had a couple tacos where the potatoes were very gritty, which was gross. However, I&#39;ve been back more and now I love it! I now get the Migas or Dirty Sanchez, and they are great. The queso is excellent (though I wish they offered a small side of it, as a full order is huge and I&#39;d love to order a small queso with my taco). And the refried beans are my favorite beans around. Some reviews state that it&#39;s way overpriced--really? I don&#39;t get any tacos with meat, but the veggie ones are around $3.50 and are huge, so if I get two it&#39;s plenty, and that&#39;s only $7 for a meal!"

The taco was pretty disappointing. Now, know that I got carryout....so that possibly had something to do with it. It was just kind of bland and the tortilla was not good. It was also really sloppily packaged and falling apart when I opened it. I even went during a time when they weren&#39;t busy, thinking that might help.

I also tried the Trailer Park and got it trashy as recommended, except I don&#39;t think there was any queso?

And what a great line it will be! Clearly, Mexico has financed this line. Nice work, Torchys, for taking it and making it your own.

That said, I only dared to wait in this line once, and this review is the tale of that complex journey. Rating this establishment isn&#39;t easy. Yes, the food is good. And if that were the only criterion, that&#39;d make it an easy assessment. But what about the menu, sold-out tacos, slow service, prices and that abominable line? The food is good, but it&#39;s not without flaw. Heavy ingredients seem to be paired with even more calorically dense ingredients. Yes, you can get a bright-tasting citrusy taco, but who the hell wants to order a heart-clogger? I&#39;m sure the demand is there, but I don&#39;t view restaurants that serve novelty food through the same lens.

When it comes down to it, though, the tacos buoyed my review of this place. There&#39;s a lot to dislike about this place, but the tacos aren&#39;t one of them. Hopefully, once the hype dies down, Torchys will be able to keep the momentum that&#39;s clearly been generated by their food (and not anything else, because really there isn&#39;t much else they&#39;re able to offer diners).

Go to Torchys. Try the tacos."

Have to say, I was not impressed (there are a lot of way better taco joints in Denver).

I&#39;m writing this review a few weeks after my visit, and honestly, the food was so  unmemorable, that I don&#39;t even remember what we ordered... One was a tuna taco and I think the other was called &#34;the democrat&#34; (I should have known based on the name alone that I wouldn&#39;t like it). My friend had two tacos also, and one of them had something so spicy on it, that when he bit into it he started turning red and I thought for a moment he was choking! (Bartender gave him no warning that the taco was unbearably hot when he ordered it)

My friend and I sat at the bar, which if you do checkout Torchy&#39;s, is definitely the &#34;way to go&#34; because then you can by-pass the huge line at the front and just place your food order directly with the bartender.

The tacos here are big... So if you want quantity over quality, this may be the right place for you.

They had a few beers on special $2 Lone Star bottles and Modelo cans. We started off with their queso and guacamole. The guac was super yummy, nice and fresh &amp; light - I specifically remember the cilantro in it. The queso was ok, I&#39;ve had better. Probably won&#39;t re order it if/when I return. 

They have quite a selection of tacos, ranging from about $2-$5 per taco. I had the trailer park taco - trashy style. It was delish!

The tacos I&#39;ve eaten so far have been superb..well almost. I can do without the brushfire because jamaican jerk doesn&#39;t have a place inside a taco. But the green chile pork/trailer park tacos are ridic. And get em&#39; trashy cuz well queso on everything is always a good choice.

What so I see is a brand new Torchys...now I&#39;m all about trying local places but I had to see how this Austin chain would be all the way up in Denver. Final verdict..amazing! Being the new thing in town I hear the line can get very long. We came at around 10ish on a Friday night and there wasn&#39;t a line. We ordered at the counter and sat at the bar. I didn&#39;t know this but you could have ordered at the bar..so something to think of when there is a line. 

Now the only Torchys I&#39;ve been to was the one near UT Austin and it&#39;s a small honestly near dive taco shop. This one in Denver is amazingly beautiful...super big and nice. Plus there is a huge bar!

I can&#39;t remember all the tacos we had but we tried their shrimp special and the trailer trash. Drinks were really good and this turned out to be a great night.

The chips and queso were tasty, but anything cheese related is arguably hard to fumble.  Ordered the Green Chili Pork taco, the Republican taco, and the Beef Fajita taco.  The corn tortillas were dry and overly delicate and the contents of each of the tacos was average at best.  

While I&#39;m certainly not one to complain about getting too much food, the size of the tacos made them hard to manage. Not feeling like the corn tortillas were worth the calories or the effort, I resigned myself to eating the inside contents with a fork.  

I will say that the service was decent.  We sat at the bar and the place was packed.  However, in the future I&#39;d opt for Machete or Los Chingones when I&#39;m in the market for some bomb a** tacos.  I feel their creations are more unique, tasty, and manageable."

I do have to say that the tacos haven&#39;t been as amazing as our experiences in Austin (either a bit dry, or a bit too salty), and I was a bit disappointed that the queso here doesn&#39;t come with chorizo like it does in Austin.

Recocmendation: get the fried avocado taco, and make any taco &#39;trashy&#39; and get their delicious queso on top. SO good!"

I had tried to go to Torchy&#39;s a couple times before I finally got to order some food. I went at 9:00 am on a Sunday and the parking lot was still full and this place was poppin. All I wanted was some queso. That queso was the bomb. I am glad I ordered a fried avocado taco too. I figured since it&#39;ll take me a few months to get back in and have a taco again. The building itself is beautiful. Service is good. I really want to try it when the hype dies down so that I can really enjoy my time there. I&#39;m glad they are opening more locations in Denver so this one can hopefully die down a bit."

Your tacos rock(o)! Many combos from which to choose, I&#39;m not sure that there is a way to lose.

Salsa so flavorful and with a bit of spice. Eating their salsa with chips is very nice!

Great ambiance and a fun vibe too! Going to Torchy&#39;s will cure your blues."

We decided to try picking the tacos up because we miss Moontower. I don&#39;t care if they borrowed ideas from Torchys, because they did them better and the ideas were pretty much just &#39;tacos&#39;.

Last time I had a horrendous experience with decent tacos and excellent queso. This time, we picked up the order, still pretty miserable and loud inside but I didn&#39;t have to be there as long. We got a democrat and it was dry and flavorless, both kinds of fish tacos completely fell apart and had to be eaten with a fork (&#39;mediocre&#39; she says), and the fourth was something with fried chicken, but it was ice cold. Disgusting.

If you don&#39;t want to make tacos then don&#39;t be a taco place. Just be a margarita place. Those exist, you know? They&#39;re called bars. Think of this as a loud bar filled with Texans and lousy tacos."

The restaurant was moderately packed. We ordered our food and it was delivered relatively quickly. The iced tea is fresh and they have a great choice of pure cane sodas to drink. We got an order of chips and guacamole, very fresh and tasty with a hint of cilantro. Our tacos were delicious. The tortillas tasted freshly made (a major win). The salsas that came with our tacos were great and we got a couple others to try--terrific!!!  I overheard a manager talk to a potential employee about standing room only Friday through Sunday. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s good or bad seeing that most people will want to sit to eat tacos (great for business, but they might want to increase the size of their restaurant to accommodate the crowds).

All the breakfast taco&#39;s I&#39;ve had have been very underwhelming and basically all egg. I wish they would put more steak/brisket on them.

Ace of Spades from the secret menu was one of the worst things i&#39;ve ever eaten. Sounded delicious but something was just off about it. The bartender told me after it a lot of other people didn&#39;t like it as well. Wish I would have known that before I ordered.

Moontower wasn&#39;t my favorite but maybe I am bias because I had the originals from torchy&#39;s before trying Moontower. So needless to say I have been anticipating the opening of torchy&#39;s for quite some time.

I had it today and was very pleased that they offered the same tacos and everything tasted the same!!! I know I will get ridiculed for this in Denver but here it goes...I&#39;m happiest about the fact that they don&#39;t want to drown everything on the menu in green chili!!!

Breakfast Recommendations:
Sausage, egg and cheese.
Bean, cheese and bacon.
Flour tortillas only

Lunch/Dinner Recommendations:
Strawberry/Mango Swirl Margarita (only $4)
Baja shrimp
Green Chile Pulled Pork
Beef or Chicken fajita
Street corn is a must (just order it and thank me later)"

Naturally, I went.  Today.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into which was both good and bad.  Bad because I did not give myself nearly enough time to stand in line and get back in a reasonable amount of time.  Good because the tacos were a delicious medley of flavors dancing on my tongue.

My first toe dip into their menu was the fried avocado taco and the fried mushroom taco.  I love the idea of a mushroom taco and can&#39;t say that I have ever seen that before.  As such that was my preferred taco of the two.  I would have preferred a corn tortilla for both but will ask for that next time.

What I should have got was the smoked brisket taco with jalepenos.  I cannot remember the name but I tried a sample of the meat from a co-workers taco and wow.  So good."

The food? It&#39;s great. Honestly, no complaints. The queso is great; it has guacamole and one of their hot sauces, so it&#39;s creamy and great when stirred together. The tacos I&#39;ve had have all been good (with the exception of the chorizo breakfast taco - pretty bland). I really enjoy the Trailer Park trashy-style: fried chicken and more of the queso.

Unfortunately, the service is often God-awful. I&#39;ve been waiting in the line and seen four people at the register, yet only one actually helping us. And you can sit at the bar like I did today, but it&#39;s often no better. Today we ordered, got our drinks and queso... And then the bartender vanished. After 30 minutes of my drink being empty, I flagged down another bartender. Note that he was near us the whole time and also never checked on us, but when I waved at him and mentioned we&#39;d been abandoned, he said he was just about to check on us. Nice try, but I&#39;ve been a server and I could see you actively trying to avoid us.

In short, go for the tacos, but only if you don&#39;t mind being ignored and taking three times as long as you should. The lines here are only half due to popularity, after all."

The tacos were good, not overly amazing but good.  They had a great selection of strange and unusual fillings, fried portabello mushroom, egg, sausage, jerk chicken, etc.  I had the Democrat, one of the few typical or normal tacos.  It was super yummy, lots of flavors- lots of sauces and meaty goodness. def. will come back for that.  I had the fried avocado, but it was not all that.  I was not crazy about the lack of meat, and   I missed the contrast of meat and veggies.      I tried a lot, we are a sharing family, and I can not wait to come when the newness has worn down a bit and try it again.  

It was a bit crowded, and I feel like when I come when it is not super crowded I will have a much better idea of it is really like.  The service was slow, the tacos were not hot and we did not see our waiter for a while to get sauces and let them know we were missing a taco.  But it is a new place and it is super crowded, so I am sure the quality will go up as the crowd goes down.  

I think the key to ordering and eating here is knowing what you like and what sauces are for you, the only way to do that is to try most things."

I had the chorizo, egg, &amp; cheese taco - so good!  I&#39;m not a huge fan of eggs, but these are the bomb.  They are light and fluffy and they definately didn&#39;t skimp on the chorizo.  And the salsa that comes with it...OMG...so good!  Good smoky flavor, not too spicy, not to mild, just perfect.  Hubby and I are going to have to make a trip to Torchys!"

My friend and I arrived a little before 5pm. The line wasn&#39;t long, just a handful of people ahead of us. We placed our orders and sat down- there were plenty of tables open to choose from. It&#39;s sort of like a taco version of chipotle, if I had to compare it to something. Only difference is they have their own bar. 

I had the ahi tuna taco and the shiitake mushroom taco. Both were pretty tasty. I&#39;m perplexed at the tuna in the Mr. Pink. Still kept medium rare but still lightly breaded and crisped on the outside? Whatevs, good job on that. In fact, kudos.

They do give you the option to choose whether you want a flour or corn tortilla for the tacos you&#39;re ordering. I almost wish they&#39;d just tell you which one it came with, because in all honesty, some tacos taste better on corn, and others on flour. You may definitely go wrong and order the wrong type of tortilla. Just sayin&#39;. 

So we ate and hung out. The longer we stayed, the longer the line got at prime dinner hours. In fact, it went out the door. And yes, I kept track of how quickly it moved. And no, it did not move quickly by any means. Maybe because there are only 3 registers? I think they need to add a couple more before this explodes and ruins the experience for everyone. I, for one, most certainly would not wait in that line to get these tacos. They were pretty good, but not worth waiting for. And in my experience, it&#39;s pretty hard to make a bad taco. 

So here&#39;s my advice to you- if you find yourself craving tacos at off meal times, go ahead and give Torchy&#39;s a try. Otherwise, I&#39;d make it a taco night at home, with all the fixings and invite friends over. It will be just as (if not more) fun."

Went at 1:50pm and it looked like things were slowing down, though still a line of easily 20 people in front of me. I had the Trailer Park, which is the fried chicken taco. I was really delicious and arrived piping hot. Flavorful, crisp, but juicy meat inside.  They put a ranch dressing style sauce on the side that you can add if you like. I really loved it. I also had the chips and salsa.  Salsa was really good, very fresh tasting.  Super pleasant service.

I love the modern, clean design. Looking forward to going back and trying some drinks."

The tacos were OK and pretty big for the price, but nothing special. It was pretty obvious an operation like Torchys leans towards using cheaper mass-produced ingredients, starting with the subpar tortillas and ending with reheated taco fillings. The margaritas were good, but small for the price. The experience made me feel like I was revisiting a school cafeteria, albeit one for wistful hipsters. If that&#39;s your thing, good on you, and have an awesome time waiting in line, suckers!

UPDATE: Tried Torchys again, and it was a bad experience. The Trailer Park taco Trashy style (fried chicken with queso) was pretty tasty. But the Crossroads (brisket) was disappointingly tasteless and the Mr. Pink (says seared tuna but was fried well done) was just plain nasty, like chewy tuna jerky. Ordered the Lil Nookies to try a desert item, that&#39;s fried cookie dough. Someone at the table suggested it tasted like Play-Doh, which then triggered a childhood memory of spitting that salty nastiness out of my mouth when I was age four or five. So if you seek that kind of nostalgia, this place is for you. Never again for me though."

The most recent time in there 4 of us that came in at 8pm on Tuesday, the place was maybe half full.  It took us almost 1 1/2 hours to get 2 tacos each delivered to our table.  We were on the verge of leaving at 30min, but decided we&#39;d stick it our simply to see just how long it actually took and turn it into a game. (Price Is Right Rules; Closest without going over)  I had 77min and came in 2nd. 

The first time I came to Torchy&#39;s it was almost the exact same story, just 15min faster than our 90min marathon this time. 

It gets 3 stars simply because when you eventually do get the tacos they&#39;re great.  Just make sure you don&#39;t have anything to do for 2hrs when you walk in the door since you&#39;ll be waiting most of the time."

The food was incredible and the service was excellent. We all had a great time. I enjoyed the checked Schwartz and my wife had the 2 combo special with chicken and kafta kabob. I also tasted one of my friends lamb entree and the lamb tasted amazing.

The falafel were fried fresh to order, the labneh was thick and creamy, and the dressing on the fatoush was tart and a little sweet, making it difficult to stop eating.

For starters, the restaurant is a lot nicer inside than the exterior would suggest.  I came in for a late-ish lunch, maybe around 1:30 or 2 and the place was pretty empty.  After perusing the menu I decided on the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich and the Fattoush Salad.  I found out soon enough that was WAY too much food for one person.  The sandwich was excellent and would have been plenty of food on its own; it was HUGE.  It came with a garlic sauce that, initially, tasted great.  After a few more bites of it with my sandwich, it became overwhelmingly garlicky.  Now I love garlic, but this was killer.  I also found out as I was eating it that it has egg white in it (I might have passed had I known beforehand.  Eating raw egg doesn&#39;t do it for me.)    The salad was also pretty big, but a tad overdressed making it soggy.  It would have been good otherwise.

I decided to get a chicken shawarma and a side of eggplant, and my parents got kebab plates. The eggplant came out super fast and it was awesome! They grill it and then top it with a vinegar sauce that tastes great, so we polished that plate off really quickly. 

The shawarma was huge, I was super full after eating it. The chicken was pretty good and there were a good amount of veggies inside, but the tzatziki sauce was kind of mild. They usually serve it with the garlic sauce, but my dad got that one and it was really strong and the consistency was thick, not really what I think sauce looks like. My dad was sad that the kebab plate only had one skewer, but this was probably because it was the lunch special?"

Don&#39;t let the location scare you; it&#39;s a gem snuggled between a tattoo parlor and psychic. If anything, it gives the entertainment of people watching if you get a table by the window.

You walk inside and you&#39;re transported to a world of fresh pitas, garlic, lamb and belly dancers. The grape leaves, garlic sauce, hummus, lamb and grilled eggplant were served hot with fantastic flavors. The garlic sauce is....well,. extremely garlic-y, which I love!! So good. I highly recommend it: it&#39;s a huge amount so share and save some for your meal for a kick. The entree are hefty portions with hummus and rice, so you&#39;re getting a good deal if you&#39;re hungry. My mom had the lentil soup and she said it was perfect; the cup is big enough for a meal on its own.

Early in the evening, a  beautiful and talented belly dancer from Cairo came out showcasing her expertise with a massive sword and symbols; she was so fun and vibrant. Our group was definitely into it though (I&#39;m assuming because it was so early, 6p) the rest of the place was boring and unenthusiastic. 

Only down side to our experience was the service was really slow, the timing of our food was off and we had to ask for the pita that were included in our entrees. They had the bartender second as a waiter which I think was the problem because we felt forgotten about at times.

Overall, excellent fresh food and fun experience. Recommended to anyone in the area or visiting Denver and wants something different."

1 - SPEED.  They are soo quick.  For both the dine in and take out service.  Food is ready likkity-split and that&#39;s a huge win for parents (like Ladyhawk and I).  Dinner at a restaurant is kind of a countdown to some implosion with kids and this place handles it wonderfully :)

2 - TASTE.  I love Gyros.  They do it well.  That is all.

3 - SERVICE.  Not to be confused with speed, this is all about the kindness of the people there and they are all rad.  Everyone I&#39;ve ever interacted with in person and over the phone is totally awesome.

And that&#39;s a wrap."

BEST in the area!! Excellent homemade bread made in a special oven that was imported from Lebanon! How cool is that!!!

The owners take true pride in the food and service they deliver here. It&#39;s their passion. They have secret family recipes for everything. I don&#39;t like lamb but I actually ate an entire lamb chop here bc the lamb flavor wasn&#39;t strong and the spices were so interesting. It&#39;s like real middle eastern lamb, which is a rare find. 

You can even watch the guy making bread from scratch and putting it in the special oven. And it&#39;s so wonderful bc it comes out warm. It goes great w the baba ganouj which is absolutely the best I&#39;ve ever had. They make everything from scratch here and it really is evident. 

You know what else they do really well here? The garlic dip. It&#39;s really the best garlic dip I&#39;ve ever had with the perfect balance of garlic and lemon and salt and everything. I put it on everything and I usually don&#39;t eat the stuff anywhere else. It&#39;s so good omg. I even get extra to take home and put on fish or chicken as a seasoning!! 

I highly recommend this place. All my middle eastern friends (and there are many) agree that phonecian kabob is the absolute best in Denver."

I enjoy mediterranean food however, I was throughly not impressed with the Phoenician. The atmosphere was nice for date night or for a group of friends.

Location, being located on Colfax street parking is sketchy.  Okay back to the food, heavy on the seasoning so extra salt is a no GO. I ordered the lamb kabob and the meat was cooked medium well. The garlic was a bit heavy which may of lead to the heartburn. The salad was good and oh! For desert, I ordered the the baklava with walnuts which was delicious. No complaints there.

The customer service was awesome and wine divine. I would recommend just make sure you chase your food with cheese or a milk based product to coat your stomach to take the garlic and spices."

If this review were for food only I would give it 10 stars! The salads are incredible- fresh ingredients, good flavors and overall delicious. The gyro meat is perfectly seasoned. The homemade bread is to die for. I love the garlic sauce, and the hummus is wonderful. We&#39;ve always had outstanding food here. 

Now for the bad news...the service is absolutely horrible. They don&#39;t acknowledge you when you get inside the restaurant so you spend your first 15 minutes trying to track down someone to get you seated. They also either rush you to make a decision with the menu, or forget about you for another 15-20 minutes, with no drinks, apps or anything. It&#39;s a busy place, but seems they have staffing issues if they cannot keep up with the tables. Last time we were there they forgot our drink, forgot our main course, there was no silverware, they offered to bring more bread and then forgot. Horrible- when you go out to eat you want to have an overall good experience. I&#39;m not one to complain about the small stuff, but this was bad. Please work on your staffing issues so you can handle all the lovely people who want to taste your delicious food. I&#39;m going to take a break from here for a while, and fingers crossed they will hire more help in the meantime."

Especially I&#39;d recommend pitas that are cooked on site acc to the staff. The appetizers are medium to low for taste wise. We tried the lebni and falafel and some other appetizers during our trips. 

The lebni is really a yogurt dish and not made of lebni. Falafel is way overcooked when we tried. However the lunch specials and the kebabs are delicious. They are decent sized and very yummy. The rice served is good and the tomatoe salad is decent especially  with lemon on it. 

We tried baklava. I&#39;d not recommend it. I am spoiled by Selda&#39;s baklava  in Med Fresh (Phoenix)  .  We  tried the tea and tea is ok if you like earl grey flavour. 

Despite all shortcomings, staff is great, food is good and one of my togo places during the weekend."

And today, I want to contribute my own two cents to the discussion. So you&#39;re gonna listen, and you&#39;re gonna like it.

One thing I&#39;ve always appreciated about PK (as I will be henceforth be calling the restaurant in this review) is their selection of their fresh-baked savory pies and pastries, collectively known as Fatayer. Not too long ago, I was able to sample the spinach/pine-nut pockets called Sabanekh, and was wowed by interplay of flavors and textures within. Another one that comes to mind in this regard is the Palestinian specialty Musakhan (no, it&#39;s not related to Moussaka...) which melds moist chicken, soft onions, and tangy sumac into a scintillating symphony of sorts. But if you prefer, say, a heaping helping of grilled mushrooms, or the creamy semisoft cheese called Jibneh, or indeed the classic thyme/sesame sprinkling known as Za&#39;atar, these are possible options for you too so don&#39;t despair. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that they didn&#39;t install that oven just for fun, so why not help them out?

Hmm, what else can I tell you about that&#39;s a little out of the ordinary? Oh, I know! Sometimes PK features a red lentil and jalapeño soup which is simply outasight. It&#39;s spicy, filling, warming, and undeniably unctuous - and in this case, that&#39;s not a bad thing to be by any means. I also should point out that their Vegetarian Combo is absolutely enormous (consisting of falafel, hummus, baba ghanouj, stuffed grape leaves, *and* tabbouleh) - if you order it, you might not want to start with a separate appetizer too, or you may not be leaving your bed for quite a while once you get home (as I discovered on a past excursion)! But it&#39;ll hurt so good, I promise. And believe me, you&#39;ll definitely want to save some room for dessert, especially if they&#39;ve got Sha&#39;abiyat [Syrian custard pie] available on your visit. I know I deal in superlatives a lot, but that&#39;s honestly one of my favorite sweet dishes in town, so try it out!"

It was Thursday night and relatively empty at the time we got in, so we sat at a table near the window. I live pretty close and really enjoy the various cultural food spots you can go to on East Colfax, so I had to try this spot. 

We started with a bottle of Lebanese red wine (not sure of the name) and it was tasty. I have never had Lebanese wine before. We ordered dolmas, hummus, pitas, and the cauliflower to start. The cauliflower tasted wonderful-- it was cooked in tahini, garlic, and lemon juice, which resulted in a unique flavor I have never experienced with cauliflower before. The pitas were to die for... Super delicate, yet fluffy in a sense. The hummus was also good. The only thing I did not really enjoy appetizer-wise were the dolmas. They were somewhat overcooked and burnt.  

We also received little cucumber, tomato, and onion salads in small bowls. I just put the salad in the pitas with hummus, as well as my entree, so I can&#39;t review the &#34;salad&#34; on its own, even though it wasn&#39;t quite salad-like and seemed more like a garnish to me. 

For my entree, I went with one of the specials, the Maqlooba. It&#39;s an upside-down dish featuring lamb and rice, along with cauliflower, almonds???, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and some other vegetables, all tossed together with many spices. There were hints of delicious sweetness in the dish and the lamb was cooked to perfection. Yogurt came on the side. I loved the deep and complex flavors within the dish, while I personally would have enjoyed more lamb and less rice (isn&#39;t that everyone&#39;s dream??). As I am not too familiar with Lebanese and Middle Eastern cuisine, I&#39;m not sure if yogurt is always served on the side of this dish? But if it isn&#39;t 100% traditional, I would have liked a more flavorful yogurt-based sauce (more like a cucumber yogurt versus plain). 

All in all, it was a great night at Phoenician Kabob with just a few things within the cuisine that I would have changed! I would like to go back and try the gyros."

I&#39;m angry at myself for living down the street and never eating here! We ate the dolma, baba, and tabbouleh, and they were so TASTY. The tabbouleh came with lettuce leaves which I turned into boats of deliciousness that sailed into my mouth. Walked to the dessert counter and merry the owner, who I could tell had great passion for his food. He recommended his wife&#39;s cheesecake and also gave us some other warmed desert that looked like the baby of a blonde brownie and baklava. They were both delicious.

For lunch try the fatayer and the chicken kabobs, although both portions are piteously tiny. I ate both and was still hungry (but I am a hungry guy). 

For dinner we got some okra special and some lamb special and they were *phenomenal*, and huge. We also got the sampler platter, and every last thing on there was excellent.

The garlic sauce is awesome too. Basically aioli. The atmosphere is cozy without being stifling.

I can&#39;t give 5 stars because the lunch was small and the service at dinner was not great, but the food is worth it regardless. Perhaps future visits will smooth this out."

It was a busy Friday night with a lot of people and bellydancing! Since we were a good sized group, the staff gave us the private room. We got a kick out of the painted walls and especially the bellydancer (did I say that already?? Hahahaha). She was pretty awesome and she gave us a bellydancing lesson, which will forever be etched into the banks of my &#34;happy places.&#34;

The owner and staff were wonderful people. They treated us like we were a part of their family and it was a very cool and uncommon experience with them. 

Now, onto food. OMFG. Sorry, but my review will not do any justice because the food is in fact THAT good. Seriously. 

I had the kabobs and I have had a couple of lustful mornings waking up thinking about them...so I do need to return and reorder. 

They brought me a plate with 5 different delectable pastries for my birthday which was a complete delicious surprise. Oh, and the Lebanese coffee will give you wings. It is no joke. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back, actually. I&#39;ll be bringing some new company with me, to introduce to this spot, very soon!"

Phoenician Kabob is so that place.  Nestled on the north side of Colfax by Ivy Street....is this cozy - yet vibrant Mediterranean restaurant servicing authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. My neighbor and I stopped in on Friday night and was happily greeted by the owner,  Ibrahim and his wife, Victoria.  I just love when the owners know your name and welcome you as if you are family!

Barbara and I ordered a bottle of wine via Ibrahim&#39;s recommendation...and it was delightful.  Can remember the name but it was only $31.00.

We split one of the specials that night, Molokhia (chicken dish) - which was so delicious.  A green leafy vegetable used in Middle Eastern, East and North Africa and South Asian cuisine - very nutritious -  was cooked with chicken, chicken broth, onions, fresh lemon juice, garlic and house spices.  Check out the photo.  We also split a fresh Fatayer from their oven...with grilled mushrooms, spinach, roasted pine nuts and cheese - like a pizza but so fresh and light.

Our food was great. Lamb and kefta kebob were both perfectly grilled. The rice was authentic basmati and cooked just right. The grilled veggies were a nice addition.

Also the pita za&#39;atar feta app was great and authentic according to my Syrian friend.

We started with the falafels as an appetizer and they were great!! They were gone so fast I wish there was more in the order.

A locally renowned brand architect had told my boyfriend that Phoenician Kabob was the bomb so we headed over. 

IMO he was wrong and I&#39;m going to remember that. We started with baba ghanoush and I have to say it was pretty weak. Not much flavor. Our meal also included a chopped tomato, cucumber, and onion salad. This was ten times weaker than the baba ghanoush. The salad was completely without flavor and that is hard to do when you&#39;ve got raw onions involved. The raw onions tasted mostly like crunchy water with a hint of onion flavor. For our entrees, my boyfriend got a pile of meat. I know he thought one meat was quite good and one was meh. My chicken skewers were good and I liked the rice. It had a nice flavor and was fluffy. The garlic sauce side saved everything. 

Another thing I am going to remember forever from this evening is that my boyfriend told me I look fatter without his glasses. I suppose I can logically understand that it is his astigmatism riddled eyeballs doing this and not me personally getting fatter, but still it was not what a lady likes to hear. Remember that next time before telling a lady she looks fat in any context.

After returning from an Israeli adventure earlier this summer, my boyfriend and I have been desperately seeking a middle eastern restaurant in denver to satisfy our cravings... and low and behold this was it! We had actually been recommended this place over a year ago by the wine guy (sommollier?) at the kitchen upstairs in Boulder. We had been meaning to try it but never got around to it, until I was googling middle eastern food denver and it popped back up! 

They have an awesome lebanese wine list, great service, the garlic aioli and hummus were unreal, pita was hot and fresh, and the owner was there delivering the food &amp; chatting away with all his patrons, three of them came up to say goodbye and hug before they left. Just from the get go you can tell he&#39;s a true genuine hardworking person who loves what he does, and it shows in the food! 

We went last night and are so happy we did - definitely can see this being a regular outing. Just wish we lived closer! Highly, highly recommend. Can&#39;t wait to dig into our leftovers today for lunch! :)"

Oh how I love the garlic dip, let me count the ways.  My co-workers at the afternoon meeting, not so much.  Be prepared to taste the garlic for the rest of the day and perhaps not go to the sauna as it might start coming out of your pores.  Can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.  

I love their lunch special.  I&#39;ve only ever ordered the chicken shawarma.  It is served with salad and rice and the garlic sauce/dip.  It&#39;s only $9 and well worth the price.  

On a previous visit I got to try the Zaatar.  I now try to have this every time I go back.

I think they have some of the best pitas in town.  

Service is not always the fastest, it is some of the friendliest.  Parking has never been an issue, plenty of street parking nearby."

This place is wonderful! By far the best Hummus &amp; Shawarma I&#39;ve had in Denver. I also love the chicken Kabob, Greek salad, and fried cauliflower!

On top of the food, the atmosphere is great. Don&#39;t you miss restaurants with real table clothes? Phoenician Kabob has them! It&#39;s curtains &amp; dark walls give it an intimate, upscale feel, but the staff is always friendly &amp; casual. The owner has come to our table several times &amp; even given us free appetizers before! As a bonus, a couple nights a week they bring in a belly dancer and give you some free entertainment while you eat. Overall a great hidden gem!!"

There was some sort of spice in it that I couldn&#39;t place but that really transformed my falafel-eating experience. The hummus and tahini were also great. As a bonus, it was fairly inexpensive at $7 a sandwich. 

One downside was that the service was fairly slow (there were two guys waiting a nearly full restaurant). Also, we ordered stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer. I wouldn&#39;t recommend these. I&#39;ve had them lots of other places and these were only okay. I also wouldn&#39;t recommend their tzatziki. It came with the grape leaves and I found it to be quite flavorless."

We walked in on a Monday night after deciding against Chinese take-out and got a big table by the window for our party of seven.  They had lots of specials listed on the board by the door and Ibrahim, the owner, is pretty tight with my uncle so they brought out a few complimentary appetizers.

Food:  5/5 Stars

-Stuffed vegetarian grape leaves 5/5 stars -  They were on the thin side, but very good.

-Fried Cauliflower 5/5 stars - I have never had this in my life and I loved it.  Ibrahim said they are going to put it on the menu.  Definitely ask for this if it isn&#39;t on the menu.

-  Eggplant slices in balsamic 2/5 Stars - not really my cup of tea.  I like babaganoush or Ikra that is all mashed up as a dip.

-  Chicken breast kabobs with garlic dip 5/5 stars - marinated with the right amount of saffron and the garlic dip rivals Zankou in L.A.  I was in heaven and ate every last morsel of chicken and garlic dip.  

-  Basmati Rice -  Normally I don&#39;t eat rice because of the carb factor, but they cook it with a touch of cinnamon and it was delicious.  My hubby, who is Iranian, didn&#39;t care for it and I don&#39;t think my uncle likes it, but I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.  It is kind of like cilantro.  You either love it or hate it.

-  Freshly baked puffy pita bread - 5/5 stars  It was hot out of the oven and so good.

I seriously can&#39;t remember what everyone else ordered because I was concentrating on my plate.  They all seemed to be exceptionally happy with their selections.

Service:  5/5 Stars

Our server was amazing.  I can&#39;t remember her name, but she was awesome.

Ambiance:  4/5 Stars

It is very nice inside, but I wouldn&#39;t say it has a really fancy or hip vibe to it.  That has to do with the location.  If you put this restaurant in a stand alone spot in LoHi or one of the other hip locations in Denver it would be a goldmine.  My wheels are really spinning on this one.  

Parking:   4/5 Stars

Street parking for free.  No lot that I saw.

I will definitely come back to this restaurant when I am in Denver and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a amazing Mediterranean food."

I&#39;d say best in Denver.  Im giving it 4 stars because my to-go experience wasn&#39;t great. The staff must have been in an off night because thenlady who helped me wasn&#39;t very friendly. I ordered a Sultan combo ($20) and it was packed to the brim in the flimsy to-go container. 2 fresh pitas in a pizza box-the pitas were very dried out by the time i got home, but im not sure what to expect since they are made fresh in the restaurant, thus i wasn&#39;t upset about this.  I&#39;ve attached a photo of my Sultan combo by the time i got home.  Everything was mashed on top of everything.  They could have split it up nicer for 20 bucks. It was a mess. Unless they change their to-go process, I&#39;d just rather eat there."

I have no idea how I haven&#39;t reviewed this place until now. This is one of my very favorite restaurants, period. Everything is homemade in house and incredibly delicious. The servers are always kind and accommodating. 

I generally go for lunch, because I like the cheaper lunch specials. I always get the chicken kabob. At lunch that means one chicken kabob with onions, bell peppers, and delicious chicken pieces served with basmati rice (seriously, how do they make rice so good???) cucumber/tomato/onion salad and (drum roll) the garlic aioli (technically called thume.) THE GARLIC AIOLI WILL BLOW YOUR MIND AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE...

All of those things are incredible and I also recommend getting pita bread because it is warm and awesome.

From the minute I walked in, I enjoy the ambiance of the place, and I was greeted quickly and seated by Katy, who wound up being one of the best servers I&#39;ve had in a good, long while. She answered all of my questions, of which I had many, and was extremely friendly and helpful. 

I started with hummus, because really, this is a litmus test for me in any restaurant that has it on the menu. The hummus, well... it was probably the best hummus I&#39;ve ever had, and was accompanied by a big basket of two huge pitas so fresh and hot that I burned myself even trying to eat them right away. I was also impressed by the amount of hummus I got as an appetizer. Too often, I spend $6 and get a plate that looks like someone smeared the thinnest, weakest little spread of hummus on it. This was a generous bowl and I couldn&#39;t even finish it.

They have a handful of lunch specials and I went with the chicken shawarma. When it came out, it was chock full of chicken cooked with bell peppers and onions and super fragrant! Even the rice that accompanied the meal was particularly well seasoned and tasty. A small salad of onions, tomatoes, and spices came with the meal, as well as a little container of &#34;garlic dip&#34;.  Now, this dip might even have a more fancy or specific name but I&#39;m going to call it garlic dip. And, if I had my druthers, I would be putting the stuff on everything from breakfast to dessert, it is that amazing. Spicy and powerful and outstanding.

I had my leftovers packed up and noticed the desserts. Well, of course, I could not leave without getting some baklava. Then I saw that they had these little homemade cookies , and... Well... I came home with a lot of sweets and a fantastic leftover meal for tonight&#39;s dinner.

Everything was reasonably priced, especially for lunch. I believe my chicken shawarma lunch was $9, and they also offer beef shawarma, gyro , and several types of kabobs.

To say that I&#39;d go back would be an understatement, as I will probably try to find a reason to get over there as soon as possible. Ask for Katy, if you get the chance, because she&#39;s awesome. And, you know... Get the garlic dip."

First - I&#39;m surprised this place was fairly empty at a prime time for Friday dinner - someone should go and fix that!

Second - belly dancing, a manager who came out to check, fast and friendly waitstaff

Third - really amazing food and a ton of it!

As my friend is GF, we were excited to discover she could have nearly the entire menu!  We therefore got the sample platter and an order of the Fava beans.  The sampler was huge - enough for both of us, plus leftovers x2!  The fava beans were warm and like hummus but chunky - think salsa with med flavors and food.  Both were good choices for sure.

While we were too full for dessert, they did have them available for your viewing pleasure in a glass case on the bar.  They also had specials of the night on a whiteboard.

The only slight cons... 1 - the hummus wasn&#39;t our favorite.  2 - there is no GF pita bread so that made it a bit harder to eat some of the sauces. 

So if you are in that part of town, or close by, go check out this place for an enjoyable meal!"

Freshly backed pita bread with their hummus and felafel is the best in the city if not the best in the country.  One suggestion if you are heading there ask them to bring the bread ASAP because it is not and melts in your mouth.  I tried lamb shank and I highly recommend it.  We are for sure going back.

I had the combo kabob platter- lamb/chicken/beef and there is no better place outside of Jordan where I&#39;ve seen better Middle Eastern cuisine. There were 12 people seated at our table and the food was served flawlessly!

There is no comparable restaurant in Denver for the fresh pita or the hummus.

The lentil soup was kind of mushy and flavorless. 
Beef schwarma was chewy and the salad that came with it wasn&#39;t very fresh. The eggplant sandwich was also not so great. Really thick, chewy pieces with not a lot of other ingredients in the sandwich. 

The server noticed I didn&#39;t like it, didn&#39;t charge us and gave us some hummus and pita. This was also pretty flavorless and unappealing.

So far I&#39;ve tried the chicken shawarma and chicken kabob.  I liked the kabob better than the shawarma, I think.  The kabob chicken was tender and flavorful.  I&#39;d like to try a beef dish next.  Any way you go, it&#39;s a lot of food for around $8.00.

I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of trying some of the appetizers and, honestly, I liked them even better than my entrees.  The smokey, creamy Baba Ghanouj and the deliciously smooth hummus are accompanied by pillowy pockets of warm pita fresh from the brick oven.  The star of the show for me was the zaatar fatayer, a flat bread sprinkled with a mixture of toasted sesame seeds, thyme, olive oil, sumac, sea salt, I think pine nuts, and probably some other spices baked in the brick oven.  Just scrumptious!

Yes, there is an authentic brick oven back in the kitchen, which emits wonderful aromas into the dining room and cooks the food to perfection.  I think sometimes you have to wait a bit but good food takes time.

I don&#39;t normally get this far out east on Colfax but I&#39;ll drive for this. You know that Colfax has hidden gems, they are just mixed in with a whole lot of mess so its hard to know. I rely on recommendations and in this case it really paid off. 

I&#39;m not exactly sure what&#39;s in the Garlic dip because I swear it tastes stronger than straight garlic. Its delicious. I brought some home and while I smelled of garlic for days, 100% worth it. (I may be ranking this whole place on how much I loved it). 

I had a lunch size of the beef shwarma. So glad I got the lunch size; plenty of food and cooked just right.

Among the eclectic spots on East Colfax - this is a true gem. The spectacular service is only to rivaled by the spectacular food bursting with deliciously distinguished Mediterranean flavors. 

To begin - I feel I must note just how patient and charming our server was. Not only did she not even flinch when our very adorable 16 month old dining companion flung rice everywhere, but she brushed it off by simply saying &#39;No big deal, we understand. Things happen&#39;

As she walked us through the menu and delicious sounding specials, we all landed on pretty solid choices of chicken schwarma, dolmas, and my favorite the Greek Salad with chicken schwarma. Never have I laid eyes on a salad so dense in flavor and size with all the best ingredients that constitutes a Greek Salad. Not overwhelmed with lettuce, each olive, feta cheese, lettuce piece, onion were perfectly rationed throughout the ginormous salad. 

But the best part? Oh the best part was this garlic dipping sauce that accompanies the salad. Not particularly sure how the sauce was supposed to consumed as the salad already had a delicious vinaigrette lightly coating each bite, but I am so happy I discovered it. It&#39;s the consistency of a butter, yet was informed that is was made of olive oil, egg white, and garlic. And if you are a lover of garlic like yours truly then you&#39;ll be dipping your pita in this all night long. I&#39;d almost go as far as to say that this tiny condiment could be a big enough reason to return time and time again. It doesn&#39;t hurt that every other dish was just as delicious. Oh - and try the fatayer, too - it&#39;s essentially a Mediterranean pizza and is divine!"

But, just like the heart, the stomach wants what the stomach wants.  So, Alissa and I dropped in for a quick drink and a light bite.  I stuck with water to drink as there had been plenty of libations earlier.  My first thought was that the place looked much nicer on the inside than one might expect from the storefront.  The owner (Ibrahim?) and the servers were friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Beef Shawarma sandwich by itself.  It was some of the most flavorful Shawarma I have tried.  I had mine with the garlic dipping sauce (thick and super garlicky) as well as the red chili pepper sauce.  They both complimented this moist and flavorful sandwich. Kelly T. did not exaggerate the magnitude of the garlic in her review, but I enjoyed every reeking bite :)

The pita on the sandwich here is very soft.  This carried over to the fresh pillows of pitas that were brought to us straight from the oven.  They were painfully hot to the touch and oh so good.  They went well with the strongly smokey and quite creamy Baba Ghanouj (smoked eggplant with tahini, garlic &amp; lemon juice) into which we dipped the pita.  Phoenician Kabob has a full bar, and many of the customers were enjoying drinks on this Sunday evening.  Indeed, we even ran into another Yelper friend (first physical meeting) who had checked in for a quick drink.  There are many things on the menu I would like to try in the future, and I will definitely be back to give them a go."

Phoenician Kabob&#39;s meat dishes are delicious, well-seasoned (but not too salty) and lean with adequate portions.  I&#39;ve had both chicken and beef and have been happy with both.  They have nightly specials; one night I had an eggplant/potato/ground beef baked special (I don&#39;t know what it was called and it was delicious.)  They also offer lamb, seafood and vegetarian options.  The portion sizes are balanced and appropriate, they don&#39;t load you up on meat; however, they don&#39;t short you on protein and then try to make up for it with too much rice/grain.  

For me, when I eat near-eastern food, its the sides and the sauces that really make or break the meal.  Phoenician Kabob includes several sides including hummus, grape leaves, salads and the like.  I love the various hummus variations and they have a delicious tzatziki; I find it good on everything.  The tabouleh is delicious, lightly minted and refreshes the palate.  It is a nice refreshing complement to the spices and flavors of the other items on the plate.  This last point is important because the baba ganouj is a delicious flavor explosion... I&#39;ll leave it at that!

They also offer drinks and desserts including traditional coffee.   

The restaurant interior is understated, and it doesn&#39;t need to be flashy, the food says it all."

To give you an idea, my Mom visited not to long ago and I took her here for a lunch/dinner kind of thing and she loved it so much we stopped in before her flight so she could buy some food to bring back to Philadelphia, yep that&#39;s right kebabs to go on a plane.

I&#39;ve had several things here and my ultimate favorite is the kafta (lamb and beef mixture) on a kabob, it&#39;s juicy and packed with tons of seasoning.  I usually get the meat platter with two or three kabobs that way I can get a variety.  The hummus is super fresh and served as a side on most meals.  

The last time we were here the owner was there and very chatty, don&#39;t pass this up, he&#39;s a great guy and enjoys being a restaurant owner.  He showed us around and even told us that he had his brick oven imported from Lebanon and installed it himself.  Truly an amazing feet when you see the monstrous size of this thing.  His brink oven gets to over 1500 degrees and can cook ram pita dough in 30 seconds.  That&#39;s how fresh your pita is going to be, all made from scratch and to your table, almost still cooking.  

They also have some wonderful specials on the board daily which includes some food options as well as wine specials.  They have a full bar, so feel free to get your drink on.  

Just reviewing this place gives me a hankering for another kebab trip.  Let&#39;s all go and give them something to talk about!!"

We both had the gyro plate and shared the fried cauliflower appetizer.  Both were very good.  The gyro meat was especially delicious.  Chunks vs shaved and quite juicy.  I asked for no rice and I ended up with more meat &amp; salad than my hubby.  (He was jealous). The salad was simply tomato, cucumber &amp; red onion.  I wish it had been dressed somehow...maybe some fresh herbs &amp; oil?  The tomatoes were definitely lackluster but it is winter, after all.

Came with four other people. We ordered:

3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 4 pieces of baklava.

Appetizers: garlic dip and hummus. Delicious - the garlic dip is REALLY good but so garlicky that it made the hummus taste... a bit blah. The fresh baked loaves of pita are NOT TO BE MISSED.

Entrees: chicken shawarma, kafta kabob, and lamb gyros. All plates eaten clean, but the kafta and gyros were the stars. Each entree is served with a large serving of rice and a bowl of &#34;salad&#34; (cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes).

Dessert: Baklava are HUGE here. The triangle piece is probably 3-4 inches. 

The owner came to ask us how our meal was at the end of the night, which was a nice touch.

I WISH they would serve more family style. If the table wants to share the entrees, why can&#39;t they bring out ONE bowl of salad, ONE large bowl of rice, and then the meats on platters? Small thing, but might make it cozier.

Total with tip and tax, per person, was $24.

But the hero here is the pita. Best I&#39;ve had outside of Metro Detroit."

We tried the hummus, mushroom Fatayer (similar to a white pizza), lamb gyro plate, gyro sandwich, Lebanese coffee and the Sultan Combo. Wow, was this a lot of food.

The hummus was very smooth and creamy with some great olive oil on top. The Fatayer was as tasty as any other great white pizza in my opinion. Very good mushroom flavor and excellent light and slightly chewy crust. The pita bread that came with the hummus was awesome, by far the best bread I&#39;ve had at any Mediterranean place. It was very light, delicate, aromatic and hot from the oven.

The coffee was interesting, it seemed like it was spiced with some Chai ingredients or something. We asked how it was made and the waitress asked the chef&#39;s. In broken english she thinks they told her that they take coffee grounds add it to some water and boil it for a few seconds, take it off the heat, then boil it and repeat a few times. It was espresso like and also like a greek coffee with the grounds at the bottom of the small pot.

The entrees were all good. The Gyro plate was a big helping of Lamb Gyro meat, lightly seasoned white rice and a cucumber and onion salad with spices as well. The Gyro was well portioned with meat and veggies wraped in a fresh pita which had plenty of taziki on the side. I&#39;d get this sandwich next time for a quick lunch. The Sultan Combo was was loaded with all sorts of great things, the highlights for me was the Falafel which was very chrispy and well seasoned and the tabbouleh salad which was very mint forward. 

The service was great, maybe it was just because we were the only ones there. It was between lunch and dinner but lets say it again, it was great service. We all know service can be terrible no matter how busy a place is. 

Check this place out, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Even if you hate garlic and hummus, get a Fatyer. I forgot to mention the garlic sauce is ridiculously spicy and raw garlic tasting. Not hot spicy just garlic spicy, WOW and look out for anyone who eats it."

This place is excellent! 

The quality of ingredients are above and beyond the other options in town. While visiting with a friend who is also Lebanese the owner was walking around speaking to all of his guests. You could tell that he had built a relationship with many of his patrons. Overall the service was fantastic. It was very obvious that the owner takes a lot of pride in his business and the quality of his food.

I chose Phoenician Kabob for lunch because it was near our next destination. The restaurant was next to a tattoo parlor, and it seemed to be in a doubtful area. Our group was two families with young children. I was not sure I made the right pick for lunch.

But never have we been welcomed as well as when we went to here. Inside the restaurant, it was neatly lined tables with plates, napkins and silverware arranged with care. There was a greyed hair super friendly gentleman greeting us. He asked us where we&#39;re from. When he found out we were out-of-towners, he said he would make us something special. My guess is he is the owner or manager of the restaurant. Our waiter was equally welcoming and friendly. 

A few minutes after we ordered our food, a pizza with home made dough came out with some home made pickled vegetables. The pizza had some lamb gyros cubed and it was very tasty. The pickles were great companions to the pizza.

Most of us in the family ordered various kabobs, some chicken, some beef, some lambs. My niece&#39;s lamb kabob seemed to be a little tough but mine and my husbands were tender, juicy and tasty. Even my picky-eater daughter cleaned up her chicken kabob and rice. 

I can attest this was the best meal we had over the weekend. I regretted that we are leaving the area and won&#39;t come back here anytime soon. I hope that they stay around for a long long time so when we come back to this area, they will still be here for us to enjoy their food and hospitality."

I remember when we hardly had any great places on this stretch of the Fax but times are changing :) The first time I ate here I just ordered it to go and it was yummy but I  decided to eat in this time and it did make a difference. My friends and I came here for a late birthday dinner for me so we wanted to try a few things. Appetizers - Hummus and Sabankh. The hummus was creamy and very flavorful a little less salty the others I have had. The Sabankh was out of this world . The little pastries filled with spinach and pine nuts were so good. I could have eaten just these and be happy. The Greek salad was very good . All ingredient was chopped up really small which is a great way to serve this salad.  We also order the Sultan Combo &amp; Vegetarian Combo both were very good! You can taste the Quality in the gyros and chicken. The tabbouleh and baba ghanouj was oh so good! The Pita however is one of the reasons this place stands out . Wood burning oven cooks the pita and the Sabanekh to perfection :) Don&#39;t drive by this place with out stopping for some yummy food!

My favorite thing about this place was the Lebanese coffee. It had so much caffeine in it, I loved it. The kebabs were so excellent, it sounds like it would be a small portion of food, but they are huge. My other favorite part was the hummus, it was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, and the pita bread was so delicious and perfect. The food here is great, honestly, I really wasn&#39;t impressed with the staff. I didn&#39;t really get a lot of courtesy, respect, and politeness that I usually appreciate from any waitstaff ... And I don&#39;t have super outrageous expectations for kindness either.

Most recently, I bought one for a New Years Eve party I hosted. Yes, the hams are a little pricey, but wow - they are worth it. 

The hams here start at 7 pounds - If you&#39;re hoping for ham on a busy holiday, I highly recommend reserving one ahead of time. Even for NYE, they were running out, and people coming in with no reservation were going to be stuck with a 9+ pounder. 

HHC does offer a pretty decent variety of frozen sides, and they have some great sauces, too. I bought a tangy mustard sauce, and a horseradish sauce, both with leftovers in mind... 

As David noted, all you need to do with your ham is take it out of the fridge an hour and a half ahead of time. In the past, I&#39;ve heated up small portions of it, but it really is just as good at room temp. 

The employees in the Aurora store were friendly and efficient, both on the phone when I made my reservation and when I showed up to pick up the ham. Great product, great service. Five stars. Love it!"

I do know that it&#39;s hard to go wrong with a burger joint.

It was a game day, so every HD TV in the place had some kind of football on. I&#39;m not big on sports, but this would be a great spot to catch the game and get a beer, if you&#39;re into that. There&#39;s a Foosball table and a nice, private outside sitting area. The inside is bright and open, chic in modern decor but still gave off a chill vibe.

Their selection of specialty burgers had a lot of variety, and I ended up with a turkey burger that was very juicy and tender. You can also build your own burger with a plethora of add-ons true to Denver&#39;s style, like guacamole and green chile. 

I think the best part were the fries, Parmesan and truffle oil, and you can get a basket for the whole table.

The booze selection was also up the par, lots of local favorites and some I&#39;ve never heard of. They also have alcoholic milkshakes, which is a win in my book.

Service can be a little slow, but again....game day, understandable. Staff was friendly and made sure we had what we needed. 

So if you&#39;re not in the mood for a greasy fast food place but still want a tasty burger and a place to unwind with a casual atmosphere, Park Burger is the place for that."

The space is modern and cramped, prefect for the Highlands. We were immediately seated by a friendly wait staff and attended to attentively. 

Our table of three ordered a basked of the Truffle fries, a New Your burger, the Royale burger, and the el Chilango burger. I only tasted the fires and New York, but my dining partners seemed to enjoy as there was silence once the food arrived except for the occasional moan of pleasure and few oh my gods (regarding the food). 

My burger was incredible. The buns were fresh and fluffy, patty was cooked perfectly and the corned beef was delicious. The fries were amazing as well and would have been great even without topping, which was good because half the fries weren&#39;t touched by the toppings. The ones that were touched were amazing! 

My one small complaint was the bathrooms seemed a little run down. Clean, but could use a new toilet seat and handle.

I ordered the tuna burger and their peanut butter and chocolate milk shake. The tuna burger is a really unique take on the sandwich. It&#39;s loaded with layers of flavors. The tuna is salty and the bread is buttery. The bread has a similar consistency of that of a croissant. The bread is toasted with a load of buttery goodness. There is a heap of creamy avocado that drenches the burger. The best part is the tart and vinegary taste form the pickled veggies.

I ordered the burger with pancetta on it. I was extremely impressed with the patty quality and the flavor. Not to mention the garlic aioli really made this burger above and beyond! Their sweet ish buns.. I&#39;m just saying, it couldn&#39;t have been better!"

I love a good patio spot, and if you can throw in good food and drink - I&#39;m in. Hands down.
I have been here quite a few times and the servers, albeit seem super busy, all the time, know their stuff. They know the menu very well and are all aware of what beer choices are available and suited for your particular liking. I have always been happy when I have dined here, and see it as a go-to spot for game days and social outings with friends. 
The parking can be a challenge, but they have valet in the evenings which is brilliant.
Well played PB!"

Not intimate as in a romantic, candlelit dinner restaurant, but it&#39;s nice and cozy. There are some seats at the bar, so if you&#39;re flying solo and are physically able, sit there to allow groups to be at the tables. 

It may be small, but they are fast!  The wait staff is attentive and quick. Whatever you need, they&#39;re on it. Go with one of their burger recommendations or build your own--you can even get yours on a bed of greens. Bunless--thanks for looking out for us gluten-free folk, Park Burger.  The Chilango is a favorite.  Also, do yourself a favor and order some fries. I&#39;m a fan of the sweets myself.  While in ashamed to admit it, I have ordered the Conb salad too. Avocado, bacon, egg--all of the goodness--with fried onions too. Though it&#39;s a burger joint, the salads are well executed too!

They do happy hour...and they carry a variety of craft beer and made some killer shakes as well.  The entire experience is well crafted. Delicious burgers, fun environment, in and out.  If I lived near this location, I&#39;d be here far more often."

My bf and I sat at the bar for a quick bite and some beer. Servers were constantly walking by us and looking at us from behind the bar (it&#39;s a tiny bar) yet we were never acknowledged. Not until 10 minutes in, I finally reached out and asked for 2 waters. After ordering our beers I figured it&#39;d be a smart idea to order food right away, or else we might not ever get their attention again. 30 minutes later another bartender approached us and said, &#39;your ticket was lost in the kitchen. Can I have your order again?&#39; No apology, no effort to redeem themselves, no care in the world. We reordered. 10 minutes later I asked if our order of French fries could just come out first as we were starving by this point. We eventually got our food, scarfed it down, &amp; paid the bill. Still no acknowledgement from the staff that our order was lost.

We will not be back. Highland Tap Burger has better burgers and they actually have service.

Food is better at the RiNo location."

We ordered park burger, buffalo burger, and shared the works. The service was good and fast. The burgers were so juicy and great, although the size was way to big. The works was so good at first. Then as we progressed, the fries were all soggy and soaked in the sauce too much, even though we didn&#39;t spend that much time. So that was disappointing. But I will definitely go back for more burgers. I really want to try other burgers, but they don&#39;t seem to come in different sizes. The only small burgers they have is their little burger.

Park burger is our #1 go-to burger spot.  It&#39;s simply the best overall burger in Denver metro.  Others challenge this title, others may even grab it (for a while), but Park Burger serves up consistency and longevity.

I know what it takes to make a tip and I know what it takes to leave a customer pissed the fuck off. This review has a little bit of everything, so for others willing to read this review, here you go:

We used to go here all the time, but stopped coming as much since the service has been going downhill for some time now. We finally came back in yesterday since we were in the neighborhood and were really craving burgers and wanted to give Park Burgers another shot. There were 2 girls working at 2pm yesterday. There was only 1 other table there so it was  slow. No reason to not get service.

Anyways, one of the girls (lets call her server A) comes over, gives us our waters and menus. We sat for a good 5 minutes before the server A came back. I asked her if we were could order then she replies, &#34;Oh, let me grab your server&#34; with a bitchy attitude (#1 red flag right there). Server B comes over (from literally just sitting at the back tables talking to the other employees) takes our order and leaves. The food comes out and we had 1 request for 1 burger and she couldn&#39;t even get that right. Anyways we let that slide. No biggie (redflag #2).

We sat there for about 30-45 minutes and the entire time Server B checked up on us once. She was again, sitting at the back table, just talking and talking to the other employees (redflag #3). Towards the end when we were all finished, I placed my wallet on the table with my credit sitting on top (YOU COULDN&#39;T MISS IT). Server B walked back and forth for a good 10 minutes, glanced over at least 3 times, and didn&#39;t bother to get the check or ask if we needed too boxes (redflag #4). We had to ask the Server A for our check and boxes which AGAIN her reply was &#34;Oh, let me get your server&#34; with that same bitchy attitude and miraculously Server B comes back (at this point I stopped counting, I was just done and wanted to get out of there).

In the end, our bill was $52 which I left a hefty $10 tip, which was by far MORE than anyone else would have left in this situation. If I was that type of person I would have left $0 tip, but I wanted to be fair and I understand the frustration when a customer leaves nothing, and so still left a decent tip anyways. Funny, I guess they thought that wasn&#39;t good enough as the next part pissed me off so much I am NEVER coming back here again.

We left the restaurant, get to the car and start loading (we were parallel parked directly in front of the restaurant window) for a good 5 minutes. I get ready to drive off, only to realize I had forgotten my sunglasses inside. Came back in, went straight to the table, which was completely cleared by now and asked the Server B if she had seen my sunglasses since 1) I know for sure I had left it on the table and 2) no one had made any effort to even walk out the door to give them to me. She pauses for a good time, then goes, &#34;Oh, yeah, they&#39;re right here&#34; with the same bitchy attitude as Server A!! She then reaches under the little desk near the register, hands them to me and just smirks and walks away.

Just shows me these girls don&#39;t care about service whatsoever. I may have tipped you more than you deserved but your lack of service or gratitude definitely encourages me to never come back again. Thank you.

It&#39;s a shame really, I really like the food here but good food + shitty service = shitty place."

We made a last minute decision to stop in here for a burger and fries. We got one of the last two available tables right before a swarm of people came in. 

I opted for the park burger with bacon and an over easy egg. The hubs got the croque burger that had an over easy egg, ham and Swiss cheese.

We ordered the truffle Parmesan basket o fries to share and it was a huge portion of fries. Not that we left any of course because they were delicious.

I also had the lamb burger, which was undercooked but still yummy, and the truffle fries, salty but delicious!

All four of us were extremely happy with the burgers. It was a good sized patty,  cooked just as we&#39;d ordered, good texture and tasted like real meat! So yummy.

The salad was crisp and featured &#39;real&#39; lettuce (not iceberg). We all liked the sweet potato fries. They were the best I&#39;ve had! I didn&#39;t like the regular fries, but everyone else did. I thought they were limp and greasy. The ice cream cone hit the spot, but was nothing exceptional. Next time I am ordering a shake because they looked deliious.

My friends had margaritas and they said they were very good. That&#39;s high praise since they frequently order margaritas.

This place is pretty small and it was really busy when we arrived, but  our server was patient, friendly and efficient . She was a young lady with a long dark ponytail. She was great.

As for the food, we all had the Scarpone burger.  It had some chopped peppers on it (gierdeniera?), as well as pancetta, cheese and garlic truffle oil.  Best burger ever.  We also had the loaded French fries.  Very tasty.  Crispy, and just the right amount of bacon, cheese and toppings.  Often this kind of dish is so smothered you don&#39;t taste anything buy cheese.  Not here.  Seriously, the food was amazing.

We finished the meal by splitting a couple of shakes.  Cookies and cream--yummy.

Now about the service.  It was early on a Friday night, so it wasn&#39;t busy at all.  The server was pleasant enough.  She just didn&#39;t seem into it.  I don&#39;t know, maybe they were going for trendy indifference?  What ever it was didn&#39;t work for me.  When we got there we ordered four beers.  She was helpful taking the order, but then the beers took 15 minutes.  Literally 15 minutes.  We flagged her down to inquire about the issue, and her response was &#34;maybe they had another order before you&#34;..  Really? Wasn&#39;t good at following up either.  If we wanted something, we needed to find her.

Overall, I think the food was a 5, and service was a generous 3.  I would still go back, and just assume that the indifferent service was a fluke."

When I asked my wife why we were gong here, when there were tons of burger spots closer, she just looked at me, said &#34;Their sweet potato fries.&#34;, and shook her head in disbelief.  

Oh. 

When we walked in from the cold, the warmth from the open-kitchen floated and surrounded us.  

The host/waiter called to us, saying &#34;Sit anywhere!&#39;.  We grabbed a snug spot on the back wall, close to the window, nestled between 2 other tables.  It reminded me of a NY deli, where you are eating with total strangers (except at Park, you don&#39;t share tables).  By the end of the evening, we had made friends with 2 other tables, so I walked away in high spirits with great food and conversation to boot,

I&#39;ve recently become more indecisive with my food and the pattern is this:  I look at the menu and decide on something I really want.  Then the waiter comes and says &#34;Look at the special&#34; and my choice is now corrupted. 

It happened here when I was presented with a burger with a habanero mayo, when I already had decided a burger covered with crispy pancetta, smothered in a truffle oil.  

2 different styles: heat vs crunchy salt and rich truffle

I went with the special.  Gah~Thick burger and chewy (in a good way) buns, with thick dill pickle chips which really crunched.   

The  wife went with a standard menu item and thenb ordered off the happy hour beer list, an Avery beer (local!)

After we finished our meal and declined desert because we were stuffed, we packed up and left.  Great spot to grab a burrger, and it would be even better in the summer day, as the front street would be full of pedestrian traffic. Park will be a good spot to make future memories at."

They have a dedicated fryilator for French fries which makes them Gluten Free! I am a huge fan of fries but can never eat them so this is a double bonus for me. Try the truffle fries - they are amazing. 

They also offer Udi&#39;s buns, which in my opinion aren&#39;t that great, but that Udi&#39;s problem not theirs! I commend them for carrying buns at all! 

I love sitting outside and people watching. I always get the same guy that waits on me and he is super friendly and can always recommend a good beer.

We tried this location since we&#39;ve experienced the South Pearl location a few times already, just to see the differences, compare a bit... the verdict is the Highland location is good but it&#39;s lacking.  Lacking in outdoor seating (there&#39;s a small bar setting that faces the street which is probably good for people watching) and service was fine but nothing special. The food also wasn&#39;t special. I got the Popper so I could compare apples to apples, my man got the Croque again for the same reason.  Still delicious, don&#39;t get me wrong, but... I don&#39;t know. I really can&#39;t put my finger on what&#39;s missing.  

We also branched out from our norm of blue cheese kettle chips &amp; got the sweet potato fries. Again, good, but they didn&#39;t stand out from others I&#39;ve had."

Park Burger took care of us on their own account and even sent us extra items.  They were courteous, helpful, and best of all our food arrived hot.  We both ordered burgers and the kelt blue chips which were awesome.  We also received some courtesy milkshakes on the house.

I have never had such a flavorful, wonderfully mastered hamburger. The juices were flowing, the flavors were exploding and my taste buds were scandalized. Fabulous. 

I had The Royale burger, containing thick slices of bacon, globs of salty blue cheese and onions caramelized to perfection. My mouth made love to this burger so hard and I never wanted it to end. I also order the Parmesan truffle fries and they were glorious.

Is that really a deal?  Oh. Guess what...if you want to add pork on the happy hour order its 2 dollars extra which is one dollar more than the nachos with pork on the regular menu.

We were pretty excited to try Park Burger and stopped by one rainy week night for our first taste. Summary: pretty good, but not great... what&#39;s all the fuss?

My wife had the Scarpone and I had The Popper. Hers was pretty darn good with the gardiniera (a relish or tapenade?) adding nice texture and a bit of sourness much like the traditional pickles do. The Popper was a good in theory but I found the soft and slightly slimy chile did not add much to the burger. 

Park Burger loses a star in my review because my burger was waaaaay under-cooked. I always take the recommended doneness and enjoy a juiicy, pink center as much as the next guy but my burger was straight-up bloody. The bottom bun was falling apart because it was soaked in blood! It was kinda gross.

The thing is, the place was not that crowded and it was near closing time. Was this just an anomaly due to cooks nearing the end of their shirt? I&#39;m not sure  but we&#39;ll be back to try the other options on the menu - I&#39;m hoping this first was an unlucky experience."

My name is Randy Berger.  I&#39;m a bit for a burger snob from LA, and wanted to let you know you helped recently with a much-needed &#39;fix&#39; during my visit to Denver.  While you&#39;re not at my tippy-top, you got the goods a&#39;plenty, and with ease made my &#34;Berger Knows Burgers&#34; with respect.  http://www.yelp.com/list/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2.  For a $7-ish price-point and a handful of drafts, you kick serious arse.

For a first timer --

1.  Park &#34;Royal&#34; Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-burger-denver-2#m_9X-KjV3dEJT4vnbgbVPw, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-burger-denver-2#ynsuGeDV5PbWIJIJnzPCvA) -- which is just about my favorite combo for a burger -- bacon, bleu cheese. and caramelized onions.  The burger was a decent size (6oz?), hand-formed thin, and well-seasoned.  The bun, oh the bun, was excellent -- very fresh, a bit sweet (nearly Hawaiian), and soft.  The bacon, crisp and plenty.  The bleu, a generous portion.  My dining companion got the same, but over a salad (instead of bun) for an extra 25 cents.  That&#39;s cool.

2.  Parmesan &amp; Truffle fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-burger-denver-2#2d09DRCaXaorkFcmXcMwsQ) -- shoestrings, tasty, good flavor but needed salt.  The large feeds 45 people, or 2-3 hungry ones.  They also could be served hotter, or might have been lukewarm due to staffing issue (see below).

Why not 5 stars? --
The decor is simple and nearly fits being hipster, but not quite. The service while super nice, had only 2 people waiting tables -- which made delays to clean tables, ordering, and needless delays.  The place was hopping, and Park should be able to afford one extra staff working."

All of their locations have the nicest staff. They just opened a location in the Rino neighborhood and we at outside on their awesome patio. One of the owners was there and he stopped by to chat and ask us our opinion about the food/atmosphere. 

The staff made awesome recommendations on food and portions and if you get something you don&#39;t like, they&#39;ll do everything in their power to keep you happy. Everyone seems to work together (have your back mentality which is hard to find). 

If you are with a group of people their large fry order is enough for 4 people to share and you can mix types! Get a basket of the truffle and sweet potato!"

We went on one of those rare-but-awesome 50 degrees+ Colorado January days and took advantage of it by hitting up the outdoor seating. It&#39;s quaint and mostly designed to seat two at a time, but you can crush in three people in a pinch (like we did). I can&#39;t vouch for indoors since I never set foot inside, but I&#39;d imagine they offer a few bigger tables.

My brother and I both ordered the Royale (he had been here before and recommended it) along with some fries and his girlfriend ordered the Turkey-bacon-guac, no bun. I also grabbed a Ska Euphoria that happened to be on tap.

The burgers came out briskly and we all dug in. The chunks of bleu cheese seemed to actually coat some of the bacon, and they didn&#39;t skimp on any of the ingredients save perhaps a patty that seemed to disappear before the rest of the burger. The Euphoria was an excellent complement as well - if it&#39;s still available, I&#39;d heartily recommend it. It was a savory, rich lunch that left me full without eating too much.

The turkey burger salad looked good as well and everybody cleaned their plates. Making a mental note of this place for next time I&#39;m in the area and in need of a quick burger fix."

I ordered the same burger as before and ordered fries as opposed to the blue cheese chips. The service was very good and I never felt wanting for drink or food or condiments. The burger and fries showed up only around 8-10 minutes after I ordered which I consider fast the bun had a nice toast to it.  The pickle, lettuce and tomato were fresh. And it was a perfect medium rare as I had ordered. The burger had a lot of complex flavor and I enjoyed it. However I stopped eating the burger to enjoy the fries and same as last time the burger was so greasy that it soaked through the bun as it sat still while I ate the fries and even went through the paper on the basket and onto the table underneath. That may be a characteristic of this particular burger. But a little too greasy for me. So I subtracted a star from the update. The fries were nicely cooked and salted. I did receive mostly broken fries and end pieces. However customers to my side had received whole fries. They were so good I did not really care they were mostly end pieces. 

Overall a very pleasant trip and I plan to frequent this establishment in the future.



**old review**
Perhaps I may have come in at a bad time. Maybe the cook had been having a bad day.
I ordered the royal burger, first burger on their specials list. Also heard their kettle blue cheese chips were very good. So I ordered both. The burger showed up well done. I had ordered medium rare. Also the bottom bun was so full of grease it fell apart while I tried to eat it. None of the toppings stayed on the burger it was so greasy. I only ate half the burger and moved onto the kettle chips. They also were not crunchy but a soggy mess. The chips had little to no rigidity. And I had to eat what little i did with a fork. Flavor was good but soggy chips ruined the side dish.

I will come back another time. And try a different burger and see if this was a one time thing and update my review accordingly."

Been eating only fish lately so we went to try their much ballyhooed veggie burger. Why does everyone think it is so good? Tasted like an over-seasoned hashbrown sandwich.

Fries were just OK. Margarita was good but it should have been for $8. Service was pretty good. Bathroom smelled like old football pads.

Definitely will give them another try if/when I&#39;m back eating meat, but not until."

Park Burger focuses on delicious, juicy burgers.  I mean, come on, it&#39;s right in their name.  I&#39;ve been to this location 3 times now, and each time I&#39;ve had a different burger.  First I tried just their standard Park Burger with Cheese.  It&#39;s a juicy, 1/3 lb burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  Burger perfection if I&#39;ve ever tasted it.  The second burger I had was their BBQ Burger.  Again, a juicy 1/3 lb burger with cheddar, BBQ sauce, and crispy onion straws.  Just sublime.  On my last visit I had the Double Park Burger with Cheese.  I would not have ordered this if it were 2 1/3 lb patties.  Luckily, it&#39;s 2 1/4 lb patties, and it was filling and delicious.  

Paired with their crispy-hot, salty fries you really can&#39;t go wrong!  

I look forward to trying some of the other specialty burgers at Park Burger!"

All the reviews seem to be good so why not? Oh, and there were several options on the menu that caught my eye so I knew that there would be something I would want.

I ordered the El Chilago (didn&#39;t mean to be redundant) burger since it was what I was in the mood for and several people seemed to like it on Yelp. To me, it was average at best. I felt like the patty was way too skinny although it does say 1/3 pound so I guess that falls on me. I was disappointed that the burger had no kick to it whatsoever and that it was a bit too overpowered by the guacamole. With that said, it was made medium rare as I asked and it was pretty juicy. 

I didn&#39;t mean to get a shake but I was messing around with my phone and noticed several reviews for the chocolate/peanut butter shake so I went with it. What I could say? I think the yelpers nailed it... I really enjoyed it.

I think this place was fine and I liked the little local feel to it. I guess my biggest problem was what I was getting for the money. I paid $14 for the burger and the shake (with tax but not tip). In my point of view, for what I got, I think $8-10 would be max. And I understand the burgers as never frozen and come from Harris ranch but it&#39;s just my opinion that it&#39;s overpriced."

I ordered a regular medium rare cheeseburger with &#34;the works&#34; fries. Service was pretty bad this time, actually -- certainly not as good as before, but the food itself was far better. I was very pleased with  my burger -- cooked perfectly --  and the fries were the tops. My medium rare came out medium rare, which is RARE in this town, to say the least. Everything tasted very good. It was a delightful meal.

Fantastic service and delicious eats. 

Their Milk Shakes totally bring all the boys to the yard and their milk shakes are better than yours. They will also fill you up before your burger hits the table but you gotta get one. 

Burgers, so damn good! I enjoyed the Mini Park Burger on this visit and there was seriously nothing mini about it.

But the Works Fries, be still my heart. They are SO GOOD! So good I&#39;m actually kind of tired that we are getting a few orders to share amongst our group. I don&#39;t want to share anymore! I want an order all to myself!

My boyfriend and I ordered the turkey with cranberry chutney sandwich, a slice of blueberry cake, and a hot coffee.  We took the food on our trip to Rocky Mountain National Park, and the food was yummy, but I have to admit the prices were high for such small portions. The main thing that disappointed me about this place was the coffee - it was so sour!

Ya, it lands solidly in that turf. But so do some of my favorite places, so don&#39;t let the post-hipster era backlash keep you from popping in.

What you&#39;ll find is a pretty simple coffee shop and cafe with a really laid back, come and order at the counter, kind of vibe. We descended upon the place and ordered lots of all the things, and even though it was a larger group, we didn&#39;t have to wait too terribly long to get sandwiches and coffee and the like.

I don&#39;t exactly recall what I had, so that&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re not slinging some boundary-pushing meals. But it&#39;s also a sign that everything was satisfactory and I have no complaints. As a non-coffee dude, I can&#39;t comment on the brew so you&#39;re on your own there.

It&#39;s a small space, so don&#39;t go with a big group (ie do as I say, not as I did) but no matter the size of your group, I would bet they&#39;ll still be kind and courteous as they were on my trip. Just a nice neighborhood find with no pretense, and a hipster name."

Left after about five minutes and have no intention of going back.

This is probably Hipster Xanadu for people more interested in photographing their food than eating it, but I&#39;d rather go somewhere where I can count on warm service, reasonable portions, and not getting a mild concussion from the professional wrestling customer base that seems to love this spot.

I ordered their veggie patty on top of their pear and goat cheese salad. The veggie burger was homemade and satisfyingly delicious. I also got their house made cucumber soda, which I loved. You could see the fresh cucumber pulp in the glass, turning it a bright, refreshing shade of green. When I asked to take the soda to go, a young man working behind the counter graciously helped me!

It&#39;s more on the pricey side I think but it is Denver so I can&#39;t really complain plus the serving sizes are worth it. The breakfast sandwich will fill you up for sure and their breakfast burrito is the size of a Chipolte burrito which is fantastic.

Small restaurant, so be prepared to squish. Cute ambiance with employees who genuinely seem to want to be there. We opted for mimosas because the spin class was a bust and all ordered breakfast burritos. The service was quick! My negative was the lack of sauces. It was a touch hot and dry and I was hoping for some sort of cream-based something to cool it down and make it juicer, but they only had salsa. But that was the height of my troubles, so this place was awesome otherwise. 

Great prices, too! Split a little sweet from the counter afterward just to eliminate all of the hard work done in spin class. Worth it."

The menu boards are so unique and please note they do change the menu items seasonally. I went in wanting to try the French Onion Soup sandwich that I&#39;ve read so much about, but no such luck, it&#39;s only served in the winter time. Thank God my alternative, the &#34;Roasted Meatloaf &amp; Sharp Cheddar on sourdough&#34; was offered. It turned out to be the best of the three sandwiches of the visit. The breads were buttery and had panini marks. The meatloaf smelled heavenly, if only it was a thicker slice. I mean, the name is &#34;meatloaf&#34;, right? 

The &#34;Curried Chicken Salad on Ciabatta&#34; was an impulse order. The ingredients taste fresh and the curry dressing was pretty good but I&#39;d like to introduce something here: SUGAR! I believe it&#39;ll elevate the flavor of the chicken salad so much if a little bit of sugar was used.

The &#34;Grilled Cheese with Peach Chutney&#34; sandwich was a sweet ending. It was the perfect amount of sweet + savory and the texture of the chutney paired with the thick slide of cheese made the whole thing creamy, it was unbelievable!

It&#39;s a good thing that each sandwich is paired with some green salads.

I thought service could be a little warmer... When I asked for a box to take leftovers to go, they offered to pack it for me, but it kinda of grossed me out a little when the guy just came out from behind the counter and grabbed my sandwiches. I mean, who knows where his hands have been. Am I being too unreasonable? But I forgive him because he was the only one who smiled; plus he explained how to reheat the hot sandwiches!

My dad had the grilled cheese, which he said was great and although he would have never thought to add it the raisins were a nice addition, but I don&#39;t do sweets and savory together, so glad I didn&#39;t order that."

Hutch and Spoon is a spot for great for a business casual meeting or to just sit back, relax and sip on a cup of Joe while you work on your laptop. I think one of the things that makes this place feel so comfortable is the natural lighting. Sunlight comes in from two sides of the building and makes the tiny space seem a bit larger than it actually is.

I had my usual fresh brewed coffee (black). Since it was morning, I also had the hankering to order a sausage breakfast sandwich. I&#39;m happy to saw it wasn&#39;t too greasy or heavy - just a couple little links cut in half and served between two slices of toasted bread. The sausage had a touch of spice and other seasonings that definitely elevated the taste of this otherwise simple sandwich.

Also: Very friendly, courteous and helpful staff. I can always dig that. I&#39;ll have to try the house made soda next time in there."

My handy Yelp app steered me to this place, which in turn steered me to Little Man Ice Cream (based on a recommendation from the owner of Hutch &amp; Spoon). This place was just what I was in the mood for...it&#39;s a quaint little shop with salads, soups, sandwiches, homemade sodas, and pastries. I ended up ordering a grilled cheese w/ peach chutney and an almond-pear soda. The sandwich was absolutely delectable! It was pretty big, perfectly toasted, full of ooey gooey cheese, and balanced out perfectly with the sweet &amp; chunky peach chutney. Even though a grilled cheese isn&#39;t necessarily pushing the limits of the culinary world...this one was exceptionally good and executed perfectly. The sandwich was served alongside a tiny salad with a light, lemon vinaigrette...which was perfect to cut the richness from the carb/cheese overload of the sandwich.

The soda was also delicious. It was not overly sweet or carbonated. I could taste the nuttiness from the almond and a slight sweetness from the pear to make for a nice &amp; refreshing drink. I also tasted the pineapple-ginger and cherry-vanilla sodas. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the cherry one and the pineapple one was pretty tasty, but mine was my favorite. The pineapple one would be really nice in the summer since it was lighter than mine, but since it&#39;s winter, I preferred the almond-pear.

There isn&#39;t much seating here so if you come during peak hours, you may have trouble finding a place to sit. The employees do seem to clean the tables off fairly quickly as people leave, so hopefully you won&#39;t have too much of a problem because this place is definitely worth trying out (even if you have to eat your sandwich standing up)!"

H&amp;S has an awesome staff, who sure are nice, even in the wee hours of the morning AND... I have fallen for their sandwiches. Just those two things would make me give this place 4 stars, but here is my detailed breakdown...

The Grand.
I love the atmosphere - cute, cozy, artsy - perfect for RiNo
Easy-peasy street parking
My tush likes their seating
There is no cheap plastic crud here, this includes real silverware... and H&amp;S once even let me use a hand-knit coffee sleeve (so sweet!) 
Delicious eats: pumpkin bread, pesto/chk sandwich and definitely their egg &amp; feta breakfast sandwich - yum!
Not too busy, you can actually hear yourself think &amp; sip
They source their ingredients locally - locavores rejoice!

The Precautions.
They close at 4pm... which makes me a little sad.
Homemade sodas sounds cool... but they&#39;re not for everyone...

All in all, one of my fave places to visit when I&#39;m celebrating Small Business Saturdays or just for a morning pick-me-up."

The quality of taste and the freshness are totally fine.

This place is adorable, the menu is pretty substantial without being overwhelming and having multiple items i&#39;m interested in eating and trying.

I&#39;ve had a breakfast burrito - and was surprised at the price - nearly $7 for something they put in the microwave...  made me sad. 

But their lunch - mmmm! I went with the Reuben, buffalo Reuben - now where are you going to find that on a menu?  It was tasty, very lean, not chewy!

Not a ton of seating, but enough that we found a table at 12:30 on a winter friday!

I intend to work my way thru the rest of the menu, including the meatball and the italian!

I did try and italian soda which was very tasty, but i think it contained fake sugar, which as i age, sends my stomach into nasty heartburn land...  So i wont be trying any of the other flavors!

Their cucumber soda is reason enough to make a trip to this quaint spot, located on the boarder of the ballpark and rino neighborhoods.

The cucumber soda that h+s stirs up, includes a house-made simple syrup from muddled and pureed fresh cucumbers, soda water and a spoonful of ice.  The drink is effervescent from the bubbly soda and has a great crisp cucumber taste that goes down smooth.  There are other rotating soda varieties available including peach spice, black currant, pineapple-ginger and mandarin-lavender (and I have tried them all) but none are as balanced in flavor as the cucumber.

On a hot summer afternoon, this is the perfect drink to quench your thirst.  I would suggest ordering the cucumber soda along with any of the tasty sandwiches or salads h+s have to offer."

Sir Nicholas and I stopped by here over the weekend for a quick breakfast and it was wonderful. First of all the place is fairly small - I would not recommend going with a group larger than 3 otherwise seating could be tricky at best. It&#39;s a pretty narrow space that&#39;s set up more like a cafe and less like a restaurant - you order from the counter and then find a table and wait for your food.

The menu is pretty small and simple, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less delicious. There are just a handful of options for breakfast and lunch, things like breakfast burritos or egg sandwiches, hummus plates or deli sandwiches. They are all reasonably priced and the servings are too big. For example an egg and feta breakfast sandwich only cost $4, but it&#39;s not quite as big as a sandwich made with two slices of bread.

Seriously, I could put this place in my pocket and carry it around with me - which wouldn&#39;t be a half bad idea, because it is very tasty.  The menu is limited so picky eaters may not fall in love with it but it is well worth checking out if you are up in the Curtis Park/RiNo &#39;hood and have a hankering for a bite.

I had a panini with chicken pesto and feta - gah!  So very, very delicious.  They also have house-made sodas with crazy interesting flavors like mango-jasmine, black currant, and pineapple-ginger.  For some silly reason, I didn&#39;t try and of them.  I&#39;ll report back after I do.  

I don&#39;t understand how they&#39;ll be able to turn enough tables to make any money, but I hope they stick around - really tasty and worth a return visit, as the menu changes."

This place is tiny and simple in every respect. Multiple chalkboards hanging up comprise the menu, which includes plenty of vegetarian options as well as sodas made in house. (I have only tried the cucumber, and it was too sweet for me to finish the whole thing, but it was tasty.) Definitely not a good option for a large group, but perfect for lunch à deux. Service is fast and friendly.

My only gripe is the hours. I&#39;ve probably tried to pop in three times when they&#39;ve been closed (hello, Sunday after a yoga class at the studio next door)."

We stopped in here for some breakfast, post sewer scoping at the new house and en route to the Garden and Home show.  Bear in mind that we haven&#39;t moved up north yet, still live in the land of plentiful bars and restaurants, and therefore don&#39;t yet have a biased view towards the much smaller quantity of places in our new neighborhood.

That said, I&#39;m really looking forward to being near this place!

We ordered breakfast sandwiches and although small, they&#39;re only $4 and don&#39;t leave you overly full.

The standout for me is their extensive homemade soda offerings.  Out of curiousity, I went for peach spice.  Super bubbly, with a very light and fresh peachy flavor.  Just a hint of sweetness.  I can&#39;t wait to puruse all of their offerings (mango jasmine has my name on it, in particular).  You can even get them made into bellinis and the like if you&#39;re in the mood for an adult drink.  They also have a nice list of wine and local beers which would make this place a good weekend afternoon hang.

And the Italian sodas, baked goods, wine and beer make it a great spot for a relaxing afternoon meal. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience here. 

The couple of guys that work here are very sweet, always asking how you&#39;re doing, wishing you a good afternoon and when it&#39;s quiet will strike up a conversation if you desire.The service isn&#39;t lightening speed, but the food is quality and made with care which outweighs the few minutes you&#39;ll wait for your sandwich or coffee.

My oat and quinoa bowl with brown sugar, pumpkin puree, pecans and dried blueberries was delicious and filling. The acai bowls I sampled were also delectable. They add a good amount of bananas to the acai puree, which makes it nice and creamy, also naturally sweet. 

The fresh fruit add ins were a bit scarce, due to the cold season. Only mango, pineapple or kiwi. Berries would have been nice.

You pick the type of bowl you want, the type of honey to drizzle all over your bowl, and three ingredients. I, of course, got the acai base with the Colorado grown fruit honey, which I chose their triple berry honey, and a traditional style acai bowl with strawberry, banana and granola. It was very refreshing and quite yummy!

The concept of build your own has become increasingly popular. You get to choose your oat base or acai. Next you have the option of toppings and fruit and then sweetener. I had Oatmeal with strawberries and banana and honey. The warm steamed milk they pour over is what really makes these bowls. The bowls are large and very fillings. They are the perfect go to if you are on the go and need something to keep you full for a long time. My husband enjoyed his bowl as well and was sad that we could not visit again.

They have a TON of different toppings you can choose to put on your oatmeal or yogurt. I tried banana, pineapple, and granola on top of oatmeal, and it was soooo good. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The oatmeal texture was just right...not lumpy, not runny...Goldilocks would have loved it. ;)  

Overall, it&#39;s definitely worth a visit for a solid, healthy breakfast. It&#39;s almost lunchtime, and I still feel full and can probably get through the afternoon with just a small lunch (or maybe no lunch, haha)."

Being a picky eater I like the idea of customizing my own pizza/burger/froyo and now we can add oatmeal to the list. The staff was very nice in guiding me through it. You basically select a base (oat/acai/etc), a sweetener, and three toppings. They also added steamed milk to mine in addition to the three toppings. For $5 I got the small bowl which is more than enough for a filling meal. Coming here is definitely a good idea for lazy summer weekends when I&#39;d rather be out and about rather than turning on the stove and heating my already warm apartment!"

Quinoa - savory Mediterranean style - is the perfect protein packed start to a fab Saturday!  Casual quick and healthy.  Really like this unique healthy conscious  option in our neighborhood.  
And why not go the extra mile in consciousness and scratch the disposable products.  I think this lovely delightful yummy meal is worth eating from a colorful ceramic or pottery bowl.  While the paper bowl looks like it is made from recycled material, shame it gets tossed after a very short functional life.  I get not having space time or effort resources to do dishes, but food tastes better from a real dish.  
Coffee and juice not their strength.  But I will be back (with my own bowl and spoon - ha!) for the food, sweet service and nice casual atmosphere."

I have heard such great things about this place and was excited to finally try it. The first impression I got upon entering was very unwelcoming. No greeting from the employees, no smiles(except from the male working that day). When I got to the desk no one explained the process they just stared at me. I asked for an oatmeal bowl to be told I would be getting quinoa oats since they were out of regular oats. They were also out of banana. And when I asked for a substitution on the pb&amp;b since they were out of banana they told me it would be an upcharge. Upon checkout they charged me for the substitution and the oats even though I didn&#39;t have a choice there were no other options and I tried to order off menu. The cashier (middle aged blonde) was snippy and rude. My sister had said (granted she was a bit crabby and post-op but luckily after having no appetite wanted to go here) that she thought it was a &#34;bit dumb&#34; that we got charged for things we didn&#39;t really want. The checkout clerk wouldn&#39;t budge on the fact that they charged incorrect prices(not that the 3 dollars mattered it was more of a customer care as someone who works in restaurant management) and told us that &#34;we could just leave the bowls there then if we felt they weren&#39;t good enough.&#34;
I&#39;ve never felt so unwelcome at any new place. Quite frankly it was the worst first impression of a place ever. If anyone asks me I will do whatever possible to steer them away toward rush bowls instead.
Update**
The manager or someone like that with the power to respond has responded, and missed my main point. She did apologize and express that she would talk to employees, but she still didn&#39;t forgot to diss the other oat company and as a rep of a business that is a bit distasteful."

Entering, the restaurant is rather small with tables lined up along the wall and bright menu boards along the opposite wall. The servers were very helpful and helped me to decide on the Banana Toffee Malt in an oat bowl and a small White Pearl. Everything was delicious. The Banana Toffee Malt was a sweet and filling dish. The White Pearl was very sweet (because of the white chocolate sauce) and yummy. Although the White Pearl was good, it seemed overpriced and I would have been fine with just a mocha latte. 

Overall, great food, the only downfall would be minimal seating. If there is a line, it is hard to sit down without someone waiting in line behind you."

As far as beverages go, I love their fresh pressed juices and they&#39;re pretty flexible with adjusting the ingredients. I&#39;ve eyeballed the coffee/tea menu and there are some pretty good looking options but so far I&#39;ve just stuck with a juice.

I&#39;m the type of person who goes to a fo-yo place &amp; piles on all the toppings I like with out rhyme or reason as to what tastes good together.... you really need to put more thought into combinations here at Prosperaots... and there are a lot of possibilities. I tried one of the suggested combinations as to keep from making a terrible flavor choice. I would like it better if you could just get a small amount of several toppings instead of a full amount of 3 toppings.. besides that, it&#39;s reasonably priced &amp; nice employees."

They make theirs with mainly 2 green apples- pure sugar- just too much. The other veggies came from the frig which had been juiced earlier in the morning. The thing with fresh juice is to know what is going into the drink and getting it within a few minutes from the time it is juiced.  Next time I&#39;ll have the OJ instead- they have a great machine for juicing the oranges.  I still recommend coming in and supporting locally.

Bartender was busy and wasn&#39;t too friendly, but he was efficient.  I had an iced tea and their soup and salad lunch special.  The Chicken Tortilla Soup (few pieces of chicken, avocado, and a few chips) was just okay, not very tasty.  Same with the Ranch Salad which was lettuce, tomato, corn, cheese, radish, and mixed in a ranch dressing, only mediocre.

The restaurant is large and noisy.  There are tv&#39;s everywhere so you can catch a game.  They have a happy hour which includes a few of their beers, well drinks, and various appetizers."

I definitely recommend coming on for Monday Night Football as their happy hour menu extends all night long. They have a great selection of nachos, wings, pizzas, and other staple bar food items. I would get the poke nachos and the fried calamari. The calamari was not chewy, and perfectly fried in their batter. You can&#39;t beat the prices - most items range from $5 to $7."

It feels almost identical to a Cheesecake factory, as the food, prices and crowd are concerned. The food is overpriced for the quality you get. 

My fish tacos were decent but nothing I would necessarily come back for. For dessert, the fruit cobbler was good, although probably upwards of 600 calories. Our waitress was very patient with me and my dietary restrictions (no wheat, no dairy). Although she came back from the kitchen stating there was no wheat flour in the streusel topping, just nuts, I am fairly certain it did have flour in it. I took a charcoal pill at home just in case, but if I had celiac or serious food allergies, you might be looking at a 1-star  review right now."

So no matter what you are in the mood for, they probably have something to satisfy it.  

I got the spicy tuna roll and we ordered the duck wings, crispy brussel sprouts and spinach cheese dip for the table.  The crispy brussel sprouts are amazing! Duck wings are also delicious.  I loved my spicy tuna roll.. it&#39;s not like traditional sushi rolls.  It was more like a mount of yum.  More of an island shape pile of avocado layered with tuna and edamame.

Last night I tried the pizza. Just smehh definitely not the best, but it was tasty. Expect a wait on a Friday Saturday night or opt to eat at the bar! Parking is difficult at this location, but what do you expect for park meadows mall.

They have a very relaxed environment with a touch of class and refinement. For some reason, it&#39;s always dark in the restaurant. I guess it&#39;s to create a more intimate environment between tables. 

I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which is my favorite dish at Yard House. Typically the BBQ marinated chicken comes cold, so I ask for it to be warmed up. I think it tastes better with warm chicken. There&#39;s so much different things in the salad like fried onions, avocado, corn, tomatoes and a few more things. The BBQ sauce that&#39;s used is just the right amount of spicy. This has been one of my go-to dishes for years. 

I did notice that the salad was smaller this time around. I&#39;d say about 50% smaller than normal. The salad used to be a big task that could fill up the biggest of guys, but this time it was just ok. Hopefully, this was just this one occasion. I&#39;m going to be disappointed if I get the salad again and the size has been reduced."

After moving to Denver, CO due to my husband being in the military, I was excited because I found out there was a Yard House not too far from us. My first time there was HORRIBLE. I was so upset and could not understand why the server was so rude and just flat out did not care about customer service or us. I should have gotten her name, but all I remember was that she was short, thin, dark hair, tan skin and possibly of Hispanic or maybe even African American descent. We didn&#39;t even feel comfortable enough to ask her for more water or for dessert because it just seemed like she would get annoyed. She just had a rude look and would roll her eyes when asked if we could order drinks along with dinner. I wanted to speak to a manager that day, but did not want to make a scene and was already really upset and embarrassed. Even though she was rude, disrespectful, and such a horrible server I still tipped her well (which I regretted). My husband knows that&#39;s my favorite spot and wanted to take me again, but after that experience, I rather just go somewhere else or drive to a different location."

Our wait ended up being an hour or so, but it was not too bad.  I was able to get some shopping done at the mall.  Nonetheless, I enjoy coming to Yard House.

Yard house is a nice place to causally hang out with a group of friends.  They have a huge food selection and an even bigger drink menu.  There is definitely a little something for everyone.  I love ciders and compared to other breweries they have a nice selection.  Food here is not phenomenal, but good enough to satisfy any empty stomach.  Servers are also really friendly here and their happy hour specials are nice as well."

We arrived 15 minutes before happy hour ended and our server was great at letting us get our order in just before it ended.  They were out of the first beer my mom tried to order so our server came back to tell her she needed to pick a different one.  I ordered a cocktail, which was surprisingly decent.  Everyone liked their food.  I ordered the mac and cheese. It has truffle oil in it so it was a little heavier tasting than a typical mac and cheese, but I liked it.  They have a large menu, so there is bound to be something for everyone."

I was looking forward to trying the Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds but unfortunately they were out! I had Moo Sho Egg Rolls and a Spicy Tuna Roll to start out. The Spicy Tuna Roll is not your typical &#34;roll&#34; and very flavorful. The Moo Sho Egg Rolls were crispy and served with a sweet chili dipping sauce, which I did finish to the last drop. 
For the main course it was Spicy Jambalaya and Mac and Cheese. The Spicy Jambalaya was a melody of flavor and had the option of rice or linguine. I had the Jasmine rice, they also have Brown rice. The Mac and Cheese is a great combination of chicken, bacon and mushrooms with a crispy topping mixed with the cheesy noodles. I would go back again and try the Vampire Tacos, they looked delicious as well!"
yard-house-lone-tree,Morgan M.,0l1uDnyf_O0Zaj8AdKowhA,"Littleton, CO",0,1,1,1,27,3PZ2TWmUuoW1-LRZ2BRQWg,1.0,2016-02-13,"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day after being quoted a 1-2 hour wait at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated quickly, but that&#39;s about the only positive thing that came from this experience. We waited over 5 minutes to be greeted and to place our drink order. A server finally came over and explained that there was a shift change, which led to the delay in greeting. That&#39;s completely understandable. We ordered our drinks and placed an order for chicken tenders for an appetizer. I received a lemonade instead of a Dr. Pepper but that was fine because my boyfriend used it to make an Arnold Palmer with his iced tea. 

Our chicken tenders arrived and I&#39;m not sure what happened with those. The chicken in the one I had was disgusting. I couldn&#39;t finish it and my boyfriend attempted to try mine to see what was wrong but couldn&#39;t even take a bite. We told our server who said she would take it to the manager and take it off the bill. I almost wanted to leave because the chicken destroyed my appetite, but I didn&#39;t want to ruin the night for my boyfriend. 

After ordering halibut and the filet, our server came out to inform us that they were out of mashed potatoes and offered another sides instead. We both opted for salads. After ordering the salads, another server came by to say that they had mashed potatoes again (not sure how they suddenly appeared), but that we would still receive the salads and mashed potatoes with our entrees. My filet was overcooked, but at that point I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal out of another problem with the food, so I just ate it without saying anything. 

Our server&#39;s presence was basically non-existent, I&#39;m not sure where she was the majority of our meal. We finished and she brought a refill (the first and only) for my drink and cleared our plates. We then waited over 5 minutes for her to return, declined dessert, and asked for our bill. We looked around for her, at which point, a busboy came over and asked if we needed something. We told him we were waiting for the bill, so he went to look for our server. She returned at the same time as he did and when we looked at it, the chicken tenders had not been taken off. 

At this point, I was frustrated and ready to go. The busboy saw us looking at the bill and looking around and went to grab a manager for us. The manager came by and we explained about the chicken tenders and how we were under the impression we wouldn&#39;t have to pay for them. He said he would take a look in the kitchen at the other chicken tenders and take them off our bill. We waited for our change for another few minutes. It felt like our server was intentionally taking her time and avoiding us because she would disappear for minutes after each interaction. We felt bad not tipping at all, so we did leave a small tip, although it was completely undeserved. We gave the busboy the same amount as a thank you for his help. As we were leaving, our server was standing at the host stand chatting with the girls there and gave us a very insincere goodbye. 

Needless to say, we were very disappointed in our experience tonight. I appreciate that the salads were free and they took off the chicken from our bill. I understand that when a restaurant is busy, service can be slow. But tonight, 8:30-10 p.m. to be exact, it was not very busy. The service was atrocious and not up to par with Yard House standards (or so I&#39;d hope). I&#39;m disappointed we chose to celebrate our Valentine&#39;s Day here and wish we had gone elsewhere in the area. Javier the bus boy is amazing, and deserves recognition. However, our server, Klarissa, was a disappointment and I wish I knew what exactly we had done to receive the bad service from her. We will return to Yard House, but never to this specific location."

My wife ordered Tuna and I had Tacos.  Without exaggeration, we had quite possibly the worst meal we have ever had at a restaurant.  

My wife labored to cut her tuna.  We didn&#39;t even think that was possible because we have had tuna at many restaurants and have never experienced this.  The side of rice was lifeless.  It was bland and dry, which was surprising since it was supposed to be the spicy rice.  She barely made it through half the tuna and two bites of rice.  

I had three different tacos.  The swordfish taco had a foul piece of fish.  Swordfish should not have a strong fishy taste unless it is old.  The carnitas taco had promise, but the mix of flavors was not right (sorry, but pineapple on a carnitas is the wrong flavor profile).  The last taco was a haha taco.  One bite and I was done.  Again, it was a strong fishy taste.  That is bad fish.  

We were eager to put the dinner behind us by finishing off the meal with a simple dessert.  Creme Brûlée and the peach, apple cobbler.  Believe it or not, the cobbler had maybe a slice of peach and maybe two slices of apple.  It was at least 2/3 crumb topping!  There was virtually no fruit.  

The Creme Brûlée didn&#39;t even resemble the common French dessert.  The texture was somewhat chalky.  We couldn&#39;t even figure out what was in it.  It is a shame that it is even called a Creme Brûlée because there was nothing about it that resembled the dish except for the color. 

I should have listened to the promptings of the waitress to order something else for my main dish.  

In all, the food cost us $54.  Even if the meal was $20, it would not recommend it to anyone.  They have a serious quality control issue.  The fish was so foul that I would expect that they are putting people at risk."

The beers are fantastic. Great selection and their beer cocktails are yummy.

Food overall is good. A couple of dishes that didn&#39;t hit the palate but overall things are yummy.

Service...hit or miss. The bar usually has slow and sometimes unfriendly service. After a bartender snapped at my husband when he asked about the World Cup game, we left. However I did stop to speak to a manager and saw him immediately pull said bartender aside and talk to him. Table service overall has been good, just a couple of servers that struggle.

Like I said we keep coming back, so their shortcomings aren&#39;t killing the experience."

Was a Tues eve, moderately busy but not SRO.  It was 1.5 hours from the time we sat down to dinner server.  We did have appetizers but really, 1.5 hours?  They said the kitchen was backed up, but even the drinks took +10 minutes per order.  So my food was mostly cold (veggies &amp; potatoe) and steak had dried out.  They did adjust the bill but the manager never stopped by to apologize.  
And they&#39;re the only restaurant in the cluster of restaurants that won&#39;t validate the valet parking charge.

Recently, I wrote the above review titled WON&#39;T BE BACK after a bad experience. Yard House corporate must have been watching and they posted a we&#39;re-sorry-for-your-bad-experience message and eventually we got in touch with them.  Not only did they apologize with no excuses but brought us back for a make-up dinner on them.  They thanked us for a learning experience and our follow-up dinner was great.  They are now back on our list of regular restaurants. They also assured me they&#39;re working to participate in the local valet parking validation."

Yes, you&#39;re going to wait (sometimes an hour plus) if you come in for dinner on the weekend.  That said, you can often find a seat in the bar to enjoy a half yard while you wait.

After imbibing said half yard, our group got seated.  Despite the large menu, the jambalaya looked intriguing.  I asked the waitress about the level of spice and she said it was up there in terms of heat; I ordered it right away.  When it arrived I was pleased to see a pair of jumbo (like U-12) prawns sitting on top of the noodles.  I&#39;ll give credit where credit is due, the waitress hit it right on head, it was spicy.  Not overpowering heat, just a nice counterbalance to the dish.

Minus the wait, which really isn&#39;t their fault, Yard House was a very good dinner stop."

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve also heard the old saying about what happens when you assume. 
I&#39;ve avoided this place for a while because I am not a beer drinker and most beer pub concepts  have a huge selection of beers and a menu consisting of the tried and true (read: tired) favorites. *yawn*
Sure, the Yard House has a long list of beers, ciders (for the love of peat, can you all add some Magners or Strongbow so we have an alternate to the syrupy &#34;seasonal&#34; flavors?), and cocktails... but they also have a rather intriguing menu that actually had me indecisive about what to order. 
Duck fat kettle chips? Pork poutine? Pastrami Benedict burger? Street tacos? Decent vegetarian options? SO MANY CHOICES. Some interesting combinations and flavors elevated the usual brewpub fair. Bravo. I would say I&#39;d not be upset with a pared down menu - just how big is the kitchen to prep it all? Our server, Kristin (who&#39;s the bomb diggety, btw) said it was a 90% scratch kitchen. Pretty awesome.
Service was great, food was tasty - Kristen made the experience even better. She&#39;s a treasure, Yard House, you want to keep that one happy. 
If you&#39;re in the Park Meadows area, I&#39;d say check this place out.

We were seated immediately and Jeremy our waiter was super nice.   I wanted a simple lunch after spending time checking out the extensive menu I finally figured out I would just have a burger.  

I went with the simple BBQ Bacon Burger.   It is Easter so I needed a little pork in my life.   

This was a darn good burger.  The bacon was nice and thick and plentiful.  It was cooked a perfect medium and was terrifically juicy.   It was served with a pile of truffle fries for an additional charge of course.  But is there really any other way to have fries if they are offered in this manner.  

It&#39;s nice to know that they serve a lunch menu daily (even weekends)  Unfortunately  my lunch hour is too early to take advantage of most places except once a week.  

It doesn&#39;t seem to be a place I would go out of my way to make sure I visit once a week but I will get back eventually.  I&#39;m not a beer drinker and this seems to be a great place for those who are."

I then had a grapefruit and tequila cocktail, well blended on ice.  Okay, I had more than one!  The service was fantastic!

We decided to eat at the bar, as the restaurant was packed.  The service again was fantastic.  I had the wasabi-crusted salmon with mashed potatoes, and a ginger sauce.  The dish had a great flavor profile.  The salmon was a little overcooked, but not much, and the flavor was still great.  I wished for more sauce, as it was delightful, but it left me wanting more.  The salmon was topped with delicately thin fried sweet potatoes (I think), and it was not only beautiful, it was tasty.  My friend had the jambalaya, which she enjoyed.  I had a bite and found it quite delicious, great Cajun flavors represented.  We shared the butterscotch pudding with salted caramel sauce - and it was delicious, as well.  I love the juxtaposition of sweet with salty.

It isn&#39;t perfect; they aren&#39;t reinventing the wheel here, but the food is consistent, and the service is generally good. 
One thing I love about this place? The size and breadth of their kids&#39; menu. My kids aren&#39;t super picky, but they get tired of the same &#34;burger, chicken fingers, grilled cheese&#34; options everywhere we go. They have thoughtfully imagined choices, and there is something to interest my kids even on their least-motivated days. 

Value: The meals I&#39;ve had have always been delicious, though possibly a little overpriced. I&#39;d rather pay $1-3 extra per person for a consistent product, though, so I&#39;ll take it any day. 

Food Favorites: the four-cheese grilled cheese with tomato soup (ah-mazing!), the steak-and-blue-cheese salad, and the burgers. Yum. 

Service: while it isn&#39;t my favorite part of the experience every single time, I have had decent service. I had one server who was excellent, and the rest were &#34;just fine.&#34; Never had any problems.

Atop the fish was a pile of fried carrot &#34;fries&#34;. My mind was blown. What a unique concoction! And an added bonus: it was delicious, truly exemplary.

Unfortunately, everything else about my dinner was unexceptional, bordering sub-par. The fried calamari for starter lacked the crunchiness I anticipated. The brownie dessert was under-cooked. The wait before we ordered, the wait to order our dessert, the wait to receive our dessert, the wait for the bill - I was hungry again by the time I left. Obviously an exaggeration, but the point is made."

Ryan Tedder mentioned how he loved The Yard House before leaving the stage. We thought the same thing and headed that way for a late dinner. After going over the menu multiple times, I landed on the salmon. It was a ginger crusted Norwegian salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes, snow peas, and carrots covered in a spicy peanut vinaigrette. I felt like the snow peas and carrots were overwhelming for the dish, but the salmon and potatoes were perfect. They were cooked extremely well.  Brian got the blackened swordfish tacos. All of the flavors of the fish, mango and papaya came together to make an excellent taco. Great food, great beer and fantastic service!"

For the first time in 35 years, we walked away without tipping.  I have NEVER done that and frankly am a bit shocked that my husband did.  Given our personalities - I would be voted the most likely to not tip.  And this over a piece of bread. Yes - bread.  Hubby was in the mood for a bowl of soup.  But hubby can&#39;t have his soup w/out bread.  So he asked our server if he could get bread w/ his soup and the server said of course!   Well the bread never showed - 30 + minutes hubby tried to get some bread - asking our server 3 times and the person who delivered the food once.  Nothing.  Soup went cold and not only did we not get the bread - we didn&#39;t even get an offer for something else or at least a warm bowl of soup.  We had to ask for the soup to be removed from the bill.  If bread was such a difficult request to fill - if our server had simply said...no, sorry we aren&#39;t able to serve bread w/ your soup...hubby would have ordered something different.

I thought happy hour menu items would be tiny considering the price but they were huge! The $6 wings came on a bed of purple cabbage and amounted to 8-10 wings! They have 3 sauce options: firecracker (sweet Asian zing), buffalo &amp; Jamaican jerk rub. The garlic noodles were very buttery &amp; were more like a pasta as opposed to the garlic noodles you get @ Asian restaurants. It came with chicken, pieces of asparagus &amp; a ton of mushroom! The space is moody &amp; modern &amp; the beer/cider/alcohol list is huge! It&#39;s adjacent to the mall so it makes for a great post mall night cap place.

In reviewing my Yelp activity, I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t checked in, or reviewed it even once - so here it goes!  The beer list is awesome, and their happy hour is grood.  (Not a typo, I really want to say &#34;great&#34; - but can&#39;t get the word out, so lean on ending at &#34;good.&#34;)  Why, you ask?  When the bill comes, it is always just a little more than I expect for what seems like a good deal at the time I am ordering and drinking.  Secondly (and this is not just for beer-thirty) regardless of time, location, lunar or solar positioning, etc., there is a &#34;shift change&#34; mid-dining or drinking experience.  It&#39;s just awkward.  But, back to the first comment - beer selection is unparalleled, and rarely, rarely, rarely, does one labor over the extended beer list, only to order and be told, &#34;sorry, we&#39;re out.&#34;  (One of my pet peeves, that has not happened here!)  My &#34;hint&#34; for the unwieldy menu...all of the food is delicious, and the presentation is impressive.  Before you even GLANCE at the menu, I mean even PEEK - know what you do not want, and do NOT look at that section of the menu.  If you don&#39;t want pizza - that&#39;s ok!  Not feelin&#39; a salad?  Leave it for the rabbits - don&#39;t look!  Looking at what you don&#39;t want will only tempt and confuse you because the combinations and descriptions are all appetizing.  Think about what you are in the mood for at the time (mexican, asian, sandwich, hefty entree, mix of apps, pasta, etc.,) and stay focused!!!!  If you try to choose from the vast menu, you&#39;ll end up with order envy (or order regret) - I promise.  Plan to come back again when you are craving something else!  The quality of the food is outstanding and always fresh (hot if it&#39;s supposed to be hot; not if it&#39;s not); portions are large (thankfully, because it isn&#39;t cheap).  Sometimes it gets loud, particularly when it is busy, so if you are down for an intimate conversation, pick somewhere else (or snuggle up on the same side of a comfy booth); and it is a bit dark - two things to keep in mind if you are planning a business lunch.  Interestingly, and as a couple other Yelpers have commented, sitting at the bar is sweeeeet - even if you are not alone.  Bartenders are always friendly and attentive, and keep a &#34;running tab&#34; in front of you so when you are ready to pay, you can.  If you eat at the bar, they use a big napkin as a &#34;tablecloth&#34; and the bar isn&#39;t framed in a way that makes it difficult to eat.  When it gets crowded, it&#39;s close - super close.  Although there are TV&#39;s, particularly around the bar, it does not have a cheesy sports-bar vibe.  To me, it is more about the drinks, food, and music - the music selection is awesome, always.  There will be a wait, if you show during busy hours - it is worth it (if you have the time), and every time I have been there with a wait - the pager goes off in no more time than promised!  Bathrooms are always clean, cloth napkins, properly uniformed staff, manager makes his or her rounds, consistently good service, quickly bussed tables, no charge for soda water today!!!  Worth a try - regardless of where!"

You can count on the Yard House to satisfy even your most picky eaters as well, because the menu is massive. There are no reasons to think the food items are gourmet, but you can count on a solid meal as a reasonable price. And if the food sucks, then you can drown your liver in so many beers that it becomes very hard to chose.

Pay close attention to the rotating menu of on-tap beers, because there are some delicious options you may not find anywhere else in the city.

I&#39;m half tempted to give a one star deduction for the outrageous prices.  The food is good, but not really any more special than other chains like Elephant Bar.  A pint of beer will set you back $6, and some salads and other entrées are easily $17.

It was too busy for our waiter to get back to us in a timely manner, so we had to go without. And I don&#39;t blame the waiter for this, I blame management for understaffing. They also changed the presentation of their food and it just isn&#39;t as nice as it used to be. I think this place may be under new management, and they totally suck. It seems like service is going downhill. I used to love this place but not so much anymore.... They also don&#39;t give you salt and pepper on the table.... ????? Why all the changes? You shouldn&#39;t change a good thing...,,"

We had very good service, very good food and fantastic beer. They had a large food selection, including vegetarian options. I&#39;m a meat eater, so I had seafood and it was very tasty.

We mainly went there for the beer. They have a very large selection and you can get beers in three different sizes, so if you want to try many, you don&#39;t have to commit to large glasses. They also have quite a few lambics to choose from and that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen a restaurant in Colorado that had that.

They told me they don&#39;t take reservations but we were able to do call-ahead seating and avoid a long wait.

The soufflés are very tasty but small. That would be my only criticism."

It&#39;s clear that the people working there are incredibly invested in the success of the business--the pride and pleasant attitudes were great to see.

The wings...were amazing!  The finish on the grill makes a huge taste treat.

We got teriyaki, Cajun dry rub and one I think was called smoking hot. That had major heat for 2 very experienced guys who eat ridiculously hot food regularly!

The wings came out perfect. The sauces were on point except the lemon pepper wings needed more seasoning. Carrots and celery were cold and fresh and the ranch was cold.

Found a couple of good possibilities here on Yelp but decided to go with the ratings and they were right.

Usually my brother and I go for the melt your face off kind of wings, as long as they taste good. GWT has a good variety of sauces, not the Triple Atomic or Chernobyl level but a good variety. And as you have seen from the posted pictures, they bring you a sampling tray which I think is a really smart idea.

We ended up ordering a couple dozen wings so we could get 4 sauces, one dozen pig wings, 2 sauces and I think it was an order of 10 of the jumbo shrimp.

I&#39;ll start with the staple, the wings. I love grilled chicken but I have never grilled wings. And in the variety of sauces they were all really good. The pig wings were delicious as well. The jumbo shrimp, AWESOME! They were huge, truly JUMBO. and of course you get a sauce with them. They were delicious!

I already started thinking on Sunday what I will order the next time I go there. :)"

I tried both the chicken and the pig wings, and do prefer the chicken wings. Fried, then grilled. (Having that char gives a lovely illusion that they&#39;re prepared in a lower-fat manner, despite the underpinnings!) I had an extremely enthusiastic and responsive server.

I see that I am in the minority here so let me explain why I won&#39;t be back. First off, I found the sample sauce platter to be really gross as the SAME platter and the sauces are shared with multiple tables. The waiter explained this and there&#39;s even a sign on the platter saying not to double dip. I find this really gross! Who knows who else sampled the same exact same sauces and what they did while the platter was at their table. Also, the celery and carrots that were provided with the sauces where limp and pale in color. 

The wings themselves were OK - nothing spectacular, in my opinion. We also tried the onion rings and I didn&#39;t find them to be anything beyond average. 

It is important to note that my husband was with me, and while he was also grossed out by the sauce platter, he liked the wings more than I did. So, it is possible that I have different tastes than the majority, but I stand by the fact that the sauce sample platter is just plain gross and unhygienic."

I think they should leave the sauces at the counter though. Can&#39;t imagine health department being ok with that. I would rather go up to try sauces that I know is cleaned and being monitored."

Wings were good but nothing really made them stand out to me. I think next time I would try them with dry seasonings. We also had the grilled shrimp which were very good and a nice addition to a wing meal. The pig wings were great. Very meaty and tasty with the sauce we chose, hot honey. I also think these would be good with dry rub seasonings. As a side dish we got the jalapeño caps. They are deep fried pieces of jalapeño. Not super hot, just right.

I was at a doctors appointment with the hubs in the local area and decided to.stop by today for lunch. Had some chicken tenders and some pig wings. Oh my, what could those be?  Well, according to our waiter extraordinaire, Jason, it&#39;s a shank and we couldn&#39;t leave without ordering some. They were certainly a wonderful surprise. Jason greeted us from the bar area and immediately assisted us with drink orders and brought out a tray of 15 to 20 different sauces to try with small strips of carrot and celery. It was hard to make the choice.  We liked so many, but narrowed it down to one sweet and one spicy. The iced tea and Coke refills kept coming without having to ask. The food was served quickly and piping hot. We ordered the lunch specials, the quality of the chicken breast for the tenders was off the chain. Those pork wings were fat and gristle free and fall off the bone delicious. (Pictures included).    We&#39;re definitely coming back.  Jason says not to miss the shrimp, and we won&#39;t. The chicken portions were offered either battered or grilled which was nice to hear. I ordered battered this time and could taste the underlying lime flavor, Jason was extremely knowledgeable on all of the preparations and the sauces and explained that the batter is chipotle lime based, yet it was mild and flavorful and not bland. The french fries were well seasoned. We can&#39;t wait to go back and sit out on their fully covered patio as we did today. Parking is ample and it is a couple doors down from Sweet tomatoes, &amp; easy to find from that reference point. Food was terrific, but the star of the day was definitely Jason, the on the ball, one-man show during today&#39;s lunch hour. He was so friendly and answered all of our questions and made great suggestion for us.  There were people at several other tables, yet none of us were ignored and we all appeared to have excellent service.  Great job Jason!!!!!"

They start you off with a tray so you can sample all of their sauces, which was really cool and definitely changed my mind on a couple of sauces that I was going to get. Once you order wings, they are fried tossed in the sauce of your choosing THEN grilled! So the wings are not covered in sauce when you get them. They tend to have more of a background flavor but they do provide extra sauce on the side if you like! (Which I do). The wings are delicious and very crispy, and if you buy 2 beers you get your wings at half off!! What a good reason to drink!, service was amazing, and just for funzies I got a desert (deep fried brownies) since they sponsors the Broncos, and they were great!! I will definitely be going back! Side note! The dry rumba are VERY dry! Stick to sauces!"

The reason for one star, the service.  Consistently bad...

I have yet to have a good experience.  The wait staff seems overwhelmed and not excited to see you.  

We came today with a large party, around 20 people.  We were greeted by a guy with a beard that was t excited to see us.  He had us sit outside on a cool day with out the heat on initially.  

He was irritated to help and was quite short with every response.  

I would not recommend.  Go to the original in Bonnie Brae. 

We will take our business somewhere else."

The &#34;pig wings&#34; were especially tasty, and I like them better than traditional chicken wings. I do wish that they had boneless options that weren&#39;t fingers, but to be fair, we didn&#39;t try the fingers/strips, so they may be good. The service was good, and the only negative thing was that the atmosphere was very quiet and subdued, despite having 6-7 tables full. We&#39;ll definitely give it another try."

We enjoyed both the taste and the presentation all of the dishes we ordered.  The portion size was big enough - we ordered a fair amount of food and definitely had a couple of meals of leftovers to take home.  The menu had some unique options and some tasty sounding seasonal dishes that we will need to come back to try.  We decided to try an appetizer since we visited during happy hour - $2 dollars off select appetizers.  We ordered the fried wontons with chicken.  They had good flavor and were a nice bite to start off our meal.  I also ordered a bowl of Tom Yum soup to start as well.  I thought the broth was very rich and had good spice.

Though it&#39;s tucked in a small, non-descript shopping center, the interior is contemporary &amp; cozy.  The wait staff were pleasant and attentive, and at first blush it seemed at first like it could become our new fave Thai joint.  

However, I&#39;m afraid it doesn&#39;t quite fit the bill.  And by that, I mean that their prices &amp; a la cart style menu do not match the clientele they will surely attract considering their location.  All in all, we felt the bill was way too high for four people, and we didn&#39;t appreciate that they charged extra for rice.  When you order curry, rice is expected.  

It&#39;s the little things that bugged me about this place.  Therefore, I can&#39;t bring myself to give it more than 2 stars, and I likely won&#39;t be back."

Having experienced a wide variety of Thai cuisine in so many settings (our family is American/Thai bi-cultural) we know when to take note. 

Lakewood! You need to wake up and keep this place busy!  If you don&#39;t they will go away and you will be stuck with nothing but corporate machine food. 

First thing: the menu was nothing like I had ever seen. Most Thai restaurants ply the same fare; not Citizen Thai Bistro. They chart their own course.  A long time Thai food aficionado, I didn&#39;t recognize most of their menu. 

I ordered the Peppercork pork. Wow! What a masterful dish. The pork was thinly cut, and the sauce was out of this world crazy unique and delicious. It comes with egg plant (which I normally hate). But somehow they found a way to make it the best part. Really! Egg plant you say? Yes! Absolutely, for yet first time in my life I relished egg plant! 

Going further the decor was pleasant, modern, chic, and very Thai. 

The service was timely, and perfect. 

What else can I say?

If you&#39;re into Thai food than this is the place to go.  I am not a fan of spicy food but I would say that getting spicy adds the right amount of flavor to the food.

First let me explain that the decor is presentable, a little too bright for dinner. We were greeted by a stressed out staff, there were 2 tables. Then a waiter eating dinner got up and took our order, very tacky on management. We ordered red curry Thai hot, which the waiter said was hotter than most. My boyfriend ordered Spicy Sweet Basil Thai hot also. 25$ later we got home anticipating our dinner and we&#39;re terribly saddened. The curry had 3 bell peppers 5 pieces of chicken and extra water to make the curry. A couple chili flakes was the call for Thai hot. The Sweet Basil for 12$ was ok but for 4$ a McDonald&#39;s happy meal would feel you up more. Good luck."

Unique combination of authentic taste (hard to find in the Rocky Mountain area) and creativeness (new variations on Thai traditionals such as noodles added to Tom Yum soup and artistic mango with sticky rice). Cocktails are also unique and include Thai elements like lychee martini. Had the Green Curry which was excellent and the right spice level for medium. Atmosphere was good as the renovations make it very Thai like.

A little in the pricey side, but the food and service are excellent. Food is fresh, creative, and delicious with an eye to seasonal specials. Updated casual urban chic decor. 

While we particularly enjoyed the Mango Prawn Salad App, Heaven Beef Roll App, Summer Salmon Curry, Spicy Thai Pan Fried Noodles, and Emerald (Pandan Leaf) Sticky Rice with Mango, I suspect you can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu. My only reservation was the Tom Yum Soup which was good but did not the best I&#39;ve ever had. My discerning teen son also really enjoyed the Roast Duck Noodle Soup. 

My younger son literally picked up his plate &amp; started licking it. While I generally discourage that kind of behavior, I seriously considered  joining him. 

Lots of gluten-free and dairy-free options (which is why I eat a LOT of Thai food) , with GF being conveniently labeled on the menu."

We asked for mild food and it was just right, and considering some recent experiences with too spicy food elsewhere, that was great. Soda options are limited, but they seem to have a good bar.

This restaurant is a created Thai oasis; Comfortable, modern and accented with notes of Thai culture. You would expect some kind of fusion place, some trendy dishes with a little heat, or someones impression of Thai.

Tasting the food will dispel all illusions. This is authentic Thai cuisine. After my first bite of Pad See You, everything changed. The meal we ate was a labor of love, carefully constructed to be Thailand. Not a copy, or a version. This is Thai food; Create by a chef who&#39;s attention to flavor will have you pricing airfare to the Far East.  

You can probably nitpick, but I have never been disappointed by a meal there. And it&#39;s always a little better than I expect. 

The Egg Noodle with Wonton Soup is not to be missed. And the classic Pad Thai is just that: Classic, yet just a little bit better than everywhere else.

The good: the food! They&#39;re serving above average tasting Thai food that has a pretty presentation and very solid flavors. 

The bad: the prices. Everything on the menu is at least $3-5 more than it should be. The prices are already too high for all the entrees and then you have to add $3 more for any protein? That would barely fly downtown and it certainly won&#39;t in the suburbs. Also - the seating arrangement is strange and lacking privacy. Plus there is no kids menu - which is going to eliminate this as a choice for a lot of clientele in this area. There were a few minor &#34;new restaurant&#34; things too - like my meal coming out 5 minutes before my date&#39;s - and no silverware being provided until we had to flag down our waiter. 

If they lower the prices (pretty substantially to be honest) and work out a few kinks - this could be a great addition to the neighborhood."

I had the chicken Tom Kah ($14) and it was extremely sweet. I mean so sweet you could make a dessert or even ice cream out of it. It literally was the grossest soup I have ever eaten! Oh and they stick about a whole tomato in your soup which makes it seem like you are getting a much bigger portion then usual. This is my favorite soup and I have eaten it at restaurants all over the U.S. and nothing comes close to being as sweet as this place&#39;s soup. I could only eat 4 bites before having to throw it away. Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of money and it was pricey too. Now, I also tried the shrimp Pad Thai ($15) which was okay. It was definitely a smaller portion compared to most restaurants and it wasn&#39;t anything to write home about, but decent. Then, there are the fried wontons ($6) which barely had any protein in them, huge disappointment. They might have tasted good if there was any filling in them to taste. Overall, very disappointed in the food. If you want good Thai food try somewhere else but here. If you want to spend a lot of money on subpar food then go here.

Started with a couple of beers, not the best selection of beers but if you like sours, you find the right spot.

For appetizers we had the duck poutine fries and bone marrow. The fries were great, the duck and cheese curds matched the gravy perfectly and I would have been content just eating that. The bone marrow was pretty standard but be sure to dunk your fingers, I mean bread, into the juices underneath the bone, they are outstanding.

For our main dish, we had the chicken schnitzel and the bone in pork chop (a special). The chicken schnitzel was good and had a nice apple slaw on it, nothing overpowering but added a nice layer of flavoring. I wish that the sandwich came with some sort of side (not that we needed it), it just kind of looked lonely on the plate. The pork chop was flat out stunning. It was cooked to perfect, came sitting in a tomato bisque which was awesome and included a goat cheese curd. I could eat everything on that dish all day long. 

Overall a great spot, I would certainly revisit and only a short 5 minute walk from the Pepsi center."

After the overly commercialized disappointment that was the 16th Street Mall, we were desperate for something authentically Denver. We decided to make the walk down to Euclid Hall, with fingers crossed, and not too high of hopes. Turns out, this place was a gem. Just turn the corner and you leave the national chains behind, and find the gray bricked building tucked away in a corner of downtown, with just a glimpse of Mile High Stadium in the background. We immediately were happy with our choice. There is a small set of stairs that leads you up into the dining area. A genuine smile greeted us and we were shown to our corner booth. The industrial feel combined modern and throw-back into a perfectly relaxing setting, and we were ready to settle in with a beer. 
Our server made great suggestions, and we opted for a few choices we hadn&#39;t seen in our own area. This was off to a great start, and finally we felt as though we were on vacation. The star of the menu is clearly the selection of fresh poutine. We saw several large parties who ordered nothing but these dishes....we opted to try house made sausages which came with a variety of mustards at varying grains and heat levels. Grilled to perfection, with a touch of char and a bite to the casing.....oh so good!!! We also had an order of cheese curds that were stellar. Out of this world, oh my gosh, where have you been all of my life stellar. I can practically taste them now, nearly a month later, as I think back. 
Euclid Hall is the real deal and we already have plans to return.....as soon as we get back to Denver."

The decor and atmosphere of this restaurant and bar was so unique and trendy. But the menu, the menu is where it&#39;s at. Talk about putting a spin on the typical comfort food. 

Let me start by this, our appetizer was pig ear pad thai. I think overall the group wasn&#39;t too thrilled. It was something the about the texture. But the flavor was on point. 

I&#39;m not going to lie, the thought of bone marrow didn&#39;t exactly make my mouth water, but my co-worker was quite nice in preparing a sample bite for me. The flavor was good. it was like flavorful fat on top of bread with some drizzle on top. HAHAH Ok I know that was cheesy but I don&#39;t know how else to describe this. 

We pretty much had a sample tasting of everything. The poutine was delicious. We had a lamb one and the green chili one. The green chili one was my favorite. It was very flavorful and not too salty. I also LOVED the fried green tomatoes and mozzarella and grape tomato dish. 

I had the &#34;Spunky&#34;, I think that was the name, for my drink. It featured a bit of IPA, which is my favorite type of beer and Bullet bourbon. I loved it. The flavor was delicious, not too sweet and very refreshing. I think the crowd was a little too upity and trendy for my liking but all in all, I had a great time and I look forward to going back."

If you have never had Bone Marrow then I&#39;d suggest you try it here, it&#39;s like butter! The pig ears are yummy as well, if you don&#39;t mind eating pig ears! We also ordered the Chefs special which was 1 pound Ribeye cooked to perfection and tender like nothing I have tasted before.

The selection is pretty small and sausage definitely takes up a pick part of the menu. However, I was pleased with the choices I went with which were the Rocket Salad and White Cheddar Spaetzl. The spaetzl was very rich and could definitely be shared or be your main entree even though it was offered as a side dish. Its almost like a take on mac and cheese. The Rocket Salad comes with a piece of brie and made a good combo with the tangy/sweet dressing. 

The menu changes all the time, so the items I listed may not even be there when you read this review. This place can accommodate large groups and has a full bar!"

We got to Larime Square around 11:00 pm and started looking for the available options. We called a few places and luckily Euclid Hall bar and kitchen was the only one that their kitchen was open at that time; and we decided to go there.

My first impression was very warm and welcoming. One of the servers leads us to our table and familiarizes us with the menu and she also made a few recommendations for alcoholic drinks.
From the food menu, we ordered chicken schnitzel sandwich, fries, and Brat Burger; both were amazing and tasty. 
They have an amazing selection of wines, beers, and cocktails. We ordered Epic Escape to CO IPA and Coyote Lovely; both were fantastically refreshing. 

The next thing that I liked the most was the unique design, decoration, and dim lighting of the bar."

When we arrived to Denver International Airport  it was after 10pm and not so many places were open. We decided to go somewhere close to q6th street and we arrived to Euclid hall around 11:15 and the food was on the table in about 20 minutes. 
I ordered the brat burger it was really delicious. The burger was cooked enough to be juicy but not overcooked. 
The place itself is cozy, I liked the industrial look specially the lamps where to most interesting features to me.
There is also another level upstairs which is  brighter and not as cozy as downstairs. 
The overall experience was good enough to make me go back again if I decide to visit Dever one day"

I got one of their sausage dishes as well as a side order of poutine and I was very happy with both choices. The only thing I don&#39;t like about New American restaurants are the portion sizes compared to what you are paying. Although the food was enough to fill me up for the time being, I found myself hungry again within the hour. I would recommend coming here while in town just to give it a try, but it wouldn&#39;t be a place that I would often frequent. They do seem to have a cool happy hour though that would be worth checking out. When we were there, there were tons of people there that were holding after work business meetings. 

I think for a larger, louder crowd, the second floor is where you want to be. The first floor seemed a little small and sleepy to me, but luckily when we arrived our waitress brought us upstairs where it was much livelier. You get a better view of the city, and you can also look down onto the first floor from the second floor balcony."

We order the pig ear pad thai, fries, elote style corn, and a burger (forgot the name)
I really enjoyed the pad thai but be aware it does not have any noodles. I thought it would have noddles and just few pig ear grinds but they replaced the noodles with the pig ear.
I thought it was weird at first but I really enjoyed it.

Honestly, this would have been a 5-star experience, but the lack of vegetarian options made me withhold a star out of spite.

But I ordered the fried green tomato caprese with ranch instead of caesar and it was phenomenal. The biscuit/roll/pretzel with a weird name was underwhelming - I&#39;ve had better bread. My colleague loved the carnitas poutine."

We tried the duck poutine, beef short rib kielbasa, chicken &amp; waffles, and the butcher&#39;s cut (rabbit confit with risotto). The sausages could have used more flavor, but everything else was delicious, especially the duck poutine, which was a perfect combination of crunchy fries, savory gravy, melted cheese, and tender pieces of duck. 

On a side note, the portions are definitely on the smaller side, and we left just slightly unsatisfied, but I guess sometimes you trade quality for quantity. All in all, would definitely come back."

With so many positive reviews Euclid bar &amp; kitchen hall definitely hit a home run on this visit. Wasn&#39;t expecting too much for this dinner apart from trying something new and see what Denver had to offer, and was not disappointed at all
After a long day at work and new city (from Houston) I decided to go out and try something different and came across place to go to eat in Denver and this restaurant came up. If you did the same thing and this come up don&#39;t hesitate and just come : 
Waiter was extremely polite and attentive . I told him that&#39;s this my first time here and ask his recommendations. This is what he came up. 

1. Half an order of the chips and dip
2. Half an order of the pad Thai pig ears

He pair them with s local beer (sadly I didn&#39;t get to write down but extremely amazing pairing thought )

The chips and dip with the dug and goat cheese AND the beer (which brought the goat cheese to another level btw) - was superb

The pig ears....ohh my god ....they paired with these local beer (IPA - dark) heaven 

---
3. Beef marrow bones - you simply have to try it for yourself. Please note that this is not for everyone, more on the fatty side but seasoning and pairing just brings the whole night together. Keep an open mind on these one 

----


There was a review about waiter just not being there, at the start they where extremely attentive but once you start i did notice that it take longer to get a hold of them BUT I personally liked it because they leave you alone to enjoy and savor the food and enjoy the moment...I was here over 2 hours and it was totally amazing ...

For dessert white chocolate chip blondie, a perfect ending to a perfect dinner 

Highly recommend them and will be back on my next trip to Denver."

They do not take reservations but they do let you call ahead and put your name down. Then just show up around the time they quote. I really wish more places would do this. 

Service was excellent and friendly. Menu was fancied German style pub food.

Duck Poutine - $14.50 - I could not find the duck or cheddar churds when eating this. Fries and gravy were good but it got boring after a few bites. 

Sausage Tasting - $17.50 - Lamb was the best and short rib was also good. They were both pretty salty. I did enjoy the Boudin (blood sausage) but my group did not. Mustard that came with it was really good. I liked spicy the most. 

Beef Marrow Bone - $10 - Really rich. Big bone with a good amount of marrow. The demi and gastrique helped cut the fatty richness of the marrow. Good bite to share. 

White Cheddar Spaetzle - $5.50 - Spaetzle had that perfect chew to it. House made whiz was creamy and cheesy. Very similar to mac and cheese. 

Jameson &amp; Ginger - $7 - Not a bad price."

Euclid hall. We came here because we wanted a few beers and we heard they had a decent happy hour. True. They have a pretty decent decent selection of craft beers for $3.50, and they have a real nice selection of rotating taps! Crooked stave was on their rotators, as well as Stone enjoy by. But you really can&#39;t beat a milk stout on nitro for 3.50...

The ambiance of this place is really cool, open kitchen which is awesome, a little hipsterish, I felt like we were in Seattle. It was fancy hipster (Seattle) not grunge hipster (Portland) I personally really liked it!!

Ugh my only problem was that we weren&#39;t hungry... :( all of the food looked so amazing. We sat at the bar which was right next to the open kitchen and where the food came out so we got a real good look at a lot of things on their menu. We did spilt a sausage, because I&#39;m German, and who can turn down a few bites of sausage, if you know what I mean! I seriously can&#39;t wait to come back to actually try a bunch of their food. The white cheddar spätzle are definitely on my radar! The green chili poutine looks amazing.

Having enjoyed the Brat Burger before, I elected to try the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich coupled with the Cast Iron Veggies.  The sandwich was disappointing.  I was sold on the grilled jalapeno cheddar bread, but I couldn&#39;t decipher a hint of either when I bit into the sandwich.  The patty was nothing special and the slaw only slightly redemptive.  The fries our table shared were delightful especially with that naughty bacon aioli.  The Cast Iron veggies were also phenomenal.  

I enjoyed a Duchesse de Bourgogne Flemish Sour as well as a blood orange sour (the name escapes me).

So much duck! The frozen shaved duck on top of the nachos (It was a while ago...) was a really neat addition to the dish.

Owned by the team behind Rioja with an expansive two-story space just a short walk away from Coors&#39; Field, it was on the recommendation of a local friend that dinner after the 2016 Stadium Series Alumni Game was sought at Euclid Hall, a reported 45 minute wait circumvented by upstairs bar seating where service was not unexpectedly fair-to-middling, while the inspired bar food was an across-the-board success.

No doubt a popular space amongst the 20-to-35 crowd, a sizable craft beer list and housemade sausages harkening concepts commonly seen at trendy spots from The Big Apple to LA, Euclid Hall ups the ante on traditional &#39;gastropubs&#39; by additionally offering a wide-ranging menu of inspired European and American classics running the gamut from salads and sandwiches to full-size plates and pastas, each taking a twist on tradition with no lack of innovation in plating or approach.

Opting to place our order in rounds, a wise choice as not to overwhelm the countertop though an issue as relates to expediting with both kitchen and bar running at full-tilt, dinner began with three plates of house-prepared meats, the sausage sampling highlighted by traditional Mortadella as well as smooth Blood Sausage redolent with Curry while the Rillette and Duck Liver were equally well crafted with the former particularly impressive when spread atop crisp pretzels crowned by a dollop of pureed pear and mustard seeds.

Told that transected cow bones are something of a signature, the blowtorch brûlée rendering tops glassy while fat beneath remains spreadable and rich, another great bit of offal is offered in the form of seared Veal Sweetbreads atop tender risotto, the flavors of winter brought to the forefront through the use of pureed pumpkin and pear slices with textural contrast built by toasted sunflower seeds.  

Unable to resist the concept of an atypical &#39;pasta&#39; crafted from pigskin ribbons tossed with belly bacon, peas, and an egg to form a makeshift Carbonara that is every bit as decadent as it sounds, our final savory was actually offered on the house as the result of a long delay due to kitchen error, the &#34;Chicken and Waffles&#34; better than most as a thinly pounded breast was served schnitzel-style on either side of puffy sourdough triangles with a sidecar of pure maple syrup.

Unwilling to forego dessert, the options riffing Americana without entering the rare air of refinement seen in Eric Dale&#39;s Rioja plates, those opting for a sweet finish at Euclid Hall are nonetheless presented with tough decisions, the &#34;Funnel Cake-fried&#34; Banana Split unfortunately not quite as interesting as it sounds while a Molten Chocolate Chip Blondie presents like Bread Pudding below melting Bailey&#39;s Ice Cream, the S&#39;mores Pot de Crème eating like the world&#39;s smoothest pudding beneath lightly toasted marshmallows and graham crackers prime for dunking."

This restaurant has an incredible variety. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of anything adventurous (I mean, I don&#39;t even like chicken) but I was impressed with their menu. Bone marrow, duck poutine, frogs legs, escargot. They have so much!

Being on the tame side, I had the white cheddar spaetzle. It was a noodle type food with homemade cheese sauce and kale. It was similar to mac and cheese but instead the noodles tasted and felt like gnocchi. Very filling for the portion which only sets you back about $5.

The sausages are also fantastic and they have a good selection. I had the smoked chorizo for about $4, and all come with a selection of mustards. I&#39;m not a fan of mustard and the boyfriend didn&#39;t quite like them either. 

Definitely worth a try!"

Located in Larimer square, Euclid has a very diverse menu and an expansive drink menu. We ordered the white cheddar spaetzle, chicken schnitzel sandwich, and the best burger. I definitely recommend the chicken schnitzel sandwich and the spaetzle, but I personally wasn&#39;t a fan of the Brat burger.

Our group of 5 were quickly seated upstairs in the dining area. The drink menu was extensive and had everyone cracking up at the names that they make you say to order - &#34;smother me in gravy you big dirty man.&#34; I had the Sequence 3 - a refreshingly sweet and light cocktail.

The menu items are not for the faint of heart - definitely some adventurous choices. The green goddess salad was light, with a great dressing. The chips and dip were served as a haystack of chips and duck on top of a creamy tangy goat cheese. The carnitas papas fritas were flavorful. The carbonara pasta was made with noodles that were not pasta but were something else entirely. I couldn&#39;t tell you all the things we ate - just that they were exciting to try and rewarding in their flavors and uniqueness. 

The dessert was a big payoff with a delicious banana split and smore&#39;s cup. The smore&#39;s were a cup of warm chocolate pudding topped with a generous frosting-like layer of just heated marshmallow and a homemade graham cracker. The banana split was served with piping hot chocolate and caramelized bananas. 

The whole experience was fun and different. Will definitely return."

The one time I went I had Duck Poutine because I haven&#39;t been to Canada, I love fries, and I don&#39;t see it on menus around town.  I will be honest, it isn&#39;t the most visually appealing dish (it&#39;s a pile of gravy on top of fries), but is definitely delicious.

We came here on a Saturday night with a group of 10 people and I don&#39;t think its the best restaurant for accomodating large groups.

First gripe - we made a reservation and ended up waiting about 30 additional minutes for our table. I understand that its tough with large groups but at the end of the day, that&#39;s the point of a reservation. In addition, the hostess was a little snarky.

Second - the food for the price wasn&#39;t completely satisfying. I felt that things were a little pricey for what we received and it didn&#39;t taste knock your socks off amazing. This could be that we just didn&#39;t order the right things or that since there was so many of us and we ate family style that I didn&#39;t really get what I wanted.

Finally, the server was just rude. I mean I get it. Saturday night, its crowded you don&#39;t want to be there and you can put gratuity on our check. You can at least be polite.

As I said in the beginning though, I would definitely give this place another shot. The place looks awesome and should be super chill. Definitely worth a second chance."

There was also bleach being used to clean while we were sitting there - appreciate the cleanliness but man.  I ordered the sausage sampler, a good variety of tastes - what really stood out was the mustards, in particular, the taste and texture of the house mustard stole the show.  I followed that up with a brat burger - filled with flavor but I immediately regretted ordering it when this giant hot dog showed up at the table next to it.  Beer selection was a plus - I was drinking a local dark IPA.. Went down a little to easily.  I&#39;d give it another try but I&#39;m not in a hurry to do so....

EVIL! EVIL! EVIL! Warning-  Things like Buffalo fried and battered chicken skin- EVIL!  Bone Marrow- Evil!  Steak and a cake donut? EVIL! This place is the devil to the healthy eater, tempting you to come and sin again and again.

The last time I was in this building it was a sad, used up tired dilapidated victorian building that housed a very lame night club.  This was a while ago back....

A spiffy remodel, this two floor gastropub does not disappoint. First you will be seated by gorgeous hip hostesses, then fabulous cocktails await served by the thunder-down-under at the bar.  Incredibly beautiful people staffing this place, AND! these eye-candies are incredibly service-oriented.  Amazing feat: Beautiful and nice!  You just feel cool being here!

And the drinks!  &#34;They&#39;re real and they&#39;re fantastic&#34; artistic mixological experiments to lots-n-lots of beer. The food is tough- reading the menu and listening to the specials is like going to a freak show- tons of things you would never expect to ever have: Frog legs aka &#34;Kermit Kakes&#34;, Gator wontons, fried chicken skin, Pig Ears, hand cranked blood sausages- We are feasting in some creepy sexy HBO series!

I should mention that while the food is unique and exotic, some dishes seemed over salted.  The Particular Brit really did not like the demi-glaze on the steak and bone marrow as was not complimentary. Still, these are minor complaints.

The large group did not bother them, they handled us like pros and our server Kurt was efficient, friendly, and a perfect 10.  What is not to like?

Only one thing really disappointed and took the coveted 5th star:  The noise level was ridiculous; Today I am hoarse from screaming and my ears pounded for several hours after leaving. The music level was back at the night club days.  It was difficult to talk, difficult to hear, and conversations were stressful.  I am an old old woman.

We started off by sharing the duck poutine. The gravy was super tasty, and there were lovely, succulent pieces of duck. The fries were perfectly cooked, but I was hoping for more squeaky cheese curds! The cheese seemed to consist of crumbled cheddar but was still tasty. For my main, I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich. The chicken was well-cooked and crisp. The slaw was nicely balanced. It was super filling and had a slight kick to it. Our server, Leah, was super friendly and responsive. We all felt she took good care of us. I definitely plan to come back and eat more tasty things in the future."

It was easy to make reservations, they had a lot of time slots to choose from. My party was late almost 20 minutes that day but they held our table and even gave me a call to make sure I was coming which I really appreciated. 

My party of 4 was seated at a very comfortable booth by a window. The DRW menu was easy to navigate. You choose one beverage (could have had more choices there), one appetizer, one entree, and a dessert to share between two people. I went with the white wine which was pretty good. I got their infamous thai pig ears for starters. They give you a very decent amount. The ears are crispy, coated with this delicious sweet thai sauce and there were also roasted peanuts and cilantro and lime. I loved this dish. For entree, there were a variety of options from duck poutine to mussels to chicken etc. I went with a good old fried chicken sandwich. This was probably one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever had. The way they breaded the chicken was very unique and then meat was especially tender on the inside. I liked the coleslaw it came with as well. I wished the bread wasn&#39;t just a regular slice of bread because it wasn&#39;t as sturdy. For dessert, my boyfriend and I ordered the banana split for an extra $2. It came beautifully presented on a long slender plate. There was banana pieces fried in dough coated with chocolate and there were a few scoops of ice cream. It was so good! 

The only downside to the night was that they ran out of the duck confit for my friend&#39;s entrees and they didn&#39;t offer to substitute with anything else. I thought that was a bit weird. But I think they did charge them a bit less because of it. Euclid hall for DRW was a great experience."

The house made mustard was delicious. 

The kielbasa was also very good but I wish it had come with more of the pickled cabbage which was a nice offset. 

The leek mushroom cheesy spaetzel was amazing but the portion was too large. For something so decadently rich, between the two of us our stomachs couldn&#39;t handle it.

If you enjoy drinking a quality beer with some mouth watering food look no further. Euclid hall has an extensive drink menu, offer beers that are incredibly hard to find. From limited edition brews to small brewery beers they have it all. The faith Hilling cocktail is simply amazing.

In addition the food is exquisite for the price. For $10-$15 you simply can not beat this place. The Carnitas Papas Fritas, Duck Poutine, and Kermit cakes are incredible. These dishes offer a unique twist with some explosive flavor.

Overall this place is very impressive. However keep in mind this place is a beer hall first and restaurant second, that being said if you&#39;re only looking for food there are better alternatives. I would recommend Euclid Hall for friends, business and dates."

Just as good as the first visit. Left very full, but still thinking about the food experience days later. Check it out, pretty good stuff!"

It has Leopold Bros American Small Batch whiskey, Domaine de Canton (a ginger-flavored liqueur made in France), St Germaine, ginger beer &amp; lemon bitters.

It&#39;s close to the 16th street mall and right next to Larimer square. My girlfriend and I both got the chicken schnitzel sandwich and it was probably one of the best sandwiches either of us had ever had. The chicken was perfectly crispy and the apple caraway slaw cut right through the fattiness of the fried chicken. The jalapeño bread was crispy and flavorful but not too spicy so don&#39;t let that scare you away. I had the grilled corn as a side and it was sweet and perfectly cooked. Euclid is located in an old brick building but the atmosphere is modern/hip and was quite a nice dining experience. They also have quite an extensive beer and wine list.

Many of the dishes are new takes on an oldie favorite.  Instead of mac and cheese, they have White Cheddar Spatzle.  Instead of brats, they have lamb belly vindaloo sausages..  Instead of Loaded fries with cheese, they have Duck Puotine.. which is basically the same.  You could say the food experience is &#39;elevated&#39;.  Instead of your regular stuff, they put a twist to it and walla.... food made better.

I think their Pig Ears dish is very good. If you like Thai flavors , you should definitely get it.
We&#39;ve also had their Bone Marrow and it was OK. I think they should retire bone marrow from their menu, its such an old and tired item on the menu.  

Service is FAST, FAST and FAST.  The limited menu is both a blessing and curse. On one hand,  you can expect consistent food, and on the other hand, everything is prepared in advance.  We ordered 7 items and they ALL came out at once. Nothing bad about it, except that we had no table space to handle all that food. 

Overall, a good place to visit to try out the &#39;new&#39; dish.."

Every single thing I&#39;ve ever tried here has been the bomb.com.  Four stars only because I wish their menu was a little more diverse.  If you&#39;re too hungry for just an app, and want something other than a sandwich or poutine, it can feel a little restrictive.  Also, it can get pretty loud at times.

On a positive though, whatever you DO get will be amazing.  The bone marrow is by far my favorite- super rich and flavorful.  Be sure to take a shot out of the bone marrow bone once you finish it.  Fun, and good!"

I would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately the last time I was here the service from one of the bartenders was terrible.

We arrived shortly after 2 last Sunday (when they open) and it was already pretty busy (just on the first floor though). They were kind enough to seat us even though we were still waiting on a 4th to arrive. The server was fantastic with giving beer recommendations to my friends (I don&#39;t drink) and they were really happy with what they ordered (I can&#39;t remember to save my life, sorry).

The menu was just heavenly in terms of amazing options, but it made it so hard to order. We ended up getting two orders of the amusingly named (I think), Chips and Dip, to share, as well as each getting our own things to eat as well.

Oh.

My.

God.

I have seen the light and it is the Chips and Dip from Euclid Hall Bar &amp; Kitchen. The lemon goat cheese was so perfectly tangy and creamy I just wanted to bathe in it. The two takes on duck, warm and cold, just made my insides feel so very happy. The chips (while some were a little salty) were a perfect vehicle for the cheese and duck. I could have just died happy right there.

My two friends traveling with me ordered sausages, the short rib kielbasa and the vindaloo, with the assortment of mustards, and were both delighted. The friend in town had an ounce of foie gras and loved it.

I got the French Onion Frites (poutine) and it was pretty darn great. At first, I kind of wasn&#39;t sure about it, but once I moved the fries around a bit and got to the sherry and French onion soaked ones at the bottom and all of the beef shank chunks, I was in love.

They were great about splitting the bill for us and overall, it was a great afternoon. They didn&#39;t rush us out after we were done eating and just hanging out, and they made us feel really comfortable the whole time. A great Sunday afternoon place to hang out over some really, truly delicious food and great beers."

My hubby and I both got the Brat Burger ($10) and shared a side of fries ($3.50). I thought the concept of a Brat Burger with a brioche bun was very interesting! The portions were pretty small but they tasted pretty good! I&#39;d go back again to try more dishes for sure."

I&#39;ve been trying to make it amazing since the yelp event years ago. The open floor plan - well - giant hole in the middle just seems to make it noise. IT&#39;s a cool view, but the sound just reverberates everywhere.

There is usually a line and they don&#39;t take reservations for under 7. Ugh. I hate waiting in line for food. It&#39;s a personal pet peeve and i know it&#39;s my issues, but it&#39;s another thing to make me shy away from here.

The bar area is ok, as long as you can grab a table! There are 2 bars, and both are usually packed.

Beer selection is pretty big, and the food choices are interesting.
Some of the options are just too weird and the cost too much in case it isn&#39;t all that... 

One time hubby got a pork/beef patty and sadly it was undercooked...  i wasn&#39;t paying attention to what he was eating until he at over half and was like, should it be pink...  that night ended badly. 

The sausage sampler platter can be interesting, but again, expensive and some of what you get - meh or ick (to my taste buds). 

It&#39;s cute, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s adventurous, but just too many negatives for me."

We ordered the Carnitas Papas Fritas as an appetizer (I think you can order it as an app or side) and it was gone within the minute. It was basically fancy green chili cheese fries with tender spiced pork on top. 

We also ordered the winter salad, Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich, and Brat Burger. Honestly, these sandwiches were better than anything we&#39;ve had at any authentic German restaurants that we&#39;ve eaten at across the country! The chicken schnitzel was cooked perfectly and came on delicious jalapeno cheddar corn bread with yummy apple slaw. The sandwich is quite large. I would have been perfectly fine without ordering a side. The Brat Burger came with a flight of mustard; 4 in total. Again, tasty dish. The brat was juicy and pretzel bun was soft and chewy. Wonderful combinations of flavors and textures in your mouth. Our winter salad was a great addition on the side."

While most of the beers were available in cans or bottles, there were many rare gems on the list. I wish more of the beers were available on draft, although some of the selections are difficult to make available on tap. 

This German style beer garden was mathematically themed for Euclid (father of geometry). The theme permeated the beer menu. Beer categories worked up from &#34;arithmetic&#34; to &#34;quantum mechanics&#34;. 

We tried several dishes and all were good. We started with an order of the fried cheese curds. 

We also split the white cheddar spaetzle (it was outstanding, food highlight of the meal), pasta carbonara, and a sausage sampler, including: beef short rib kielbasa, mortadella pistachio black pepper, boudin noir aver curry e aubergine, and hardwood smoked chrorizo. The sausages came with four different mustards. We also ordered a side of the apple cabbage caraway slaw. 

The food was good (spaetzle was worth going back for), but the beer selection was inspiring. I spotted Mephistopheles (Avery) on the menu and while this was not available, I was more than happy with the Uncle Jacob&#39;s Stout (Avery) I found instead. This rare treat was an amazing find.  I hope to be able to return to this spot so that I can further investigate more of the rare beers. 

We also ordered and my wife and sister-in-law loved the rhubarb dessert."

I went to Euclid Hall on a Friday night and it was extremely busy.  Thankfully, someone in our group had thought to make reservations as there were many parties waiting.  Despite the crowds our server was amiable and accommodating.  The atmosphere is clean and orderly, albeit a bit claustrophobic when crowded. 

Euclid Hall has a vast menu and I wanted to try many things, but ultimately I opted for the Pad Thai Pig Ears because it sounded a bit unique.  I was expecting a traditional pad thai with rice noodles and pig ears for the protein, needless to say I was surprised to discover the pig ears were the &#34;noodles&#34; in the dish.  While this was a lot of meat, I enjoyed every flavorful bit of it.  My friends ordered schnitzels and poutines and all enjoyed what they ordered.

We were seated immediately and the building is very nice and is 2 stories. The table was fine and the atmosphere was pretty good. The music was a bit loud and they really liked playing stuff like offspring, not exactly eating music.

I ordered the chicken schnitzel sandwich and I was thoroughly disappointed. Your bread was way too burnt, the chicken was cooked to oblivion with no flavor, there was next to no sauce on my sandwich, the only good part was the dressing. I asked for more sauce and was brought a white container of god-knows-what that tasted like sweet whipped mayonnaise. One of the worst sandwiches I&#39;ve had in my entire life. The drink I got was named after super troopers and was decent but pretty bad for being $12.

The server was great (nice, fast, prompt, polite, didn&#39;t try to bug us too much) and we had to go to a show so I didn&#39;t have time to ask for something else to eat. I&#39;d love to review this place again one day as I feel like it has potential, but that sandwich does not. I&#39;d like to watch a manager eat that sandwich and tell me with a straight face that it doesn&#39;t taste like burnt sawdust with overcooked chicken and no sauce."

I have been here numerous times for work events and therefore tried the majority of the menu and have never been disappointed with my meal. My favorite, the steak and donuts- who doesn&#39;t love that. The deserts are spectacular as well so be sure to save room. 

The only draw back is the restaurants noisy, to the point I have had to shout during most of my dinners there. Perhaps that is par with being a beer hall but for me that is the only drawback.

I ate her today for dinner with a group of 6. The dark color palette of the design and indie playlist gives Euclid Hall an aesthetic that is sophisticated, urban and moody. 

I ordered the chicken liver mousse, beat pickled eggs and hops-infused pickled cucumbers. The mousse was essentially an extra fluffy and smooth pâté; it came with toasted bread and a sweet jam. I was pleasantly surprised to find the two spreads went well together. The eggs were overlooked for my taste, but still were an enjoyable compliment. The hops pickles were truly like nothing I&#39;ve ever had: fresh, light and subtly spicy. I also had the blondie for dessert. Candied nuts make this an excellent way to end the meal.

My friend&#39;s Chicken and Waflles were really delicious, though!  The chicken was lightly battered and fried to a nice crisp, soaked in a little maple syrup.  The waffles were super light and fluffly.  One of the best Chicken &amp; Waffles!  Small dish, though, for $13.50.  Third friend got the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich, which she said was good.

First off-the pizza is awesome! I moved to CO from the Midwest &amp; have had a hell of a time finding some decent pizza &amp; Anthony&#39;s solved that for me! 

The problem: pick up orders take over 40 minutes. No matter the day no matter the time and the managers response to a complaint is &#34;there&#39;s nothing I can do for ya&#34;. This is a general manager at that. When I explained I didn&#39;t have this issue at their other locations his only response was that he was a general manager and couldn&#39;t help me. I worked at pizza places for 4+ years throughout high school &amp; my undergrad years in college &amp; never once told a customer I couldn&#39;t help them. 

Overall A+ pizza &amp; D- customer service."

My slice of pizza was sopping with grease and toppings looked like they just got dumped on top and heated up. My son had pesto pasta and it came as a bowl of spaghetti with bland oily pesto sauce and hard garlic bread. No one asked how we liked it and the vibe in there was awful- the place had no music and the workers seemed grumpy. Won&#39;t be returning. 

.....month later .....

I am changing my review from 1 to 3 stars. After the last experience here Peter contacted me and gave us two free pizza coupons to give them another chance. We went to the location off 8th and CO this time. It was nice inside- very up to date and clean. We ordered the same pizza as last time with a salad to go. I only had to pay for the toppings and salad, so thank you Peter for that coupon. It was definitely better than the last time. We got meatball, black olive and green pepper again. Unfortunately I don&#39;t think they used meatballs though- it was more like crumbled sausage. But it was cooked better and we appreciate the offer to try again."

I dont really care about the service etc, but that was fine. Great Neopolitan slice, or what we call a slice in NY. Thin almost cracker-like crust, full sized pizzas, oily (a sign of good cheese), balanced pizza sauce (not too much oregano or anything , not raw) perfectly made pizza (proportions and cook).

And all the NY Pizzeria basics for your pizza... For me just a couple chili flakes. 

Good prices IMO."

My visit tonight was wonderfully uneventful, which is exactly how I like it. 

Ordering a pizza on Friday night, I expected it to take a bit longer than usual. When I called in my meal the girl who answered told me it would be about an hour before my meal was ready. I showed up 45 minutes later expecting to wait for fifteen minutes, I waited 15 minutes and my meal was ready. 

The pizza was hot, the cheese was perfectly melted, the wings were spicy, and my family loved it. Thank you all for a wonderful meal."

It&#39;s situated in a shopping center surrounded by a grocery store, hardware store and liquor store.  You can quite literally grab those few things you need from the hardware store, do your grocery shopping and go grab a pizza and a 6 pack in one stop.  Yes.. I have done just that on occasion. 

I have never had any issues with this location.  I will admit I have not tried anything other then their pizza.  I don&#39;t need to!!!  I like their pizza as has my out of town friends and family who have visited.  It&#39;s the way pizza I grew up with has always been.  Flour on the bottom, grease on top.  

There&#39;s a lot of room in this location compared to their others.  I know they are trying to have a specific Décor, but it leaves the place a little on the cold side.  Delivery can be a little long sometimes, but I figure if you&#39;re in that much of a hurry you can get in the car and go get it yourself.  

I like knowing what to expect and this location has always been consistent."

First time I ordered a veggie pizza, garlic bread and cannoli.  Pizza was soggy and undercooked and they forgot the cannoli.  Not too big a deal, Im used to soggy undercooked pizza since moving here and everyone can forget from time to time. 

  The second time:  I waited 2 hours for the delivery, I called and was told it was on its way.  Given it was snowing thought that was reasonable.  Hour 3 comes and goes, still nothing.  I call to see if possibly I missed the doorbell or what, the person that answers the phone says hold on.  Then a guy gets on the phone stating, &#34;what&#39;s the problem?&#34; (seriously?) I told him and he said my card was declined and they were trying to reach me.  I then asked then why an hour ago did someone tell me it is on the way?  Furthermore, my bank show that the transaction went through.  I then asked who I was speaking with and he refused to tell me, just the manager is not here he is on deliveries.  I was left with no option but to go up there and try and get my money back.  While there I finally spoke with one guy that had somewhat of a clue about customer service and got my my money back.  I am a very patient person as I had worked in the restaurant business and know it is a tough job, but seriously?  Since it was snowing I was planning on tipping very well for this service, I ended up time a drive through guy instead.  I hope these two occasion were just some fluke but I will not be going back."

I was seated for my Free bday dinner at a table that I doubt OSHA would approve - damn near in the middle aisle! I was seated and greeted by a seemingly nice bit maybe overwhelmed waitress. I have benefit of the doubt because it seemed busy. I was ALONE and ordered an appetizer. When it arrived, the portion was huge! I commented that I didn&#39;t know it would be so much - no wonder surrounding tables stared. Lol. Ahhhh... I was hungry and ready to eat but had no silver/plastic eating utensils  A myriad of people passed my table, bumped into me (because that&#39;s how tight it was) and all of the elements probably flew in my food. Ugh!
Got my burger that was free but it was pink (gross to a person who barely/rarely eats meat). My waitress was gracious and offered to have the kitchen make another one for me since she explained that I asked for &#34;NO pink.&#34; I went back to eating my appetizer that was way too much to begin with. Worked in my favor I guess... an appetizer and two (2) glasses of wine later, a new burger arrives! Who can eat now?? I hate to complain but really... the manager stops by and says &#34;I heard your food wasn&#39;t right. Is everything ok now?&#34; I reply a &#34;Yes, it&#39;s totally fine,&#34; and he walks off. Lol. 
Well... My free burger is in a box, along with the troth of onion rings and I&#39;m over $30 poorer! Happy birthday to me!"

The burger comes with hardwood smoked bacon, fried onion strings, an onion bun, tomatoes, peppercorn spread &amp; a side of thick cut fries for $11.50. I thought the side of fries was smaller than most burger joints but I was ok with that because I usually never finish mine. I also tried the whiskey river BBQ chicken burger which comes with cheddar, onion straws, lettuce, tomato &amp; mayo. It also came with a side of fries &amp; was under $11. I liked the two about the same amount. For dessert I tried the chocolate fruffles. It was frozen brownie bars dipped in dark chocolate with a side of whipped cream &amp; berry &#34;ketchup&#34; for dipping. I thought the berry sauce was too sweet &amp; the whipped cream looked like the pre-made canned kind. The bars had a candy bar texture but harder/chewier. I also tried the freckled lemonade cake which is basically a lemon tiramisu. It has lady fingers &amp; shaved white chocolate on top. On the bottom of the cake are some strawberries and a strawberry sauce. It was by far my favorite thing on the menu!!! I plan on trying to make it @ home. This place is neat because they have little iPad-like tablets on each table from which you can pay, order, call the waitress, or play games. You barely have to interact with anyone @ all (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing)! I think Chili&#39;s has something similar. The games aren&#39;t free. It costs $1.99 to play them."

The group of ladies at the host stand performed admirably. They told us we were going to have a fifteen minute wait for a table and we waited 8 minutes. They led us to almost the exact same table. 

The hostess told us the server would be right with us, we saw her about 5 or 6 minutes after sitting down, which is a bit longer than it should be - in my opinion - to greet a table. When she brought out our drinks we ordered our food and asked if she could bring out an order of fries for us to get started with. She said she would and we saw her about fifteen minutes later after our burgers came out. 

I couldn&#39;t see where she got off to, but we were hoping for something to snack on while we waited for our food. Also of the four of us there, we got one refill on our drinks. Not one round, literally one. My son sat there with an empty drink nearly the whole time after he got his food. $5 for a &#34;bottomless&#34; freckled lemonade huh?

The food was okay again. My daughter had the corn dogs, my wife a plain cheese burger, I had the clucks and fries, and our son had a chicken sandwich. I had a few fries that were cold which was likely due to the lettuce the fries were sitting on.  She did ask if we wanted more fries after we were done, however I felt if I would have said yes I may not have seen them anyways after already being forgotten once. 

This place needs a good training on proper service. If you tell someone you&#39;re going to do something, do it. The value that we pay for just doesn&#39;t seem worth it, when I can get a burger and fries from five guys down the street without all the mistakes."

When my wife and I entered, the hostess asked us if we were both over 21. After my wife responded with a yes, she immediately proceeded to take us over to the crowded bar area. Neither my wife or I drink so just because we&#39;re both over 21, don&#39;t assume we&#39;re alcoholics. While she was leading us over there, my wife said &#34;we don&#39;t want to sit in the bar area&#34;. Now mind you, the bar area was completely full. The rest of the restaurant had less than 10 tables occupied. Either the hostess was day dreaming or she didn&#39;t hear us, but she kept on walking towards the bar area. We had to repeatedly tell her we don&#39;t want to sit in the bar area before it finally clicked with her. 

Now onto the food. I ordered the Red&#39;s tavern double. If you&#39;re wondering what it tastes like, grab a Whopper from BK and it&#39;s pretty much the same thing.

Red Robin serves burgers and it just so happens I haven&#39;t been to a Red Robin in years.

Do to our schedule we ordered takeout so I will review the food alone and not the service.  The drive back home took at least 15 minutes and when I opened my burger it was still hot and was not falling apart.  

I ordered the Bleu Ribbon Burger to go mainly for the blue cheese and crispy onion straws.  The burger was juicy and I could taste all the ingredients.  I wanted the blue cheese to be more equally spread over the whole burger, the blue cheese taste was primarily in the center of the burger.  

The onion rings are where it&#39;s at.  The onion rings are larger than large and have a crunchy and crispy exterior with a sweet onion on the inside. Make no mistake, it may seem like they don&#39;t give you enough onion rings, but these rings are super filling and with a burger as well I could only eat five rings with my meal.

The last time I came here I got the fish and chips. The fries were fine but those are hard to mess up. The fish was very disappointing. The pieces of fish themselves were not completely coated in batter so the inside of the fish was highly saturated in oil. The batter itself stayed oily even after blotting it with a napkin. In my experience, this is due to not frying at a high enough temperature. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked them to remake it. It came out the same way though. I asked the server if it always comes out oily and not coated completely and the server told me it does.

I appreciated their attempt to remake the dish but after it sounds like mediocre was the norm for fish and chips, I&#39;ve decided to stay away from this location. The Park Meadows location is much much better."

The food is mediocre at best and quite frankly Red Robin is an over priced Mc Donald&#39;s with a liquor license. 
 If your speciality is burgers...... You should be able to cook them and present them well.
 Thanks Red Robin for a truly forgettable experience."

On my recent time there the wait was 15-20 minutes on a Wednesday evening. After being seated it appeared that there were many open tables but not enough servers.

I shared a salted caramel shake which was actually pretty tasty and big enough for 2 full cups. For my entree I tried the colossus Burger. As you can only order it  pink or no pink I chose the less well done option. The burger was fine but looked nothing like the picture (as is normal with big chain restaurants). It had brisket, provolone, grilled onions and two types of sauce.  

The burgers came out before the shakes, which was a little unusual.

Our waitress was friendly but so busy that she wasn&#39;t able to refill our water at any point in the meal. 

A fine experience but not a homerun."

Not that that has any bearing on this review other than it being an interesting factoid.  That original is now closed and torn down, and Red Robin is a huge chain.  And as chains go, Red Robin is not too bad.  I choose this chain over most others.  This Aurora location is the same level of a-ok that most Red Robin&#39;s are.  It seems pretty new, so it&#39;s clean and open.  The service is okay in that overly solicitous way that most chains do it.  Am I the only person who thinks it bizarre to be called sweetie by a seventeen year old?  The food is truly okay.  It&#39;s a better burger than most other chains.  The fries are bottomless, though your bottom will not be less after the third go-round.  They will replace most beef sandwiches with chicken, and if I remember correctly the chicken is hormone free.   The beer selection is terrible.  They have a full bar with those fancy schmancy drinks.
If you&#39;re looking for something decent to eat and want the comfort of knowing what you are getting, then this Red Robin is an okay choice."

We don&#39;t live near the area but we stopped by since we were visiting someone. It wasn&#39;t very busy and we walked in, got seated.... Got our drinks.... So far so good. We place our order at 7pm... At 7:20 our waitress comes to tell us half their grill wasn&#39;t working so it would be &#34;just a couple more minutes&#34;.... (Would&#39;ve been nice to know that from the beginning)... 10 minutes later still no food but the waitress does come back to say &#34;just one more minute&#34;... 5 minutes later nothing.... I tell my husband that if the food doesn&#39;t come in the next 5 minutes we&#39;d leave. Coincidentally the food arrived maybe 2 mins later - but that was a wait of almost 40 minutes!!!! For 2 burgers!!!!! Even worse is that there were at least 2 other parties that arrived after us but still got their food first so was it really the grill that was the problem? 

I&#39;ve been to different RR&#39;s and usually there is some type of compensation whether it be a discount or a free dessert or drink when something isn&#39;t up to par. Not here... The manager didn&#39;t even bother asking how our service was as they usually do... But he was there just walking the premises.... In reading the past reviews it seems like they have a lot of work to do at this location. Food tastes great but I&#39;d like to eat my food when I&#39;m still &#34;excited&#34; for it, not once my appetite has been spoiled by a long wait.

Luckily this is not my local restaurant and the one closest to me has much better service because I&#39;d never come back to this one."

I replied with yes and I don&#39;t want another or this one. He made no recognition to the mistake grabbed the plate and walked away saying ok.

The food came our warm, not hot. I ordered a chicken sandwich and I wouldn&#39;t have fed it to a dog. It came out cold and rubbery, which means that they had to of microwaved it. We tried to get the attention of a server but no one came over until everyone else had finished. We explained about the chicken and the server could care less. We weren&#39;t even offered anything else and to top it off the manager didn&#39;t even come over to apologize.

No complaints about the food! The reason for the 2 stars is this: they make chocolate milk only at the bar, and it comes in a very small glass. They offer free refills which is nice, but if you have kids, then you know how quickly they power through a little glass of their favorite beverage. Because it&#39;s made at the bar, it takes a long time to be delivered to your table. I&#39;ve noticed that the same is true for shakes. So you&#39;d basically have to order a chocolate milk and then order another one the very minute the first one was delivered.  

Don&#39;t get me wrong- I don&#39;t allow my child to drink a gallon of Choco milk in a sitting, but the glass size is very small by industry standards. And it&#39;s the only restaurant I&#39;ve been to where it comes only from the bar."

Greeted by the hostess, and I say greeted loosely. More like we were grunted at after waiting for a minute or two. She leads us to our table, tells us our server, Caitlin, will be right with us and then literally throws the menus down on the table and walks away. If I hadn&#39;t been starving I probably would have walked out at this point. 

Our server makes her way over and she can barely look at my sister and I. I attempt to ask about a special that  I had read aboit in my email this morning and get a rude response about &#34;yeah I know how to put the order in&#34; ummm, ok...awesome. We order our burgers, app and drinks and barely see or hear from her again. She did bring refills for our drinks when our food arrived, probably the only nice thing that happened. 

It was inconvenient when we asked for extra napkins and sauce. Or she was just not having it but this is no way to treat customers. My sister and I have both worked in the industry and were appalled.

We ordered the same burger, one lettuce wrapped one not. Same salads. One burger came wrapped (not the lettuce one) and one came on a plate and while the other came in a basket. Sloppy. Not impressed at all.

There was no wait to be seated and we never waited more that 10 minutes for our appetizer, burgers, and dessert. 
I also never had to ask for a refill of freckled lemonade :)

Our cake was amazing. 

Definitely a satisfying dinner!

Starting with a positive note, they recently did a remodel and the place now looks great.  Both the inside and outside were remodeled and it looks very up to date and nice.
  
With that being said, the service here is not very good.  I was just there 4 days ago and our server asked us as he was taking our drink order if we wanted any appetizers.  We said yes and ordered mozzarella sticks.  When he brought the drinks back he took our food order.  We sat there waiting and waiting but no mozzarella sticks ever arrived.  As our meals were being brought out we asked the server what happened to our appetizer.  He went back to the kitchen to check.  When he came back out empty handed he told us there was a mix-up in the kitchen.  We told him to just cancel it.  He then came back 5 minutes later with the mozzarella sticks and said he will not charge us for them.  I understand mix-ups can happen but this is not the first time dealing with frustrating service at this location.  When the server gave us the bill he made sure to tell us out loud what the total should have been and then how much we saved since he took the mozzarella sticks off and also didn&#39;t charge us for our drinks.  Was he telling us what the total should have been so we tip based on that amount?  Just seemed weird...

Another time I was there recently (maybe 3 weeks ago) I ordered a Blue Moon Shake as dessert.  I waited a solid 15 minutes for the shake to be made.  My server actually gave me my check, came back and got my card, ran my card and brought me back the receipt all before it arrived. 

I do like the food so I keep going back but the service is starting to make me question if I should keep going there or now.  Time after time I have been disappointed."

Their drinks are large in variety and I LOVE a place that will serve an adult beverage with my meal. 
The downside for me is the wait service at this location is lackluster. Though I never have to ask for a refill on my beverage that is the only attentiveness that there is. It may just be me but I have never been asked how is my meal until I walk out the door and I feel like I am being rushed out said door every time.

Not only that I saw my waitress twice the whole visit. Once for my order and once when my food came. The only time my drink was refilled was when another gal brought out my appetizer. Now the ugly. I had not been here for some time and with past experience the food is usually tasty. I can say that I have had better burgers at McDonald&#39;s. The food tasted cheap and was soggy.

I like this red robin location a lot because we usually get seated right away and the wait for our food is not bad at all. We have a red robin loyalty card that we&#39;ve taken advantage of and received free burgers from. I am a vegetarian and it delights me that they can substitute the patty for you for a veggie patty. Our food is always fresh and not cold at all. The taste is great. The fries are always warm and delicious. Their appetizers aren&#39;t bad at all. I love the onion rings and kettle chips. My only problem is that there&#39;s been a few times when I ordered my meal that I asked for a side of ranch and the waitress forget it. I reminded her and she forgot again so I gave up, but that&#39;s only happened twice. I also don&#39;t care for the bar side because I don&#39;t like being seated so close to other people but usually it isn&#39;t packed so it&#39;s not a problem. The waiters and waitresses we have had, have been prompt and friendly. Once they brought me a burger with a meat patty and the waitresses right away corrected it and brought me my veggie burger without a problem.

Then our server finally revealed herself, making an excuse about having been switched from the bar area and not knowing she had a table, then walked away from us. We promptly got up and left. Very bad service all around, from the rude hostess who needed to be reminded there was a party of 5 waiting for a table, to the servers who side-eyed us in their attempt to be cut early, to our &#34;server&#34; who couldn&#39;t even be bothered with actually apologizing to us.

He was very nice and said they offer a gluten free bun and their fries are cooked in a designated fryer.  The burger and fries came out and they tasted as good as it gets but an hour so later and one urgent trip to the bathroom and the good times were over.  I truly believe the manager believed they were offering a gluten free option but my guess is probably that one of the cooks dropped something breaded in the fryer when they got busy.

- bottomless fries
- botomless non alcoholic drinks
- decent mixed drink + beer selection
- great place to eat if you are hitting up Costco
- kids can play some games + get balloons
- waitstaff is great 95% of the time

I always sit in the bar area, and I always get consistently good service.  They are doing a good job of following their own rules and keeping the kiddies out of this area.  That gives this  room more a nice &#34;adult burgers and beer&#34; vibe, and less of a &#34;happy-happy-birthday, lord of the flies, free-for-all&#34; one.

The quality of the burgers and chicken sandwiches have been solid.  They do have the same problem here that all the Red Robins now seem to have when it comes to the french fries.  Ever since they went to serving smaller amounts of fries with your meal in those asymmetric metal ring molds, I can never seem to get hot and fresh fries on the first pass.  I have a theory that they are batch cooking them, instead of doing them to order.  This is rather annoying as I would really like to have hot fries while I eat my burger, and not later, after I have finished it, when they finally bring out a new batch.  This location does do a better job than most of getting the second batch out as quickly as possible.

They also have a decent beer selection here, and they serve them nice and cold.  The servers are friendly, and the prices, although creeping upward, are on par with similar establishments."

The food is good and hot but the service is below average . 

Went here yesterday and order drinks, fries, and food immediately upon sitting down. Our drinks came quickly and the restaurant was not busy on a Sunday afternoon. Around 10 minutes later still no fries so maybe she forgot ? We asked and she said they should have been out and apologized , saying they would be right out. 15 minutes later nothing. 20 minutes later our food was out. She asked if there was anything else and we said the fries. She assured us the fries would be out and apologized. Then almost the whole way through our meal she came back to our table and said, &#34; they still didn&#39;t bring you those fries !

I&#39;m pretty much almost done with our meals 2 baskets of fries are put on our table. Communication is a problem there. 

That&#39;s not the only bad service. One time I was at this location and the girl didn&#39;t want to write any of the orders down and I said I have a lot of allergies so she was aware , she came back 3 times asking about things that weren&#39;t right for my order and it came out wrong."

Not sure why this is...
 I like that the waiters always wait for my family to finish praying before interrupting us to take our order.
I just love that whiskey River barbecue wrap and wedge salad."

We asked for a second sandwich midway through the meal and the ticket wasn&#39;t added to the kitchen until we were ready to pay the check.

The fries were soft soggy and seemed undercooked, so not sure how they get them very soft undercooked but not hard but they did it.  My wife had what they called French Onion Soup and as you would probably expect it was not only not very good it was bad.  The soup had very few onions in it even though that is the name.  The cheese was a giant glob of some kind of artificial cheese, it had a glob by plastic taste to it that I just can&#39;t place other than it is not cheese.  The &#34;soup&#34; tasted like a package of instant beef broth instead of the long simmered taste it should have.  Overall it was not a great visit.  The waitress was pleasant but one other nit is RR serves a lot of fries every day, our ketchup was empty and so was the bottle on the table next to ours.  Salted Caramel shake allowed us to leave happy at least it was very good."

My lunch visits have consistently gotten me in and out and back to my office within my hour break, and have never required me to complain to get my order right or drinks filled.

I asked for a med-rare burger and was told they only do well done or just a little pink...thought that was odd as I never heard that at the other locations before. After the meal came, I could tell the burger was pre-cooked and just warmed probably to get food out quick. My wife&#39;s chicken sandwich was similar (reheated). 

My thought is, if a restaurant wants to be known as a burger place and charge $10+ a burger, then it better be one good burger and this was a major letdown.

Again, I&#39;m not sure if this is a common practice at this location or was due to the crowds at that time since I haven&#39;t had that issue at other RR&#39;s locally."

I don&#39;t know if this location uses different suppliers but the hamburger buns at this location always fall apart making nothing but a mess of ingredients. Never have had this issue at other locations. Even when this location isn&#39;t busy the service is subpar. Went Saturday about 8 in the evening. They weren&#39;t busy but our service was horrible.

My friend and I visited there last night. Our server was great, but once we were done and left the table we went to the bathroom. While in the bathroom I realized I left the Christmas gift she gave me on the table. We were not even gone for 5 minutes, we had not left the premises yet, and when we asked the hostess and female bartender about it they looked shocked. Pieces of the gift were stashed behind the bar and at the hostess stand and the bag was thrown in the trash! I was expecting to find the bag, and all of its contents in one place, but these immature and greedy girls obviously went through the bag, picked out what they wanted, and threw the rest away. 

Again, we never left the premises!  I will NEVER visit this location again based on the fact that two greedy girls tried to steal someone else&#39;s Christmas gift. Shame on them!"

First, it was very busy. Over half the seating is for the bar, which had more than enough empty tables and yet there was still a line out the door and a 20 minute wait.  Our server was very nice and really was doing the best that she could. The most disturbing part of the evening came, when my son uncovered a rotten baby carrot that came with his kids meal. I gave his plate to our server and told her she may want to let the kitchen know. Fifteen minutes later we were given our check. I did not make a scene about the rotten food, but still hoped that someone would address it and at least offer an apology. Ten minutes late our bill was paid and we were out the door, still no explanation or apology. 

I can get a tasty cheese burger across the street at Freddy&#39;s, I go to places like Red Robin and pay $10 for their version of something that Freddy&#39;s does way better because I like the fun atmosphere and service. Tonight Red Robin failed. That they would think that the service of rotten food is something they can just skim over and pretend like it did not happen is as rude as it is reckless."

Red Robin never fails to impress with thick, fresh, tasty fries and big, beautiful juicy burgers.  The value is great and they have a great menu selection from burgers to fish and chips to milkshakes to salads...love it all!  I&#39;d rate them 4 STARS FOR FOOD!

This location, however, has a terrible team of employees.  Our service was not very attentive (didn&#39;t check back very often and had to ask twice for ranch and lemons)... the real kicker and why I give them 1 STAR FOR EVERYTHING ELSE is that when I was in last night I exchanged gifts with my friend and she left the gift bag on the table... in the approximately 7 minutes it took us to go to the bathroom and get to the parking lot and realize she had left the bag, four of the staff members had gone through the bag and divided up the gifts amongst themselves... the bartender pulled out one item from under the bar, another was hanging in plain view off the bar, a host pulled one item out from under the host stand, and the bag with the last two items was pulled from the TRASH CAN -- only 7 freaking minutes after we left it!  Finally, we never recovered the final gift bag item...some server must be enjoying her colorado-made shimmer lip balm right now.

Their fries are good if you ask for crispy, but they are often underdone if you don&#39;t.  If you want to be thought of as a burger choice, you need to serve your burgers to the temperature of your customer&#39;s choosing.  Red Robin refuses to serve rare burgers, and most of the time their burgers are med-well to well.  Wrong for me.  Worst of all, when you send a message to their corporate offices via email to suggest that they should consider buying beef that they are comfortable serving rare, they simply ignore and do not respond to your message.  I am a customer, and I will bring my patronage to businesses that can appreciate that dynamic."

We arrived just after 5pm, so it wasn&#39;t too busy and we had no trouble at all getting a table immediately.  

When we were shone to our table, our son was repeatedly begging for milk already, so I asked the hostess if she would mind seeing if our server could get him milk first thing.  Only a minute or so later, he came by with a cup of milk for our son.  As a parent, every thing they do to help make it easier with hungry, anxious children means so much.  It helps us keep our sanity!

Even when our little guy spilled milk and was dropping things on the floor (which we cleaned up voluntarily as much as possible - don&#39;t feel right leaving that), the server and other staff were always quick to offer help with extra napkins etc.  

The food was good, as always/predictable.  The staff was very friendly and available.

Great family place!!!"

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a burger there; maybe that&#39;s what they specialize in - whatever it is, I do NOT get the hype. I&#39;ve gone three times over the past few months, and I&#39;ve come to discover that Red Robin kind of sucks. Such minuscule portions of such mediocre food at such ridonk prices. Thirteen ninety-five for a &#34;prime rib&#34; French dip sandwich. Smaller than a 6-inch sub from Subway and bland as an old shoe. The au jus was like dirty bathwater, too. Meh! Same price for a plate of &#34;riblets&#34; and chicken fingers. (Hubby ordered *grilled* chicken, not fried, but whatev.) The portion was WEE. Half of the plate was cole slaw, and that was pretty meh, too. And the kids&#39; meals - it galls me to see a place offer mandarin oranges as a side, instead of fresh fruit - especially when they serve them up in a tiny sample cup like the ones at Costco. I wish so badly I could find a kid-friendly restaurant that offers decent food at a good price."

  I ordered the carne asada plate and we also had the smothered stuffed sopapilla with shredded beef. My carne asada was good and the beans and rice were excellent. In my opinion, if a Mexican restaurant can get the rice and beans correct then the rest of the menu will probably be great. Well, let me tell you the rice and beans reminded me of my mom&#39;s and was just amazing, loved them both! The stuffed sopapilla was the winner out of our entrees and excellent all the way around. Stuffed with amazing shredded beef and smothered with green chili sauce and cheese. This thing was great and will be ordered again the next time I&#39;m here; which will be soon.
  Lupitas is on Colfax and the area seems a bit sketchy but we were there for lunch so no worries. There was plenty of parking on the sides and rear of the building. The working owners were very nice and genuine. Service was a little slow but I attribute that to walking in right behind a big party (just my luck). 
  I&#39;ll go back a couple of more times before I raise my rating just to make sure it was that good. I hope my next visits are as enjoyable."

Otherwise the place looks like somebody&#39;s junk room and there weren&#39;t a lot of customers there during what should&#39;ve been a busy dinner hour. There were two servers, presumably one of them the owner, they were milling about without any worry about all the mess and junk all over the tables. We weren&#39;t sure the place was even open when we walked in.

The food was bland and greasy, and I&#39;m always amazed at how some restaurants can completely cook the flavor out of food.

If I were desperate and nothing else was open, I might consider going back here purely out of need. Otherwise there are many good restaurants all over town and no need to go to a place in such disarray."

Had family in town for Easter and we enjoyed a great meal on a Saturday night with live music and great service. Had the cheese enchiladas smothered in green chili and loved them.

It seems there is no effort to clean up anything inside and outside the building. The food is tasteless and a bit overpriced for the quality you get. I remember when this was a Mr. Steak years ago and I think they still use the same furniture. I want to like this place and with all the new construction up Colfax near University Hospital they could really capitalize on new clientele. I wish them the best in the future.

I gave a one star, but if zero stars was an option that is what I would give this place.  Somehow, this place got a 4.1 which fooled me into going.  First disappointment was the service was extremely slow!!  Lupita&#39;s customer service sucked!!  She was very argumentative when we asked for a soft taco after receiving a hard shell taco and not only that she got some of our order wrong!!  The food was not authentic tasting, it taste like processed food.  Those of you that know how authentic food taste know the difference.
While waiting for our food, we noticed the dirty salt shaker that looked like bugs were drowning in there and the cleanliness of the restaurant looked questionable.  I would NOT recommend this place at all.  I don&#39;t normally rate places, but I thought I&#39;d be doing someone a favor by not recommending this place.  

Do us a favor Lupita and retire that aweful mexican food!!"

When you walk in be prepared to go back into the 1970s. It&#39;s like you seriously stepped into a wormhole. 

The food is what I&#39;m learning is &#39;Denver Mexican&#39; where everything is smothered in cheese. It&#39;s cheap and the proportions are plentiful. The beef was incredibly moist and the flavor profiles are pretty straight-forward. Heavy--cheesy and greasy. 

Refills are not free and you do not get free chips and salsa refills either. 

If you want a hefty portion for a good price Lupita&#39;s is worth a look, but it&#39;s far from being a top Mexican restaurant in any regard."

Bland red salsa. Bland green chili. Bland food. Good sized portions and great live music. They&#39;ll charge you for the second order of chips and tasteless red paste. Why?

There are much better places in the area, real Mexican joints. I assume this type of &#34;Mexican&#34; food would fly in the Midwestern U.S.

I tried this place because of the reviews. People mention great food and attentive waitstaff. There must be two Lupita&#39;s in Aurora."

I wasn&#39;t expecting much from it, but the restaurant offers a lot of different menu options as well as combination options for when you can&#39;t make up your mind. I opted for a combo plate (of course) that came with a chicken enchilada, tamale, chili relleno, beef taco and rice with a side of green chili. The green chili was pretty good, as was the enchilada and the tamale. The chili relleno was the star of my place. Hilariously enough, the best part about it was that it wasn&#39;t battered traditionally, but it was wrapped in an egg roll wrapper instead. It was super crispy on the outside and the cheesy filling on the inside was perfectly melted and delicious. The only sad part of my entree was the beef taco. It was very reminiscent of the type of tacos you can buy at Taco Bell. I also got a chance to try some of the guacamole from my brother&#39;s plate and it was GOOD. I would come back here for just the rellenos and guac. 

Service wasn&#39;t great, but it wasn&#39;t bad either. I&#39;d say pretty average. The staff was nice, but not as attentive as I would have expected considering how empty the restaurant was. Definitely a recommendable place if you&#39;re looking for a sit down Mexican restaurant."

Betty the owner always comes around to every table and thanks everyone for choosing her restaurant which I feel is a very warm and welcoming touch and most owners of businesses just sit back and relish their earnings. Not Betty, she works along side her employees to make sure her patrons are well taken care of. The place needs a little work but it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t want to raise the prices of her food to cover the cost of fixing seats, she&#39;d rather make do with what she has and try and ensure a wholesome environment for her customers. I love eating at Lupitas as do new people I introduce to her establishment and their food is always on point ^_^. Thanks Lupitas for adding some wonderful color to otherwise dim colfax."

The chips were good, but the salsa was awful. I ordered the chimichanga and my friend had the mexican hamburger. We followed that up with sopapillas. The entrees were okay, not the best, but not the worst. Dessert was served warm, but a little greasy.

This time however I do have to critique the service I recieved. When ordering I specified that I did not want ONIONS with my food.. Well that&#39;s exactly I what I got.. I did mention this to the waitress and all I got was &#34;I hope theres not too many.&#34; The owner I&#39;m assuming came and told me that most of her food has &#34;garlicky onions.&#34; Well that&#39;s what she should&#39;ve said in the first place. I got the green chili burrito.. It wasn&#39;t too bad but the onions were a little too much. Knowing what she told me I could&#39;ve reconsidered my order. Anyways... I asked for my check so I could leave and it took a while for them to bring it to me. Once I got it I waited a little too long for them to come around to pick up the payment. So I took matters in my own hands and walked to the register and made payment. Other people are right service is slow when you are not a &#34;regular.&#34; I will def reconsider my food choices when I return to Colorado!

They had a cute live band of some people who were &#34;past their prime&#34; and they were very entertaining and fun. The food is pretty straightforward.

We were in the mood for Tex/Mex and eventually found Lupita&#39;s. Boy, were we excited to discover that Lupita&#39;s has Friday night live country music every week!

The festive atmosphere on Friday nights is really fun, with a mix of (mostly) older and (some) younger folks. On Live Country Music Friday, everyone has a smile on their face. The night we went, there was a good country band playing, and we got up to country line dance a few times. The open mic sessions were a hoot.

The food itself was a bit bland--I would say average Tex/Mex. The service was fantastic. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly, and offered advice when ordering. The margaritas were pretty cheap and OK.

All in all, I would highly recommend going to Lupita&#39;s for Country Music Friday. Soak in a unique and awesome dinner atmosphere and enjoy some decent Tex/Mex."

I first opened the door to the kitchen, since there wasn&#39;t any sign saying otherwise, but quickly orientated myself to the front, main entrance.  I was immediately greeted and not heckled for my mistake, but quickly sat down and served some chips and salsa.  I was also sat right near the entrance, perhaps to display that a little white girl was eating here on her own?  I don&#39;t know, but I would&#39;ve preferred a table not so in your face.  However, it was quiet enough that it really didn&#39;t bother me or take away from my pleasant experience.

I decided upon the Beef Plate:  beef taco, beef burrito, and beef enchilada.  Figuring I&#39;d have about 10 minutes to wait, I cracked open a book to kill some time.  Oh no, the Lupita&#39;s staff was back with my dish before I could finish three paragraphs.  Good?  Bad?  I&#39;m not sure, but each item on the Beef Plate was tasty.  I could&#39;ve used a little more kick of spiciness, but I&#39;ll take it.

Aside from the eventual glare down from another patron (I think she was irritated that I didn&#39;t have a male companion with me!), Lupita&#39;s is a great mom and pop restaurant to check out if you&#39;re over by the AMC, Anschutz Medical Campus.  Fast and friendly wait staff.  Tasty food at a good price.  I&#39;ll certainly be back for another go."

The odd mix between the food, decor and music kind of makes it endearing!

I ordered a margarita (run-of-the-mill) as well as the stuffed sopapilla which was really good! Had taco meat and cheese in it and lettuce, tomato and rice on the side. The sweetness of the sopapilla combined with the saltiness of the meat made it really good! I would recommend it. The other members of my group ordered combo platters which they cleared their plates of so I&#39;m guessing they liked theirs as well!

At one point Rudy from the band called us up on stage so be forewarned! If it&#39;s your first time there and you&#39;re sitting close to the front he might do that (or was it just us!?)

Lets just say this isn&#39;t authentic anything. From the decor to the food its a mismatched heap. Peruvian/Xmas decor and horrible Mexican food. Now being Mexican and from So Cal I am accustomed to great Mexican food and Lupitas falls short...way short. I ordered a bowl of Menudo to start and Tamales for my entree. I&#39;ve had better Tamales from street vendors and what kills me or what literally could of killed me was my spoiled bowl of menudo with the strong after taste of iron and way to much fat in the broth. Yea stomach problems all night! No Bueno!  Oh and dont get me started on the tamales which were dry and puny covered in tasteless red chili! 

Come on now people. I am no food snob and love a good hole in the wall when its actually good, but i cannot say that for Lupitas. At least my beer was cold! Lupita&#39;s Lets offer something better to the public, I know you can do it."

After spending hours, brushing, caring, and riding horses, I am usually famished. And quite often on the way home I stop at Lupita&#39;s. I like sitting down and having a basket of hot chips and a negro modelo put in front of me without really asking and I like the owner to come over and say hi, how are the horses. Betty Ortiz, the owner of Lupita&#39;s, has become a community favorite. She treats everyone like family and gives back to the community. 

She serves good food, and if you don&#39;t believe me, drive by during any meal time and see the number of cars around the building including Cadillacs, police, F150 trucks, and small beat up sedans. I love the souffle style chili rellanos if I am going to have a meal otherwise I order a fish taco. On the weekend you can get a good Caldo de Mars (Soup of the Sea) along with oysters on the half shell. I have not been and will review later but on the first and third Friday of the month she has a dinner show usually featuring what I call western/Tejano music. The only reason I give Betty 4 stars is I am not in love with the salsa, I like it but it has been tamed down a bit to accommodate all tastes. However, I should give it back as she lets me in smelling of horses and barns, I truly appreciate that."

My husband, a friend and I stopped for lunch.   I was struck by the kitschy decor and we commented on the Christmas lights, bows and greenery that were obviously left up year round.  As other reviewers mentioned, the place is in need of some serious updating and TLC.  Although worn, it&#39;s kept clean.

We each ordered an entree off the menu.  I got the tamales, hubby got the pollo  poblano, and our pal got the sante fe burrito.  No complaints from any of us, and our plates were clean by the end of lunch.  

Our only disappointment was that the menu advertised a Tres Leches cake for dessert, but our server said that it wasn&#39;t available.  Moreover, it hadn&#39;t been available for a while.  Why get our hopes up and keep it on the menu?  Oh well.  We had to settle for a sopapilla each for dessert.  The crispy, warm, cinnamony goodness ALMOST made us forget our yearning for Tres Leches.

If you&#39;re in the area, stop in.  Prices are good and so&#39;s the food."

The service is very friendly and the place is clean. Good sized booths or tables - your choice. And most importantly, a full-service bar! Oh, and they have breakfast all day? is this true? Might have to try the Huevos Rancheros and a Bloody....

If  you aren&#39;t at Helga&#39;s raging it up with a few liters of Warsteiner, Fridays here look like fun with live entertainment - either a mariachi band or teen wonder singer! 

I had a great chicken burrito and two ice cold beers. Each time my beer was served with a fresh icy-cold frosty glass. Can&#39;t beat it!"

All the way back to the days when it was a dinky, dingy little place on Montview Blvd in a tiny strip they shared with the Montview Bar and Grill (which is still there).  It had, at most, a dozen tables covered with red and white checkered oil cloth, and mismatched chairs.  The main cook was the father.  I never knew his name; he was affectionately called &#34;the old man&#34;.  The rest of the staff was family.  For seven or eight years we were bimonthly regulars.  The menu was limited, but everything was fresh and delicious.

When the old man retired in the early 90s they moved to larger digs on Colfax just west of Peoria where they are now.  The food and service was just as good, but the atmosphere was different.  We kept going for a few years, but less and less frequently, and eventually just drifted away.  It&#39;s been at least 10 or 12 years since I&#39;ve been in the place.

When I checked Yelp for a spot for my weekly breakfast out, Lupita&#39;s came up in the search.  Well heck, why not?  The amazing thing is that after all this time, the place was exactly the same.  It&#39;s like I was just there last week.  And, as Jodi A. noted, it really needs to be updated.

I had the chorizio, egg and potato burrito smothered with green chili and cheese.  Wow!  Lupita&#39;s, why oh why did I ever leave you?  I&#39;m back."

I brought the place to the attention of my colleagues and the 5 of us headed over. Our crew includes everything from the foodies who will eat anything as long as it&#39;s authentic, others who just like good tasting food and me with my special love for all Mexican food whether gourmet or diner style. 

Lupita&#39;s met all of our wishes! I enjoyed a Pollo Poblano burrito that was the perfect mix of creamy, spicy chicken with grilled peppers and onions. It was smothered with green chili and honestly, I was enjoying my dish so much, I forgot to stop and taste the chili on its own to judge it. The other dishes all received high marks, and covered everything from tamales to a pork dish to a cold tomato based soup filled with seafood. 
My fresh made limeade was a highlight and I was pleased to note on the menu that they sweeten it with low-calorie sweetener. I was only halfway through my drink when it was refilled -- free refill on a &#34;specialty drink&#34;? Now you&#39;ve got me! 
The prices cover just about every budget. I would think you could get out of here with a $6 lunch if absolutely necessary. Mine came to $10 before tip. (Oh and honorable mention for the fact that they offered separate checks with no guilt -- I love that) 
This place has the nice feel of authentic without being intimidating. Now, maybe I can convince a few friends to give it a try after work -- I can only imagine the margarita that limeade would make!"

After passing Sweet Tomatoes many times  on the freeway, we were glad to look this place up and discover that this place is Soup Plantation! Yes!!! Last time we had Soup Plantation was when we lived in San Diego! 

The staff here is soo friendly and accommodating... always making sure that we were doing okay and someone was there to pick up our plates &amp; utensils if needed. 

The Salads ingredients were fresh... soups delicious... and the pastas yummy. You can&#39;t go wrong with your own salad, clam chowder (you could actually taste big pieces of clam &amp; potato!) and the oh so creamy Mac n Cheese! 

Finishing the meal up with a blueberry muffin &amp; honey whipped butter ...  then some tapioca... and you can&#39;t forget the ice cream with toppings if choice... or a kid favorite... in a mini cone :)  

What a great experience with the family ... to enjoy fresh delicious food, clean and inviting tables, and really friendly staff. We are so glad to find another family friendly place for lunch or dinner!"

Granted, that store seemed a lot bigger and in one of the richest zip codes in the Dallas area, but the options seemed very similar on the pasta side, and I found the focaccia flatbreads to be undercooked and most of the other baked goods overdone. 

The soups here are always nice and the salad bar has a lot of variety, I just couldn&#39;t help thinking it wasn&#39;t as good as I remember and I unfortunately passed a lot of other options I wish I stopped at along the way."

My current and amazing wife asked that we go because she wanted a good salad. So, I honestly know of no better build your own salad place than sweet tomatoes. This location was well kept, some of the patrons were a bit sketchy but the food and service negated these issues. We were pleased with our meal and are very confident that we will return soon."

I love Sweet Tomatoes in Orlando and hoped for a consistent experience since it&#39;s a chain. The food is good!! I was extremely disappointed in the care of the facility. It looks like the walls around our booth had not been cleaned in ages. The flip chart ad on the table was plastered with food remains. The salad bar was super clean and the selection was fantastic!!! Staff was on the downside of friendly. I would come back for my love of Sweet Tomato but I sure wish the table areas were more clean.

They have a variety of soups, salads, and desserts available throughout the day. The options seemed very limited at my most recent visit when I went there for a late lunch, as there were only two pasta choices, two pizza-like things, their usual soups (a lot), but plenty of baked goods (muffins, cornbread) and soups. Perhaps, this location just doesn&#39;t serve as many options? Whatever the case, I thoroughly enjoyed filling my tummy with fresh vegetables from the salad bar, and blueberry/chocolate muffins with ice cream at my most recent visit. Yum."

The price is steep for a salad bar and the salad bar itself just isn&#39;t very impressive.  The soups and pastas are nice but probably not a good idea if you&#39;re trying to eat healthy, which I suspect most of their customers are trying to do.  The place is decorated like a hotel room and feels as sterile and personality-free as one as well.  Service is quick, but not very friendly.  It&#39;s just a big &#34;meh&#34; overall."

After the salad there is a great selections of soups (had a great cheesy cauliflower tonight) and a potato bar (my 2nd favorite stop), and a great selection of breads (I go for the focaccia!).  Also I tend to not head to the pasta bar and dessert ice cream section but other people love it.

If it&#39;s not broke don&#39;t fix it. Second thing is that the slices of bread use to stay nice and warm in a towel under the heat lamp. Now it just sits out by the muffins and hardens.

This was a horrible mistake.It opened at 8am and had special discounts till 9am, so we met there early at 8:30am, plus i figured it would be very crowded due to the holiday. I thought the empty parking lot was a good thing, evidently everyone else knows NOT to go for breakfast here. The salad bar looked good as normal, but not at 830am, the waffles and french toast was what we came for. Everything was very dry and old looking and ended up being cold before we started eating. The menu they boasted was all horrible. Fresh fruit, consisted of rotten strawberries and orange slices, potatoes dry, waffles/french toast dry and cold, syrup was even cold. The best item they had was an egg sausage scramble, but you had to be brave to try because it looked like regurgitated leftovers. Their advertisement had bacon and sausage links in the pic, but they had none, WTH.  Also, shame on YOU Sweet Tomatoes for charging me an extra $2 for coffee. Luckily many folks I invited decided not  to come, I was embarrassed that I chose such a lame spot to enjoy Mothers day."

I was skeptical at first but decided to go for it. Wow, I should have listened to my skepticism. Where do I begin:

1. The eggs are made using liquid eggs, a big no no for any restaurant. (I think this is really only acceptable in penal institutions!)
2. The potatoes are about the only thing worthy, and they come from frozen stock. (Really? I&#39;ve always heard FRESH is cheaper than FROZEN??)
3.  The french toast, although it really does look like french toast, actually tasted like something else, and my usual fixers of syrup and butter could not even save it.
4. The only thing that they didn&#39;t mess up was the salad bar and soup bar, which is not what I went there for in the first place.

Note to Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes Corporate: Please give up on the breakfast. It&#39;s NOT your cup of tea!"

Similar to the other one, it was fresh, well maintained, and the staff was friendly. I had three bowls of soup and they were lacking flavor, so I had to add my choice ingredients to fix them up. 

One thing that was extremely cool is the waitress was walking around the restaurant handing out coupons for future use. Needless to say I held on to it and will be using it soon. I thought this was a great way to show they appreciate their customers and they want you to come back. Just as a side note, I rarely eat at Sweet Tomatoes unless I have a coupon.

+ From the create your own salad fixings to the prepared salad creations, everything was fresh and flavorful. 
- There is a large selection of soups, although I found them to be good but bordering bland. 
+ The three basic pasta options were delicious.
+ Selection and flavor of breads (including muffins) was wonderful.

I try so hard to eat healthy and light and this is the perfect place for that.  I enjoy going here with co-workers, or going to just grab a salad and soup to go.  I think the salad bar is great. I know it&#39;s not the freshest veggies but I&#39;d rather have a salad here than a burger from a fast food joint!  One of my favorite items on the salad bar is the broccoli salad.  It is so yummy! I always save a spot on my plate for a spoonful of that.

The soup selection is huge. I&#39;m not sure how many pots they have, but it&#39;s a lot! I also like the potato bar and pasta bar. I&#39;m not a fan of the pizza or the brownies.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that over priced. I feel that I always walk out full,  stuffed as a matter of fact!

And some nights, like tonight, I am all about convenience.

I always get a bigger salad than I want. Maybe it&#39;s because they have so many toppings, and I can&#39;t help piling carrots and corn and rotini and cucumbers and squash and jicama onto my romaine and then dousing it with their decadent house ranch dressing. Of course, then I get down to the Joan&#39;s Broccoli Madness and remember that was actually the only kind of green thing I wanted on my plate - broccoli soaked in mayo with raisins and cashews. Oh yum.

They always have a decent selection of soups (some good, some not so good), a make-your-own baked potato bar, plenty of bread and muffins (carbs!) and pasta (more carbs!). Every month they always have a theme, and I have really enjoyed some of their past special options.

This place will always have a spot in my heart because tonight it is where I, the only daughter and first child, told my mother I am (probably) moving to a small town 6 hours away. Eek. She might never go to Sweet Tomatoes ever again.."

My visit today was just as I remembered it - good quality and loads of options.

Entering the place, you start with a tray and a plate, loading up first with greens and then moving down to add all sorts of toppings. You can really push out the boat here if you&#39;re not careful and you load up with the oily / cheesy options. I stuck with the lettuce and other veggies but none of the stuff that was already covered in dressing. There&#39;s a delicious low cal cucumber dressing option down at the end.

After the salad bar, you have the option to purchase a refillable drink - soda fountain or coffee - and pay for your meal. From there, there&#39;s a soup bar (around 8 different choices, tonight&#39;s included a meat chili, chicken noodle and vegetarian bean), a bread bar (with pizza, muffins and cornbread), and finally a pasta bar (tonight&#39;s choices were mac and cheese, penne arrabiata and a jalapeno salsa pasta). Finally, the fruit/dessert bar includes a soft-serve machine, toppings and cones.

If your kids are picky eaters, or if you&#39;re a vegetarian, Sweet Tomatoes is for you. The place really encourages healthy eating, but there isn&#39;t much as far as protein. Nothing you can really sink your teeth into, which is part of the style and how they keep the prices low ($13 for an adult dinner with drink).

Would I come here again? Absolutely! I&#39;m still stuffed and I got home two hours ago!"

I&#39;d much rather travel to the location near Park Meadows. The food is all the same but it&#39;s the staff that warrants low ratings. This is specific to Mon 7/14/14 during the late evening. The elderly men working the bread and soup stations need a lesson or two in customer service. They will follow you and stare you down as you are making your selections. I quite honestly do not enjoy being stared down as I scoop my soup or select my bread--making the entire experience unnecessarily uncomfortable and rude. They were glaring the entire time and whispering amongst each other making the entire experience sour and unappetizing to say the least.

They are very coupony, which i guess is making them off set the prices or what not. They have made very little changes over the years, to their items. However the did add a new premium section which is an additional 2.50 (i think could be 2.29) which has fancy things like mandarin sections, grilled chicken and artichoke hearts. Like a hipster section of the salad bar. 

They do have a constantly changing menu that varies from month to month but not year to year. Every year they have a &#34;lemon&#34; theme month, or a &#34;Greece Isle&#34; month or &#34;Tropical Paradise&#34; Month, etc.  So if you find something you like eat there every day until that month is over. 

Things I could eat the entire basket of-
-strawberry muffins
-cinnamon breakfast muffins
-blueberry muffins
Did I mention I like their muffins?

My man really loves the tomato soup(seasonal) and the cheese stick dippers. Its like childhood memories for him. We also like to breakfast there once in a while but its only on Sundays. 

The place is still in my opinion geared more towards the senior set and the family crowd, so be ready to be heavy handed with the salt and pepper at the table. I also love the garlic dressing. mmmm"

Don&#39;t pay full price it&#39;s only for suckers, coupons are available in the newspaper and through Club Veg their online club.
The pasta is a joke, forget it, The soups are very decent, some are excellent others are, well you decide...Salad fixings  are always fresh and tasty, I agree with some reviewers about the up selling of odd additional items like almond slices and chicken pieces for $2.50 but if you want it then buy it otherwise stick with the basics.

I love it, my husband hates it.  Typically, Sweet Tomatoes restaurants always have a huge variety of fresh salads, vegetables, delicious soups, breads, and pastas.  This one is no exception. As expected, the salads are incredibly delicious and who wants to miss the Tuna Tarragon or Joan&#39;s Broccoli Madness? Not me!  The prices are kind of high for a huge family, but if you sign up for the email program, you will get 9 coupons each month to use to your salad-eating heart&#39;s content.  The set-up of the buffet is really weird and I&#39;m going to tell you how its set up so you don&#39;t walk around like an idiot like I did.  When you first walk in, you go to the right down the salad buffet line. As with any Sweet Tomatoes, there is a second buffet section with the soups, breads, pastas, desserts, and drinks.  But that section is hidden behind a wall and you need to do a u-turn at the end of the salad buffet to find it. The tables line the walls in the restaurant.  So, there are no tables out in the &#34;open&#34;. One section of booths is between the salad buffet wall and the soup, breads, pastas buffet wall.

All of the salad ingredients appear to be super freshy. I love anywhere you can make your own salad and then use 3 plates because its overflowing everywhere. Yeah!

Little known fact: There is blue cheese almost at the end of the line, don&#39;t be a fool like me and get that chintzy cheddar thats closer to the front. Hold out for the azul!

Spinach, romaine, banana squash, chickens, sunflower seeds, variety of dressings and cups to put em in so you can have many. Also, a fancy pepper grinder which is at least 1237892137% better than shake pepper.

Anyway the rest of the stuff is pretty sub-par, but I always eat it anyway. Baked potato bar is pretty solid. Mac &amp; cheese is really unimpressive though it looks like it&#39;d be scrump.

Anywho...my hubby bought a Groupon Now deal. I was able to check the website and text my husband everything I wanted from their monthly feature. Apparently, they change their selection monthly-and some stuff is even changed biweekly.

Everything was tasty. In fact, it was so good, that we ended up going back 5 days later. This time we both went and I was so happy. I was able to see the WHOLE menu. The vegetables appeared to be chopped fresh. And you can see the employees quickly stocking items as they ran out.  The place appeared to be clean. Note: we took our order to go, so I don&#39;t know the cleanliness of their dining area and bathrooms.

I guess the only thing that keeps me from giving Sweet Tomatoes five stars is their set up. I feel it needs to flow better for a buffet. You would need to visit the place to know exactly what  I&#39;m talking about. Also, they are a little pricey. So bring your coupons or online deal.

The chicken pot pie I got was... de-freaking-licious. BUT at $16, I thought it was going to be sizable, but the size reminded me of the frozen pot pies you can buy at the grocery store. The wait for the pie is over 20 minutes. Yes, the name is 20 minute chicken pot pie, but my god, they are not kidding.

The food here is really good, the tap list rocks, and it&#39;s just got an overall good neighborhood feel to it.  I&#39;ve never had bad service or a bad time here.  It&#39;s a spot I tend to remember fondly except when I&#39;m in the area, something I mean to rectify!

Beer selection was decent.  Specialty cocktails and the such.  Nice whiskey collection. 

Opted for the bison pastrami sandwich.  It was very good. Not $13 good, but hey, it&#39;s made with Bison. Side of fries for $3 on the steep side for me personally, but they didn&#39;t wow me.

The chicken was tender, the sauce packed with flavor and the flakey buttery crust melted in your mouth.

A little to much salt on top for my taste. The filling was nice and thick wasn&#39;t watery at all. It had vegetables, white, and dark meat shredded chicken.

We started with a couple cocktails, I got the Strawberry Fields which I loved and the boyfriend got a bourbon cocktail which he said was very strong (in a good way!)

The atmosphere is nice, like a dimly lit alehouse from some decades ago. Service was fine and friendly.

As for the bison pastrami sandwich, it was maybe the best pastrami I&#39;ve ever had. The meat was tender and flavorful, but didn&#39;t feel as fatty as traditional beef pastrami. The bun was a soft pretzel roll that paired well with the meat and the mustard dipping sauce, and the garlic aioli added some nice extra flavor. Although I wish the sandwich was a tad bit cheaper than $13, given that it doesn&#39;t come with a side, I would definitely order it again.

The sweet potato fries were also great, especially when dipped into their garlic aioli. The side of these fries costs $3, so you are out $16 for a pastrami and sweet potato fries, but it&#39;s worth it and I recommend trying it next time you are here."

And, admittedly, I went here not looking for brunch (I was hoping for lunch) and so I was sort of disappointed that their brunch menu only had 4 real &#39;lunch&#39; items compared to around 8 &#39;breakfast&#39; items. So this all may have colored my review and lowered the rating some.

However, I went here with my partner to grab lunch in Denver before flying out of town that night. Admittedly, the main reason we went here is because we saw it on Diners, Drive-ins &amp; Dives and though it might be humorous (or at least a gloriously indulgent way to finish off a vacation). Unfortunately we found ourselves there on a Sunday afternoon, during brunch, and got a pretty Meh experience.

The bar/restaurant itself looks pretty nice. It&#39;s dark but comforting, and all the decorations flow back into the name &#39;Prohibition.&#39; The bar itself is gorgeous with a beautiful back-display for all their boozy offerings.

Like I said, we were pretty disappointed with the food offerings, but that was because it was 2 PM and the best offers were still breakfast items. We ordered from the smaller number of lunch offerings, and got the Bison Pastrami sandwich and the Focaccia Chicken sandwich. Both were served in a basket with fries (which I&#39;d assume were pre-frozen). Both were pretty good, but not great. The chicken was pretty bland, and the best part of the pastrami sandwich was the pretzel roll. It was good, but not worthy of a TV show. I will admit, the biscuits and gravy I saw at another table looked pretty good.

Our server was good but seemed in a pretty big hurry for how empty the place was. I&#39;m not sure if he ever actually stopped at our table, or just accomplished everything as he was walking by. Dropping off drinks and food, even taking our menu it seemed like he never actually stopped for us, which was just a little off-putting.

Luckily, the prices were really reasonable, so even if it ended up being a pretty &#39;meh&#39; end to a great vacation, it was probably the cheapest meal we were able to find in the entire state. So that&#39;s a plus."

The service was awesome and Kayla was so nice and helpful. Everything we ate was AMAZING. The queso had sausage or something in it and was the perfect amount of heat and the grilled polenta was fabulous as well. Everyone at the table with the exception of me ordered the bison pastrami and had nothing by rave reviews. I had a bite and it was really, really exceptional.

The happy hour is ok, not great. We chose this place because their happy hour ran until 7. $5 appetizers would be better if the appetizers weren&#39;t normally $5-$7. Well drinks aren&#39;t that discounted either. The service wasn&#39;t great. We got there at 6pm, our server probably took our order around 6:15 but after bringing the food didn&#39;t come back until after 7 meaning we only got to place 1 happy hour order. Most servers check in just before happy hour ends, I would have gotten another drink and another app. The other two people I was with were just drinking water and sprite, I had a vodka cranberry but I still drank all of my water and never had it refilled. Our server swung by and refilled one of the 3 glasses of water leaving the other two empty and didn&#39;t gives us a chance to ask for anything else. 

For food we ordered the crispy polenta, which was delicious and the mozzarella bites and sweet potato fries which were fine.  The place was clean and not too loud until after 7:30. They bring your check in an old book which is cute. Overall the passive aggressive service and lack of charm will probably have me headed for the Irish Snug down the street in the future."

The one star is for the good food. 

Never in my entire life have I been at a table that was treated with such blatant disrespect over the course of the meal. It started early with snippy comments like &#34;well, do you know what drinks you want yet or do I need to come back?&#34; Well sorry to inconvenience you, Alison, but you&#39;re probably going to have to come back. Finally, we get our drinks and our waitress decides that it&#39;s clearly too much effort to hand the drinks out individually so w/ a pinch of attitude she announces what the drinks are, sets them down at the end of the table and walks away. At this time, the bar is pretty loud, so we could not hear what the drinks are. Now, this table of 6 is trying to decipher who had what.

Next, we ordered food. The waitress comes over CHOMPING on gum to drop our meals off. Now, this may just be me, but if I&#39;m paying $20/plate, I expect my service to have a little class. I really don&#39;t want you snapping your gum over my meal. It&#39;s just tacky. It&#39;s not a huge deal and I certainly wouldn&#39;t have thought much about it if it weren&#39;t for her overall attitude all night. 

During our meal, our table decided we wanted to participate in trivia. At one point it was extremely hard to hear the announcers questions. A member of the party politely asked our waitress if she could ask him to turn it up. Her response, &#34;No, YOU can.&#34; Just flippant remark after flippant remark. Of course we can ask him to turn it up. Thanks for the hot take. But it didn&#39;t seem so out of your way to make a comment to him that the table in the back can&#39;t hear while you&#39;re grabbing 6 more drinks for our table. 

At one point in time, we ordered another round of drinks and a member of the party unfortunately got the wrong beer. She politely went up to the bar to exchange her drink for the one she ordered. The bartender, of course, had no issue swapping the drink out. Out of nowhere, here comes the waitress to declare that she did indeed deliver the right drink (at the end of the table -- while we&#39;re playing trivia) and we just weren&#39;t paying attention and somebody else had obviously grabbed it. &#34;I put it into the computer right.&#34; That may be, but nobody at our table ordered an Avery White Rascal, so the mistake was not on us. 

Finally, it was time for our bill. Mind you, we have a six-top table that has been at the restaurant now for close to four hours drinking and eating dinner. Obviously, this is a huge inconvenience to split the bill up, and we are certainly happy to help. However, our waitress once again RUDELY declares that she just couldn&#39;t even be bothered to keep track of who had what so we&#39;re just going to have to figure it out and let her know. This is no easy task. At this time, we&#39;ve grown frustrated with her attitude and start to get a little agitated that we&#39;re tasked with separating this almost $300 bill. We simply were not in a situation where splitting the bill evenly six ways would be fair to everyone involved. She can hear our frustration in trying to split the bill and comes over.  &#34;What&#39;s the problem here?&#34; she asks rudely. We explained that we&#39;re just trying to figure out who had what and it&#39;s difficult. At this time, she starts getting a bit unhinged, arguing with us about how we didn&#39;t tell her to split the bill at the beginning and how she has multiple six-top tables (we were the only 6-topper) and she&#39;s very busy. Certainly, we&#39;d be much more willing to have sympathy, if it weren&#39;t for her attitude the entire night. The whole night, she just simply could NOT be bothered. Everything came with a dose of flip remarks and attitude. 

Finally, she snatches the bill out of one of our hands and storms over to the bartender to help her split it up. Now we&#39;ve certainly had enough of this lady and we are completely flabbergasted that we&#39;re being treated this way. Of course, the conversation quickly turns to &#34;what is this girl&#39;s major malfunction?&#34; From across the bar you hear our waitress scream &#34;Do you have a problem? I can hear you talking.&#34; Now she&#39;s storming over to our table getting into our faces screaming at us in front of the whole bar. As she is arguing with us, off-duty staffers are pleading with her to stop. Now she&#39;s telling them that we&#39;re rude and talking about her. Finally, the bar manager comes over and tells her to walk away and asks us what the problem was. We explain that we were simply trying to divide the check and our waitress comments &#34;Oh of course now that he&#39;s here you&#39;re being nice.&#34; We weren&#39;t any different to him than her. Luckily, the bar manager was more than happy to help us split the bill. 

After this spectacle, we were simply offered apologies from other staffers. Nothing was done to remedy the situation and the waitress continued to serve tables while griping about us. If it were me, she would have been sent home IMMEDIATELY, with more ramifications to come later."

The drinks are good too, but the issue was that waters had to be asked for three times.

It was not even that busy.. I get that you can get sidetracked sometimes and forget, especially since &#34;water&#34; doesn&#39;t get added to the tab, but I asked for water.  Several minutes later, no water so my friend asked for water (that&#39;ll remind him!).. no water.  So on the third time, I think when our food was out, I asked for ketchup or something and two waters.  Finally.  Water!  

Seems like a locals sort of place.  We overheard some pretty weird conversations going on.  There are huge TV screens behind the bar that are sure to distract the bro on dates with the lady since sportscenter or a current game seem to be typically televised.  

Anyway, it&#39;s a cool spot.  I like the feel of it, but water man.. water!"

The bartender was friendly and the staff knew what they were doing. The place is sleek and a bit nostalgic but still up to date. It&#39;s not that large inside but that adds to the charm. 
I tried the Short Rib Burger and it did not disappoint. A perfectly executed short rib on a brioche bun. That&#39;s a real beauty there kid! I had them add some sauté onions. It&#39;s nice with the lettuce and tomato but if I had another one I would loose the veggies. 
A really cool place and another DDD joint on my list. FoodDude!"

Their go to dish: short rib burgers. We&#39;re talking two huge tender pieces of short rib with decent fries. I would suggest taking the meat from the buns and ask for a small cup of au jus. Pick off pieces of the meat and dip it into the au jus, very tasteful. Don&#39;t forget the bun. Eat it along with the dipped short rib. Only $12, you can&#39;t beat that price for two huge pieces of tender meat.

 I also had my first Moscow Mule in the classic copper cup."

They recommended the braised short rib as their best dish, so we got the braised short rib burger and the entree. Both were pretty underwhelming. And dry. We asked for more of the braised rib sauce, but even that wasn&#39;t enough to combat the dryness. 

Loved the Brussel sprout hash on the entree and the sweet potato fries though. Those were the real winners."

It was still happy hour when we wandered in and surprisingly, not too busy.  We got a booth and were quickly attended to.  I loved the dark woods and easy going vibe that the place has.  Our waiter was working a lot of tables, but was never too far away to check in.  I actually got the spiced rubbed grilled flank steak and queso sandwich with grilled peppers &amp; onions, which was amazingly good.  I would dub it the gourmet Philly cheesesteak.

We didn&#39;t have much as far as drinks, but what we had was very good. The food was wonderful. I had the chicken pot pie and also got to try some of the fish &amp; chips.

The service was good, it had a pleasant atmosphere, and it&#39;s fairly reasonably priced.

I have just a couple complaints. The menu is pretty limited, particularly when it comes to vegetarian options -- it&#39;s more of a bar than a restaurant. The other problem was that they had the door to the outdoor patio open the whole time. It had been a nice day, but it wasn&#39;t comfortable having a 50 degree wind blowing in the door at us the whole meal."

However, my last visit took an unfortunate turn. My wife and I have been going to Prohibition fairly regularly since I moved to Denver in August of 2013 (we live 1 block away). 

After working on the 16th Street Mall during the Zombie Crawl myself, two coworkers, and the girlfriend of one of them decided to grab a couple drinks after closing up our shop. 

We came in around 12:30am. One of our party had already arrived and gotten a beer. The coworker I arrived with ordered a beer and got it without starting a tab and headed out to our table. I ordered a beer and told the bartender to put his on my tab (I thought it was slightly strange that she didn&#39;t have him open a tab or pay, but I was hoping to buy the first round anyway so it worked out). We sat on the patio for a bit talking about how crazy zombie crawl is and the coworker who arrived before us went in to get another drink and asked if anyone needed anything. My other coworker said, I&#39;ll have another beer and she went in and got it on her tab (thus, both of his drinks were already paid for). Pretty normal night thus far.

At 1am they closed the patio and we went in and got a table and continued to chat about the evening. At last call we went up to settle our tabs. Bartender 1 was taking a (large) &#34;shot&#34; of Jamison with a patron. After she took the shot she came over and we asked for our tabs. My coworker was unaware that both of his drinks were already paid for and said he had two tall boys. She immediately went brought him a tab with just that. My tab was accurate and so was our other coworker&#39;s. 

This is where our experience took a nose dive. Upon trying to rectify the billing mishap it was very clear the bartender was intoxicated and couldn&#39;t really comprehend what we were telling her. I told her that I have worked in the industry and I think it is really unprofessional that she is drinking behind the bar. She asked where I work and when I told her where I currently work she condescendingly said &#34;that&#39;s cute.&#34; She also told me that the manager lets them drink behind the bar and ignorantly stated that there shouldn&#39;t be an issue because she had comped everyone in our party at least two drinks each ... but each of us only had two drinks. So ... at this point I&#39;m realizing how intoxicated this bartender really is. The other bartender finally came over and tried to help and it was clear that she had been drinking as well.

I called them both out on drinking behind the bar and they asked me to leave and never come back. 

I was probably a little short and rude when I called them out for drinking behind the bar. I&#39;ll own that. I was not intoxicated in the least and was frustrated by the lack of professionalism demonstrated by these bartenders at a place I&#39;ve been a patron at longer than either of them have been employed there."

I ordered a whiskey Sprite and ended up with a whisky ginger. Brushed that off common mistake. Then we order food which took over 45 minute to get ( all we ordered were fries) and my friend orders a sandwich where took over an hour to come out. We were going to a show that we ended up being late for, our waitress was completely unapologetic and rude. We ordered one last round of drinks which took so long it was no longer in happy hour, thanks for that. Then when we expressed that fact that we had somewhere to be they somehow took even longer. I will honestly never walk into the joke of an establishment ever again. And as someone whom deals with a lot of out of town clients and tells them good places to eat and drink I will never recommend this place. Good job"

Tonight I went out with a few work buddies, and they got our tabs a little messed up. Which I totally 100% understand - I work in the service industry myself, and I get that stuff gets mixed up sometimes. But the bartenders were way way more mixed up than anyone sober would have been. At one point both the bartenders told me and my coworkers that they had &#34;comped each of us at least two drinks&#34;. Which didn&#39;t make any sense, at all. Since this was the first/only issue we were bringing up to them... Why would they have comped all three of us two drinks each? And we were only asking after a single drink that had been double charged?

The bar is a beautifully carved, dark wood piece that recalls literally the Prohibition days, however the rest of the space doesn&#39;t seem to aesthetically align with the old-time look the name might suggest. On the other hand, the crowd is a good mix of laid back and fun-loving people. 

On Sundays, the brunch boast $10 carafes of Mimosas and Bloody Marys, plus the draft specials aren&#39;t too shabby either. The Kitchen Sink Salad satiated me for a bit, but I really wish the ingredients could have been more frequent. That and the server. Very polite but a little inconsistent until it was time to take our credit card. The place wasn&#39;t packed. In the case of an over pouring of people, I would&#39;ve understood the slower service.

What?!?! You have the cheese and refuse to put it on my sandwich? It&#39;s a $10 sandwich and they can&#39;t make it the way I want? Great customer service.

We&#39;ve seen them on Diners, Driveins and Dives and when we came to the Fillmore recently it seemed like the perfect place to go.

They have a great selection of beer and on happy hour the prices aren&#39;t too bad.

I had a burger with bacon and a side of fries, while I didn&#39;t like that every single thing was extra - including the fries - I thought my burger was excellent. Cooked to perfection and the bacon was at its crispy best.

Service was excellent, too.

It was all pricey, but good!"

It&#39;s one of those bars where the people to waitress ratio is not in proportion, but our waitress Cupcake was so nice, and thorough also.

I went here for Brunch on a Sunday.  Service was fast and good, but the food was middle of the road.

This is only my opinion though.  The service was good, the food and ambiance however, I found lacking."

So the name is a bit misleading but it&#39;s cool. Sometimes I don&#39;t need bells nor whistles (for the record, that&#39;s more the exception than the rule). The interior is as dark dark dark as my heart and I can see losing an entire evening here (or, at least until last call at 2am). When I recently visited, it was impossible not to enjoy the cool evening and I was totally down with the patio on the side (note: sit with your back facing the icky McDonald&#39;s across the street that totally ruins the vibe!)

Prohibition is a purveyor of a variety of cocktails, both house specialties and classic, the kind you&#39;d find in my home city. And man, are the prices *right*!!! I&#39;ll be real: I wasn&#39;t in love with my Midnight Blue cocktail (far too charmed by the name to not realize it would be too sweet for my tastes). I blame the moonshine. Or the fact that the lemonade tasted like it was out of a box rather than fresh squeezed lemons + water. I&#39;m a little bit sour on that fact, not gonna lie. I wasn&#39;t compelled to order another and that&#39;s a rarity. It might have had more to do with the fact that they close the patio earlier than closing time, which is understandable given the neighborhood being somewhat residential on one side. So, it was a one drink kind of evening at Prohibition.

No food for me here (would it kill them to have a veg option that&#39;s not French fries? I guess I just want it all, don&#39;t I?)

I don&#39;t mean to complain! The service is fine and it&#39;s definitely a bar I&#39;d return to when in the area, but probably not a destination for me."

With such an embarrassment of riches, it&#39;d be easy to overlook a bar like this, its in an urban portion of the Capitol district more than a few blocks away from the tourists and the LODO.  That&#39;d be a mistake.

You can feel the old-school dive that the place is built on coming up through the floor.  The relaxed attitude and the drinks forward approach, they list the classics right on the menu, are a quick antidote to commercial bar standards.  

Big tables, inviting to sharing or traveling in packs, further the friendly crowd.  And there&#39;s a large sidewalk patio just outside to enjoy a smoke and a drink, should that be more your speed. 

Great Drinks, Great Crowd, Great Bar."

Not only was the food relatively forgettable, but I came here just after having been to williams and graham, so I was hoping for a comparable speakeasy environment and got bunk.

Ultimately, comparing W&amp;G to Prohibition is like apples to oranges, but I just felt there should have been a more pronounced historical presence...call me old-fashioned, but if you describe yourself as something specific, you should follow through on the premise.

To be fair, the food and drink wasn&#39;t terrible. But the price point is what drove it down to two stars -- we got one app, two entrees, one dessert and two cocktails and spent 100 dollars. I could&#39;ve eaten at a much better restaurant for that kind of money."

We almost never have to wait. I don&#39;t know if we just have spectacular timing or what, but the only time we ever struck out was on New Year&#39;s Day, which I&#39;m pretty sure is the busiest brunch day of the year, so I can forgive that. 

Their food is so fresh. I usually get some sort of omelet or hash or scramble with a side of pancakes, and it&#39;s always top notch. Fresh veggies, generous portions, and everything is ALWAYS delicious. I think if I had to name one complaint, it would be that the upcharge for chocolate chips in the pancakes is a bit excessive (I think it&#39;s like $1.50 or $1.75), but I still get them every time. Maybe I&#39;ll just sneak in some chocolate chips next time. Call me the chocolate chip smuggler. 

I want pancakes."

Inside reminds me of an old-school breakfast place, with lots of cafe tables and booths along the sides. I though that the menu would be the standard fare for such a place, with typical breakfast options- quite honestly I was expecting nothing that deviates too heavily from any other breakfast diner in middle America. 
Boy, was I wrong. The menu does have plenty of the usual fare, but there&#39;s also some completely unique options that I don&#39;t think you can get anywhere else. Seriously, I was completely torn between like six of the meals on the menu. I ended up getting the sweet potato hash with scrambled eggs, and it was a ton of really high quality food. Being the native Coloradan that I am, I of course got green chili on the side, which was a great choice. Their green chili is actually quite spicy and I would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to try it. The menu also has lots of options that are vegan and gluten free, so if you have specific diet restrictions this place is definitely willing to accommodate. 
The wait staff was attentive and willing to answer all my questions- really quite friendly!"

Thanks to all the yelpers out there who informed me via Yelp about awesome this place is. We started off with their bottomless mimosas  which really hit the spot on a Sunday morning! I got the special for the day which was chicken fried steak smoothed in sausage gravy and topped with two made from scratch biscuits and two eggs cooked to your liking.

My friend and I walked here from their place (around Sloan Lake - a pretty good walk!) and came for breakfast early on a Thursday morning.

We sat outside since it was so pleasant and were given water upon sitting down. Our server was attentive and checked in on a lot, which was great.

I ordered their Frittata which was made with egg whites and you were able to choose three different toppings. I went with red pepper, mushroom and avocado. So, so good. It came with a potato cake and spinach salad and both were delicious. I was really pleased with our breakfast. It wasn&#39;t too heavy, was home made and had so much flavor.

It&#39;s never been so overwhelming that you can&#39;t get seated and have to wait 2+ hours though like OTHER popular unnamed breakfast joints in the area. It&#39;s bright, cheery, and still got that comfy diner charm going for it. 

The food is consistently good and albeit mostly diner-food, but it&#39;s better than what you&#39;d find in a middle-America diner. A step above, if you will. I also say this because dang, their house coffee is pretty darn delicious. I thought it was going to be watered down, tasteless coffee (because that&#39;s what you get in the aforementioned diners), but it was smooth, rich and flavorful.

Natasha was my server and took the best care of me start to finish; super polite and friendly. She didn&#39;t treat me like an individual, she treated me like I was her best friend.

Let me start by saying that the lake view patio is gorgeous and is pet friendly, so bring yo furry friends (pets, not furries you wierdos).

They do call ahead and will text you when a table is ready, which is as good as morning sex in the sense you weren&#39;t expecting it, but damn it was good to have. 

Now the food. I ordered the bottomless mimosas, well because, why not. Daydrinking is ok on weekends, right?

Now, I didn&#39;t just order mimosas (no judging needed) and went with the special, the Filet Mignon Eggs Benedict (picture attached). It was seasoned beautifully (Gordon Ramsey voice), complete knockout. The wife had the sloans breakfast and was great, nothing wrong with it one bit.

I would highly recommend Ruperts. Great crowd, great food, and owner is very approachable and talkative. All in all, great local spot.

The service is super warm and genuine. I love it!

She was probably the best server we have had in all of Denver. she was very personable, HILLARIOUS, and very prompt with our mimosas and food and etc. will def be back! this place rocks in my opinion!!"

There were 6 of us who sat out on the patio for breakfast, we were quickly seated with no wait (8am).
I had the chicken fried steak, came with 2 biscuits on top and smothered in gravy, 2 eggs &amp; potato pancakes.  The biscuits were very dense, needed extra gravy for those two bad boys, very good.  My wife had gluten free pancakes that also came with eggs,  she absolutely loved it.
Others at the table had corned beef hash and a breakfast sandwich with Texas toast, I forget the name but snapped a pic.  There would be no leftovers this morning.
Great food, ambience, service &amp; view!!
By 8:45a it started to get crowded &amp; by time we left, 9:30ish, it was packed."

We had quite a wait to get seated, but that is understandable at such a popular place. And I can see why it is so popular. Great food, I had the chili bowl and it was just what I was hungry for. Not overwhelming hot, but flavorful. The sunny side up egg was perfect. My husband had the truffle scramble. He enjoyed it and from the taste I had I think that is on my list to have there some day.

Even though it took a bit to get seated, the servers were right there ready to help, got us coffee, cream, water and such quickly. Took our order and seemed be at our table so quickly I wondered if they had over heard us talking about what we wanted before we got sat down!

I was not impressed by the coffee, it was not horrible, just not as good as I was hoping for after waiting for such a long time. Next time I know to bring my own and enjoy while I am waiting and get another drink. I did really enjoy the orange juice. I am not much a juice drinker but it sounded good and it was. I am sure the mimosas are great too, just did not feel like starting drinking yet today."

The place was packed!  The service, however, did not suffer.  Our waitress was kind, attentive, cheery, and helpful! The food was, for the most part, great.  For the most part.  

I had the veggie benedict, though I subbed in the green chili hollandaise.  Since I love heat, this proved to be an excellent choice!  My husband had the sweet potato, corn, and black bean hash.  He also thoroughly enjoyed his dish.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s where the good news ends.  My daughter ordered the truffle scramble, and though she was really looking for it, she was extremely disappointed.  There was SO much truffle oil on her eggs that she could hardly eat.  In fact, it not only ruined her meal, but the smell was so overwhelming, that it impacted all of us.  I had to move away from her plate.  It was too bad.  Correctly executed, I&#39;m sure the dish would have been amazing.  Too much of a good thing, even truffle, can be really bad.  Bummer!  

Other than the truffle oil incident, Rupert&#39;s proved to be a good little spot.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll give it a second try, and hopefully we can give it four stars next time!"

The food is definitely better than typical diner food, service is always friendly and they do $9 bottomless mimosas. When it&#39;s nice out, it&#39;s lovely to enjoy the lovely view of the lake. When it&#39;s gross out, it&#39;s lovely to sit and stare at the snow while you stuff your face with comfort food and cocktails and delight in how warm and comfy you are compared to the freezing hell that&#39;s happening outside.

We&#39;re slowly working our way through trying the whole menu and everything so far has ranged from good to awesome. If you&#39;re a little hungover and super starving the breakfast BLT has magic hangover dissolving powers, I swear. The dude has only good things to say about the gouda grits which are a weekend special and if you&#39;re a savory grits person, go for it before they run out. If you want the super-cool kid dining experience go ahead over to Snooze and wait 2 hours for weekend brunch, but if you want good food and all the mimosas your little booze loving heart could desire then just go to Rupert&#39;s and find something cool to do with the time you just saved yourself."

I&#39;ve been there twice now, I have to say I liked what I order the first time.. I thought the chicken fried steak was purdy bomb! It came with biscuits on top so it was like a two for one dish(biscuits and gravy...yum). There bloody Mary&#39;s were also great, they were 2 for 1. I also thought the French toast was super good! The second time I got a stuffed poblano pepper, wasn&#39;t too impressed. Overall it was ok. I&#39;ll probably be by again to try there mimosa and have another Bloody Mary..

She was skeptical about my carrot pancakes (secretly I knew she&#39;d love them, that is why I ordered them) but as soon as they were on the table and before I could unwrap my silverware, she had both tasted and commandeered them. 

That was it, she was in love and is already talking about coming back.

They have a front patio seating area that looks out onto a nearby lake, the lake being literally across the street. The patio also allows customers to enjoy the crisp Colorado air while eating their breakfast. We step inside and are greeted by a friendly face that seats us immediately. Our server comes by soon after we are seated to take our drink order, then our food order a little after that. Our burgers come out in about ten or 15 after ordering, which was pretty quick in my opinion considering they had a full house. Our burgers were absolutely divine. Both of us ordered the hangover burger, angus beef, bacon, and an egg with a choice of Parmesan fries, or yam fries for an extra dollar. The bacon was crisp, the burger was juicy, and the egg was a little runny, the way we love it!

I had the peach stuffed french toast, which was a special for the day. Very tasty stuff, but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s gone now. The gouda grits were also awesome.

Ordered the bottomless mimosas and after the first glass went the entire meal without a refill despite being told it was on its way when our food was served. The food was good, and served quickly. It would have been nice to know that when it says &#34;choice of meats&#34; that some of the options they tell you cost extra.

I may have given it 4 stars if I would have had the bottomless mimosa (great deal). However, after a rough Friday night, I opted for coffee. For a place that is open primarily for the breakfast and lunch crowds, coffee should be a top priority. However, I couldn&#39;t even finish a cup. My other half ordered an Americano and it was also void of great coffee flavor. Overall this place has a great location and looks like it has a nice patio with beautiful Sloan&#39;s Lake and downtown views.

Food: The food was also OK. I had the Veggie Benedict. There was nothing great about it. It wasn&#39;t horrible, either. It was just OK. I had to use pepper, salt and hot sauce to get it up to par.

Coffee: If this were strictly a coffee shop, this place would have received a scathing review and 1 star. Denver has many great local roasters. I would highly recommend that the owners shop around and change this up for both coffee and espresso drinks.

Staff: The staff was 5 Star worthy. Super nice, friendly and very attentive. If only the food and coffee drinks matched the front of house staff, this place would be a no-brainer for a 5 Star rating."

I would love be to come in the summer and sit outside.  I will definitely be coming back!"

We have been here before after church on Sunday and it was pretty good food wise. Today I came in by myself for breakfast- after being seated I waited approx. 10 minutes before my server showed up for my order (it was not super busy in the restaurant) I ordered a classic eggs Benedict and coffee - although my food did show up quickly there was nothing exciting to it.  Potatoes were two little rounds of tasteless mush.  And the eggs Benedict was lifeless without much taste- a little seasoning would have been good.  Just ok

The server was great and the breakfast menu hit the spot. Their &#39;weekday mimosa&#39; was delicious and filled to the brim for only $4.50.
The only complaint was that our waitress, Shannon, took our order and tacked on extra charges for the 3 blueberries in the pancakes that came on the side. She mentioned the extra $1 charge for choosing a side of fruit, but when saying we could pick toast or pancakes - blueberry, strawberry, or plain - she failed to mention that those weren&#39;t standard options and the blueberry version was $1.25 charge. Not a big deal if she had mentioned it rather than acting like the options were all the same. They forgot our avocado on our omelet and it didn&#39;t come out until we were nearly finished with the meal, so that was a bit of a bummer.

All in all it&#39;s a great breakfast spot and luckily there are some extra parking spots in the back."

I was eyeballing the Gouda grits on the special board and was saddened when they erased it before we got our table, but I was not sad for long! 
I had the truffle scramble, and it&#39;s all I can think about- it was so good, perfectly fluffy eggs, with just the right amount of crunch from the fresh asparagus! Yum! The crispy on the outside,creamy in the middle potato pancake was a great companion to the eggs, throw in a side of toast and it&#39;s what I call a great breakfast!  Everyone was super nice and friendly here; even with the busy atmosphere! Definitely coming back here again!"

The food is nothing to write home about but it is consistently good, just wish they would step it up a notch to make it great as it has the potential. The staff are always friendly and courteous which is nice. The view of Sloan Lake is amazing from Rupert&#39;s.

We have lived in the neighborhood for a couple of years now and this is our go to place when we want to walk to breakfast as it is close to home. We wish they would change the menu every once in awhile as it has not changed once since we&#39;ve been visiting there, even with the change of ownership they did not change the menu which seems a little strange to me.

I had the Truffle Scramble and it was slightly sweet and definitely savory.  The asparagus was perfectly cooked with no fibrous pieces.  The cheese was perfectly melty.  The truffles added a light tasty flavor.

A great combination of crispy and creamy seasoned to perfection.  Their corned beef is made in house and is so delicious that I ate my French toast and came close to eating half of my hubby&#39;s dish.  It came with hollandaise sauce, which we thought was weird at first, but man did it taste awesome.  Rupert&#39;s is casual, comfortable and has a good view of Sloan&#39;s lake.

I got delivery and my $35 order arrived smelling like it hung out at a cigarette filled bar for an hour. It STUNK something fierce. I totally lost half of my appetite just off of that. Try the wonton soup and it was awful. Wontons were an off/odd color, broth had nothing to it other than bad broth- no cabbage -no nothing. Threw that in the trash after two bites. Then got garlic beef, asked for spicy and it was SOOoO overly sweet. Im really hoping  I just hit them on a horrible day, because this was just all across the board a waste of my money. There are way more delivery options around I like and trust more."

There was a another girl on the counter she was smiling all the time.

The menu was fairly large and the prices reasonable.  

We tried a couple appetizers.  The pan fried pork dumplings were well-cooked and tasty.    The won-ton soup was just fine.  I had no complaints about my Mongolian Beef.  Others at the table seemed to really enjoy the Curried Shrimp.  Similarly, the Lo Mein was well received by our table.  Service was good. The food was hot.  And they did not skimp on the rice.  At the end of the meal, there was a pleasant surprise.  Instead of the standard fortune cookie, we each enjoyed a small piece of coconut cake.

I typically stick to the chicken dishes- all which have proved to be very good. It is always cooked correctly and not greasy like many other Chinese restaurants. My only wish is that they would include an extra something in their fried rice aside from egg. Throw in some onions or something for a little bit of added flavor please :)"

My wife and I thought we would see how the new owners fared. We ordered dinner at the restaurant on a Dec Wednesday evening. We had Hot and sour soup, spring rolls, mu shu pork and orange beef, not spicy, white rice came with the meal, and tea. The bill came to $26.00 and change. 

Overall the food was good, nice little spice kick for the hot and sour soup. Hot mustard was definitely spicy. The orange beef, crispy and tender, though not paper thin as another reviewer described it.  The mushu pork they rolled for you, and all you needed to do was unroll and apply your own hoisin sauce and re-roll it.

Comparing Paradise to Ambrosia which is just down the street on Liverpool, we felt that Paradise is better than Ambrosia with Similar pricing.

Overall, an average Chinese restaurant, good food and service, not spectacular, not bad for the suburbs.  There are other Chinese restaurants in the area, but they are about 9 miles or more away from Paradise Asian Cafe."

I asked for gluten free items, and selected the lemon chicken our server suggested. My husband ordered egg foo young. After roughly 10 minutes or more, the server came back out to say they were all out of egg foo young for the day. It takes too long to make, and therefore we could not order. What?? It&#39;s an omelette! My husband placed a different order of chow mein. His food came out so fast, it makes me wonder if it was pre-made and just heated in a microwave. My lemon chicken comes a couple minutes later, Although it did look good, it was two huge chicken cutlets dredged in flour and fried. I said that was not was I was expecting since I requested gluten free items only. The server said yes, it&#39;s just flour on the chicken. I informed her that flour has gluten. She promptly whisked it away. I told her I did not want anything else. This whole situation has just gotten too bizarre. She then offered me brown rice. Gee, thanks. If you are going to be running a restaurant, it&#39;s probably a good idea to know a little bit about food and ingredients. We used to be frequent diners of Paradise when they first opened. Over the years, the service and quality just keeps declining. This restaurant has changed ownership and staff, and they are driving it into the ground. We were the ONLY people in the restaurant.

We&#39;ve ordered from Paradise Cafe 9 times. Of those 9 times, 8 of those experiences included messed up orders. Today my family ordered 3 take out meals, and when we got home, we saw that one of the meals was wrong (it was supposed to be combination fried rice with no peas or carrots, and was instead chicken friend rice with peas and carrots). When I went in to pick up the order, I specifically asked if it was combination fried rice with no peas or carrots, and was told yes. Since I was in a rush, I took them for their word, paid, and left. When I got home, I saw that not only was it not what we&#39;d ordered, but they&#39;d neglected to give us the receipt inside of the bag despite me asking. After calculating it, we found that they had charged us for the price of combination fried rice (which is more expensive) but had given us only chicken fried rice. When we tried to call back and get what we had actually ordered, they refused. At this point, we&#39;re done. I&#39;d strongly suggest going to honey bee asian bistro, moon thai, or any of the other more competent take out restaurants. This place is over priced, the quality of food leaves a lot left to be desired, and they&#39;re apparently incapable of getting orders right 90% of the time."

Delivery time was 15 minutes later than promised.  The food was cold once delivered and portion sizes less than expected. The sweet and sour chicken was without sauce and when we called about it they did sent out more sauce but it took 25 more minutes to get it.  The food was not very good and when we asked for a discount the manager was very rude and would not accommodate unless we would bring the chicken back into the restaurant (which defeats the purpose of delivery and paying a delivery charge). Will not order or go to this  restuarant ever again.

The orange beef is amazing. Sliced very thin, super crispy, with a sauce that is perfectly balanced- sweet and spicy. I&#39;ve still not found a place in Chicago that compares.

The prices are super reasonable, too."

We&#39;ve eaten their about 20 times within the past year, and find the consistency to be far superior to any of the dozen similar restaurants in the area.  

Amazed at the consistency of their quality, I discovered that each day, the owner oversees and tastes the preparation of the sauces, so that you will always find them fresh and according to the highest standards of the attentive owner.  He also makes sure that there are a colorful variety of fresh vegetables, so that you enjoy the same fine quality on any day of the week.

Husband ordered the burger, it came out like a Mexican dish, a burger bun on the very bottom, then the hamburger patty, then it covered with green chili sauce.

Her: how&#39;s everything?

5.  Quality of food

What I got at 5281:
1 - 5 were met and exceeded expectation.  I ordered the 5281 salad which is a delicious and fresh salad topped with peel and eat shrimp and a strip steak cooked to perfection!!!  My husband ordered the cheesy burger which came with FRESH, hand cut fries, and side of ranch (which is delicious).  It probably sounds silly, but I am always a bit delighted when you don&#39;t have to remind the server about the side of sauce that you requesting during the order process.  You will also see the owner moving about the front of the house and making sure the guests are all enjoying their choices.

We found 5281 on Yelp, and we noticed that it had 15 reviews and averaged a full five stars. Needless to say, we were intrigued. We are not from the southwest side of Denver, but rather Broomfield, so we were in unfamiliar territory. We initially thought this restaurant was in Morrison, but it turned out to be in a nondescript strip mall off of C-470 somewhere. Not exactly eye-appealing. To its left is a run of-the-mill liquor store. To its right is a shop that sells standup paddleboards, run by a wacky lady with whom we had a one-way conversation prior to our meal; I now understand that inflatable boards are not a good purchase, and all of her dresses are meant to be worn in the water but have pockets with no closures. We will drop by to see her again never. As for 5281, let me begin with the ending: this place is fantastic. Quite a surprise, and here are a few details. This place is about eight months old, and the personnel are extremely engaging and friendly. Granted, it was not very crowded at the time we were there, so we were able to spend more time with our server because she pretty much insisted on doing so. Her name was Christi, not to be confused with her colleague named Kristie. Really nice and a bit quirky, we learned a lot about her personal life, including her dual ambitions of becoming either a dentist or a wedding planner. That makes sense, I thought to myself. She moved here from California to be near to her grandmother, and I appreciated this sweet sentiment, although I admit my first inclination was to consider her a runaway serial killer, hiding in the shadow of the Front Range. The menu was amazingly straightforward, with staples such as steak, more steak, baked potatoes, and burgers. But, their specialty is a pork-based green chili. I know, I know, everyone has this. However, it was amazing! It was the last thing I needed before running in an event tomorrow, but I could not hold back. The sample that she brought us was enough for me to uncharacteristically order a green chili burger with fries. Upon completion, I notified my family that it was the best meal I&#39;ve had in the 21st century. My son is in New York City and my daughter is in Russia, each traveling, but I felt it necessary to text them this information immediately. I began to understand why the ratings were so high at this place. The owner is named Bruno, and he looks exactly like someone named Bruno. He is quite physically imposing, and I would bet my last dollar that he has beat the hell out of several fellas in the old days, probably for the betterment of everyone. My wife agreed with this assessment. Bruno told us that they have been making this green chili for 15 years. In addition to the great food, the clientele is quite mixed, and this is a good sign. On one side of us were some tattooed motorcyclists, and we were flanked by a foursome whose aggregate age was about 500, enjoying a combination of New York strip steak, hits on their oxygen canisters, and some cold beer. I&#39;ll take that any day! The decor was fake wood with a copious number of television screens showing various sporting events. And in one corner were a cluster of misplaced paintings that I think were for sale. The long bar served plenty of drinks, and everything is reasonably priced and of high quality. These are folks that you want to succeed in their business. As we departed, practically every employee waved and said goodbye, and did not even seem fake. I may make the long drive back to have the same meal very soon, possibly tomorrow. Maybe even in the morning. I highly recommend that you try this place out and enjoy it as much as we did. It&#39;s fun to find a little gem out there, and this is such an example. 5281 is damn fine, by golly."

This place was great. Food was great and the price was right. The service was excellent. My steak came out a little overdone and they took it back immediately and the owner brought out another in short time that was one of the best steaks I&#39;ve had in a very long time. They even gave us a free dessert that they make themselves and it was great too. I had to bring it home to finish it! The side salads were not your typical iceberg lettuce with carrot either and were very good. The best part was their green chili!! Excellent! We had the green chili fries and my husband was very impressed! We really liked the food, sporty relaxed atmosphere and good drinks. Great alternative to the other crowded steakhouses in this area. We will be back!"

This location is pretty awesome. Their bread is always soft while most others are a bit crispy. The employees here are super nice every time I have visited and have yet to mess up an order.

I&#39;ve noticed that this location is pretty skimpy with the tomatoes. I order a #13 - Gourmet Veggie Club. I consistently get 3 small tomatoes per sub which is pretty wild. Same with the cucumbers, the lettuce however is always abundant. I don&#39;t mind a lot of lettuce but would prefer a bit of everything in each bite. Anyways, I now request extra of certain things which seems to give me a normal amount in the end. 

Unfortunately they do not deliver to my area. I will never understand their delivery radiuses.  But, whenever I order online for pickup I arrive 7 minutes later and my stuff is ready!!"

The bar atmosphere is nice, it features open air windows and an outdoor patio. It&#39;s a really fun place to watch sports. You would think that its proximity to Regis would make it a full fledged college bar, but it&#39;s got a really nice balance of folks who frequent the place.

I&#39;ve passed by numerous times and heard they got good specials-
Seemed mostly a college hang out-
I also love to play pool and they have 2 tables- 
When we got there I really did not like the atmosphere and felt uncomfortable - 
Although I only went outside to take a phone call-  
People were being loud on the patio and it seemed like it was getting a little out of control- 
I did order food because I was hungry and my cheeseburger with bacon was pretty awesome with fries - (Made the trip in worth it)

The bartender was polite and knowledgeable and recommended a few Denver brews that I loved so much I went and bought to bring back home.

It&#39;s in a cool neighborhood location and you get the neighborhood crowds.  The garage doors they have will open to let that cool breeze or sun shine in that leads to the outdoor seating area.

Even when I did an apparent party foul asking for a Yuengling and Kyle (the bartender) mentioned &#34;You&#39;re not gone find anything like that East of the Mississippi&#34;...Midwesterner problems.

Yes, I appreciated the renovation but they are sinking into old behaviors. Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t get: the burgers and wings are good- really good. I agree with everyone who talks about the high quality of the food. They could attract a crowd for food but they are clearly still catering to the Regis crowd exclusively.  

It took 20 mins to get a servers attention and when we did she still failed to clear the table of glasses from the previous occupants. Service didn&#39;t improve as time went on and we waited long periods of time between visits to the table and for an extended period of time to pay. It was busy so let&#39;s not hold speed against them but cleaning the table is pretty key.  

The floors were gross. Here&#39;s why: beer pong. Ok, that&#39;s your choice to host pitchers and beer pong at your bar despite the improved bottle display encouraging liquor. But on a busy wing night, maybe postpone taking up 1/3 of your space with what equates to 2 cheap pitchers of beer over 20 mins. 

I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not above admitting I smoked a cig or two in the previous establishment but I was reminded very quickly of how little had changed when we found ourselves surrounded by pot smoke. 

All in all, I have fond memories of the Hill Top but I wouldn&#39;t go unless already deep into a bottle of liquor. It&#39;s changed less than you would think post renovation."

They have just enough taps for everyone to get the beer style they like. Their menu is full of foodie, bar food fusion, like Totchos (tater tots topped with nacho toppings). I am definitely coming back for the peanut butter bacon burger!

People are just really friendly and happy, here. We posted up in a corner of the pool room and had a great time chatting and making jokes with the fellas playing pool (including the owner, I believe). We would have stayed longer, had the Snowpocalypse not cut our day short.

It&#39;s not that bad around there, but it just doesn&#39;t look like the area where you would find such a cool bar.  Inside, the place is top notch, fresh, inviting and comfortable.  

Someone has spent some time putting in a first class, neighborhood pub.  It&#39;s attractive, it&#39;s not noisy, it&#39;s clean, and the staff are polite, courteous and accommodating.  Stepping through the doors is almost like stepping into an oasis.  

And, just like a local bar should, they have great drink specials, (the bartender makes a mean Bloody Mary), every day of the week.  This place is definitely affordable.  They have good prices on good &#34;bar food,&#34; too.  I was interested to try the nachos made with tater tots, but I did not.  Maybe next time.  

My wife had a big, soft pretzel, and I had french fries.  The pretzel filled a plate, and it was only $6.00 every day.  My fries were adequate, and only $3.00.  The only complaint I had with the food was that it was a bit greasy, but I kind of expect that from bar food.  I certainly liked the french fries here better than those I had at the Buffalo Rose.  I&#39;m thinking they were frozen, but not kept frozen, and, thus, they retained too much oil.  Either that, or the cook did not let them drain long enough before pouring them in the basket.  

My wife said the pretzels at Piflers&#39; on Colfax was better, but this one was adequate.  

The food, as in most pubs, is probably going to be hit or miss.  I am not rating this place on its food.  I am rating this place on its atmosphere, good drink prices, and excellent neighborhood feel.  There are two pool tables in there, (one even converts to table tennis), a video shooting game, four TV&#39;s, a patio, (albeit completely unattractive), and a real &#34;What is this place doing here&#34; type of feel.  

This should be a top notch destination for students of local Regis College, and a hangout for neighbors as well.  Why drive into Denver and risk driving impaired when you can walk to such a great, local pub.  If I lived closer, I&#39;d be walking there all the time."

Atticus dresses nicely. The ambiance was good - everything clean, lighting nice, decor was high(ish) end. She is pretty well mannered, but the service is where she starts showing some cracks in the facade. It wasn&#39;t any better than what you would find at the neighborhood Chili&#39;s. 

Sadly, Atticus doesn&#39;t have great taste in food. The salmon tartare was fine, but too salty and oily. The risotto was good, but the seafood in the Paella was bland and wasn&#39;t allowed to shine through the overbearing citrus. We finished with a dessert that was indescribably bad - cold, soft apples atop a cold, soft crust topped by cold cream and a side of ice cream. Atticus should know better than to serve that to paying customers. The problem is, they do know better, and that&#39;s why they never asked if we liked it. We ate just a couple of bites and didn&#39;t finish the rest.

Dinner for two cost $80 - far too much for the quality of food provided. It is pretty telling when a restaurant has just two other tables filled on a Saturday night. It&#39;s empty for a reason. Atticus is a low class girl trying to charge high class prices. She has some work to do if she wants to break through."

We arrived at about 7:45 on Sunday and there were only 4 tables occupied. Service was friendly and very fast. The menu was on the small side with about 5 apps, 2 salads and 7 entrees but it was easy to find some yummy sounding choices.  It looks like they change the menu frequently. 

We ordered mussels in a white wine garlic sauce with fries, French onion soup, crispy salmon with asparagus, wilted greens, and pesto fingerling potatoes and the Atticus burger.  

The mussels were good. I liked the flavor of the sauce and that it was served with fries but I wish the sauce was a bit thicker. 

The French onion soup was very tasty, not too salty, and looked beautiful coming out. There were 3 huge chunks of French bread in the soup with cheese melted on top. 

My favorite part of the meal was the crispy salmon.  I would even call it blackened salmon. It was cooked perfectly, very flakey and tender on the inside with a really nice salty crunchy crispy skin!   The asparagus, greens, potatoes, and sweet potato sides were delicious.  Asparagus still nice and firm and greens and sweet potatoes were a great compliment to the salmon.  My only complaint is that I could barely taste the pesto on the pesto fingerling potatoes. 

I&#39;ll be back to try this spot again."

As Atticus is a walkable neighborhood restaurant, I have now been in for dinner and breakfast many many times and I just have to update my review.  

*** 5 stars! *** 5 stars! *** 5 Stars! ***

I just love Atticus. Whether you are there for brunch, noshing on a simple two egg breakfast, or there at dinner enjoying a creative cocktail and some amazing Entree, Atticus has exceptional food and service quality.  

The space is small and intimate with character oozing out of its exposed bricks- remember Fagan&#39;s that used to be on that corner?  They left the painted slogan up over the bar for a serious Denver cool factor. The fireplace is a gem.  Make a reservations with your special someone and ask for it. The food is sophisticated but not over-the-top and always delicious.  Service is friendly and helpful.  It is a place you can go again and again and always have a fresh experience!

I am really surprised it only has 3.5 stars, but in a way, that&#39;s ok- let&#39;s keep it our little secret neighborhood restaurant!"

We met a couple of friends here for breakfast, we had reservations, and we arrived first.  We were sat on the other side of the wall from the bar.  Our friends arrived almost right after us, but the host couldn&#39;t put it together that they were the other half of our party, even though we had all stated there would be four of us.  They sat at the bar for over 10 minutes until they finally heard my voice and looked around the wall.  

Meanwhile, Jess and I ordered mimosas from our server who dropped them off and decided to never interact with us again.  She walked by several times and I watched her see the new arrivals, but never tried to help.  I finally got up and asked another waiter to get her, and he ended up just taking over the table for us.  

The menu wasn&#39;t doing much for me, but I went with the breakfast burrito.  When it came out, it was cold, as if the ingredients were poured into the tortilla from cold storage.  The server was apologetic, and had a new one made.  My companions did enjoy their meals.  A manager touched our table and apologized for the experience.  I really appreciate those two actions, but honestly I think the taste in my mouth is a little to bitter for me to return any time soon."

Service-very friendly and attentive waitstaff. Daniel the new GM talked to every table while we were there. 

Ambiance- very cozy, pretty small but not cramped. Nice decor. 

Parking-lot in the back but it&#39;s usually full. If you are there during the week after 6:15 pm you can park across the street in the Bank lot. 

Menu-minimal choices for apps, greens and entrees but they make almost everything from scratch so understandable. Surprised they had an oyster offering and a buck-a-shuck day. 
The appetizers and entrees seemed a little expensive at $7-15 and $17-26 but then again everything in Denver is expensive these days. 

Food-waitress recommended the duck tacos, kale Caesar add salmon and the  steak frites. 

We ordered to share 
1) duck tacos-3 to a serving. Wasn&#39;t all that impressed but I&#39;m not doing dairy so may not have gotten the full flavor profile without the cheese.  

2) Atticus burger-We substituted seasoned veggies for the fries that normally come with the burger and although the waitress didn&#39;t tell us there would be an up charge, it was only $1 and They were worth it. Asked for medium burger and it came out more med-rare, but boy was it delicious! Seasoned perfectly and really juicy. 

3) Brussels sprouts 
Interesting combination with dried cherries. Probably better with the shaved Asiago that it comes with."

One of the things I appreciated about Atticus was the menu variety. Given that 3/4 of us at our table we some variety of vegan/limited diet, it was impressive that there were still a variety of choices that suited all diets, tastes and appetite levels.

We ordered the Brussels&#39; sprouts and ceviche as appetizers, and while I did not try the ceviche, the Brussels&#39; sprouts may have been my favorite item of the evening. They were crispy and had a nice balance of savory with a little sweet.

I had the steak frites as an entree and asked of medium well. The steak came out more on the medium side, and while it was not my favorite to eat pinkish meat (I know it tastes better that way to true connoisseurs, but after a bout with food poisoning I go medium well), it was flavorful and juicy. The fries that came with it were also good.

We had a berry cobbler and a chocolate pot de creme for dessert and both were solid. The chocolate was served cold, which I should have expected given that it was a pot de creme and that is how it is served, but it may have been tastier warmed up a bit.

The appetizer was a 4, the service was a 5 and the main course/dessert were a 3. If I could, I&#39;d go for a 3.5 overall.

That said, there is enough on the menu that I&#39;d come back again with a veggie/vegan crowd."

A bit inconsistent in service and food quality but overall great effort."

Each time was fantastic! The location itself is fairly small so don&#39;t expect to get a big group in there. They have a great happy hour special from 3pm - 6pm with $5 charcuterie boards, $2 off wine and other specials. Their brunch special is something like $10 bottomless mimosas - haven&#39;t tried it out yet but planning on it!

The ambiance is very intimate but rustic. Decor is super cute - lots of hard wood with a wood burning fireplace.  Definitely making it a point to go back."

I came here with a friend because the drink menu looked fabulous, I had enjoyed the sister restaurant Blackbird for brunch, and I had the pass book for Denver Dining. We ordered the charcuterie board and brussels, scallops, and sea bass. 

The charcuterie board featured three cheeses, a little pot of honey, proscuitto and candied bacon, with some olives and toasted baguette slices. The candied bacon was... cold and limp. The pieces of toast were rock hard. The cheeses and the honey were the best parts. Of course the brussels were pretty good.

My sea bass was not what I typically expect when I order sea bass. It was served more like trout; the piece was much &#34;thinner&#34; than I expected. Usually, I get a thick piece (think like filet mignon) and this was more like a NY strip. Not bad... but not awesome either.

I&#39;d like to give this place another try and order different food. Maybe this restaurant group does better with their brunches."

It&#39;s a really cute restaurant with a small outdoor seating area on a busy intersection (Downing &amp; Evans).  They open at 11 and we were there at 11:15.  They have a small menu but good choices.  However, the server recommended the salmon salad and then came back and apologized because their seafood truck hadn&#39;t arrived yet.  She said she could give me the crab salad with a crab cake instead of crab.  I was disappointed but it was very good.  My friend had the vegetarian sandwich and she liked it as well. I think it might be best for lunch, but I&#39;d be willing to give it a try for dinner if I&#39;m in the area. The server was nice but not overly attentive. Prices were reasonable for lunch.  There were people at a couple of other tables but I liked the quiet atmosphere of the restaurant because we chatted for an hour and a half over lunch and were not made to feel like they needed to turn the table over."

The place was fairly empty, granted... we got there at 3:30. Ha! I hadn&#39;t been here since it was all only Boones (the next-door-neighbor bar), and it was really cool to see the transition it has gone through!

The bartender was very friendly. It was pretty obvious that I was waiting on someone to join me, and he stayed and chatted with me for a little while.

We ended up taking advantage of the happy hour deals. Half off glasses of wine (there&#39;s some fine print on this... I couldn&#39;t keep it straight. If the glass is over $10 it&#39;s half price glass, under $10 was $5 glass... I THINK! Don&#39;t take my word for it) and then some special appetizers. We got the chef&#39;s board which came with 2 meats and 2 cheeses (and other things to top your bread off with). It was tasty... as always I wished there was more bread. And more cheese. 

They have a deal on Monday&#39;s and Tuesday&#39;s (I believe) for half priced bottles of wine. Not a bad date night idea!

We stopped by on a week day to get lunch which was perfect because it wasn&#39;t too crowded and felt like a really intimate atmosphere! Nile was out bar tender and he made really great drink selections and amazing drinks! 

The food was amazing and very fresh and not too over the top feeling. We started with the chef board with meats and cheeses and other assorted snacks which was one of my favorite boards ever! We also split the B.L.T. With pork belly and candied bacon which made for a really tasty sandwich.   

As for drinks may I suggest the clover whisky or anything whisky as Nile was a great drink inventor, or the Bloody Mary which included the candied bacon...yum! Thanks Nile!"

The hubs burrito was very good with lots of chorizo, fried potatoes and delicious green chili, however the cheese wasn&#39;t completely melted on top. My shrimp on my shrimp and grits was perfectly poached and the initial flavors were tasty. 

Now on to the rest of the experience. The place was half full and it took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks and a full 40 minutes to get our meals. We were told a 6 top table&#39;s order went in right before ours causing the extreme delay. It is a little alarming that a restaurant advertising weekend brunch isn&#39;t able to stay on their game and gets into the weeds with a six top. 

This isn&#39;t the restaurants fault but our experience was punctuated by a table of four braying donkeys, whoops, loud girls that were unaware of the space. Other tables around us were also commentating. 

As I mentioned my shrimp and grits was good initially. About halfway through it became a greasy mess. There was so much butter/oil floating on top I couldn&#39;t finish it. The grits were super smooth which only heightened the greasy quality. Our waitress did offer to buy our second drinks on the house but we passed. 

A quick trip to the restroom had watered down hand soap in the ladies. 

We had to ask for our check and an hour after we walked in we were finally released! I think there is a lot of potential but it felt like opening day of a brand new restaurant."

We had an 11:30 reservations and were seated promptly. Our waiter was very nice and he took our drink orders in a reasonable amount of time.  We ordered 2 of the Holy Bloody&#39;s and a carafe of Mimosa.  After a good 10 minute wait we received our drinks and placed our food order.  The Bloody was missing the pickle that the menu had promised.  I wouldn&#39;t normally care about a pickle but I happen to like pickles and with the up charge of $3.00 you would expect you get all the things the menu says your going to get.

After a good 25 min wait the server came over to aplogize that the food hadnt come out yet.  The food was not very good and it felt like they let a new chef cook it all but never told him how to do it.  The vegetable hash was just a bunch of 1/2 sauteed veges on a plate.  You cant put 1/2 raw vege on a plate and call it a hash.  Pretty bad."

I guess it should have been a sign when the place was empty at 10:30 am during brunch on a Sunday. The food was nothing special, didn&#39;t come out hot but it wasn&#39;t worth complaining about. I had a girlfriend order the huevos rancheros and the menu said it came with a side of corn tortillas. It didn&#39;t come out with any corn tortillas so she ask the waitress. The waitress was extremely rude. Her name was Jennifer. Also the bar tender I believe. She argued with my friend saying she read the menu wrong. Then to prove my friend was wrong, went and got the menu only to read that it did indeed come with corn tortillas on the side in addition to the single street taco sized corn tortilla that was on the dish. Brought out an additional two corn tortillas and said &#34;who needs these anyways&#34; service lacked in every way from that moment forward. 
Didn&#39;t refill water or coffee. Brought our checks super early when we probably would have had another couple mimosas while chatting. 
My friend stood up to calm
Her baby and this waitress came up behind her and rudely said excuse me. I guess the first time my friend didn&#39;t hear her. My friend commented that she was rude and that she didn&#39;t hear her. And the waitress &#34;Jennifer&#34; replied &#34;you guys are rude&#34; walked away and called us bitches. I was appalled. For an empty restaurant during Sunday brunch time. This place can&#39;t afford a waitress like her. We also heard her be rude to another table. A question was asked and she responded &#34;is that real question&#34; 
Truly rude. Jennifer, I think you&#39;re in the wrong industry. 
Please note that we are all women, married, with children wanting to enjoy brunch and catch up. We were not rude. The server was rude from the time we sat down which put us all on edge. We did expect good, courteous, respectful service. We did nothing to warrant being called &#34;bitches&#34;"

It started off strong, with only a few people in the restaurant, but after my food was delivered it was all downhill. They were going through a menu transition so the items I&#39;d seen online that sounded good weren&#39;t options which was disappointing but I ended up with the crab cake benedict. It was good but spicy and if I&#39;d known that in advance I&#39;d have ordered something else. After getting my order I didn&#39;t see a waitress for a ridiculous amount of time. I finally ordered a decaf espresso drink which ended up being delicious but it took almost 20 minutes for it to show up so I ended up spending much more time there than originally expected."

Our server was terrific, and we enjoyed a very tasty meal. I had the short rib sandwich on a bed of greens instead of bread. The fries were perfect, and the meal was delicious, but as I thought about it afterward...

When I started eating my food, I asked the server about the cheese, because it had a weird look and strange texture. He told me it was a mixture of Gouda and American cheese. That hit me a little weird, but I filed it away and enjoyed my meal. Today, the question came back to me and I did a little research. Folks, American cheese means processed, like Kraft singles or Velveeta. 

I really wasn&#39;t expecting Atticus to serve me processed cheese. I have a lot of food sensitivities. I choose pricier restaurants like Atticus because I expect that I&#39;m not going to be served horrible food. 

Why am I paying high prices for horrible, low quality, cheap pseudo-food? Gross, Atticus.

The drinks were spectacular and the food ok but the service was well below what I expected considering the prices. Our waitress visited us maybe 4 times and we were constantly left waiting for obvious needs.

The most irritating thing was there seemed to be quite a large staff and many open tables the night we went yet they found it quite difficult to clear our small table with the large dirty plates of appetizers and empty drink glasses we were done with. One waiter walked by at least 3 times and never once offered to take the dirty dishes crowding our table and then another waitress dropped off my soup without a spoon, promised to bring me one, then several seconds later joined some fell off-duty employees for dinner and drinks at the table next to us!

In a city with numerous restaurants offering the same or better quality food and similar pricing this place just doesn&#39;t make the cut. I&#39;d much rather go somewhere where I&#39;m treated well and feel appreciated. After leaving I realized why the place seemed a little empty for a Friday night."

At brunch we had the Brussels sprouts, pork belly benedict (!!!) and shrimp and grits -- all spectacular choices.  At lunch, I had the skirt steak tacos and, of course, some Brussels sprouts.  The skirt steak was unbelievably tender.

The décor is so warm and inviting.  I love the fireplace and there is plenty of room for medium sized groups. The service was outstanding and we were having such a great time that mid-day brunch with girlfriends turned into a couple hours of fun.

2) I had the biscuits and sausage gravy. The sausage was not evident and the sauce tasted and looked like velveeta cheese sauce.  The biscuits were cold. 

3) She had the waffles and they were unimpressive, chewy and bland

My egg was barely cooked, white part runny, and the arugula was so overpowered by a vinaigrette that made the meal uneatable. I picked around the toast and part of the cooked egg.

Most places rely on their showy food or cliche decor. Some places truly do have amazing food but seem to forget that the time between you sitting down and actually receiving that food is important as well.

Atticus blew us away tonight! We arrived half an hour early to our scheduled reservation (on a very busy Friday night) and decided we could check and see if the hostess could sit us early (we knew the chances were slim since they were so busy). Within about 15 minutes, they had cleared a table and had us sat. 

We ordered our drinks and app (the Hot Pot) both things came out quickly. We then ordered our main courses (the lamb and burger). 

Before the food came out, our waiter came out and apologized profusely for the wait and advised us that because we had waited for longer than what they wanted us to that they would be taking care of our entire bill!

We seriously didn&#39;t wait that long, though. We could see they were busy and honestly thought the wait time was decent.

The food came out and it was perfectly cooked and both entrees were packed full of flavor.

This place will definitely get our business again."

So many of us grew up inspired to practice law by Gregory Peck&#39;s depiction of Atticus Finch in &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; that it&#39;s a surprise the name hasn&#39;t become more popular. But maybe this newest incarnation will prove to be as long-lasting a business as it&#39;s predecessor at that Evans and Downing Streets corner: Fagan&#39;s Restaurant from the 70&#39;s. At the time, Fagan&#39;s was just as au courant as Atticus now is, with its small plates and food service set out on planks, along with its homey fireplace.

Atticus did a great job last night. I met a business associate at the bar for a drink and then stayed for dinner with my honey who came on by later. We remained at the bar to eat and were treated well by the cool bartender. Really liked the butcher plate special which included perfectly cooked medium rare squares of lamb and succulent--but too fatty--pork belly (hint to the kitchen: a square of pork belly should at least have some meat on it and not be 100% fat; hence 4 and not 5 stars:). That meat combination was sautéed with baby carrots and Brussels sprouts in a delectable demi-glace. My sweetheart absolutely loved her shrimp and grits, and the Malbec at $8 was reasonably priced and a perfect fit with the lamb.

No time for dessert since we were running late for a movie; but looking forward to catching a rerun of Atticus real soon.

Atticus was recommended by a local since I&#39;m just in town on business. I finally get to the restaurant (btw no parking), walked in and stood behind two customers the &#39;host&#39; was greeting. He had them sit at the bar and walked away. Was fairly busy in there. I waited at the door for about 8minutes before I was even acknowledged. He walked passed me a few times and said nothing. Then finally he said &#34;you have a reservation, sorry we&#39;re booked&#34;. I asked for the to go menu, but I was so turned off I just left. 

Also looked like they had some visitors and they asked me if I had been serviced and I said no. But they didn&#39;t bother to get the hosts attention and he passed them a few times too."

The service was good, she was very nice. We had the pork belly Benedict and the Chorizo Hash and a side of cheddar grits. The ingredients me ideas are there but the execution was not. 
Our poached eggs came out way under done and we had only one bite of cheddar in the grits. The hollandaise was extremely runny and the flavor was just not there. The prices of the food did not reflect the quality at our visit. 
All in all we tried it but most likely won&#39;t come back."

I&#39;ve heard good things about this restaurant so I was very excited to come here with my dad. When I entered the building, I saw no one there. Literally just one family and two employees.
    I asked for a table for 3. An employee came up to me and said in a snobbish tone &#34; sorry we cannot accommodate your group at this point in time.&#34; The time was 9:20 and the nearest reservations were at 10:00. 
    My dad was sad he couldn&#39;t eat there."

First off, the service was INCREDIBLE! The bartenders, the host, the manager, everyone was so awesome! 

Their crafted drinks (specifically the whiskey ones) were really really awesome!

Located near DU, it&#39;s not an area I would usually explore for brunch on a weekend but the reviews had me intrigued. 

First of all they accept reservations, second of all they have their own parking area. Hallelujah brunch heaven. 

Of course bottomless mimosas are available. The menu took me by surprise because there is only one sweet dish: the waffles.  But god almighty the chorizo French toast was amazing. Savory French toast? With a poblano pepper, cheese, egg, and chorizo?!! Yes. Dear Jesus yes. 

Can&#39;t wait to be back for drinks and the dinner menu."

And then there&#39;s the food - glorious food!  BLT sandwich ordered without bread. Pork belly, candied (!) bacon, perfectly ripe tomatoes, arugula, fresh sweet peas, crunchy fried chickpeas, spring mix of greens. AND lightly pickled sweet onions!  And that was just my dish.  My only regret was that as a business lunch I couldn&#39;t sample the lovely artisanal cocktails I observed being served to others. (Did someone say &#34;Sidecar&#34;?) I&#39;ll be back for sure.

While I had driven by Atticus several times, I had no idea what it was and honestly, I didn&#39;t really care. It wasn&#39;t until I was watching 9news last week and they featured them and their Denver Restaurant Week (DRW) menu. I was impressed and decided to make a reservation and went with a friend last night. 

The interior of Atticus is lovely. Warm and inviting with a fire place in the corner of the dining room, which was really welcome on yesterday&#39;s chilly, snowy night!  We were welcomed by our wonderful server Jeff and he explained the DRW menu: included was a shared Charcuterie board, choice of salad, entree and a dessert to share. We both decided on the roasted beet salad, the Corriander and Coffee Crusted Lamb Loin and the Salted Caramel Flan for dessert.

The Charcuterie board was a wonderful start: lovely meats, cheese, tapenades and nuts. The Roasted Beet Salad was the perfect blend of sweet roasted beets and creamy goat cheese and the lamb was cooked a perfect medium rare. I loved the blackberry sauce it was garnished with and I enjoyed the polenta that was on the side. However, I did find the zucchini and summer squash a bit overcooked for my liking but don&#39;t get me wrong, I still ate it! 

By the time dessert came out we were pretty full, but we still had a few bites of the Salted Caramel Flan. I love flan and I love salted caramel and this didn&#39;t disappoint. This flan was less dense than I&#39;m used to which was nice after such a filling meal. And it had just the right ratio of salty to sweet. 

This is what DRW is about, folks! Sampling from the actual menu to discover a new place and hopefully like it enough to return. And in this case it paid off! I&#39;m looking forward to coming back and checking out their breakfast/brunch, their happy hour as well as coming back for dinner and enjoying other items on their menu.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Atticus!"

The ambiance is perfect for date-night or nicer dinner out with friends.  Price is really reasonable as well (or maybe I&#39;m just used to Chicago prices).

The old fashioned was perfect with a nice oversized ice block.

Had the special filet for the evening and it was cooked perfectly.  The brussel sprouts were nice and crispy and I love me some beets.  Only knock I have here is the presentation.

I enjoyed the plating, but wasn&#39;t as much of a fan of it being served on a wooden block.  Maybe I&#39;m being a little neurotic, but wood makes me think bacteria :(

Ended the night with a sazerac which was holy batman strong.  It was well-made, but a little much after the old fashioned and bottle of wine we split."

I could taste all the fresh ingredients.  The mussels were on point!  The white wine broth was worth eating all the bread I used to soak it up.  Also, the service was excellent.  Not pushy, very relaxed, and eager to please this customer that made a couple of special requests.  I will definitely be back."

Had an 8 pm reservation and still no food at 9:15. And definitely no seating at the table.Ordered appetizers from &#34;sister restaurant&#34; at 8:30 and finally got at 9:15. Worst. Ever. Holy crap.

And the bread is horrible.

Annnnd no toilet paper. Used a napkin. And flushed it.

Also, thank you for the basically raw cauliflower &#34;steak&#34;...? Only still here because it&#39;s free. And we&#39;re drunk. And never get out.

 I&#39;m not sure who said this place was inexpensive in their review but that&#39;s not quite how I would describe it. That being said, I&#39;m happy to pay for a good brunch when its really good. 

We&#39;ve been twice now and both times we had a happy table. I had steak frittes and while it was a bit salty, I like that and really enjoyed every last bite. If I had it to do again, the shrimp and grits were outstanding and I had plate envy after ordering. So good! 

Nice place to take the family or a date. Its a good alternative to the student focused restaurants in that neighborhood."

I was surprised at first by how small it is, but I like the quiet, intimate feel.  We ordered the brie pot and salmon flatbread for starters.  The brie pot was peppery and creamy.  There was a lot in there, and four of us didn&#39;t finish it off.  The flatbread had salmon, prosciutto,and a creamy herb spread.  I think I liked it, but my piece was so tiny that I was still deciding by the time it was gone. 

I ordered the skirt steak for the main course. It was cooked perfectly, and I loved the marinade. It was a good sized portion of meat, but one piece of broccoli does not make me feel like a ate my veggies. 

I&#39;ve heard they have phenomenal brunches as well, so I can&#39;t wait to get back."

The hubby and I wandered over on a Friday night around 8 pm. We had not really planned on anything in particular for dinner, and we weren&#39;t really trying for a &#34;date night&#34; or a &#34;fancy meal&#34; or anything. We just happened to be feeling lazy, not up for cooking, and needing to get out of the house (because we both work from home.)

Upon first entering, the space is small and warm, with a great &#34;rustic&#34; style that isn&#39;t too predictable or overdone. I really love the color blue they used on their accent wall! There was a sign that said &#34;check in at the bar&#34; so we asked, and were advised to wait. In a couple minutes, someone came over and asked if we had been helped, and we said &#34;no, not yet.&#34; Suddenly, it was a whirlwind of service and awesomeness, because that someone was actually Justin, the GM for the restaurant. 

Justin and his staff made sure we were well fed! The service was spectacular and had a definite air of the &#34;friendly neighborhood restaurant&#34; - a great feeling when you are so close to DU, and most of the &#34;neighborhood&#34; spots are a bit louder/younger. Not to say I am an old fuddy-duddy, but it was more mellow, and right in line with what I wanted for the evening. 

Hubby had the &#34;butcher&#39;s choice&#34; - a hunk of lamb and a hunk of beef, on a hunk of wood, with parsnips, broccolini, and chorizo, with a whiskey demi-glace. I went with a vegetarian ravioli that was so good, they brought me some extra bread to clean up the sauce to avoid me licking the plate. (Seriously, I was considering it.)

The custom cocktails tend toward the bitter/brown drinks, but this isn&#39;t a bad thing, and they aren&#39;t the *only* options. My first glass was the &#34;Jem &amp; Scout&#34; - mezcal, something spicy, and something else....and it was awesome. It also had *quite* a kick, which made it a good sipping drink. My second round after dinner was a variant on the French 75, since I don&#39;t like pear....and it was also delicious. &#34;Fun&#34; was the word my hubby used to describe it. 

We started our meal off with a Brie Hot Pot - and it was amazing. We ended it with a Raspberry Shortcake. That was also amazing. Surprisingly delicate in flavor, yet still warm and comforting. 

The service was great, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere were great, and a night that started off as &#34;meh, might as well go out&#34; turned into a lovely, romantic, intimate date night - pretty much our first &#34;fancy&#34; night out since getting married in June. It was a much needed evening, and the great people at Atticus had a lot to do with it!

GO HERE NOW. Unless you are loud, obnoxious, or cheap. I will say our meal was over $100, but worth every penny."

The Positive. 
- Super cute, rustic-y environment with nice decor and lots of bright, natural light (we went for lunch).  
- Our server/bartender (same person, as there was 1 person working...which I&#39;ll get to) was super sweet and responsive. 

The Negative
- Slow. Slow. Slow.  As noted above, there was 1 person working both the bar and the 4-5 tables over the course of our lunch. We sat down at 11:45 and it took a solid 15 minutes to get our drinks ordered/delivered, 30+ to get our appetizers (which we ordered immediately upon sitting down because we were starving), 75+ to get our mains.  At one point, we thought maybe our server had forgotten to put in our order.  We had planned on a leisurely lunch but were a bit shocked that we didn&#39;t leave until 1:45. 

- Inconsistent, Underwhelming Food. 

Appetizers: We started with the Brussel sprouts (which were delicious) and the smoked trout platter.  The trout didn&#39;t have a smoked flavor to it (at all) and the blue cheese/caramelized onion spread/dip that came with it was missing blue cheese. It was very bland tasting.  

Mains: When we asked what the &#34;Flatbread of the Day&#34; was our waitress said &#34;Let me go ask, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve decided yet.&#34; Note, it&#39;s well past noon at this point.  When it came out, the crust was completely undercooked/doughy and very sparsely topped. The Caprese Sandwich was more a platter of a few pieces of toast with mozzarella/tomato on top.  The Porkbelly Tacos had some weird refried bean base to it and the arugula on top was wilted.  The three wins for us were the Tuna Tartare, Shrimp &amp; Grits - a super flavorful, large portion - and the Frittes...which I proceeded to dip in the Shrimp &amp; Grits out of hunger from not eating much of the other items."

So why two stars, the food comes nowhere close to being good enough to justify the outrageous prices.  The Duck Tacos are good but you can get much better duck confit tacos down the street at &#34;Uno Mas&#34; for a third of the price.  The have a dish called the cauliflower steak that is one of the most ridiculous things I&#39;ve ever seen.  It is a well cooked and seasoned cauliflower floret on top of the worst quinoa I&#39;ve ever had (assumabley microwaveble) accompanied by a modest portion of roasted veggies.  The price for this disappointment is $17 dollars. This place is trying to be upscale but they just don&#39;t have the talent to compete with pearl street eateries.  Unless they rework their approach or are able to rely on brunch, I wouldn&#39;t give them anymore than year, if that.  I know the millennials in that neighborhood don&#39;t put up with this kind of thing."

I&#39;m not sure if they were short handed for brunch or the waiters head just wasn&#39;t in the game but our food was wrong, the recovery time was less than par and the sincerity of the issues was neutral. As if it was &#34;no big deal-oops&#34; we may visit again but not any time soon."

My girlfriend and I went for dinner and got to sit in the back corner next to the fireplace. The server was polite and attentive. After we had gotten our wine and placed out food order the power on the block went out, there was a blizzard outside. The manager came over and turned up the fireplace for us and said the cooks had enough to power to finish our food and were able to cook with what heat they had left. 

So we were sitting there, in the dark, next to a fireplace, in the middle of a blizzard, and it couldn&#39;t have been more perfect. Our food came out and it was fantastic. The manager would come over periodically to check on us and give us an update on the power.

Once our meal was done, the power was still off, the manager offered to buy our dinner because of the circumstances.

This place was charming, had amazing food, the people there were so friendly, and I would recommend this place to any and everyone."

The space is gorgeous, parking is easy to get, service is (mostly) attentive and perfect and it&#39;s been a great location to take clients for business lunches. PLUS, the menu has been great, tasty and unique. Until...

We went yesterday for lunch to find that the menu has changed (almost entirely) and it&#39;s NOT what it used to be. Gone are the yummy sandwiches (like the chicken breast or the portabella mushroom) the pepparadelle pasta and the steak tacos. In place are a variety of &#34;new items&#34; that seem to actually be the same ingredients used in several different ways.

-Three items with smoked chicken-- salad, chicken salad, and enchilladas
-Three &#34;BLT&#34; items-- a sandwich, tacos and a salad

And a Steak and Kale salad (which I regrettably ordered). While it sounded good, we were served a bowl of undressed kale hiding a few slices of steak, some caramelized onions, four cherry tomato halves and a dusting of blue cheese. Akin to eating rabbit food, I requested a side of vinaigrette just to make the kale less dry and more edible. 

While I know it&#39;s a trend-- for restaurants to kick the good things off the menu, I was hoping this wouldn&#39;t happen with Atticus. Bring back the oldies (and goodies)!"

I went here with a girlfriend and received a very warm genuine welcome.  Service was extremely attentive and responsive.  We asked to be seated near to the fireplace which was really charming.

We ordered the brie pot which was nice but brie was super runny and hot, frisee salad which was over-dressed, brussell sprouts with aoli which were delicious but heavy on the aoli.

Has a warm tasteful decor.  Not super vegetarian-friendly but definitely worth checking out."

Based on their menu online (and the full one our kind server showed us), they have a few vegetarian options for each meal. I was sad to miss out on the Cauliflower Steak, which is supposed to be amazing, but I got the Eggplant Hot Pot (without the egg, as I don&#39;t eat eggs). It was ok, but felt overly salty to me, and like not enough food. However, my corn flan starter was fantastic. My partner had the salad to begin - it was good, but nothing too special or different. For the main course, he had the fish, which again, was good, but nothing so fancy or unique. Desserts were both amazing, and the iced tea, though not frequently refilled, was clearly brewed there and was a delicious blend. 

I am still not quite sure what the theme is here; reclaim rustic? Fancy schmancy mining tavern? Add to that the fact that you have to go through a grungy/loud college bar to get to the bathrooms (again, miner rustic fancy outhouse themed?) that were out of cheap dollar pump soap. Odd, but not a deal breaker.

However, the wait staff were phenomenal, the food, while pricey, as reliable and the main menu had some really creative choices. We&#39;ll be back for a special celebration night to try out the exciting items we missed."

I love the spot and the decor is really great. They have held true to the &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; origins of the name and decorated to befit the story-old-timey industrial, farm-ish, with a bit of bookish thrown in for good measure. I think Atticus has a fighting chance to really standout in the Denver restaurant scene, but there are some kinks to iron out (as there are with any newcomer). The service was...interesting. I was greeted by a very courteous server in a timely fashion and we talked about wine while waiting for my friend. Once she arrived, we decided on a bottle on Zinfandel to share. The server again goes into his wine spiel and goes &#34;at your age I doubt you have tried enough wines to really know what you like and want but I think you did well in choosing this bottle&#34; My girl friend and I laughed and I said &#34;Actually we are studying for our level one sommelier exam right now so you&#39;re talking to some people who actually know a thing or two about wine&#34; (said in a very friendly way!) The server goes &#34;Oh, well in that case I guess you don&#39;t even need me then&#34; and turns around haughtily. My friend and I looked at each other in disbelief! We didn&#39;t mean to crush his ego, we were merely trying to make conversation! After that, the service was just weird. It was blatantly efficient and it was very apparent that we had offended our server, which was completely unintentional. Having been a server I can understand having a bad day but it was like night and day after the &#34;wine incident&#34;. 

However, the food was good, I especially liked the French onion soup; its size was perfect for a starter and the flavors were nicely balanced. I also loved the bruschetta and the flourless chocolate cake is a must for dessert! Our server was nice enough to give us dessert on the house, not sure if he felt bad or if he learned that we knew some people who work there. Whatever the case it was a nice gesture and was much appreciated. 

I hope Atticus can get a solid team together and really take the city by storm as its atmosphere and food are moving it towards a great place in the mile high restaurant scene. Can&#39;t wait to see what the group (Table to Tavern) does with the remodel of their other spot, Handlebar!"

Service was atrocious. The server couldn&#39;t answer basic questions. She didn&#39;t know the beer selection, or the well vodka. Very elementary facts if you are a server at an upscale restaurant. The portion of steak was the real issue. They charge 21$ for what tasted like microwave fries and the smallest cut of steak possible. Will not be returning."

Fusion plate was amazing, lots of interesting choices of meats / cheeses, service was absolutely atrocious, after we waited literally 20 minutes for additional bread for said fusion plate, it finally arrived, a tiny little bit of bread.  Normally, I wouldn&#39;t think to leave zero tip, however, the bartender/manager came over and asked us &#39;how is everything&#39; and we said &#39;we&#39;re still waiting for our bread&#39;. She just fluttered around not really listening to us on this concern.  I guess if someone usually walks around to ask how everything is, I expect that they will actually remedy the concern we have, not just walk around and ask people like a mindless automaton. 

The real zinger for why this is 1/5 stars is the same manager/bar person comes over later and tells us that my entree order never got put in, and that it&#39;s the girl&#39;s first day.  Really, no sorry, you blame your new staff on the problem?  At the time she was telling us this, she didn&#39;t even apologize or say sorry, just put blame on the new person, that is entirely what put me off about this situation. She did come over later in the evening and apologize and give us a free drink, but at that point, I&#39;m sorry, a free drink doesn&#39;t really make up for the multitude of problems we experienced.  All in all, great birthday dinner, we made the best of a bad situation, but I would honestly say, don&#39;t expect to be wowed here by the service!"

Pros: Doughnut bites, cheese board, and mussels. Friendly service.

Cons:

EVERYTHING TOOK FOREVER. There were also out of seemingly a lot of items on the menu.

My eggs were overcooked on my benedict. My husbands burger was overcooked. My friend said her brie and apple sandwich was bland.

After being there for almost an hour we were informed that they were out of what my friend ordered. I forced them to give her a free drink for the silliness.

My friend announced it was the worst brunch he&#39;d ever had.

We won&#39;t be going back as there are far too many places to try to even flirt with disappointment."

We made our reservation for 2 and when we got there, they showed us to an 2 person table in the corner that you couldn&#39;t even get to because the adjoining table&#39;s chair was flush against it.  The waiter even was embarrassed and offered us the option to eat at the bar or at a high top bar table which is what we opted for.  So first impression with seating was not that great.  Decor of restaurant was definitely very hipster.  We ordered the chef&#39;s board which came with 2 meats, soppressata and proscuitto, and a medley of 3 cheeses: a yellow rind cheese that was like brie, a cubed blue cheese, and crumbled blue cheese, olives, pickled onions/red and green chiles, crusty bread, salted almonds, and honey.  I was just sad that they didn&#39;t make any meats themselves...other places have homemade pate or pressed meats like the french are so found of.  my husband had the lamb which cost $26 and was very small...almost medallion like in size.  I had the clams, mussel, and chorizo fettucine and must say it was tiny.  The pasta was small and the sauce was more a broth than a sauce.  After we paid our bill which was almost $100 for 2 people (and I was still hungry), the manager did come by with some free drink tickets to make up for the crappy table experience but that would have been better to give us at the start of our experience.  Not sure if we would come back to use the drink tickets since were were not completely sold on the food.  Fancy but I don&#39;t think they pulled the flavors off."

They really missed the mark today.  

Things were quiet on a Monday, and the restaurant seemed to only have 1 bartender and 1 server there, adequate for the level of business, but not enough to give our table much attention.  We originally set out to just have some drinks and an appetizer, but decided to stay for a light dinner.  The negroni tasted like watered down campari, and was served barely cold.  My wife&#39;s martini (asked for dirty with olives) came out amiss, hard to figure out what was off, but there was something in there that didn&#39;t belong.  We ordered a hot pot (fondue) and mussels, and neither one was crave-able, both were presented well, but seemed to lack seasoning.  4 of us had the Shepard salad, and the general consensus was that it was bland, had little to no lamb.  When I brought this up to our server, he brushed it off and never made any effort to either bring us something different, or to take the uneaten salads off the bill.  

The bright spot on the food was the risotto, perfectly cooked, great flavor. 

I hope they find their way back, I really used to enjoy it.  Tonight they just didn&#39;t seem to care or try."

Took my husband and in laws and had a rez for a Fri night few weeks later. (Mothers day was Sun so this was the Fri before it to give you a date of when this was) Totally different experience unfortunately. We sat forever unnoticed, had to have the hubs get up and ask the hostess if we could get drinks, sorry they forgot about us! No big deal, it happens. But then it was just all downhill from there. Was given wrong main dish/ ordered cauliflower steak- came as small crumble in pot. Food was not that great all around and we ordered all the desserts hoping that&#39;d be better but one of the deserts, a root beer float with stout and vodka was so disgusting I don&#39;t get how anyone could drink it. Just a bad experience all together. Our waiter was apologetic at the end but still, a mAnager should&#39;ve come out and apologized. We ordered a lot! Apps drinks, entrees and all the desserts. A good $300 price tag. And we were in good spirits, laughed everything off and were gracious about everything that kept happening. I later found out my father in law was so ticked that he wrote management an email later and even never got a response. That&#39;s unacceptable to me. Write your customers back, even if they are upset- let them know you at least care. Geez! I felt awful because it was my recommendation too! So it was good one time/ awful the next.

First we ordered brussels which were a tad salty and the egg on top was over cooked.   I had the short rib benedict, the English muffin was dry, thin and hard, the bacon was hard and thick, the short rib was horribly cooked... dry and fat attached that was not cooked, the egg on top of that was over cooked again, the hollandaise was none existent and what was was there was flavorless.  Only writing this review in hopes the restaurant reads it and realizes there is a problem with the execution of the food.

I&#39;ll start out by saying that my biggest disappointments were the main dishes.  We order the fishmonger plate, the butchers plate, the duck duck and the skirt steak.  The skirt steak given was an extremely small portion - it just didn&#39;t make sense for the price.  I was particularly disappointed by the fishmonger dish.  It&#39;s given to you on a wooden slab which doesn&#39;t make for easy eating.  The fish was bland - pretty much salt and pepper on trout.  The scallops were nothing special.  The veggies were boiled and in very short supply.  It was really a lackluster plate.

On the positive side the &#34;beginnings&#34; we had were good.  I highly recommend the brussels sprouts.  The dessert we shared was my favorite.  It was some ice cream surrounded by divine custard and blueberries.  It really hit the spot.  Our server was kind and thoughtful.  She was always there when we needed her.  The ambiance was quirky.  It was a comfortable place to dine at.

I could see myself suggesting this place only for a light bite or happy hour (I hear they offer great deals and their libations list was great).  However, I&#39;ll pass on a full meal here."

One if the signs of a good restaurant is that they have the food readily available on their menu and that it&#39;s good.

It&#39;s the 2nd time that they didn&#39;t have the Green vegetable drink so I asked for the orange carrot drink. The large quart sized container of pre-made carrot drink went sour so I opted for the less desirable red beet drink. 

Note: when you&#39;re drinks go bad, and there&#39;s plenty left, you can FILL it to the Brim and not an inch below it. I was told that this is policy, but when you&#39;re &#34;freshly&#34; made drinks go sour on you, I don&#39;t think you have to worry about scraping an inch off the top of the cup for profit?! For a high cost of $5 and change, I think you can live with filling it up... 

Suggestions: Maybe make the juice as it is ordered and fill it to the brim... You will have happier customers! :D 

ps... I dint know about the rest if the menu, but last time when I got the biscuit w/ egg &amp; bacon, the biscuit was meH. I ordered the greens with it but had to ask for it in place if the potatoes when my plate came.

This place needs to Step it Up more then a few notches!

The chef knows what&#39;s up and the food was incredible.  Portions are the perfect size.  the Waiter was attentive but not hovering.

My only complaint about this place is, the tables for two are soclose to the next table, it&#39;s impossible to have an intimate conversation. The couple next to you will be involved with your conversation. No way around it.  The room is small so I do not see this changing anytime soon.  I would be hard pressed to say this was an intimate place since some of the tables are way to close together, but if you get a table by the fireplace, or away from the four two-seaters that are close to each other, I think this would qualify as a romantic evening.

There&#39;s another part of this restaurant that is equally nice.  I wouldn&#39;t say its a sports bar, but very casual and I&#39;m sure on a friday night,, being so close to DU, the atmosphere will get loud.  But the food was great.  I had the spare ribs and it was nothing less than perfect.  The burgers are good size portions and tasty.

It&#39;s our go-to place..until it get&#39;s to popular which I&#39;m afraid will happen sooner than later."

None of us had been before, and we all agreed that the service was impeccable.  We were greeted by a friendly host and seated right away.  The waiter, Roman, was amazing!  He was attentive without being overbearing and knowledgeable about the menu and wines/drinks.  Along with a great bottle of wine, one member of our party had a Moscow Mule.  Not usually my favorite drink, but holy Lord, it was awesome!!  Another person ordered the Vieux Carre, which is a Rye version of an old fashioned.  Again, the bartender sure knew what he was doing.
The Brussels Sprouts appetizer was delicious and came out quickly.  I and another person each had the cauliflower steak (vegetarian meal) and it was really good.  I can&#39;t eat quinoa so they made exceptions for that.  The accompanying veggies - asparagus and carrots - were perfectly seasoned and crisp tender.  Yum!  A couple of other people ordered the hanger steak which was the special for the night.  This got glowing reviews from those that tried it.  Another person ordered the burger.  It was gone so quickly, I&#39;m assuming that was delicious since none of us got a chance to try it.  :(
The desserts...oh, the desserts.  Roman brought out a couple of desserts for us to try and share.  We couldn&#39;t decide so we ordered another round of both.  One was a rhubard cobbler with pecan ice cream.  The other was a chocolate cup with ice cream and berries.
We will be back again, maybe try their tempting brunch?  I just cannot say enough about Roman.  If you get him as your waiter, you&#39;re in for a treat!  He&#39;s funny, charming, knowledgeable and generous.  We all had a blast!"

I have been 3 times and have been underwhelmed each time. First the good. I like the intimacy of the restaurant, the fact that it is close to my home and not a chain, the bar area is warm and comfortable and the fireplace adds charm. It has the potential to be a great neighborhood bistro... however the first two times we dined they were out of much of the food we tried to order. We ended up ordering things that we really weren&#39;t interested in eating. The third time, I ordered mussels that came with fries. The half order was very small and the fries arrived cold and soggy. I sent the fries back and they came back hot, burnt and soggy!?! Also, had to ask for bread for the garlic and wine sauce that the mussels were in - apparently they don&#39;t serve bread with the mussels. My partner ordered the cauliflower steak. It came out warm and very bland. The waitress assured us that this is the most popular dish they serve. Hmmm. Earlier in the evening we ordered drinks and the waitress recommended we order a local distilled vodka. We like local, however, the vodka was sweet with a hint of vanilla. The taste was unexpected and we had to send it back. The wait staff should know that when they recommend a product they should be able to share information about that product that could influence the diners.
I do recommend the salads, the onion soup, shaved brussels sprouts, and fruit compote. I&#39;m not sure that I will return but I sure do hope that their spring menu improves and that they figure out how to order so they don&#39;t run out of food early in the evening."

Overall, the food was very good as was the service, but had a really annoying experience that will prevent from going again.  After ordering, the server and manager returned a while later to tell us that they were out of three of the 4 entrees we ordered.  We did come in later and that happens.  The manager, however, apologized profusely and said he was going to take care of us and make things right.  Evidently, his view of taking care of us was to take our order after implying he&#39;d buy a drink, etc.  Bill came and nothing and the manager was nowhere to be found.

Had he not said anything, I wouldn&#39;t have thought anything of it, but after he opened his mouth, we had a different expectation.  Further, the entree menu is limited and I couldn&#39;t find anything (I think there were three red meat options, but I wanted something else not vegetarian and there was really nothing else).  Since we had appetizers I got a salad which was blah.  So I left hungry after paying $70 for two of us and not much food.

Not what I was expecting after the first visit and a huge disappointment."

Inside has a cool and masculine lodge-meets-bistro vibe. The cocktails are superb. I enjoyed a vieux carre to start the evening and was lucky enough to end the night with a taste Atticus&#39; own barrel-aged Manhattan, which the owner, Rob, was kind enough to let me sample, right after trying it for the first time, himself.

While the drinks were great, the food was the real star here. Not being a huge lamb fan, it was a leap of faith to order the Colorado Lamb after the waiter suggested it. Not only was it PERFECTLY cooked, it was so tender and flavorful! 

We also shared the Butcher&#39;s Choice, which I can only assume changes from night to night. This night, there were no complaints. It allowed us to try the pineapple-ginger marinated flank steak which was phenomenal. The lamb slider was incredibly flavorful topped with the best tzatziki sauce I&#39;ve ever had. Finally, the smoked rib was fall-off-the-bone tender. The roasted cauliflower that accompanied it was stellar as well.

I had the Salmon sandwich with a side of seasonal vegetables. The sandwich was absolutely amazing! The sauce was done just right, and it didn&#39;t make the bun soggy at all. The salmon was thick, juicy, and not dry at all, just the way I love it! The fresh vegetables was seasoned well, and was absolutely amazing!

I do really like their to go bags which are black re-usable grocery totes. The décor inside is nice, I like the wood throughout the restaurant, it has a nice fresh vibe.

I&#39;ve tried the chicken and the seasonal veggie entrees and really enjoyed both. The chicken is flavorful, and the vegetables are roasted/caramelized the way I like them. I love the veggies even without the romesco sauce served with them. I usually get the potato side--garlicky, smashed fingerling potatoes. I think they roast them, then flash fry them? Whatever they do, they are soft but crispy on the outside. Salads are good, not overdressed.

The pizza is just fine. With so many great pizzas in Denver, I doubt I&#39;d come here just for that. But if you bring a kid, the cheese pizza should please them.

I love the variety of beverages available. Cucumber mint lemonade is good, as is the hibiscus. The alcohol selection is nice, but with all those aguas frescas, you don&#39;t necessarily need booze. Oh, and did I mention they have Happy Leaf on tap?

My fiancé and I sat at the bar, which we fault ourselves for doing. We never really had an official server checking in on us, and felt stuck in &#34;limbo&#34;.

I can walk to Honor Society in under 5 minutes and if I show up at 11:00 am I can beat all the lines and get my food pretty quick.

I really enjoyed the Caesar Salad with grilled steak and cashew Caesar dressing ($14).  The portion of steak was generous and was cooked perfectly and still moist.  The dressing tasted like an authentic Caesar dressing and if they hadn&#39;t told me it was made with cashews I would have never known.  I have also enjoyed the Seasonal Salad with roasted vegetables ($12.75) and it was piled high with local roasted vegetables, heirloom tomatoes and watermelon radish with a refreshing vinaigrette. 

One of the only things preventing me from making this a weekly lunch location is the price point.  Everything is a little high for lunch at a fast casual place where I order at a counter.  Let&#39;s do some math:

Base Salad is $9.75, add roasted vegetables or chicken for $3.00, add steak or salmon for $4.25.  If you want a drink it&#39;s a minimum of $3.25 or as high as $8.25 for a smoothie.  That&#39;s a spendy lunch location.

I like Honor Society and will venture back from time to time however I would like to see the price point revisited."

I had the gluten free fried chicken, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted vegetables. Portions were perfect but the flavor left something to be desired. The crispness and cook of the fried chicken was perfect, but was wildly under seasoned. The spicy sauce served with the chicken was good but could use a tad more heat and sweet. The sweet potato purée was incredibly creamy but unfortunately bland. The vegetables were surprisingly perfectly roasted and seasoned. This place has all the components of being incredible if they just had an attitude about their food. They have the technique just not the flavor. I&#39;m undecided if I&#39;ll go back."

Pros:
* Fresh seasonal food
* Good sized portions

Cons
* I ordered fried chicken, but I received baked chicken
* My chicken and carrots definitely should have come out warmer (especially compared to my mashed sweet potatoes)
* Having seen all of the prepared food in line I would have expected it to come out more quickly

Conclusion: I won&#39;t ever come here by myself, but I may join a group of friends if they all wanted to go.

Honor society features a very simple menu. Their selling point to me are fresh ingredients and generous proportion. It&#39;s a shame to see they no longer keep up with their promises."

Standout element, though-- I ordered something thinking it was simply hummus and veggies (The Farmer), and a whole pizza with hummus and veggies came to me.  Now, I&#39;m GF-as-all-get-out, so that pie ain&#39;t workin&#39; for me, and even though it was entirely my overlook/mistake, homies straight carried it away and came back with just veggies and hummmus.

I promised to pay it forward, so a five star Yelp (while also wholly authentic) is the least I can do.

Final notes: they gots CapRock gin, the GF pizza is on point, and if you ever jus&#39; waitin&#39; for a hot date and wanna sip cocktails with mild kombucha (mild, mind you) while catchin&#39; up on skate videos, this yo&#39; jam.

I was convinced to give Honor Society another try after a manager reached out to me, and so I went in a few months later. If you&#39;re the kind of person that likes to read the last page of a book first, then I&#39;ll save you some time and say that I&#39;m bumping my review to 3 stars, however while I want to give HS 4 stars, it just didn&#39;t work out.

I went during lunch before rush hour on a weekday, around 11:30. When I first arrived, there wasn&#39;t a line which was nice, but the menu was in a corner at eye level and a sign that maybe should have been outside was in front of it, blocking about half the menu. There&#39;s no line, but the glass height between you and the food is confusing as it&#39;s slightly higher than a place like Chipotle but not high enough to make you think you&#39;re separated from the people working and making food. So I stand around for a bit waiting to be helped by the woman that&#39;s working ignoring me until I get her hint that she isn&#39;t the one helping me with my order. A simple &#34;hi welcome to HS, you order over there&#34; would have been nice but oh well.

I recall from looking at the menu that they do meals based on the protein you pick, so whether you get the chicken/salmon/etc, it&#39;s the same price whether you get the salad or the main dish (some sides extra and salads dont come with sides). I go up to the cashier who is friendly and says hi, and I ask for a drink suggestion. I end up getting the Mint Cucumber drink ($3) and the grilled chicken meal with sweet potatoes and vegetables ($12). The cashier smiles and says thanks but is pretty brief there being no line.

While waiting for my food I use the restroom and on my way pass by the kitchen and bar. Both have big tubs sitting out filed with different types of fresh food that employees are working with. This by far was my favorite part, as everything looks fresh and smelled fresh. There is no doubt in my mind that HS is probably as close to fresh as it gets in Denver. 

I get back and my food is ready. They give it to me in a tote bag. Huh? Idk if this is normal for them or what but I&#39;m sure they know it&#39;s not the norm so an explanation might have been nice. Anyway, most important part. Food is pretty good. Chicken is tasty and fresh, but not earth shattering. The sweet potatoes are the best I&#39;ve had in a long time and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll go back just for them in the future. Veggies are so-so, fresh but not really tasty. The mint cucumber drink is good, it&#39;s pretty sweet but still enjoyable. 

Short summary? Employees are somewhat friendly. Food is super fresh. Sweet potatoes are amazing. Rest of the food and drink I&#39;ve tried is good. But $15 for a lunch I&#39;m not totally impressed with when I can go to a half dozen other places within 3 blocks for less money and be just as happy if not happier is a hard sell for me."

I work in the building above honor society and love that we have something so delicious so close to our building.

I have come here for lunch a few times and have never been disappointed. Honor Society puts a different twist on the idea of fast casual. They have hot and cold plate options where you choose your protein and sides or you can order a salad, sandwich or flat bread. My favorites so far have been the grilled chicken sandwich and the beet salad with chicken - seeing a chicken theme? Hehe. The bread the sandwiches is served on is absolutely amazing - crusty on the outside and doughy on the inside. 

The staff is great - super friendly and efficient. They usually have someone wandering around to check to make sure your food tastes good and asking if you need anything. Your food comes up within 10mins of ordering which makes it perfect for a quick lunch.

I have to say, the food was pretty good and I would rate 4/5 for the food quality, taste, presentation, amount of food, cost, etc; however, I was very disappointed with my glass of wine.  Not only did I get a very small pour, the wine did not taste good at all and I wonder how many days it had been opened for... 1/5 on the wine.  Yuck.

I was contacted by one of the managers and offered a gift card to give them another try. I have so much respect for establishments that no only read their reviews but follow up on them. I&#39;ll start with the positive updates:

Breakfast burritos are now breakfast tacos, they have increased the amount of filling in them and lowered the price about $0.35. I have definitely stopped for the veggie taco several times now, I&#39;ll pay $3.65 for these and they&#39;ll even send you with some sriracha if you ask. A friend who works in my building has tried the chicken chorizo taco and isn&#39;t a huge fan, she said the chicken makes it weird but she loves the veggie tacos. Admittedly we stopped in much more often when they still sold their chai tea. They removed it from the menu due to popularity apparently. 

I have tried lunch once more, I don&#39;t recall each of the items but it was essentially vegetables with a side of vegetables and a side vegetable salad. I enjoyed all of it but the seasoning for the main dish and side was all very similar. Personally I think the menu needs a little grilled tofu or beans some sort of non meat protein option but thats more my preference. I still feel the prices are a little on the high side but I do like the food. I would eat there more often if they offered corporate discounts for the business near by or a slightly more affordable lunch menu. The staff has improved as well, less apathetic. I feel like this is more of a 3.5 star restaurant but I&#39;m going to round up on this one."

I went with a friend for lunch. I love the interior and that they have a nice patio. I thought the look and feel was very fresh and fun.
I got the fried chicken plate with two sides. I thought the price for the portions and the quality was totally fine. The new typical, so I don&#39;t know what people are complaining about in that regard.
The sides I got were the cauliflower/carrot/raisin and the butternut/pumpkin seed/cranberry. Both were super tasty.
My friend got the mushroom pizza which was also good.
My complaint is the booze. I love that they have it. I don&#39;t love that they charge dinner prices for a standard pour. My lunch was $24 dollars since my booze cost as much as my lunch. The two don&#39;t jive. At least have lunch pricing, or step down the wine quality. I can buy a whole bottle of wine at ModMarket for $8. Is it great? No. Is it a great value? Yes. Noodles and Co sells beer and wine as well, also within a reasonable price point to the food.
If you&#39;re going to do a fast casual restaurant, $11 glasses of wine don&#39;t really match up with that.

The crust is thin and crispy, nice yeasty flavor.  The sauce is tart and flavorful.  My wife had a salad (don&#39;t remember the name)...and it was no better than a homemade salad.  Green, tomatoes, radish, carrots, chicken...and the dressing (with mint) not so great either.  You go out and pay $12 for salad to get something you won&#39;t make at home.  This was not it.
Prices - they charge $8-10 for a glass of wine.  I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s absurd!!!  These are fine dining restaurant prices, not a casual eatery.  $3-4 is a fair price.
I may or may not come back...if I do, it&#39;s pizza all the way."

Within the past few weeks, their quality and consistency has dramatically decreased. Whatever turmoil is going on behind the scenes has impacted their business. We used to love this place, now they are out of beer, their pizza tastes different (and cooked poorly), and their staff don&#39;t seem to care. Whatever they were doing before worked well. We will try back in a month to see if anything has changed for the better. If so, I will update this review. Businesses make mistakes, management and ownership changes... I get it. It just cannot be evident to regular customers. The weak link(s) must be strengthened; otherwise customers will not return."

Food Quality: Far exceeds expectations for a quick food restaurant.
Food Taste: Incredible and Complex.
Drinks: 5 different kinds of lemonade? Heck yes.Vegan Iced Chai on tap? Heaven.
Time: Always way faster than I expect.

I work near this place and have come quite a few times with some colleagues since this place has opened. It has always been relatively hit or miss, but it&#39;s close and convenient so we still come back. We all popped in a couple days ago for lunch and were just blown away. Apparently the new summer menu had just launched and (literally) everything we ate was amazing. The new fried chicken sandwich is bonkers, chick-fila to the next, next level. The new sides were so tasty I almost got a second helping of the heirloom tomato and local melon salad. Everything seemed fresher, more delicious, seasonal and also (not to mention) was delivered faster than we have ever gotten food there. Not sure what has changed but we will be in there a lot more. I heard from the cashier there will be a new breakfast menu coming soon which is also very exciting. Whatever changed...keep it up! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious, fresh, fast and affordable food. Bravo."

Ordered a plate with grilled chicken, braised collared greens and sweet potatoes and just about died. From happiness, that is. 

Service is friendly and eager to help. Space is open and not too crowded (though I imagine this will change as more folks realize it exists). Prices are totally reasonable for a healthy urban eatery.

First off the cocktails are over the top. I&#39;d suggest sticking to their cocktail menu rather than sticking to your usual. You&#39;ll be impressed. Even the cocktails on draft are amazing. I can&#39;t recall the name, but there is a whiskey sour cocktail with ginger that just has an incredible spice to it. And their own spin on a margarita, served with black Hawaiian lava salt (I am now on a quest for this stuff - delicious) is over the top. The cocktails aren&#39;t huge, but are boozy. You are tasting mixology, not a mixer to cover up an inferior spirit.

The food menu is an interesting concept. 5 proteins. You pick whether you want them on a salad, as an entree with 2 sides, or as a sandwich with one side. The prices are really reasonable with the most expensive being $13ish, as I recall, for a flat-iron steak. But I picked the fried chicken sandwich with a Caesar salad side ($11.95). I&#39;m not talking about a breaded and fried patty. Instead, this is legit fried chicken breast that would hold its own against some of the best in the South, just in a sandwich instead of on the bone. I am guessing the entree serving comes bone-in (obviously that would be a problem in a sandwich, though!). The sandwich comes with pickles, arugula, and a delicious spicy sriracha aioli.

Though I&#39;m not really a smoothie person, the bartender gave me a sample of one of the smoothies they have on the menu and it was delicious. If they had these to go, it would make a great quick healthy breakfast/lunch option.

The interior is beautiful, modern but rustic. An open, visible kitchen so everyone can see what is happening. It&#39;s non-pretentious and the vibe is relaxed. But you can really tell that a lot of time went into designing this place. 

I ate at the bar, as I usually do when on business travel by myself. The service was great, no complaints! It&#39;s amazing that a place can have it together this much considering I went on their second official night open. I look forward to revisiting on my next trip to Denver. Not sure if I can be adventurous and stray away from that fried chicken sandwich, though...it was really that good. Maybe I&#39;ll branch out and try one of the other sides at least!"

It was the first week they were open so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get the swing of things.

What I&#39;m confused about is why you have breakfast on your menu available until 10:30am, but you don&#39;t open until 10:30am? We just walked over to try the breakfast burrito to find you were closed (yelp says you&#39;re open, by the way).

Chicken had been sitting so long that it had glazed over look and was tasteless.  Butternut squash had a great taste except the squash was as hard as a rock.  Only redeeming dish was the short rib and that was too fatty.

Just a regular black tea, on ice. About 10-12 ounces. And when I went up to ask for a refill, I was told that they don&#39;t do refills for iced tea. And the employee and manager could not have been more dismissive to me about this &#34;policy&#34;.  And the other employee who asked me how I was enjoying my meal could also not have been more clueless about the situation either.

She finally asked &#34;do you know what you want&#34;, I did ask for a recommendation she said the chicken chorizo flat bread(12.00). I ordered that with no cilantro and a glass of prosecco (8.00). She pored about an ounce of wine in a glass from a tap and stuck her face in the glass to smell it, set that glass down grabbed another and did the same from another tap, picked up the first glass pored about 3 more ounces and handed it to me. I reluctantly looked at the glass and she asked &#34;problems?&#34; There was nothing seeming wrong so I had a few sips. The pizza came out in a huge box 
I opened it and of course there was cilantro. Knowing it wasn&#39;t a big deal  I left. Got to my office and my co-worker and I shared it, both of us did notice there does not seem to have any chicken but other than that it was great!

We were one of three tables at 5pm, was not handed menus, luckily I found menus on the counter. The menus were dirty. Then once the waitress finally took our order she had no clue about any of the wines. We then were waiting for drinks, choose the appetizers we wanted and... waited... some... more. So after catching up on everyone&#39;s weekend, we left, sans wine, and had not had a chance to place our order.

I had the steak sandwich and Watermelon/arugula/mint/feta side. The only thing noteworthy was the price. The salad was light, fresh and tasty but the sandwich was as bland as can be, small, and the meat was way undercooked (literally seared but raw inside). I had only water and the price was $15.50. If you like overpaying for meh food then give it a shot. Pot Bellys is right next door and offers a way better value and awesome sandwiches (although not much selection of sides). I can get out of there with a small side and sandwich for $7.50."

My husband and I started coming in earlier this year, moved into the area st the end of last. As it is a little Irish pub we tried the burgers first. Let me say, they are amazing. My husbands favorite is the Black and Blue, all of my family has rave about this blue cheese burger, we&#39;ve brought both sets of my parents in for a bite to eat. I always love their BBQ burger. The French dip is great, honorable mentions go to the buffalo chicken wrap and Shepards pie. The only things we&#39;ve felt weren&#39;t great were the Monte Crisco, blackened chicken the seasoning is too salty and the shrimp po-boy had a little too much bread. The fries however are addicting. 

Moving on to the beer selection, please please go check them out for happy hour. They have an amazing selection of micro brews on tap all the time with a nice rotation twice a week. For $6 you get an amazing beer, if you like the watered down crap, those are $3 on tap as well. Sports are playing on the tvs, the juke box is playing a mix of rock and they even sometimes have live music. A true neighborhood jem!"

 The place is not all bad.  If you want a beer, I would recommend this place.  They have craft beers and many are locally made.  The bartender (with lovely purple hair) was friendly, attentive, and down right awesome.  

The food on the other hand is dreadful.  The hot wings were cooked, but not hot.  I get the feeling they were parboiled then fried, unfortunately they were not hot.  The out side was warm, the inside was cool...not fantastic.  The buffalo wing sauce lacked flavor and was very thin.  The Ranch Burger was not good.  The toppings were good, but the meat was completely flavorless.  Seriously, salt and/or pepper would have improved the burger greatly, but I don&#39;t think this dawned either one of the cooks.  Also the medium burger was medium rare to rare.  It really sucked.

To sum it up, come for the beer.  If you are hungry, there are four other restaurants in the shopping center, including a wing place."

And it will be our last time even if they have free food and beer!
Horrible customer service- sign says seat yourself, so we do. 10 minutes later waitress asks if we want menus, yes please and she leaves! No hellos, want drinks, today&#39;s specials, just walks away!
Not very busy and she just keeps looking at us from afar, universal signal we&#39;re ready to order because our menus are down!
Finally ordered 2 waters and a beer. More waiting....then drinks came then more waiting... ordered Ruben with soup, chef salad and Patti melt. Nothing complicated. Took forever! She brought out hubbys Ruben and bros salad and said my melt would be about 5 more minutes! Ugh I order another beer then. Ruben and soup were cold. Melt Sat for so long bread was mushy. We decided to eat what we can and go. Still hasn&#39;t brought my beer so I flag her down. Asked to cancel the beer since we were done eating and she said it was ready. No I don&#39;t want it. But it&#39;s ready is all she says. AS I WATCH HER GO TELL THE BARTENDER FOR MY BEER WHICH WASN&#39;T EVEN POURED YET AND SHE BRINGS IT OVER SAYING THE BARTENDER WAS BUSY WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS! What a liar! BARTENDER was playing on an ipad! So I said once again that I don&#39;t want it but would love the check! She leaves the beer and gets the tab and yes the beer I tried to cancel twice is on there!
This whole dining experience took 1 hour and 10 minutes! I ordered my 2nd beer BEFORE my food came out!
Needless to say the $6 beer came out of her tip! We will never go back. If I want this experience again I&#39;ll stay home, make a grilled cheese sandwich and talk to a cardboard box!"

All in all, there are a lot of tasty beverages from which to choose.  I did not have any food on this visit, but I sure enjoyed the fermented offerings.

I really, really, enjoyed the Ace Perry Cider.  It was crisp, delicious, cold, and was like getting hit in the mouth (in a good way) with a bag of Granny Smith&#39;s.  I will definitely be drinking this again.  I tried a taste of the Golden Monkey from Victory Brewing.  It was a very nice Belgian-style ale with some nice herbal notes.  I rather enjoyed it.

They have a pretty solid menu of things to choose from.  My favorite being the fish and chips.  Their beer offerings change quite a bit as well.  Not being a beer drinker I can&#39;t speak much about that.  They have Trivia on Saturday nights and the place gets packed QUICK!

Happy Hour from 3-6 which consists of $3 for draught on tap beers and  1/2 priced Appetizers.  A few other drink specials on wine and well also.  They also have a 5.99 lunch special.

Overall experience: not bad.

I felt quite at ease as i walked into this quaint little tap house. the walls are painted in dark hues, creating an old English pub feel. I like the large chalk board full of beers on tap and in cans. No bottles are served here, which i thought was interesting. The beer, was good. nothing outstanding and stellar, but completely hit the stop. [ i mean what concludes a day of shopping better than beer?] the service was also interesting. i&#39;m not sure if our waitress was tired, hungover/still drunk or just plain stupid but she was slow, rarely checked back with our table and wasn&#39;t in the mood for conversation. hmmm.

However, despite the service, this pub is pretty cool. lots of beers. good food &amp; a great place to gather with friends :)"

Like my wife says, I&#39;m thinking they&#39;d be much better for a beer and appetizer rather than an actual meal.

First off, there were only 2 other tables with people on them and a couple people working, so you&#39;d think the service would be right on top of things. Nope. We sat for a few minutes before they bothered to come and take our orders, and there were several times while we were in there that our drinks were empty, which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. After we were done eating I also had to go interrupt the server (she was in the middle o texting for about 15 minutes) and ask for our check, since we had to get to our movie.

The food itself was decent. We got the fried pickles, which were awesome. I got a burger, which was just okay. It didn&#39;t really have any flavor, which was odd since it had BBQ sauce and bacon on it. The wife got the turkey wrap and she said it was flavorless, too. The french fries were good, tho.

Overall, I&#39;d come back for a brew and an app, but that&#39;s probably it."

This brewery restaurant is unassuming and casual in it&#39;s location and decor, inviting and not very crowded from my experience and other reviews I see.  They have a handful of TVs, several high tops, low tops and booths.

The menu isn&#39;t loaded, however what they do offer is better than average eats.  I had the Rueben and despite having pickles on it (huh?) it was hot and good with just the right amount of kraut.  My friend had the fish and chips and they were very good - great batter and hot moist fish inside.

The beer was not very good.  I had their Hefeweizen and the Railyard ale and had to choke them down.  Not good at all - they need some professional consulation on their methods or their recipes.  The service was even worse than the beer.  Despite not ever getting a napkin or utencils with my meal, the waitress didn&#39;t even acknowledge me or take my drink or food order when she came by to check on the table (I came a little late).  Okay maybe that was a simple oversight but it didn&#39;t stop there.  I never got my water and she was unattentive in general to the whole table.

If it hadn&#39;t been for good company it would have been a two star rating.  I can&#39;t say I really recommend this place."

Staff
The staff reminds me a of mix between Empire Records and Cheers...

The ambience is laid back, the barmaids are super cute and very friendly and the french fries rock!. It&#39;s a great place for an afternoon away from a busy bar. The beer selection is good but expensive.

Food
They made some tasty burgers but not alot of variety
I mostly come here though for the mussels and fries! It&#39;s an awesome dish- it&#39;s served in a butter/lemon/shallot/wine broth with a heavty portion of their stringy crunchy fries, a garlic aoeli dip and a loaf of fresh french bread for dipping in the buttery broth after you&#39;re done sucking the mussles out of thier shells.

Happy Hour
it&#39;s happy and irish- usually less crowded
Not a place to get the pickup, definately a close knit, neighborhood type bar.

Cons:
They close earlier than all other bars every night- so boo to that
The music is usually too low- sometimes it takes the staff to have a shot or two and it to be dead to get them moving in here."

After the first time, I said I wouldn&#39;t be back.  The beer wasn&#39;t fantastic and the bartender was horrible.  But... since this is the closest bar to my house, i&#39;ve given it a few more chances.  I think I want to like it more than it deserves, because I generally dislike all those pretentious Denver pseudo pubs and wanna be &#34;dive&#34; bars who still charge $6 a pint or $9 a cocktail and those &#34;craft&#34; bartenders who can&#39;t seem to figure out the difference between a Gibson and a Martini (tho most won&#39;t be bothered to serve a simple drink like a plain ol&#39; Martini or can&#39;t cuz only Appletini&#39;s are on their drink menu).  Annnyyyywwwayyyy.... I want to like this place as a good ol fashioned blue collar bar.  It definitely has a local vibe and if you&#39;re not a regular, a few stink eyes might get thrown your way, especially at happy hour. 

I&#39;ve sat at the bar and at tables.  One of the best times I had there was on a Saturday night quiz night with my father and girlfriend.  We were greeted with friendly competition and never got booed while we were winning the quiz.  So, the local feel got somewhat friendlier.  

My girlfriend and I recently had an early dinner here.  They seemed busy at the bar with happy hour and the bartender was the only staff working.  She was SO MUCH friendlier than the previous bartender/waitress (the one with the nose ring).  She knew the LOCAL beers, all where from Colorado, so I&#39;m not sure where the idea they don&#39;t serve local brews came from.  I had the Philly and GF had a huge side salad and chicken strips.  The Philly was better than the one I got at Pat&#39;s in Philly and the chicken strips were battered like fish and delicious.  I got a great Milk Stout to top off the dinner.  The whole meal was reasonably priced.  

I give it three stars instead of more for a couple of reasons.  I&#39;ve been patronizing the place for the better part of a year and feel a bit cold every single time I walk in.  The other reason is that generally the service is mediocre at best.  This last time was the best by far, but when we walked in 10 till 5pm, the bartender was the only staff.  It wasn&#39;t her fault it took a bit to get to us, but why hasn&#39;t the owner figured this out?

Anyway, pretty decent place. Not a dive bar or brewery, but a good little local bar selling ok food and good Colorado beers."

My husband has always wanted to try this restaurant as it&#39;s right down the road from our house and has a nice variety of beers on tap. The variety of beer is probably the only thing they&#39;ve got going for them. Everything else was pretty bad. 

Our appetizer was overcooked and dry. The waitress was nasty and more interested in socializing with the cook than us and I couldn&#39;t even finish my meal. In fact it seemed most of the staff acted as if our party and the other two couples in the restaurant were a nuisance that were interrupting their personal break time.  I can&#39;t even remember the last time I&#39;ve been so unhappy with a meal. 

I left feeling like we would&#39;ve had a better experience at the Sonic that&#39;s in the same parking lot. Sorry Royal Hilltop but I won&#39;t be back !!"

When we walked in, we weren&#39;t sure if we had stepped into a Pub or simply a dive.  There wasn&#39;t much décor, just plasma TV&#39;s with basketball games on and the standard neon bar signs. We were told that they had just switched from British Ales to Local Brews, so any English charm that we were looking for was no longer there.  The staff seemed relatively friendly but were more concerned with socializing with patrons that are regulars. 

Our waitress, we found really needs to find a new line of work. They weren&#39;t in any kind of uniform or T-shirt promoting the place. They had on a plain t-shirt that was a few sizes to small and frumpy pants. She shuffled across the floor, not seeming to care about anything except the friends that were there.  Because she was more concerned with socializing, it took awhile to get our order placed, any refills and our final bill. 

The food was ok but nothing really that is worth gushing about. I ordered the Monk and Cheese. It&#39;s Penne pasta served with a three cheese sauce and I asked for chicken. I found the cheese sauce to be bland and the chicken was just grilled with a small amount of spices. I have to admit, a box of Mac and Cheese would be better than what I had and a lot cheaper.  I wish I could say something more on the dish but there isn&#39;t really anything else to say.  Simon had ordered the Fish and Chips. It&#39;s Alaskan cod that is fried in a beer batter and served with slaw, tartar sauce and fries. The Fries were cooked well but over salted and the fish was ok. 

We feel that the dishes are over priced for the quantity and quality of food. They do have a children&#39;s menu and they offer a number of beers. Will we be back? I don&#39;t know. Maybe we went on a bad night.  Have you been there and had a different experience?"

There was a good crowd for 4 pm in the afternoon  and the atmosphere was friendly.  My hubby had Dry Dock Apricot Blonde and I had a Diet Coke. Incredibly dissatisfied when our waitress brought our drinks. The Blonde was flat and poured horribly. My soda was flat as well. Our waitress was not personable and seemed bored with her job. She literally put her elbows on our table while standing; this was after waiting almost 10 minutes for her to take our food order. We ordered wings, french dip sandwich and a Monte Carlo.  Wings were excellent; both sandwiches were good. A tad greasy for my taste.  The waitress was more interested in hugging and talking to the people behind the bar than serving the people seated in her area. She left dirty plates on our table, didn&#39;t check to see if we needed anything else and we had to flag her to tab us out. She didn&#39;t inform us that happy hour was going on or engage us in any conversation.  It seems like a good neighborhood bar but the waitstaff was horrible.

Beer selection is fine.  Love the gravy and fries.  If you want mussels then go to Le Central, these are smaller in quantity and lame tasting in comparison, not quite their forte.

Dutch lunch was very adequate and enjoyable.  Tried their wings once but they are somewhat forgettable.  Their soups tend to be on the saltier side.  Happy with their salads.  Fish and Chips is not my first choice but they are OK.

Wife tried their Monte Cristo but it was an uneatable grease sponge and they wouldn&#39;t make good on a replacement.  That was a last visit.

Can recommend the Reuben, Fish Po Boy and BLT.

Their remodel from a couple years ago aborted from the pub experience, some of the weaknesses remain in some of their staff and menu items so we rarely go there now."

The few times I&#39;ve been in late-night or beyond dinner have been somewhat slow, while the dinner-time hours can have a decent crowd. Because it&#39;s a neighborhood establishment, I&#39;ll certainly go again (as I&#39;ve done many times before)."

I had the fish n chips, which were good but greasy.  Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t mind too terribly much that the fish was greasy, but it seemed to be more greasy than what I had imagined.  I suggest this place and recommend it highly.  They have a decent amount of English brews and a load of single malt scotches.  Its a nice place to sit quietly and enjoy your brew.

I think every true beer drinker searches for this ideal place...I am still searching. When we moved back to the Aurora area we were pleased that we might have found a new place to call home. WRONG! The Royal Hilltop smells like a dirty foot and the food tastes about the same. Although the smell of a dirty foot almost always accompanies tiny little bars..usually the food and the service is what draws the crowd in. I&#39;ve never seen a staff move so slow. Hey...this isn&#39;t Montana...we are in the city. You can always count on spending more than $30 bucks for a &#34;quick&#34; beer. Yes, the Hilltop has a great selection of Premium beers...but their happy hour sucks..only $1.00 off.

They&#39;ve expanded their beer selection since the last time I was in, so I had a nice porter while waiting for my meal.  The fish was 3 pieces of excellent cod (not salmon as another reviewer mentioned), and the fries were shoestring and hot and crispy.  Unfortunately, I had ordered tartar sauce, but was informed they no longer serve tartar sauce, only garlic aioli.  What?  No tartar sauce with fried fish, in a bar in the USA?  Somebody in the kitchen thinks they&#39;re a gourmet.  Hopefully they&#39;ll get over it.  Service was acceptable, and the food was excellent, but -1 for the garlic aioli.  I&#39;ll go back, but if I want fish, I&#39;ll bring my own tartar sauce.
Update: They were simply out of tartar sauce that night; my waitress made it sound like it was a culinary choice.  Still good fish &amp; chips!  And malt vinegar is still available for those with a more British taste."

Friendly service and solid pho.  We tried the seafood pho and the combination.  They even brought out a free side of grilled pork.

I had the vegetarian pho and the broth was just okay. Nothing special. Husband had the rare steak pho and was fine with it, though he&#39;ll eat most anything that&#39;s comprised of noodles and broth.

The egg rolls take it down to 3 stars, though. The entire thing tasted and looked pre-frozen. Not at all your standard Vietnamese egg roll. No ridiculously crunchy exterior deep friend to smithereens - just an average egg roll. Boo."

First time, it took nearly an hour and a half and they forgot the drink. Driver was extremely rude, basically shoved the food into my hands and ran off to his car before I could ask where the drink was. Not a good look when your tip has been prepaid at 25%. Food was meh, nothing memorable.

Second time, I waited over 2 hours before finally calling and having the order cancelled and refunded. First time I called, the lady assured me it was on the way. Second time she actually asked for my order number, making me think that such long delivery times are the standard for them and they just automatically respond &#34;it&#39;s on the way&#34; if you call for an update. For what it&#39;s worth, they did refund the money and I got a text this morning offering free food, but to be honest, I don&#39;t think this place is worth it. Not even for free.

2 stars for the effort to make it right, at least."

I wasn&#39;t really in the mood for pho, so I opted for a rice plate (grilled chicken and eggroll).  It was OK.  The eggroll was greasy.  The grilled chicken was just a tad greasy, but had good flavor.  Overall, it was a generous portion of meat and rice, and with the 20% Grand Opening discount they were giving, it was incredibly inexpensive.

The exterior of the restaurant and the small strip mall it&#39;s located in really need a serious facelift and parking is awkward, but the interior of the restaurant is clean and pleasant and the staff were friendly and accommodating."

I thought this place would not know how to do seafood simply because it&#39;s in Denver (I can hit a nine iron from my house and it would land in SF Bay). What can I say I&#39;m a coastal snob. 

I went all protein tonight. Starting with the calamari because it came free with hotel voucher. Nice combo sweet savory sauces. Then we ordered six &#34;nawlins&#34; style oysters (cooked on grill with butter and cheese) and six raw.  My dining partner ordered some straight alcohol drink. I ordered homemade ginger beer and Seagrams.

 Our high energy, sweet but not syrupy over the top waitress Abby suggested we get a specific oyster that had a clean finish with a hint of cucumber. 

After we downed those bad boys, not the best but purdy darn good, my dining partner waved me in close to tell me a secret. As I leaned in over the table he asked me if I tasted the cucumber. I said a little very subtle. He said &#34;well Abby knew I liked cucumber because that&#39;s the finishing flavor in my drink. It accompanies these oysters perfectly. This girl knows her stuff!&#34;

Wow now that is amazing!!! After that she recommended the special boil as main course. I wasn&#39;t one to second guess her after that knowledge so that&#39;s what I ordered. 

Bit over boiled to my taste lots of shrimp a few crawdads (crawfish for you northerners) big hunk of snow crab which I hooked up with dropping some old bay into my buttah to hook it up. Snow crab is very clean but mild not like blue crab)
The andouille sausage was ok more like polish sausage but it complimented everything else. 
Washed it all down with an Anchor Steam. Amazing.

Abby indulged us in sampling their own home made brewskies. Not a fan! But I&#39;m sure hard core folks would like em. I&#39;m a lager dude who goes straight from Stella to Guinness. None of those reds ambers, wheats for me.
Then we got the peaches and cream pound cake. To share. 
That Abby... she presented two perfectly proportional pieces, perfect for sharing. Impossible to distinguish which was bigger.  Truly amazing!

Staff backing Abby up were on point with water clearing plates etc. 

So while the food was about a 3.5 the service was a 5 or more. Why would I come back to a place where the food is slightly above average for the price?  Because when the meal is an exploratory event with exemplar staffing, decor is awesome, and in the kitchen you can feel a bit of flare for experimentation leaning to the naughty side (Kind of like New Orleans without the grit and grime) and it&#39;s in Denver... come on man... 
This may be as close to a great seafood meal as you land locked knuckleheads will get without getting on a plane. 
Ah yeah -spoken like a guy that can hit a nine iron and be in SF bay.  So if I am coming back... what&#39;s your excuse for not?"

For apps, we got the Fish Cake Sliders, Garlic Fries, Raw Oysters, Pork Belly Beignets, Calamari, and Fruit de Mer.. I recommend the Calamari and the Garlic Fries. I loved the Pork Belly Beignets because 1. I love pork belly and 2. I love beignets, but the plate itself was pretty small. 

For drinks, I had the Jax Strawberry Lemonade, Cucumber Lemon Press, and Paloma. I&#39;d definitely go with the Strawberry Lemonade.

I would&#39;ve wrote this review sooner because I thought we were coming back, but we didn&#39;t have time :( Overall still a great experience. I&#39;m sure I would&#39;ve loved having a meal here!"

I love oysters and today they had oysters for 75 cents each (until they ran out). Came in around 4:15pm with my Mom and were immediately greeted and seated. Marie was our server and she was very pleasant, professional and efficient.

Started off ordering a dozen oysters, calamari and Brussels Sprouts, and a Howdy Beer from the Happy Hour Menu. All were very delicious. My brother-in-law came in later and we ordered two dozen oysters, another Brussels Sprouts and the peel and eat shrimp and the fruit de mer (yum, yum, yummers!!) :-)

He ordered the Cucumber Lemon Press (cucumber infused vodka, housemade lemonade, soda). I definitely had to try it and it was very tasty and went down smooth.

By the time we got ready to go it was pretty full and had a great vibrant feel. They have free valet and also there is free 2 hour parking and free parking in the garage."

Before I even get to the food and drink, as soon as I set foot in the restaurant, I was brushed aside by the hostess which put a sour taste in my mouth.  I came in, and was not addressed, but immediately after me, a big crowd of people came in, and the hostess began seating them.  I got her attention and said, &#34;Excuse me I have a reservation...&#34;  since I had entered a good 2 minutes before them, but she laughed, literally brushed me aside as you would a small child, and said, &#34;Well... let me let these people inside.&#34;  (It was also 65 degrees and they were standing in the foyer... not outside in bad weather).  I immediately felt like I was bothering her, and since the place was packed, debated going elsewhere.

I did get seated however, and the place was hopping, and super loud.  It is clearly a very busy place for Happy Hour, but I&#39;m not totally sure why.  The food was ok, but overpriced and not super filling.  Being from Maine, I didn&#39;t expect to be blown away, but it was meh.  The spicy tuna things  were good, but super small (and only two for $8????) and the mussels were good.  The drinks were mediocre, and one of the members of our party almost sent hers back (something spicy with ginger beer) but was too embarrassed to make a big deal.  I had the sangria, which was raved about by my co-workers, but I thought tasted like white wine and sprite.  An ok drink, but I guess I was expecting more.  Honestly, I wasn&#39;t paying, so it was an ok experience, but truthfully we ended up eating again a couple hours later.

I might go back to give Jax another chance and maybe try the oysters that they are known for, but frankly, I think there are better places in the area especially if you want more bang for your buck!!I"

Well, they (I say they because there are a few locations) are hands down THE best seafood restaurant in Colorado. And not just because Landry&#39;s owns all of the others and they are now cheesy chains.

I digress. Jax has stunning decor, classy service, and trendy couture seafood that is fresh, fresh, fresh and num, num, num. Jax has made me like and trust raw oysters again and that was no easy task!

I have probably dined at Jax a dozen times. I tell everyone to go there. I take my friends and family there. I&#39;ve never been disappointed. I&#39;m so sorry I didn&#39;t review them on here. Or did I? Maybe one of the other locations? Yes! Eureka!

It&#39;s a brightly lit restaurant not overcrowded by brunchers on a Sunday, so I could not understand why our waitress was surly. Even the bus boy was in a happier mood and was the one who serviced us more.

Not a whole lot to choose from the Brunch menu (would be nice if other lunch items were offered), we decided on the lobster roll (overcooked lobster meat and you call yourself a fish house?!?) with fantastic house made chips; the burger (had fried oyster in the patty? but instead of being flavorful, it was a bit bitter...) with mediocre fries; and the crispy brussel sprouts seasoned with fish sauce (good flavor)."

We rolled in around 7 PM and the place was pretty packed, but we still got a table for three smack dab in the middle of the dining room :) No happy hour, but that didn&#39;t stop us. We started with a round of hard strawberry lemonades and some calamari and oysters on the half shell. I loved the strawberry lemonade because it was sweet with just the right amount of sour; my mom was expecting more strawberry flavor but I thought it was awesome. Calamari was yummy, not a lot of tentacles though which are fun to eat; two sauces were on the plate so don&#39;t miss that if you want to dip! Oysters on the half shell were AWESOME. We ordered six from the West Coast (I&#39;m blanking on the name) and they were delicious with a squeeze of lemon; very fresh, firm, and tasted of the sea.

For the main course I ordered the mussels with pasta, mom had the lobster roll, and dad had a bowl of gumbo and the scallops. The mussels were legit because 1. There were a ton of them, and 2. The broth was delicious! The tomato, oniony deliciousness permeated the mussels and pasta so every bite was perfect. I mean you could even drink the broth! (totally did this using my spoon ;D) My mom liked the lobster roll but was a bit sad the lobster was cold. The side of potato chips were excellent and perfectly salted. Dad&#39;s gumbo was great and chock full of andouille sausage, and he enjoyed the scallops which were cooked perfectly.

Service was a bit stop and go; we were seated immediately but then couldn&#39;t find our waiter once we had decided what we wanted to eat. He was much more attentive after we put in our order and the food started to come out, but the beginning was a bit rough.

P.S. Restrooms are nice; they have cloth towels for drying your hands."

Of course, I was in. I have never had brunch there before, so I was excited to try new dishes.  To get the party started, we ordered some mimosas.  They offer several flavors to pick from. I wanted seafood since it is a fish house, but they really don&#39;t have much on the brunch menu that has seafood in it.  I settled on a few things to cover all bases. Oysters to start off the brunch were fantastic. Then got the chicken and crawfish gumbo. This dish was phenomenal! I wanted more.  Then to wrap it up, I got biscuits and gravy topped with sunny side up eggs.  What a great overall brunch. The service was great and perfect atmosphere. Great job Jax!"

Strong delicious drinks. 

Oysters are fresh and delicious. Many varieties to choose from. Emersum&#39;s are the happy hour specials for $1.50 each. They have a special orange champagne sauce for the oysters that is amazing, ask for extra. 

Fruit de Mer is not recommend, small, rubbery, and acidic. 

Calamari is the best I&#39;ve ever had. The best.  

Peel and eat shrimp is basic. 

Wedge salad is also basic.

Oysters are good, but over-priced at around $3-$3.50 a swallow if it&#39;s not HH. Servers and bartenders are all really nice and efficient. 

The food . . . was OK. Hence the 3 stars. Kale salad was good, but seriously over-dressed. Note to self: Self, always ask for the dressing on the side:). Then had the sea bass and the scallops. Both were decent but nothing special. Three medium-sized scallops with some lentils (which were good) and some sauce were not worth $32. The heavily seasoned India-Indian spicing of the vegetables accompanying the sea bass overwhelmed the plain-roasted fish. Key-lime pie was good but nothing special.

Prolly won&#39;t go back as a regular, but it was a hoppin&#39; bar scene . . . so maybe I&#39;ll make an exception when I&#39;m in the mood for a party and don&#39;t care about spending a bit too much for some seafood.

The happy hour menu has a lot of very interesting options, and I&#39;ll have to try more of them the next time I am in town. I ordered the happy hour sampler, which consisted of oysters, peel &amp; eat shrimp, and snow crab legs. The oyster were delicious, so I ordered half a dozen more. The crab legs were not so great. I&#39;ve definitely had fresher crab legs that I bought at Costco. The shrimp were also underwhelming - hard to peel, a bit tough, with - mealy consistency. Not the fresh, snappy consistency that I look for.

I also ordered a wedge salad, which was fairly good. 

For my main course, I had the lobster roll. This isn&#39;t a New England lobster roll by any means, but it was still pretty good. The lobster pieces were substantial and tasted pretty fresh. The flesh could have been sweeter, but not bad. My main complaint is the roll. It&#39;s fine and all, but it is toasted which makes it a bit too crispy. 

For dessert, I had the key lime pie. The presentation is very frou frou, but the pie itself wasn&#39;t spectacular. Not bad, but not memorable either.

Overall, Jax is a fun place to grab some seafood and drinks. Nice atmosphere and all that. And the oysters are great. Just don&#39;t expect the rest of the food to knock your socks off."

We started with the Chesapeake oysters for appetizers and they were delicious, fresh and served with horseradish, tomato sauce, and butter. 

There are two TVs for enjoying your favorite sports teams, nice decor with ocean/fish themes, and a huge bar that takes up most of the real estate. It looks like the tables are mostly set aside for reservations, which they offer through Open Table. 

The menu looked a bit limited in terms of fish selection, maybe due to the fact that we are in Colorado? And it was very pricey! $25 for a small portion swordfish. 

I did love that the women and the men servers had the same uniforms, and the women were not forced to wear short skirts and skimpy tops. :) 

It took about 30 minutes to receive our entrées, but tasted great.

For my entree, I enjoyed the Thai catfish--lightly breaded and served with some seriously kick-ass curried squash puree, lovely greens and two slices of (frankly) under-roasted delicata squash.  My husband had the seared wahoo.  He liked it.  It was served medium--so a lightly cooked middle.  I had a taste of the miso-beet puree served with it.  Really, really delicious.

It is up scale and busy, but the music is very loud.. My lady has food allergies which can be difficult to work around when the menus is based on pre-set apportionment (meaning each meal planned is pre-set quantiles)... the menu had an enticing attraction and we ordered meals.... For instance it wasn&#39;t clear that the tuna steak wasn&#39;t a steak but rather small sushi chunks that were not hot as we would have expected for a dinner portion... they should have offered this dinner on a sauce plate as an appetizer.. Although they did substitute veggies for the pasta, it seemed like a lot of trouble for them to accommodate the allergies or anything out of the set menu.  

The meal was 4 star price and we knew if we stayed, we would have been miserable for the evening.... for the first time in my 30 years of eating out, I walked out without eating my meal...

I heart you...

I have been to the one in Downtown.. and since Hubs does not fancy to drive to Downtown and park there, to this location we went.  This recent visit was on SUNDAY December 28th 2014.  It was for my VERY BELATED BIRTHDAY Celebration with Hubs since the month of December was so busy for us to get out for Brunch or something.

FINALLY!!!

Time was about 11:35hrs ish.  We are seated promptly in one of the &#34;extended&#34; room.  From the Brunch Menu we opt to order the following items :

*  Fried Calamari ($9.00)
*  Steamed Mussels ($12.00)
*  Maine Lobster Roll ($22.00)
*  Burger with Blue Cheese ($10.00)

I like both the Fried Calamari and the Maine Lobster Roll.  Those Fried Calamari are one of the Best I have had in which I wish I could have more!  The Maine Lobster Roll portion is generous though I cannot deny the pricing could be steep for some.

I am surprised that Hubs like the Steamed Mussels especially the BROTH and the Mussels!  He is NOT into seafood, mind you.  We requested if our order of Steamed Mussels to be cooked without the wine or the Bacon, in which our lovely server obliged to our request!  SCORE!

Hubs like his order of Burger.  Though it was just a BURGER, it was cooked to Hubs specification.  All in all it was a successful VERY BELATED BIRTHDAY Brunch we had at Jax Fish House, Glendale Location.

Maybe we are situated in that &#34;extended&#34; room, that morning, while in the midst of Brunch, a BIG Group had their Party, and that &#34;room&#34; can get &#34;loud&#34; so maybe next time, I would opt to be seated some where else.

While having our Brunch at this location, a LIVE JAZZ BAND, is performing and indeed it was a BALL to listen to those tunes!  Ample of parking outside, but there is also a FREE UNDEGROUND Parking available too.  That morning our lovely server, her name is Julia.  Left this establishment about 12:55hrs ish.

SUNDAY Brunch is from 10am to 2pm.

LUNCH Hours are from 11:30am to 2pm every Mondays to Fridays.

It happens to be crafted locally AND it is a lager, which is a rare treat for &#39;micro&#39; local brews - Custom made for the restaurant by none other than supa-master brewer Bryan Selders (one of the founders of Dogfish Head Brewery), who now calls Colorado his home and Post Brewing in Lafayette, his flagship.  Nothing can equate the absolute crispness of this beer, paired with a dozen freshly-flown oysters (for $1.25 each during HH!), on a hot summer day.  

Why Glendale?!?  Because they have an awesome rooftop, baby...and zero parking hazard. Grab your Post Howdy Pilsner and oysters fix during happy hour...stay for the sunset...it&#39;s weirdly superb."

Great service, as before, and they even brought out a sling for us for our baby carrier.  The menu for brunch was good, though I wish they had more food-allergy sensitive options.  My burger was great, and my husband loved his shrimp and grits.  I think my father-in-law was the only one who had a so-so meal.  He ordered the omelet and side of potato casserole.  Both we bland to him.  Prices are high-ish, as expected at Jax.  All in all, great brunch spot for anyone with a baby."

With a Colorado twist, I guess.  Give people a chance and tell them this is not Louisiana food but Colorado food.
If you&#39;re expecting Cafe du Monde beignets, you&#39;ll be rudely disappointed.  Even if this weren&#39;t supposed to be a NOLA beignet, it&#39;s excessively bacony, excessively salty, greasy, nothing beignet about it but the powdered sugar.  
Biscuits and gravy, no flavor at all.  Nothing.  And dry.  Totally bland.  Like eating paper."

I travel to Denver often and Jax, either downtown or the Cherry Creek location, is always one of stops for Happy Hour or dinner. This review is for the Glendale / Cherry Creek location. 

During my last trip to Denver I stayed near Jax Glendale and went for Happy Hour two nights in a row. Unfortunately, I left disappointed both times. The first night, I had the Happy Hour mussels, like I always do. This time, though, instead of a large bowl heaping with mussels, I was presented with a little cup with a total of 7 mussels in it. 7 mussels for $9! The taste was delicious, but the value proposition has taken a turn for the worst. Mussels apparently are now almost the same price as the Happy Hour oysters.

The second night, I ordered another one of my favorites, the calamari. Most of the time Jax calamari is the best I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had it many times - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and not greasy at all. This time, however, I was presented witha plate of soggy and oily calamari. I thought they changed the recipe or something until I saw diners next to me order the same, but theirs looked normal - dark brown and crispy. This speaks to inconsistently prepared items coming from the kitchen. They were not busy at that time that day - no excuse.

So, two things, they are apparently trying to cut corners by serving an extremely small portion of mussels, and the quality standards of the kitchen appear to be compromised. I hope this trend doesn&#39;t continue.

I will be back to Jax, but if the quality and value continue to decline, I will have to start looking for amother favorite place to eat when I&#39;m in Denver."

Food was pretty good, drinks were on point.  I did not particularly enjoy the seabass I ordered- my error in thinking it was a Chilean seabass as opposed to the branzino-ish seabass.  The oysters were fresh and pretty tasty, I would definitely order those again. The restaurant was lively albeit a corporate chain feel."

We usually make sure we hit Jax before the flight back to AZ. The food and service has always been outstanding. I did notice recently that it seemed the portions were a little smaller. If you are going to order the Oysters, stick with Happy Hour ones. We got a dozen for $18 but also wanted to try the WellFleet Oysters, so we order 6. I didn&#39;t realize that they were $4 each. They were good, but not that good. 
I have to say that the Calamari was awesome. I would highly recommend it. Our server was Abby and she was amazing."

We started with a mimosa and Thai bloody Mary and some oysters. The drinks were only $3 each and since it was after 12 the oysters were on happy hour, which made them only $1.50 each. 
My blood mary was great as were the oysters. They came with the standard cocktail sauce, horseradish, lemon as well as 2 different mignonettes, which were both great. The citrus one was my favorite. We were also given saltines to eat with them, which I had never done before, but really enjoyed. The oysters were fresh, ice cold and delicious. 
I got the hash and my boyfriend got the new Denver omelette. The hash was absolutely amazing. The shrimp was great and the arugula was a nice addition. However, it was the mustard vinaigrette that made the dish. It was a smaller portion than some places give, but not bad for $12 considering it had shrimp and chorizo in it and tasted fantastic.  
The omelette tasted pretty good, but was very flat and looked a bit sad. I can make a better omelette at home. This is the reason Jax isn&#39;t getting 5 stars. The potato casserole it came with was awesome though and I will order that as a side when we go back."

Their direct website says they close at 11.  But yelp says they close at 10. The server said the kitchen closes at 10 and they also close at 10 but people stay until about midnight at the bar...

Anyway their calamari is the best!. The batter is perfect, the sauce is perfect (sweet + spicy) and they give you plenty squid unlike most seafood places that tend to use more batter to cover up small portions. 

I&#39;m a crab cake fan and I try them no matter what seafood place I visit and I&#39;ll just say these are not the best. The menu seems short to me it&#39;s only half a page but their drinks fill up 2 and a half pages so I assume people go here for the drinks? 

The server was nice, the atmosphere was decent, a bit loud but again I think it&#39;s more of a bar feel. It was raining but it seemed like they had a nice outdoor seating area upstairs."

The calamari was great - in regards to quality and thickness - however the breading was super bland and had no flavor. 

The butter roll - well it was just that.

Scallops were great.

However, my favorite dish at the Jax downtown - the chowder - hasn&#39;t measured up either time. The first time it was WAY too salty and the second time it had chills in it and I couldn&#39;t even tasted the sherry. It was horrific. I won&#39;t be going back."

Whenever I travel I use Yelp and it has never failed me. I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at Red Creek across from Jax Oyster Bar.  This place is off the hook. I started with the Calamari. It was seriously the best I have ever had. Then I had the oysters recommended by Danny the bartender. He said go with the Shigoka and he nailed it. I had the Mirada also but the Shigoka was better. Sweet and clean. I had many different drinks from whiskey to shots to beer and Danny could not have been more accommodating and friendly. He cares and is passionate about customer service. I finished the night with the crab cake and an amber ale. I am from Maryland so I am skeptical about crab cakes from out of state but they nailed it. Ask for a little old bay if you are east of the Mississippi. This place killed it with food, drinks and service. I will be back. Maybe tomorrow. #gooddecisions."

I had a creole oyster as an appetizer that was mostly grease. The gumbo had a very very good flavor and had a great compliment of shrimp, mussels, and fillings but was thin, watery and not what gumbo in New Orleans tastes like. The Brussel sprouts had a great charred flavor for the most part but were also very dry. Overall I would eat here again but would try an entree or sandwich."

The seafood at Jax Fish House Glendale is fresh. This is an unexpected pleasant surprise because Colorado is a landlocked state. The fried calamari, brussels sprouts, and seafood platter on the happy hour menu was delicious. Our waitress was professional and effectively sold the menu.

We had a bit of bad service, but the manager was super nice and wanted to make things right with us.  So we still left happy customers.  They care a great deal about customer satisfaction here. 

Happy hours is definitely the time to come. There is a great selection of fun cocktails including a white sangria, a bourbon raspberry concoction, and of course beer and wine.  Their oysters were 1.50 each and they had peel and eat shrimp for $6.  They also had a sampler that included crab legs, oysters, and the peel and eat shrimp for $18.  

I think this is a STEAL of a deal.  Not to mention, this is one of the freshest places to get seafood around town.  Everything is reasonable and delicious. 

I will definitely be back for more."

When discussing the best places for Happy Hour, Jax Fish House is always top of mind with local Denver-ites.  

I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of dining here for dinner, I&#39;ve solely enjoyed their HH during every visit.  I&#39;m addicted to the Bangkok Fizz with Thai chili infused vodka, pineapple syrup, lime and ginger beer.  The drink has enough heat to make my lips tingle and the sweetness from the pineapple syrup that keeps me ordering more.  I also enjoy the Cucumber Lemon Press and the Affirmed for HH beverage choices and at $5 a piece each beverage is a steal.

The HH food is excellent as well and I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;ve had more than my share.  The Calamari with the mango-chili mojo and lime aioli is a fried delight with refreshing dipping sauces to enhance the flavor.  The Fruit de Mer is a cold seafood salad of sorts with squid, shrimp, mussels, octopus and olives.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the flavor of this dish but the size of the dish is meant for a child.  I probably wouldn&#39;t order this dish again since I enjoy other HH items more and feel like they&#39;re the better deal.  

The Peel and Eat Shrimp are at the top of my HH list, I like to get down and dirty with this dish.  The shrimp are served chilled with some sort of spicy rub and then the peeling must start, and you try to peel faster than your neighbor to ensure you enjoy your fair share of these tasty shrimp.  The best part is dipping the shrimp in the Jax mustard sauce and enjoying another level of heat with each bite.  Jax offers warm towels and lemons to clean up your hands afterwards since licking your fingers is nowhere near enough to get them clean.

The oysters during HH are $1.25 each and the perfect accompaniment to the other dishes and all the beverages.  Do yourself a favor and order a dozen before you even sit down, you won&#39;t be disappointed.  They&#39;re freshly chucked oysters served with cocktail sauce and lemon and disappear quickly with every slurp.  Make sure you order enough so everyone gets the same amount at the table.  There is no way you&#39;re going to cut an oyster in half to share.

The other HH food choices are solid as well but the ones I mentioned are the ones worth returning for.  You&#39;re at a fish house after all, don&#39;t you want to indulge in fresh fish.  I appreciate the atmosphere more at the Glendale location than the one downtown.  The Glendale location feels less cramped and offers an outdoor patio upstairs in the warmer months.  

During the hours of 4-6 every day you may find me at Jax indulging in some adult libations and getting dirty with some shrimp during HH.  Come join me if you dare."

I asked for bread and butter. &#34;We don&#39;t have any.&#34; I didn&#39;t argue, but I knew house-baked Buttermilk Bread is on the menu. I went downstairs, ordered two servings of bread and butter to go, paid and brought them upstairs. Half the menu and most of the happy hour items are not available on the deck. That is utterly stupid. The waiter came back by and saw the bread. I looked at him and said, &#34;You lied about the bread. You&#39;re just lazy.&#34;

The bartenders were wonderful and attentive. The strawberry lemonade cocktail is addicting, consider this your warning. I may go and grab a bottle of strawberry infused vodka this weekend now! 

The happy hour oysters were also delicious. I just love oysters! They are $1.25 each and luckily I didn&#39;t come in with an empty stomach or I would have never stopped. 

We also ordered the happy hour shrimp cocktail and we weren&#39;t too impressed. I know there isn&#39;t much to a shrimp cocktail but I do love shrimp cocktail but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll order this one again.

Next time we will def come in with more of an appetite. The calamari smelled and looked so scrumptious that we will for sure need to taste it. My fiancé was really interested in the gumbo fries but didn&#39;t have the appetite to try it. I can&#39;t wait to be back for the great service, oysters, and other great items on their menu."

And it has a fantastic rooftop patio.  And I can ride my bike or walk to it.

I haven&#39;t yet been for brunch or dinner but have enjoyed lunches and happy hours here.  I have to say that happy hour is definitely where it&#39;s at because you can try so many different kinds of seafood and other snacks and keep it affordable.  Some of my favorite happy hour treats are the fresh Chesapeake bay oysters at $1.25 each, and $5 portions of peel and eat shrimp, fruit de mar (squid, shrimp, mussels, octopus, potatoes and olives), chicken and crawfish gumbo fries (you can also get a cup of gumbo but get the fries!), and fried calamari.  Honestly, I&#39;ve been known to make a meal out of the happy hour offerings.  I like to wash it all down with a Cucumber Lemon Press, Bangkok Fizz, and/or the housemade sangria on tap.

The lunch and dinner menus make seasonal changes, which is always a plus in my book.  Some of the items are a bit spendy but I&#39;ve always been able to find something that doesn&#39;t do too much damage to my wallet.  I&#39;ve received nothing less than excellent service every time from the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff.  Jax offers some special event and holiday menus and they had an extended happy hour on Christmas Eve this year.

If you like oyster bars, it is very popular for that, and everything looks fresh and well-prepared."

For starters, we had the fried calamari and peel &amp; eat shrimp.  The sauces are what really make these appetizers pop.  I could seriously eat multiple plates of these instead of ordering an entree.  We gobbled these up in record time!

For my entree, I had the tender belly pork loin which comes with green beans and smashed fried potatoes that lay on a bed of bacon bits, creme fraiche, and some sort of preserves.  OMGeezy, it was fantastic!  The pork loin was cooked to a perfect medium, so it was moist, tender, and delicious.  Being the glutton I am, I also ordered a side of garlic fries.  It could use more garlic and parmesan, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  

Dessert was rather interesting.  I settled on ice cream, but was miffed to discover that chocolate was not offered.  The flavor choices were rather eccentric, so I settled on the safest one which was the balsamic strawberry flavor.  This was the shiznit!  Probably the best strawberry ice cream I&#39;ve ever had.  Next time I&#39;m here, I may even go for the cheddar ice cream.  

Service was great and there&#39;s lots of parking.  I&#39;ve heard the happy hour here is pretty good, so I&#39;ll be sure to check that out at some point."

I was in the area for work and stayed by at the nearby hotel. The other restaurants surrounding the two hotel are no where close on the caliber of this one, so this restaurant holds a monopoly on class and options as far as dinner cuisine.

I visited two days in a row. Day 1, I had the affirmed cocktail, fruit del mar and the red snapper. The red snapper was so good I forgot where I was and almost had a &#34;Meg Ryan&#34; moment. The next day, I had the cocktail again and tried caviar for the first time. It was not what I expected, it was better. If ever in the area again, I will most definitely partake in the fare again."

We were sat in the nook with the drink station, server computers, expo, and kitchen, so I guess it would be hard for anyone to miss us, but the staff was very attentive. Now the problem, maybe they are the best raw bar because that means the kitchen can&#39;t ruin the food. Everything from the brussels sprouts to the tuna to the sherbert was over seasoned. The brussels sprouts were soggy with vinegar. My tongue was raw from the sea salt and unexpected blackening seasoning on my rare tuna. I scraped off all the outside layer from the tuna to make it edible. Then my raw tongue got the punch of serrano peppers in the raspberry sherbert. Tuna does not need whole flakes of sea salt and sherbert does not need chilies, stop trying so hard. I wanted a light refreshing meal and it was heavy and overdone. We were both extremely sick, probably from over-consumption of sodium. If you go, stick with the raw bar."

Jax does just that for happy hour. You will not find better oysters for less and the atmosphere gives the impression you could walk out onto the New England coast upon your exit. 

Dinner is another story entirely. My girlfriend, her father, and I missed happy hour by a few minutes and decided to stay. 

We waited for an hour and a half before we were seated. In fairness, we could have got a reservation. However, watching the staff unprofessionally fraternize at the front booth was a bit of a bitter pill to swallow while we waited. 

One we were seated, the service rolled to a crawl. We waited a long time. Long enough for each of us to drink enough to believe we were artists. We used the provided crayons paper table cloth to make a crude recreation of the Mona Lisa. 

The food finally came. It was........ok. Some parts were really good. But it was mostly ok. I can&#39;t remark on their signature swordfish plate because they were out. I had sea bass instead.  I just don&#39;t think it was worth 30 bucks. I was more impressed with the potato chip appetizer which also available for .... Drumroll.... happy hour.

The waiter, who I must add was a consummate professional, felt our defeat and gave us free dessert. It was a deconstructed s&#39;more and was delicious. 

I felt somewhat vindicated by the free dessert but was then sucker punched by a completely messed up bill. We then had to wait. for. ever. for the staff to figure out what happened between our wait at the bar and at the table. 

To sum it up, go on happy hour and get the oysters or their fantastic burgers. The bartenders and waiters are great and you&#39;ll be happy with what you get and spend. Stay for dinner and you&#39;ll be less pleased. Their entrees are kinda blah but the appetizers are fantastic."

I&#39;d been eyeing Jax for a while, so this was a great HH opportunity. Even though I &#34;wasn&#39;t hungry&#34; I still managed to have 1 Jax strawberry lemonade, 2 Bangkok Fizzes, an oyster shooter, peel and eat shrimp, and generous tastes of 3 desserts. Get ready for the blue &#34;Read more&#34; 

I missed the memo on the first round and went for the adult strawberry lemonade (umm, can we say &#34;totally refreshing and delicious&#34; all at once?? By putting &#34;adult&#34; I mean it was infused with vodka, but I can hardly believe it). I was back in the game on round 2 and 3 by ordering the Bangkok Fizz. I&#39;ve mentioned before how I love ginger beer. The Bangkok Fizz is the ultimate drink. Spicy, deceivingly loaded with booze, refreshing, and crazy delicious. 

The oysters were great and I tried them with the mignonette. Mignonette, that&#39;s a new one to me, but it was a great compliment to my oyster. It was a good thing Alissa R. and I decided to just get the peel and eat shrimp and even better that Dale Z. made it a double order. The seasoning was finger licking good. Yes, they provided us with wet towels, but I didn&#39;t want to waste any seasoning.. 

Desserts. Was I just craving every sort of sweets that night? Or was everything that good? The cobbler served in the cute mini cast iron skillet was excellent. Ice cream with not too tart and not too sweet peaches. There was a flourless (gluten free) chocolate cake with an orange chantilly. Chocolate and oranges is one of my favorite combinations. So this dessert was begging my fork to continuously dive in while the others foolishly talked the evening away instead of indulging. Last but not least, the monkey bread with Stanahan&#39;s whiskey brickle ice cream (Jennifer B., I&#39;m going to the source!!). Definitely a more elegant take on the monkey bread that we made in college. Had I known then about this whiskey ice cream, I probably would have gained the freshman 15 times 3 my junior/senior year. 

To ponder: Was it the company that&#39;s worth 5 stars? (Answer: Yes.) Or the awesome desserts and HH food that&#39;s making me give 5 stars? (Answer: Yes.) Or the 5 star experience? (Answer: Yes.)

If I could lounge on a rooftop patio with a view of the mountains, in patio furniture complete with colorful pillows, while sipping on Bangkok Fizzes all day...I would! Seriously, if you&#39;re going to Jax... Invite me. Please!"

What else could you ask for? The happy hour from 4-6pm dominates with Kumamoto oysters hailing from the North West coast to the Chesapeake bay oysters from the East - all waiting to be washed down with one of their many delectable cocktails, like the Bombay Fizz. 

Though, the view from the rooftop isn&#39;t the must mountainous, they make up for it in over-the-top great service and deliciously fresh seafood.

Came from a late afternoon Friday Neighborhood Association get together and was offered a seat at the bar where everyone took wonderful care of me and made me feel right at home in the midst of a very hectic and busy Friday evening. Had a double IPA along with a delicious bowl of their Seafood Chowder which was more of a bisque, with shrimp and mussels.  The flavor profile was very balanced and complete with depth. Followed this up with the Lobster Roll... very nice combination of lobster and other flavors. Went very well with the Chowder for a very pleasing dinner. Finished it off with some homemade ice cream and sorbet. Nice ending to a fine meal. Kudos to all the staff for their great, attentive and pleasant service!

Hubs and I had an incredible experience sitting on the rooftop with our buns firmly planted at the bar. Matthew was an excellent bartender and he is an expert mixologist. 

We happened to be there during happy hour (offered 4-6 everyday) and there are a variety of tantalizing cocktails on the menu as well great beers on tap and house wines. I started with the cucumber lemonade vodka which was really a mistake. It wasn&#39;t bad, I just didn&#39;t realize how awesome the other options were. The BANGKOK FIZZ is outrageously good. If you like spicy cocktails, you will love this drink. Jax makes their own ginger beer and it is absolutely amazing. Coming from someone who is typically not a fan, you can trust that it far exceeds any ginger beer out there. Another cocktail winner was the ARNIE. It boasts house-infused black tea vodka, but I think it is the bitters that set it apart- giving the drink an edge that prevents it from being cloying- like so many fruity drinks can be.

I love that Jax does all its own infusions and of course the ginger beer. They also make a sangria that sits on tap. Drinking here is definitely a treat and a fantastic and unexpected addition to the area. City Set has it going on!"

I took down my initial review because we had been refunded our entire meal after someone from Jax read my review. He sent us a gift card in the full amount and so we decided to give them one last shot. 

This week, we called in a to-go order so as not to have to wait to be seated (and because we live extremely close to this place). Upon arrival, the girl that helped in closing out the tab was EXTREMELY rude and at first did not want to take the gift card. She ran it through the machine a few time, said it wouldn&#39;t work and asked us for another form of payment.... uhh no!

Eventually, she got it to work and we left fairly frazzled due to how she treated us. 

Upon getting home, we realized that we did not get one of the things we ordered, my pork was so dry, I ended up giving it to my dog, and my partner&#39;s food was deemed inedible after about 3 bites because the meat was raw. 

The only reason this place isn&#39;t getting one star is because of the manager trying to correct the inital problem and sending us a gift card to try them again.

We have eaten at other restaurants owned by the same company and I can honestly say I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going wrong with Jax. All of their other restaurants are amazing!"

I&#39;ve had moe mind blowing experiences at their downtown location in both food choices and definitely atmosphere. It was incredibly well lit...is there such a thing as over-lit? It was bright in the dining room. I found myself comparing it to like any other super bright place...think village inn...but nicer, of course. 

Drinks: I had a spicy ginger beer drink made with Thai chili vodka that was just...delicious. The waiter warned me it was spicy, and it was, but it was a great kind of spicy!

Overall, the food was good, as it always is. Started with oysters, based on a recommendation from the waiter. Their oysters are always a high point for me--fresh, clean, delicious. For entrees we had ona (husband enjoyed it) and I had halibut. They were ok. Were they worth the price of $30 per? Not really. I felt like there could have been better sauces, better sides. My halibut was gorgeously pan seared though, kudos to the chef.

Summary: I left with the feeling of paying too much, which is never awesome. I&#39;ve spent more at Jax and not left with the same regret...I just feel like they&#39;ve gone from amazing to...generic."

Service was very good-efficient, knowledgable, and friendly. 
The menu has some good variety. We tried the king salmon and halibut along with some iced shrimp. The fish was all cooked properly and tasted very good.
My only real issues with this place is the portion sizes and noise levels. The dining room gets very loud during peak hours, and the portion sizes for the price are pathetic. For the typical $30+ plate of fish, you should get more than a 4oz filet and a garnish sized side. We had to order the shrimp just to not leave hungry. For over $100 with no booze, we should have been stuffed. 
Presentation was quite good as well, which is common for restaurants dressing up skimpy portions at high prices."

Of the 12 guys that attended the dinner, ALL of them thought it was an awesome meal/experience and told me to write this review (because they know I eat most of my meals on the road based on Yelp reviews :)

Being a large party, I made reservations (through Yelp/OT of course) so that we could seated without issue.  It was a Tuesday evening and I made reservations for 6pm.  When I arrived at 5:30, the place was packed and I was glad I made reservations.  In fact, even when we left at 9 (on a Tuesday) it was still packed!

We enjoyed a few libations at the bar before being seated - the bartenders were friendly and helpful: I originally wanted to order the &#34;Thai chili infused vodka&#34; and the bartender warned me about the spice.  I like spice, but when I tried a bit of a coworker&#39;s drink later in the evening, I was very glad I didn&#39;t have it.  Happy Hour is a great deal - lots of $5 drinks and food.  Our table server was nice enough to put our first round in at 5:55pm :)

We had four dozen oysters which were excellent.  The peanuts were probably not worth the cost, nor was the calamari - there weren&#39;t very many to go around.

I had a scallop special, which included roasted brussel sprouts that were to die for!

Finally, of the desserts we had/I tried - I would recommend the monkey bread over the donuts.  

Kristin (our server) and the rest of the staff were wonderful - which is not easy for a big group of guys, especially on a busy night.  My water glass rarely sat empty and the manager was very attentive.  They do not automatically include gratuity, but I was happy enough to tip over 20% for our group.

I ordered a lobster roll for takeout. When I went in to pick it up, it looked like a nice clean and cozy, casual place to dine.  It was happy hour (5pm) and for a split second, I thought about staying and having a drink. However I just traveled to Denver a couple of hours ago and I was exhausted, so I took my lobster roll to go. 

Getting back to the hotel, I open the box and it looked Really good! The bread is freshly made, toasted and buttered, and the lobster had bacon pieces on top. It came with a lemon wedge and a tiny side of pickled vegetables.

As a born and raised northerner from a coastal area, I am accustomed to having top notch seafood. I must say that although the lobster roll looked very good and the meat was fresh and the bread was good, I found the lobster meat itself to be bland and lacking flavor.  I wish I had gotten some Old Bay seasoning or something to spice it up. For $24, I expected more - I had a better flavored lobster roll from a gourmet food truck in Northern VA (the Lobster Pound).

I have to give them 3 stars for having friendly servers, a clean restaurant, fresh bread, fresh seafood, and good food presentation. But good food is more than these things, it&#39;s about the flavor. I am disappointed that I wasted one of my two days/meals in Denver on an overpriced, unflavored lobster roll."

We booked a table on Friday night, for Friday night via open table and there was plenty of bookings available when we did it. 

My hubby was feeling pretty hungry so we decided to get an app each, split a salad and then a main. 

My only fault with the place was the speed at which the food came out, which isn&#39;t usually a bad thing but our apps and salad came out at the same time. We asked the waitress to puta hold on the main till we were done so we could enjoy our food, which she did and it worked out well. 

Apps: he had bruschetta and the goat cheese mixture was to die for!! I had the gnocchi and holy moly it was so good!! More filling than what I thought it would be. 

Beef &amp; quinoa salad: it was nice but nothing to write home about. 

Mains: my scallops rocked!! The parsnip purée was delicious with the caramely sauce. He had the duck and it was cooked perfectly. Soooo good!

We ordered hummus with pita, butternut squash wood fired pizza and a sandwich salad combo(half roasted beet salad, half aubergine sandwich) 
Roasted beet salad was amazing, the citrus vinaigrette was delicious. The creamy goat cheese on the salad, another hit! Hummus and pita was also very good. The aubergine sandwich failed to impress. I didn&#39;t like the butternut squash pizza, but that could be just me as the reason for me not liking it was due to the fact that the butternut squash had notes of almond extract in them. Almond extract tastes nothing like real almonds, it tastes/smells like maraschino cherries(off topic: I detest them, how can they even be called cherries? They have had their very heart and soul sucked out of them!) So, that particular flavor in the squash spoiled it for me. Sad! It didn&#39;t taste one bit like butternut squash. 
We ordered grilled cheese sandwich from the kids menu which was very good. It came with fries that were delicious. It also comes with a drink and a kids ice cream. The kids ice cream comes with some chocolate sauce, bits of cookies and some gummy bears. Very pretty plate and something that kids would really enjoy."

Manager Ben Morris and sommelier Jason Duffy hosted our chef&#39;s tasting menu with wine pairings, and it was one of the most thoughtful and delicious meals my wife and I have ever had. The arrival of every course was preceded by a visit from Ben and Jason; details regarding the preparation of each dish came from Ben; complimentary flavors and backgrounds of the paired beverages were expounded upon by Jason. Our first course was a seared diver scallop with a delicious sparkling wine; next were roasted Brussels sprouts with not just a fantastic wine, but a lovely saison ale; we later enjoyed lamb cheeks and a red from another part of the globe; the meal&#39;s crescendo was a filet mignon so tender that we mocked the presence of the steak knives. Afterwards we chided the server for the lack of a prescribed wine pairing with our &#34;s&#39;more inspired&#34; dessert, but it was nonetheless accompanied by not one but two glasses of port. Though each dish throughout the evening was described and thoughtfully-paired with a beverage on personalized menus: Mr. Duffy did not hesitate to augment his prescribed beverage pairings on-the-fly when he was so inspired; his spontaneous excitement about alternate pairings (the saison, the ports, etc.) further elevated our immersion during the meal.

There are several YaYa&#39;s throughout the country, but that doesn&#39;t matter; Ben and Jason effortlessly provided such a personal experience that we would not have been surprised if YaYa herself visited our table during the meal. If this restaurant is a chain: it certainly didn&#39;t feel like one.

If, after reading this review, you think that YaYa&#39;s sounds a little too formal for you: fret not; seated at other locations in the restaurant on a Friday night were families with small children, hipsters in hoodies, business professionals, and people wearing sports jerseys and sneakers. That Ben and Jason were able to pull-off such an immersive and high-end dining experience for the two of us -- all while accommodating the majority of casual customers who just wanted to order off the menu -- is testament to their respective skills. As the place really started to fill-up with patrons towards the evening&#39;s end: we unfortunately seemed to have a little less quality time with our hosts, but that was understandable given the size of the place and the quality of service upon which they seem to pride themselves; we certainly did not feel neglected, even as the restaurant began to fill, though we were glad for our early arrival.

If you can get past the valet: YaYa&#39;s will treat you right, whether you are there for casual meal, or to enjoy the individualized expression of their chef&#39;s creativity. I think it&#39;s time to make another reservation..."

Everyone is dressed well. The place is immaculate. There is joy in the air. You start to feel like you&#39;ve discovered a real gem. 

When you glance at the menu, you&#39;ll start to wonder what this madness is all about. You pull your phone out to check Yelp on what kind of restaurant this is. &#34;American (traditional), Italian, American (new).&#34;  You grin. Best of both worlds. 

Now, you&#39;ll be tempted to order every appetizer on your first visit. Don&#39;t do this. Just come back and spread it out.  Don&#39;t get too greedy your first ho around.  Start with the beef carpaccio (if you&#39;re with a group). If you&#39;re solo, jump into that gnocchi. 

Moving on to the entrees. The roasted organic chicken is what sets this place apart. Is it the perfectly roasted potatoes, the garlic and butter sauce that the chicken is bathing in, the tender chicken itself, or the peculiar caper berries? That&#39;s right my friends, caper berries. And have no shame, you&#39;ll look around to see if anyone minds you tilting your plate back to grab every ounce of that secret sauce that you wish they sold by the pint. They should sell it by the PINT!! 

Oh YaYa&#39;s - Old, new, Italian, whatever you are, you are my favorite."

My friend said that Yaya&#39;s has been around since he was a kid. And still rockng the great menu? Wow! 

You can have whatever your heart desires. Seafood? Meat? Eggs? Dessert? Pay extra $10 for a bottomless Mimosa. At $26 pets person if you&#39;re a big eater it&#39;s so worth it. It&#39;s almost as sinful as Las Vegas. Eggs the way you like it. Just tell the man behind the egg station and you&#39;re set! Crab legs? Grab legs! 

It&#39;s a spread worth your money. Now the view outside is another plus. It&#39;s sits infront of or across the street from a small park. The flowers in bloom this season surrounding the fountain and little pond was almost breath taking! 

Drive here and you will thank me. I suggests reserving a spot since its famous and busy!"

The weather was warm so we opted to sit out on the patio with a view of the little pond and water fountain.  Our server, Cliff, was very helpful and attentive.  

We started off with Crab Cakes along with Humus and Pita.  The crab cakes were moist and had a little spice from what I believe were fresh cut habañero peppers.  Cliff saw how much we enjoyed everything and decided to bring us an order of baba ganoush and focaccia bread which was equally tasty.  To go with our bottle of Sauvignon Blanc we ended up ordering the ravioli and Scottish Salmon.  My wife absolutely loved her ravioli while my salmon was cooked to medium rare perfection with a nice crunchy, almost toasted top layer, on a bed of Spetzle.  

As a special treat Cliff brought us a chocolate cake with ice cream which was out of this world! The cake is actually made of filo dough and melts in your mouth.

When we were done with our food we took what was left of our bottle of wine and headed inside to the bar and enjoy the lively atmosphere.  Definitely a place to go for just about any occasion but I&#39;d recommend dressing in business casual or better.

With a great combination of quality service and food this place is now on the top of our date night restaurant rotation.

We already have reservations for Sunday brunch tomorrow and my wife is excited to check out the spread and see exactly how bottomless a bottomless mimosa really is!"

I love lasagna. I don&#39;t know what they put in it here, but wow. I mean, wow!! The flavor is like nothing you have ever tried, and delicious! Large portion!

I also looked on Ya Ya&#39;s website and no where did it say you could not order off their menu for dinner.  The waiter was very good.  The buffet cost $36.95.  The food was Luke warm.

I opted for the lemon raspberry martini and it was so sweet and delicious. My friend got the mojito and was also happy with it. We munched on bacon wrapped dates and a bruchetta pizzaretta (sp?). Both of which were amazing and cooked to perfection.

Our server was Edward and he was outstanding and very prompt, as was the brunette woman who was also taking care of us.

I made the mistake of having too much carb (the biscuits &amp; gravy, made-to-order French toasts, and pasta bake all looked and tasted very good) as well as dessert on my first time because how could you not? OK, not a mistake when there&#39;s dessert involved (especially such good ones), lol.

My family visited Ya Ya&#39;s to celebrate a double birthday party, party of 9 last night.  After a wonderful dinner, my 2-1/2 daughter was asked by our waiter if she would like to go make her own special dessert with the chef, in the kitchen. She of course said yes and only heard the word &#34;DESSERT.&#34;  I went with her, held her hand as she carried her large dessert spoon in the other following our waiter.  We walked into the kitchen, country music playing loudly, clanking pots and pans, lots of action as a kitchen should be. There was a long plate prepared with seven gummy bears, black napkin with sprinkled powdered sugar. She placed the gummy bears on the vanilla ice cream, covered the bears with crushed Oreos and helped the chef drizzle chocolate syrup over top.

Such a special thing to do for my daughter. Thank you for this special moment Ya Ya&#39;s! She absolutely loved it. (I posted a short video of the 2 minute video I recorded along with a photo.)"

Ya Ya&#39;s is also a sizable restaurant, so it isn&#39;t difficult to get a table. Bonus that you can also book a reservation through OpenTable.

They do have outdoor seating, but that is too hot in the Summer. Parking is a real trick unless you are willing to go Valet.

I opted for the bottomless mimosa ($8 extra), but they were in big wine glasses and well worth the $8. The buffet was amazing. They had an omelet station with a prime rib station next to it. They had fresh salmon to make your own lox bagel (super good). They also had a dessert table (my favorite) and the normal bacon, potato, sausage choices. They had ripe fruit to accompany your heavy breakfast and they had made to order items also. I had the lemon-blueberry stuffed french toast and Ya Ya&#39;s hot brown Benedict. I was a huge fan of both, I was barely able to finish the Benedict I was so full. I wanted to continue binge eating all this delicious food, but I had to quit.

Bottom line is, come here for brunch and you will not be disappointed. They had everything I love about brunch and our waitress was friendly and attentive."

We decided to try YaYa&#39;s because I had heard about it for a few years. When an AmEx offer came my way for $25 off $50, we couldn&#39;t put it off any longer. First  - it&#39;s right in the DTC but we had trouble finding with even the Garmin - aim for the Hyatt and it&#39;s right next door.  Happy hour from 3:30-6:30 pm. 

Parking valet - prompt and courteous. Hostess at front door, welcoming and indicated the bar for happy hour. Bobby our waiter? Stellar. He was helped by several other servers and bussers who all delivered superior service. When I changed from a bottle of wine to cocktails after he&#39;s already brought the bottle (still unopened), he couldn&#39;t have been more accommodating. Cocktails! Superb. I was a little toasty just from the Pink concoction I ordered for $6 with fruit, mint, cassis, etc - complete yum. Husbands martinis were excellent. My second drink was a limoncello - sparking wine cocktail, also excellent -- good thing I wasn&#39;t driving, these puppies are strong. 

For happy hour food, we had the chicken skewers (excellent Greek flavor with tzatziki on the side), $5 I think, and $6 lamb meatballs (actually kind of &#34;meh&#34;- meaty and six of them but not my favorite), and an excellent chicken pizza like thing called a spiedini with a sauce with olives you could spread on it -- top notch. $6 on happy hour. Two different servers reminded us when happy hour was almost over so we could lodge any last orders. And then finally - everything was so good we had a dessert. I permitted the husband to order the bread pudding because I hate bread pudding and knew I should eat no more. This bread pudding - Kahlua chocolate bread pudding with ice cream and caramel sauce smelled so good I had to try it. This bread pudding was dynamite! 

Even our trip out the door was pleasant with kind good nights and what totally came off as sincere wishes for our return. I was also slightly tipsy as I mentioned from just two fabulous cocktails. We will definitely be back. 

The dinner menu is kind of pricy $20-30-ish for entrees, but not out of line with the great service, upscale atmosphere, and quality of food and choices."

First note--the service-Lenny was amazing. Gave us great recommendations on wine, what to order, and was just really friendly and very funny. 

Drinks--very extensive wine menu, with great descriptions by flavor profile.

Now to the real deal--the food. A small note: I&#39;m not a restaurant week believer. Most of the time I think of it as a way to go to nice restaurants and get cheap food, rather than the amazing menus they normally offer. We decided to go to YaYa&#39;s last night because their restaurant menu seemed to be made of mostly their menu. Four courses--all delicious. Here are a couple of standouts:

Apps- steak tartare. Had a mustard component that was rich, yet subtle. But the real app winner was the fresh ricotta with dates, onions and chorizo. Holy love of cheese, this was fantastic. Smooth, slightly sweet, a little salty...and apparently not to difficult to make at home, according to our waiter. They also gave us some focaccia and baba ganoujh that was really nice. Side note--ricotta and focaccia--amazing!

Salads--pretty standard, nothing to really bust out the postcards and write home about there.

Entrees-I had the best lamb meatball pasta with a mint pesto. It&#39;s on their regular menu...and if you like acid, it&#39;s a must try. I love acid. I will be back, on the regular, to eat this. Husband had a steak with an amazing beet purée. The steak was cooked perfectly.

Desert-creme caramel cheesecake--great texture, super tasty, and a sticky toffee pudding. Also delicious. Would eat both again and again.

So all in all, amazing amazing food, and restaurant week finally worked for me--I will be going back for more lamb meatballs for sure. (Note, please add ricotta to regular menu)"

Brunch is a fixed price and it cost more than the price that was listed on their website, so that was the 1st surprise.  My waiter brought me drinks i didnt ask for and ignored the requests I gave. I heard other waiters around me tell their tables about extra features that were available and that they could order, my waiter did none of that. My waiter was too busy being over attentive to the table next to me that he neglected me. For a 40.00 brunch, I expect to not be neglected.

(These visits were before being a yelper) I&#39;ve even bought gift certificates for clients there. An account executive took me out for lunch today for my birthday today. The service was very good. The atmosphere was excellent as always. But my burger was awful. I ordered it medium, but received it burnt to a crisp. My toasted bun was also toasted black. The bacon was even badly overcooked. It was a celebration, and a gift for me so I didn&#39;t want to put a damper on the meal, so I choked down as much as I could, but it was truly terrible. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll give them another shot because of all of the great experiences in the past, but it will be a while. Bummed.

***this is an updated review based on a lousy response I received from a management type fellow in which he blamed me for not sending my food back.  Here is a helpful tip for restaurants: if you receive a critical review, don&#39;t blame your reviewer. They already had a bad experience.  Don&#39;t make it worse. I&#39;m reducing my formerly 2 star review to a 1 star review. It&#39;s no wonder why the quality has gone down. Poor management and attitudes tend to spread like wildfire. If I worked for someone like that, I wouldn&#39;t care what kind of food I was putting out either. Soooooo many good restaurants out there.  Save yourself the frustration and never eat here. Ownership: save yourself major losses and find a new manager. This one&#39;s heart isn&#39;t in it."

My reservation was for 10. I called to say I was going to be five minutes late. I was told that would reduce my table time by that amount. What? There is a time limit? Not that I would be there longer than that but there is a timer? So, I show up at 10:03 and it is easily another seven minutes until we are seated anyway. Not that the ten minutes was a big deal but that the person who answered the phone called me out which was an instant turn off (they open at 10). 

You would think the food was just placed in the covered dishes on the buffet, right? The bacon and potatoes were both cold. &#34;Stuffed&#34; French toast? Try two pieces of white bread slightly burned French toast sandwiching a thin layer of diluted Nutella. The prime rib was good, but cut remarkably thin. While I didn&#39;t try, I&#39;ll bet I could read through it (credit talent of the man who slices it). I didn&#39;t get an omelet; my friend said hers was &#34;eh&#34;: not bad; nothing great. 

The kale artichoke salad was crisp and refreshing as was the cucumber salad; fruit was fresh and displayed nicely. Made to order Eggs Benedict disappointing (so the half order wise). The dessert table was bountiful with a wide array of options. The cheesecake was light and creamy. I would have liked a piece of carrot cake, but we were running out of time so waiting 15 minutes for it to be replenished would have put us over our time limit. Was it an off day? I don&#39;t know, but for $25, I won&#39;t risk it again. 

 Atmosphere is beautiful, though. 5* on the ambiance."

Too bad it took me two months.

Ya Ya&#39;s is pretty good.  Loads of gluten free options.  I had the pork tenderloin and it was perfectly cooked.  I mean perfectly.  Tender and flavorful.  I might use a better preparation than turnips, but the glaze was very nice.

The bisque (also gluten free) was ok.  I could definitely taste the graininess of the rice flour that was used to thicken it up.

Slightly above average service."

Since they open late, and located just across Hyatt Place, I think they get a lot of patrons from the hotel.

The bar area was relatively filled up when I arrived close to 9pm.

Their wine menu is on an iPads which includes extensive description of each.  Not sure if it is necessary but it was kind of neat.  The wine is quite reasonably priced and the options are not too overwhelming.

I am going to say this now, get dessert!  The bread pudding is served warm ala mode.  I licked it clean (even after a full entree below).

I had the steak quinoa salad - HUGE portion.  Probably only a few slices of steak but the quinoa completely filled me up.  The dressing is reminiscence of the bulgur dressing with the abundant parsley.

Service was attentive and friendly.  I was dining solo and didn&#39;t feel out of place at all."

Middle of the road at best aside from the service which was really slow.
Granted there we were in a group of eleven and there to celebrate my wife&#39;s birthday, and I know large groups can be tough.
It was almost like a big surprise party as the Servers seemed surprised every time another chair at the table was filled with a guest as our friends arrived. For our friends the surprise was in how long it took to get a drink or even be acknowledged...

I had liked the menu online as there seemed to be an offering for everyone, but in reality this was more like going to the cheesecake factory where the menu has a lot of offerings and really nothing special.

The appetizers were good. Nothing unusual, nothing with any impact, but good.

Dinner had the potential of being great, I ordered the trout. Thinking the greatness potential evaporated under the heat lights along with any moisture was left in that poor trout. 
I don&#39;t recall all of the other comments our friends made, but no one was enamored with their dinner, and the consensus was more of a &#34;MEH...&#34;.

The worst part of the night was the servers adding a 20% gratuity for a less than lack luster job. unfriendly, uncaring and worst of all slow...
I get it with large parties... Some people think that at a table of 8-12 with a $700-$1000 tab a twenty is enough. However on the other side a waitress should not be able to provide crap service and still receive a premium tip. In fairness there did seem to be a &#34;team approach&#34; which in restaurants means no body does anything while the other guy goes to smoke near the dumpster. 

There are just too many other restaurants in the DTC area to waste your time here. Doubt we will go back..."

Especially for places I used to love.  Service has constantly gone downhill and today&#39;s performance could not be worse.  If I wasn&#39;t in the service industry I would have complained and left no tip.  
Customers there at first we thought were just jerks but then we got it, half full patio and empty inside and struggling servers who lacked communication and forget about teamwork... Sorry for the run on but service used to be on point.  
People clearing plates not asking if it&#39;s ok, no refills on sodas and debris in my cocktail.  Requested a manager, never got one.  They offered us dessert but comped other checks in a close vicinity.  That&#39;s fine I never mind paying but the only people who deserve to be paid today are the cooks.  The food is always amazing.
I will not fine there again but I will still recommend their food.  It&#39;s expensive but worth it,  get it to go and leave a 5 buck tip instead of spending $30 a head for lunch.  
Also, a lunch table having alcohol!!! Pay attention dummies!  Good chance to ring in a nice bill and get a better tip!  I hate complaining but wow yayas I was so disappointed I actually dug into my wallet for a coupon that was over a year old... We could have easily walked out and just dropped a tip...  
And to the hostess, you sat us at the only table we wanted to sit in... The people next to us don&#39;t deserve any privacy, your in a restaurant on a patio on a nice day, please put your tits away and leave your kids at home next time! Great job!"

Very nice wait staff, the patio is great, but I doubt I&#39;d go back. $15 for 2 really, really average crab cakes. Average is being generous. I would not have them again at $5. Also had an eggplant based app that was really very good, that I would enjoy again. So one out of two. Fine. 

But those two tiny apps, and two glasses of my fave Kim Crawford sauv blanco came to about $50, plus tip over $60. Kim is $12 a bottle, not per glass. Ouch. 

No way Jose, there&#39;s way too many better scenes, MUCH better food and ambiance available around here for the same or usually a lot less dineros. Been to Union Station? Or on the flip side of style and AMAZINGLY good food, Billy&#39;s in NW Denver?? Or... Any place else for such better food and value. 

I understand it&#39;s DTC etc but still...  I&#39;ll pass. I don&#39;t need to &#39;see and be seen&#39; that badly any more."

I ate here with someone who is sort of a picky eater but she also wanted to try a bunch of stuff.  She ordered for both of us (burger and wrap) then asked the waiter to split everything - half a burger, half a wrap, half the side of fries, half the side salad - between the two of us.  Oh, and cheese on the side and extra sauce and... yeah.

Not only was the food amazing (lamb burger and salmon wrap) but the service was impeccable.  All the requests were followed without the slightest hint that this was a pain in the butt and no mistakes, our waiter was obviously paying attention.

As I have reported before, they continue to be my go-to happy hour when the need arises. Yummy food- especially the hummus and the mussels. And of course the wine pours are the best around.

But the other reason I am bumping them to 5 stars is that they just catered our office Christmas lunch and did such a great job- really went above and beyond. We had the garlic chicken with olives, the lasagna, the spinach salad, and the caesar salad. Everyone raved about the food. We had planned to just have plastic ware but Ya Ya&#39;s decided that it would be too hard to each the delicious food that way and brought in linens and flatware for us- really making the whole affair so much nicer and festive. Pure yumminess.

They also told me they&#39;re catering a mexican party over the weekend- so you&#39;re not restricted to just what is on the catering menu. The chefs are definitely talented so I would trust them with any event and anything you had in mind.

I will definitely use them again for future events."

I&#39;m from the gulf coast, so I&#39;m familiar with seafood. The desserts were nice, but not overwhelmingly great. At the omelet table, I had to wait about 5 minutes for the attendant to return.

It is one of my favorites and I would love to keep coming back. But! What has happened here lately? We just finished eating brunch here and the food was mediocre at best, cold and the worst part was the service!! Rude waitress took our plates early, was there to &#34;help&#34; us with our needs during a buffet style brunch and literally said NO to getting us ketchup. She even asked us to share the single tablespoon amount she had already brought and then said go back up to the line get yourself some more. Really?! You don&#39;t have condiments on the table and you can&#39;t just bring some to the table when we ask kindly? What are we tipping you for then? Not to mention did not get refills on mimosas, forgot drinks, and asked us too many times if she could clear our plates before we were finished. We had to say no a few times. You would think she would get the hint. Although we could not bring ourselves to not tip her, she deserved none and should not be helping customers. Restaurant owners: please get good service. Bad service makes your delicious food not enjoyable and trumps all your other positive efforts. Ruined a Sunday brunch with friends that had great potential to be a great memory of your restaurant. Save yourself the time and annoyance and find brunch elsewhere."

Unimpressed with service.

In my world, I service my customers before myself. I guess patrons take a back seat to restaurant employees that sit at the bar. 

Unimpressed with dessert. It was peach concoction in a pastry with ice cream and some sauces. First, don&#39;t bring me ice cream and fork. Second, use a smaller plate. The sauces were so far from the pastry that it was like mowing a football field to get to all the flavors. Last, were those peaches really fresh? Tasted canned to me.

I was at Ya Ya&#39;s for a business lunch this week and was pleasantly surprised by this place! Despite working in the DTC area, I don&#39;t explore too much around here since I&#39;m usually in such a hurry to beat the traffic on 25. 

Between our group we had the butternut squash-pumpkin soup, roasted beet salad with salmon, tenderloin tips sandwich, steak burger, and beef stroganoff. With the exception of the beef stroganoff which just didn&#39;t hit the spot - everyone raved about their dishes and everything sounded like it would be ordered again given the chance.

We came a little on the early side, but am thankful we did. This place is hoppin&#39; come 1:00 pm! Nearly every table was full when we were on our way out the door. They do have a valet since the parking lot fills up quickly - so that&#39;s nice to know in case you&#39;re coming during the rush and the lot is full."

Modest me played it safe by ordering the fennel sausage pizza. Thin crust, fresh ricotta, red onion, scallions and house made sausage. I enjoyed it overall, but do prefer my fennel sausage to be a tad spicier.

Zoës Kitchen is the newest culinary addition to the Southwest Plaza mall and really delivers as a Mediterranean fast casual spot. It has a very similar feel to a Garbanzo but is laid out a little different. Instead of walking down a line where they assemble a plate in front of you, you place an order at the register, take a number, and they bring you your food in a timely manner. 

 My fiancé and I got the chance to do a pre opening taste test of menu items and we didn&#39;t taste one thing we didn&#39;t like. My personal favorites were the steak kabobs and the spinach rolls which I will rave over, ugh, I mean review for you all. 

The steak medallions were marinated very well, and cooked to a very nice medium well. Even for being a relatively cheaper cut of steak it was tender and very flavorful. No leather here. It came with a side of broccoli that was very nice and rosemary red potatoes that were seasoned very well and both crispy and fluffy. 

THOSE SPINACH ROLLS THOUGH.....dude. WOW. They were delicious. Spinach cooked down to perfection, just the right amount of cheese, and a crispy dough!!!! I could eat it every single day. If you go check this place out do yourself a huge favor and get an order of those bad boys. You can like my post to thank me lol. 

If you find yourself with a little rumble in your tummy as your doing some shopping, swing by Zoës, grab some spinach rolls, say hi to Mike Noble for me, and enjoy yourself some delicious Mediterranean eats."

It&#39;s definitely worth the wait. The steak kabobs were very tasty and the Mediterranean Baked Feta was outstanding. The chicken was seasoned well. The service was efficient and friendly.

Stopped in a few weeks ago for the lunch buffet whole in the are and was blown away by the yummy options. Many I have never had before. I have gone out of my way to come back several times since and the offerings change each time. Love that! Plus the best Chai tea I have had. Some of my new favs... Cashew Paneer, Lamb rice with ginger, fish vindaloo and a tangy ginger vegetable dish I can not recall the name of. 

The staff was full of smiles and very welcoming each time we have been in and they remembered us from our previous visits.  I&#39;m trying to stay away for a few weeks so I don&#39;t burn it out but I really could eat here again today!

Really convenient location right on off HWY 36, 120th and Wadsworth. Worth the trip.
If you love Indian food bookmark this place and plan to stop by. You will thank me!"

We called ahead, were told our order would be ready just after 1 and then waited, waited, waited . . . along about 1:25 we said something and then there was a scurry as servers grabbed some of our items off of the buffet line (and that meant one of our items was cold and not spiced as we ordered it). Then we got home and discovered another of items had been substituted and wasn&#39;t what we ordered! When we called they said immediately (no pause or checking anything), &#34;No, you ordered wrong. Anyways, we gave you a thing of sauce so just mix it together and then it will be the same as what you ordered.&#34;

If we ordered wrong, why would they give us this sauce solution without our mentioning anything . . . Also, how do you have an answer for our &#34;wrong item&#34; all ready already, without checking the order or discussing it further? Finally, even if we DID order it wrong, this is a pretty not-service-oriented answer to give. UGH.

We&#39;ll never go back for lunch and we may take a break for awhile anyways. Too bad."

Now they don&#39;t deliver though. I&#39;ve had several of their entress and my daughter and I tried their lunch buffet because after reading the reviews, it seemed they had better reviews than Mini India.

Chicken Korma- it was okay and some flavor to it, but not as good or creamy as mini indias.

Chck Tikka Masala - this was pretty good and is equal to as good as others I&#39;ve had.

Strawberry Lassi - this was good, not complaints here.

Chicken Curry - not bad, but not memorable.

The total buffet that I did have during lunch time, didn&#39;t include any of the above that I previously had in the past, and was an utter disappointment and we went around 1130am. Everything was pretty stale and empty and I will never go back again.  I think I do prefere Taj or Mini over this place."

I will have a boner the size of a skyscraper for days after this meal; I will need to consult my physician. This was literally THE GREATEST Indian meal of my entire life, and I will probably dream of it weekly for the rest of my days. Every single bite induced eye-rolling mouthgasms. We have already planned to return next week, and have even discussed ordering 3x as much to just freeze and horde in our freezer (we live 2.5 hours away). 

We started with the vegetable samosa and onion pakora as appetizers. The tamarind sauce and mint chutney was delicious. The onion pakora was awesome, like an Indian bloomin&#39; onion. The samosas were very flavorful and fresh. 

I had shrimp tikka masala spicy level 3, which was perfect for wanting a little spice and heat without burning your tastebuds off or sweating from the face. The sauce was SO flavorful; really complex and perfectly spiced. I could drink it with a straw. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the rice was great as well. 

Now for the naan....Jesus take the wheel. I&#39;m pining after the garlic naan. Usually I am a cheese naan girl (we got both), but Zaika&#39;s garlic naan is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I have never had such savory, garlicky, buttery naan. If I could use their fluffy naan as a comforter, I would have a slumber party with it and then devour it in the morning. Amazing amazing amazing. 

We finished with those delightful little &#34;cake&#34; balls in syrup (I won&#39;t even try to spell the name) and they blew my mind. They&#39;re like little soft pancake planets soaked in warm, delicious syrup and sprinkled with coconut. Balls it was good. 

In summary, this was truly the most satisfying and mind blowing Indian meal I have had in my entire existence, and to boot, the staff is prompt and friendly and the restaurant is beautiful and tidy. I will be back again. And again. And again x3918374929."

We usually like Jewel of India for Indian date night but some friends invited us for a double date and we are glad we agreed! The place has a newer, more modern decor and feel than the usual Indian restaurants we have tried, and it is much larger than it looks from the outside. 

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was great. The staff was attentive and wonderfully pleasant! Each and every person we encountered at the restaurant went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience. 

Based on the service alone I would have given this place a 4 star rating but the food won on its own, from the onion pakora we started with to the garlic naan to the carrot pudding. And the entrees knocked it out of the park. The lamb vindaloo was delicious with the perfect amount of spice and the Saag Paneer was awesome!!

We definitely will be back here!"

I stopped coming here any more but had cravings for Indian food and thought it might be better after all. Today it was my bad experience. As usual entered Waited for food. Most of the food was empty no chicken is chicjen cream curry, no tandoori, no Mutton. I waited patently and once the food arrived I saw the pakodi was fried with big lumps and the naan was so thick that I could feel the dough inside uncooked. I asked the waiter very smoothly they said they were busy and they have to understand that they are very busy. I was unsure what to say for that answer. I camly finished my food and paid the bill. I decided that was my last visit. I feel customer satisfaction is the most important part of business. Hope you improve on that and also food. Thanks for serving us."

The owner walks around, fills guests&#39; water glasses, cleans up tables, and talks to all of his guests. To me, this shows pride and ownership. He really cares about his restaurant, his food, and his guests! I had a really long conversation with him tonight and he&#39;s a great guy! His wife and son helps out in the restaurant and you can definitely see the love and support they have for each other.

If you can take the heat/spice, get it spiced up, it makes it that much better.  Unfortunately, my 3 year old has caused us to downgrade our taste buds to a mild for now, but it&#39;s still awesome!  

Last, service/management is top notch!  They REALLY care!  There was a hiccup in a recent order and they handled it very professionally!  What they offered was above and beyond my expectations!

The buffet was the usual collection of suspects: rice, biryani, 1 fish and 2 chicken curries, tandoori chicken (which was not traditional, but strangely nice...), and some deconstructed blooming onion. Most were luke warm, some were cold. All were thin and watery.

It was generally good and the atmosphere was on the higher end. The service was speedy. As a vegetarian, I wanted to try a thali (mixture of lots of items) but since they didn&#39;t have a veggie thali, I had to settle for a couple of entrees and a chaat starter. The paneer makhni was good and about what I&#39;d expect from BritInd for a 4-out-of-5 spicy. My advice is to stay away from the kulfi (they called it Indian ice cream): it tasted a bit dishwatery. 

Good news is that the place was basically empty on a Saturday evening so I doubt it ever gets busy. It wasn&#39;t a great Indian place but I would like to go back to try their lunch buffet (which is apparently every day except Sunday when they&#39;re closed all-day)."

The first visit we came we had the vegie samosas, chicken tikka masala and nan. Since then I can&#39;t get myself to try anything else because I crave the chicken tikka masala for days after having it.  The chicken is so tender and the spice level 3 is just hot enough for excitement but not so much that it burns off your taste buds and you can&#39;t taste anything else. The nan is so fluffy it&#39;s like eating a buttery cloud. There&#39;s really not much else to say.  It&#39;s great alone but better drenched in the masala sauce which I could drink it&#39;s so delicious.  

If the food wasn&#39;t enough to make us come back, the service would be. From the moment we walk in the door we never feel as if we&#39;ve been forgotten. Are water glasses are always being filled and multiple people check on us during the meal,  not just the 1 server assigned to our table.

When they first opened I was thrilled that Broomfield finally had an Indian restaurant. After we went I was terrified it would close and I would never be able to eat this delicious food again. Thankfully other people took notice! 

I am a vegetarian and have tried pretty much every dish I can. The tandoori veggie Shaslik is so flavorful. However, the Kauli Manchurian is the BEST food I have ever eaten. It is an appetizer but we&#39;ve ordered it as an entree before. The spice level is pretty accurate to what you request. I&#39;m a medium+ and I get just the right amount of kick. 

At first I thought the prices were a little high but I think they accurately reflect the quality of the food. We typically order take out but dining in is a nice date night option. Nickel St. has a surprising number of delicious restaurants and Zaika is top notch."

I was very impressed with the quality of items on the buffet.  This particular day, they had chicken vindaloo, chicken curry, chicken tikki masala, onion pakora, aloo zucchini, a curry using black lentils, and tandoori chicken.  

They were continuing to refresh the buffet, even towards 1:30 PM.  The onion pakora was cooked very well and held up on the buffet line.  The chicken dishes were spiced appropriately, especially the vindaloo, though I was slightly disappointed that potatoes weren&#39;t present in the dish.  The raita had generous shavings of vegetables and served as a nice fire hydrant for the spicier dishes.

The only disappointing part of the visit was the iced chai.  It lacked flavor and had no notes of cinnamon or any other aromatics.  Definite worth a visit if you&#39;re nearby."

Zaika is as good as it gets for Indian restaurants in Denver. Everything about my dinner experience was top notch. The prices were reasonable, the service was notably excellent, and the food was exquisite. 

I was dining with a group of six, so we ordered a whole bunch of food and shared it around the table family-style. Of all the dishes that we sampled, the Lamb Vindaloo was my personal favourite, but the lamb curry was also amazing. The fish makhni was a big hit around the table, and of the starters that we tried the Kauli Manchurian was the most delicious of a group of delicious dishes.

Our friends had ordered the veggie dumplings before we arrived. They were steamed and in the style of Mongolia. Definitely a different style than what you find in most Indian restaurants but very good. I also ordered the samosa of the day. Spicy and topped with garbanzo beans it tickled the taste buds. 

For the main I ordered goat curry, the hubs got chicken tikka masala, our friends ordered the chicken coconut curry which I forgot the name of and lamb vindaloo. 

The goat curry had an excellent sauce with the goat tasting like goat and as it turns out isn&#39;t something I will probably eat again. The hubs chicken was amazing as was my friends vindaloo. Which was so spicy I literally turned bright red after one bite. 

The garlic naan was the best I have ever had. So good that after we inhaled the first order we promptly ordered another.

My chicken tikka was nothing short of glorious. Cut each piece easily with my fork and seriously wanted to take a bath in the yoghurt, ginger and garlic sauce.

Fresh hot naan is served to your table which is a nice touch.
I wish the food was a bit spicier, but I also have a high tolerance for spice and I understand why this is not so possible.  The food is very flavorful however, so I don&#39;t miss the spice too too much.

Our household loves Indian food - when we moved here two years ago from NYC, were sad to leave our favorite Indian place behind. Zaika has given us a taste of what we&#39;ve been missing all this time! We tried a bit of all the basics - an Indian food litmus test, if you will. The veggie samosas were great, the garlic naan was on point, the onion pakora was delectable, and the saag paneer and chicken tikka masala entrees exceeded our expectations.

I am not sure if our server knew it was our first visit, but she gave us a complimentary roll as well as cake dessert. I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting that!

The food is definitely 5 star worthy! We got the cream cheese wontons and egg drop soup to start. The cream cheese had a really rich flavor and was perfectly fried with a side of sweet and sour. We ended up ordering the teriyaki shrimp which was delicious as the shrimp was very moist and large accompanied with peppers and onions. The spiderman and dynamite rolls were also AMAZING. Everything tasted real fresh and the flavors were perfect together.

I have been to this restuarant mutiple times now and it&#39;s been better each time. 

This last time, I ordered a moo-shu vegetable, which they don&#39;t even have that on the menu. Chef came out told us that it&#39;s not on menu here, but knew how it was done, he went back made the best moshu and gave me hoisin sauce.

You would not think much of the place driving up to it, but inside its very nice and can hold a fair amount of people.  We tried a lot of food, Miso soup, Drunken Noodles, Lo Mein both with chicken and different types of sushi (Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail.  The sushi was very fresh and tasted great. The menu portions were more than adequate.  Drunken Noodles had some heat, but  not too much and we did not specify so those that order may want to ask for more spice.  Service was very good, but we did go at a non standard time so it wasn&#39;t crowded, but there was a steady stream of people.  5 Star review is based on expectations and overall similarity to other places of this type along with the quality of the food."

Date of Visit: 2/17/16

While searching for pre-movie eats in the area, my friend and I came across JP Nori. The solid reviews and pictures were worthy of a test run, and we were pleasantly surprised.

The decor is pretty typical of most casual sushi joints (a bit tossed together), but nevertheless, the place had a relaxed, fun vibe, with cushy booths, and it was *clean* (+1 star). They have a killer Happy Hour with quite a few specialty rolls, apps, and adult beverages for under $5. We went with the Spicy Yellowtail, Spicy Salmon, Combo, and Monkey Brain. Don&#39;t worry about what&#39;s in the last two - Just order them. 

While this might not be a Michelin star type spot, anytime you add fresh, flavorful sushi with solid presentation and friendly service - You&#39;re a 5 star joint in my book."

Yaki Udon- which are absolutely delicious
Tuna Roll- very fresh and well made
Pad Thai- best I&#39;ve had in Denver 
Chicken Gyoza- great appetizer
Crap cheese wontons- crispy and perfect

I don&#39;t know how we haven&#39;t ended up here before, like other Yelpers, I have great things to say. The ambiance is perfect, very authentic with high end decor. And not gonna lie, I also was digging the lightly playing pop music.

We were greeted right away, they were somewhat busy on a Sunday night. Once we sat down we browsed the menu and decided what we wanted and it took a few minutes before someone greeted us. 

Our appetizer seemed to be taking a very long time, someone brought edamame and apologized about the wait, without us saying anything! I was very impressed that the staff took ownership and made things right. The gyoza was outstanding when it arrived. The sushi was also extremely fresh and everything had a wonderful flavor. 

For 3 specialty rolls, gyoza, and 2 orders of nigiri (no drinks) our bill came to about $55 before tip, not bad at all. I would highly recommend this place for a good date night!"

I went for Lunch with my friend.  We are the only patrons at that time since they just opened their doors.  It was about 11:10hrs ish.

The one thing that catches our eyes are the BUDDHA that is the Largest item we have seen in a Sushi Restaurant on Colorado Soil.  The Décor is modern.  Even our Booth seats are covered with Chinese/Japanese writings what nots...  

From their extensive Menu, I ordered these following items :

*  Regular Baby Octopus ($7.95)
*  Snow Crab ($5.95)
*  Amaebi aka Sweet Raw Shrimp ($5.95)
*  Unagi ($4.45)
*  Wasabi Tobiko ($3.95)
*  Tamago ($3.50)
*  Kaibashira aka Scallop ($4.50)
*  Spicy Scallop ($4.75)
*  Tai aka Red Snapper ($3.95)
*  Black Tobiko aka Black Caviar ($3.95)
*  Squid ($3.95)
*  Octopus ($3.95)
*  Surf Clam ($3.95)

If I am NOT mistaken, my friend ordered these for her Lunch :

*  Drunken Noodle with Beef option ($9.95).

  Since its Lunch, her Lunch Combo also include an Egg Roll, a Soup and Salad.  My friend also ordered some Roll.  If I am NOT mistaken, it was the Spiderman Roll ($12.95).  This Roll comes with Soft Shell Crab, Spicy Tuna, Mango, Avocado, Cucumber wrapped with Soy Paper and drizzled with Eel Sauce.  The Soft Shell Crab is FRIED.  My friend like her Lunch, though she wish, her order of Drunken Noodle could have been more Spicier for her taste bud.  She also liked her order of Spiderman Roll.  As long as my friend is happy, I am happy too.

  When I get the chance to eat one of the Spiderman Rolls, personally it was a tact too sweet maybe due to the Eel Sauce and the Mango that they put in the Roll.  Overall the presentation of the Roll is pretty to look at.

  The Highlights of my Lunch was the order of Regular Baby Octopus.  NOT many establishment on Colorado Soil offer those Baby Octopus.  I wish I could have many more of those Baby Octopus.  My friend like it too, when she eats it.

In terms of the service its stellar with 5 stars.

  Sushi/Nigiri was presentable and there are 2 items that they made slightly wrong for my personal taste bud.  The Amaebi Shrimp Heads were fried with Batter which was slightly too thick in texture for my liking.  Then for the Squid Nigiri, inside it, they put some Bitter Leaf I think it was Shiso Leaf that I don&#39;t fancy.

  During our Lunch, and the conversation we shared with our lovely staff, she brought out a Complimentary Dessert of Mochi Ice Cream.  She said since it was my Birthday, the Kitchen staff prepared those for me.  After our Lunch, I spoke to the Sushi Chef and the kitchen staff.  They are willing to make to order what I like, or do not like the next time I come here to JP Nori.  All in all it was a Successful Birthday Lunch and we don&#39;t mind returning when needed.

Thank you JP Nori staffs.  See you soon.

Left JP Nori about 13:10hrs ish, stuffed with happy tummy and my Sushi fix.  *Smiling Ear To Ear*

The talkative sushi chefs will not leave you bored sitting at their bar. They may even try to lure you into buying the last two sea urchins. 

Looking at the menu you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised that there&#39;s not a roll over $13 and some of the staple rolls like a philly or rainbow roll are about $1 less than most places.  

Take one of their recommendations. Our guy made a roll that he invented with seared tuna over a blow torch. That&#39;s right people - see the photos. It was like watching an artist put together his final piece for a show. Layer upon layer he continued to add decor to the roll until it was go all ready to consume. I wanted to invent a word for the flavor explosion in my mouth. I didn&#39;t want it to stop. Flavor explosion, keep going keep going. Another bite - WHAAAABAAAAMM.  It was something like that. A symphony meets dynamite. 

My wife is smacking her lips at this point because her belly is soooo happy and she loves me sooooo much because I take her to sushi for our date night. 

Moving on to some other rolls they recommended and concluding with a treat they delivered spread out like a piece of art on a plate - mochi. I LOVE mochi. Ironically it took 2 sushi chefs and 1 host to explain what it was before we decided to have them bring it out. &#34;It&#39;s like sushi rice ice cream.&#34; &#34;Yeah, like rice paper and mango ice cream.&#34;  I was expecting a piece of nigiri with ice cream being the top but it&#39;s mochi boys. &#34;MO-Chee.&#34;

Mochi me next time my new friends. I will be coming back."

I ordered delivery because they mailed me a flyer, but it had been damaged by spilled coffee . Turns out the free delivery was only 3 miles, so there was a $4.00 delivery fee. I ordered 2 sesame chickens with fried rice ($1.95 extra) and 2 egg rolls. Food arrived, gave $5.00 tip to the driver. $27.40 total. 

Turns out, I only got one dinner!  They did include a hot &amp; sour soup. ( I HATE that soup) and a &#34;salad&#34; that had plain lettuce and carrots. 

I called back...the lady said I confirmed one dinner when I made the order. Nothing they can do now. I hung up on her. 

I looked at the bill...found an undisclosed $3.00 tip added. 

Let&#39;s see...$4.00 delivery 
                   $2.00 extra for rice
                   $3.00 undisclosed tip
                   $5.00 tip to driver

                   $14.00 extra for 1 bowl of chicken.

Everyone was super friendly, inciting and welcoming; from the host to the servers to the sushi chefs. Everyone had a smile on their face and was happy to have us there. 

We had chef Simon prepare our lunch. From the salmon, yellowtail, toro, eel sashimi it was all fresh and really good. 

We also ordered the heart attack - that wasn&#39;t our favorite but I can see how others would enjoy it. 

Yummy roll- that was actually pretty tasty.

Not are if I got this name right but it was something like 2 in 1 spicy roll- that was also very good.

The chefs were all friendly and made us feel comfortable. We noticed a lot of locals here- they know each other on a first name basis;so that&#39;s saying  something. You always want returning customers.

This second time we ordered delivery. Everything came as promised no mistakes and the wait time wasn&#39;t all that bad. My two complaints however are that the wontons were under cooked. They tasted almost stale. The Mongolian beef even though it had great flavor there were literally about 10 small slicked of steak and A LOT of onions. It is not worth the price. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour really a very bland broth. The chicken pad Thai was good but again very little to no chicken. 

In the end we still stick to ordering sushi and most likely eating at the restaurant."

When I saw that it was doing really well in the review department I thought &#34;Even Better!!!&#34; And when Ty and I finally made it in I was pretty darn happy with what we were served. 

Before I go on however, I must issue a disclaimer: The server reminded us that the lunch special of three rolls (limited selection) for 12.00 with soup and salad was still going on. I&#39;m not sure if the rolls with this special and both my husband and I felt that they seemed a bit small. Still for three rolls plus soup and salad, I didn&#39;t feel cheated. 

Alright, moving on. We ordered a bunch of sashimi and the portions were generous and prices where fair. Presentation with an orchid flour: beautiful. 

We order the Spicy 2 in 1 and liked it although I&#39;m A heat freak and wished it could have been a little spicier. Other heat freaks will understand the crazy looks you get when you declare this at a table full of wim- I mean people with a more delicate palate. 

Service: prompt and attentive without beating you over the head. Oh! And I guess it was really cold in there because of an AC issues. I thought it was fine and I was in short sleeves. They gave us tea on the house by was of apology. I thought it was really sweet of them. Our server was funny and teased us good-naturedly about how much we ordered and finished. Is it bad that a 5&#39;4 120lbs girl can put away almost as much as her 6&#39;2 190lbs husband? Please say no.  

Decor: Gorgeous! The little falling lights were a nice touch. The bar is pretty and I think it would be nice to sit there for lunch. 

Sushi: some good, some great here. Again, not sure if that had to do with ordering off the lunch menu. I want to go back and order for dinner and see what&#39;s up. 

All in all, I liked it enough to become a regular, they&#39;re close to me and they deliver. That deserves four stars from me."

I understand now why it has so many great reviews. My husband and I happened to be in the area and stopped in for a quick lunch. Service was the star here. Waitstaff were ON IT from the time we walked in until the time we left. There were people running food for other tables while those servers were busy with other tables, and I really appreciated that flow. The presentation is the other star. The sushi was presented beautifully - I actually got my specialty roll in a sort of Valentine&#39;s Day heart formation, which made me giggle. The tempura was also stacked into a pretty little teepee, and there were fresh flowers on the table, which was an added bonus in my opinion. Everything was very clean and well-presented. Now for the food: the fish and rolls were very fresh, which is ALWAYS appreciated at a sushi establishment. We got some spicy edamame and the tempura shrimp and veggie appetizer, and the batter was nice and light, but the flavor was a little off. The dipping sauce they gave us just tasted like watery miso broth. My Van Roll was the one that came out looking spectacular, and it was tasty, but needed more crunch, like a crisp vegetable texture or panko. My husband got the lunch special, which included soup, salad, and 2 rolls. He got hot and sour soup, which he said was okay, and the Philadelphia Roll and Spicy Tuna rolls were very fresh and tasty. I would probably come back here if I was in the area, especially for the service, but sushi, I&#39;d stick with my favorite spot, which has yet to be beaten in flavor."

They gave us free dessert which was nice. The fried monkey brains thing is tiny! Its only like two rolls cut in half to make four little pieces - not worth $6 - such a waste of money. I ended up having to get another roll because usually I fill up on appetizers but that was barely an appetizer - more like your friend letting you pick off a couple pieces from their plate.

I have had sooooo many bad sushi experiences at &#34;highly rated&#34; suburban joints that I am skeptical about trying anything new. But I was feeling brave one night and gave it a try. Have been back a couple times since, to see if everything would be consistent. It was!

The music is well chosen and not too loud--sometimes EDM, sometimes current pop mixed with 60s pop. The ambiance and build-out are perfect for the suburbs. The service is team-style and friendly. The patrons run the gamut: Japanese couples, single white male hipsters sitting at the sushi bar, middle-aged suburbanites, and 20-something African American girls.

So that leaves the food: super fresh, some things you won&#39;t get at every other sushi restaurant, and satisfying. We&#39;ve tried many rolls and salads. The chef always sends something &#34;extra&#34;: a little salad, or dessert. 

The only misses so far are the soups, which are uninspiring and not hot enough, and the mai tai cocktail, which was mostly juice and too sweet. (The house hot sake is perfectly balanced, though.) Give this place a try!"

Spicy tuna roll, Spicy 2 in 1 roll and Toro sashimi. We are participating in the whole life challenge and are not able to eat white rice or soy sauce as well as tempura.

We love that we are greeted by the hosts as we walk in the door. Everyone that works here is super friendly, warm and welcoming. They honestly make you feel like you are family. We always sit at the sushi bar because we love to talk to the sushi masters and watch them create their beautiful creations. Simon and Andrew are both awesome chefs that offer great recommendations as well as answer any of our questions about the wonderful food they are serving. They also have great senses of humor which makes our meals fun and they are also very creative with the dishes they serve. They are always offering delicious complimentary samples of different items on their menu for our tasting pleasure. Everything we have ordered has been outstanding. Quality is the real deal. Fish is fresh and top notch. Awesome sashimi and nigiri, great selection of rolls too. No matter what we order it is always of good quality, well prepared, beautifully presented and super fresh. The prices are definitely fair and reasonable for such awesome fare. The ambiance is very nice and the service is prompt, respectful and welcoming. Victor is a great host. 

Bottom line, this restaurant is trying to expand people&#39;s perception of a plain ole sushi joint and their sashimi and nigri stands out more than anything. If your idea of great sushi is simply spicy tuna and California rolls, do yourself a favor and come here to expand your mind. They have tons of fresh and exotic fish and all dishes are beautifully executed and presented. If you want a versatile menu where you can order a mix of a good roll or two, with tasty sashimi and some great non-sushi entrees, this is the place to go.

FOOD - the fish used in the sushi was very Good and the rolls were flavorful and a bit different (green roll = very tasty) than your average strip mall sushi joint.

SERVICE - overall the service was great - friendly and attentive. 
AMBIENCE - seeing that this place is in a kinda shady strip mall (see Toad Tavern) my expectations were very low but surprisingly it is very nice inside and comfortable. And Thumbs up the biggest Buddha I have ever seen in a sushi joint !

Great food, service, and they just gave us free sushi! From the outside it seems like a cheap Chinese restaurant, but when you get inside it is nicer than a lot of others in Denver. The service is just as good if not better that many others I&#39;ve been to in Denver."

I was mostly wrong. The sushi was good, very well done. The fish quality was good and their specials were way beyond what I expected: the uni was excellent, the toro was outstanding, the halibut fin was delicious. What wasn&#39;t so great was our waiter. I arrived later to meet my friends, who has already warned me that the place was packed, so I was ok with waiting for service. Overall the guy was rather busy but as the restaurant started clearing out and there were very few tables left it wasn&#39;t as if we suddenly got more attention. The waiter tended to us inattentively, taking plates away with food still on them, not checking our order (we ordered two orders of two types of nigiri sushi and he had to be asked). After we had been talking and finishing up our waiter came to us and informed us that they close at 10, thus he has to drop our check. Of course it was 5 after 10, we had been finishing up eating and were almost ready to go, yet the fact that the waiter wanted to rush us out the door was very rude. Of course, the moment the waiter was able to pick up the check and his tip we never saw he, yet the table still sat with all of our plates on it.
So, all in all, a 4 for food as the quality was close to what you&#39;d get at some better sushi restaurants in town, and a 2 for service, as the waiter could have been so much better, which averages a 3 overall."

One negative: the drink I ordered was mostly ice, in a very small (not suitable) glass, and wasn&#39;t made well. It was a mango margarita...

Their pizza, cheesey bread and ranch are all superb. Very reasonable prices too. Like many pizza places they sometimes forget some of the sides or mix up the soda we order, but that&#39;s not an issue.

This place had high reviews so therefore I had high hopes- my husband called up to get the prices since there wasn&#39;t any on the menu (my number one pet peeve) why wouldn&#39;t the prices be on the menu??? Anyway we found out they only offer 2 size pizzas a large or x-large so we went ahead and ordered an all meat, a sausage and  the chicken with sundried tomato pizza can&#39;t remember the name of it. My husband was told that we were 1 mile out of the delivery radius and the pizzas would be ready within 20minutes. No problem he didn&#39;t mind picking them up however when he got home with the pizzas I was extremely disappointed by the topping situation they were very stingy with the toppings like literally 3 small pieces of mushroom on the entire pizza and no sundried tomatoes at all.
The all meat pizza was a joke I have never seen so little meat on a pizza very disappointing because the overall taste of the pizzas was good had the toppings been more generous I wouldn&#39;t of had any complaints. We sucked it up because it would of meant my husband going back out to return them and pick up new ones and with 3 very hungry children it just wasn&#39;t worth the hassle."

The lady at least apologized but could only guess that you were closed as you were not answering your phone.  

One may have a great product, but if the customer service and communication is lacking, it will not end well.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I called over 15 times to see if I could get through as I enjoy your product.

It&#39;s really a takeout only sort of spot, as the interior only has two small tables for a total seating capacity of five. 

What they lack in ambiance they make up for in pizza. Prices are reasonable, and the ingredients are clearly fresh and top notch. My first visit here I went with an 18 inch pizza that was half 5280 (with fresh jalapenos) and half Spinach Feta. They were both delicious but my preference leaned slightly towards the 5280. 

The 18 inch is pretty massive, and dinner for two resulted in us being completely full with 3 1/2 leftover (large) slices. 

The workers were very friendly and clearly enthusiastic about making a great pizza. I will be a repeat customer."

We dined in.  The price was exceptionally cheap and tbh Id tell the brothers who own this place to raise them, its worth it.  We stood at the counter for a bit as they were in the back working on taxes.  Thats ok, they are a young business and working out the kinks.  We ordered a 14 inch pep sausage pizza that was delicious and cheap.  We ate there at one of the 2 (yes 2) tables.  No Parmesan available at that isn&#39;t acceptable in a pizza place.

However, the brothers were very friendly, very helpful and were very inquisitive if we liked their product, which we did.  I thought overall, this place has a great plan and great food, but just needs to step it up a bit.  

Ill go back and review when they have been in business longer but I have high hopes for them."

Overall verdict...4 stars!  Great toppings! Really fresh and very tasty!  Crust was good but by the time we got home it was a little chewy...i&#39;m sure it would have been better if we would have eaten it there.  The sauce was really good and not too sweet or bitter...just right.  Only complaint was that there were very little mushrooms...very little.  Price point was ok...$34 for two pizzas...average i guess for Parker.    

Very good pizza with great service from the workers there.  Very friendly guys that made you feel like a regular when you walked in.  I&#39;m sure they will have lots of success!"

The two brothers that own the store are basically natives to Colorado (basic meaning moved here when they were under 3, as a native myself it counts). They were wonderful to talk to and my wife and children loved how warming they were. The pizza itself was wonderful. The sauce was obviously genuine in that if it was canned, I would have had heart burn, which did not happen. The flavor, sauce and crust were great! I would recommend them over any pizza place in Parker, the only pizza place in southern Denver that would compare would be Big Bills New York Pizza, which is equally as good. Honestly, great pizza and support local business."
coloradough-pizza-parker,Tim O.,iRvAEdOQvFNIdMLOxkY9Vg,"Parker, CO",0,1,0,0,3,JXqRRtGFKqJNU-hNr12YUA,5.0,2015-03-06,"Coloradough&#39;s perfect combination of pizza and service compelled me to write my first Yelp review (I know, I&#39;ve caught up to 2007). We stumbled upon this place almost a year ago due to their early positive Yelp reviews and have been addicted ever since. It&#39;s become our Friday night go-to. 

The pizza is incredible!  Even pizzas that aren&#39;t really my usual type like &#34;The Parker&#34;, a chicken-bacon-ranch masterpiece, are amazing. In fact, I am currently calculating how much farther I would have to run tomorrow if I ate that 4th piece hiding over there in the box.  

But why do we drive by at least 8 other pizza places closer to our house? Why did I buy an insulated pizza bag to keep the pizza warm because they are a little farther than the other guys?  The reason is service like I got tonight.  I realized I forgot my wallet when I was getting out of my car to grab our pizzas. I can honestly say this has never happened to me before so I didn&#39;t really know what to expect. They didn&#39;t just grudgingly agree to let me go with my pizza. They told me not to worry, go home, enjoy the pizza, then give them a call when I had a chance. When I called, they thanked me for doing so and wouldn&#39;t even accept a tip. 

Customer for life. 

The only thing they don&#39;t do, you ask?  Get my daughter to like the pizza. Of course as a 14 year old, the only reason she doesn&#39;t like the pizza is because her parents do so much. Maybe it is a good thing they can&#39;t get her to like it. If she did, I might be worried the pizza was tossed by Satan himself."

We thought of eating in, but when we walked in, realized it was a pretty small place with two tables. Last time we were there, they did ask if we wanted to eat there, so some people must do that.

From the moment we walked in the first time, we were greeted very nicely, and shown the menu, which is the one here on Yelp. They explained all the different varieties of pizza and that they use all local ingredients, including the sausage, which is made from a small Denver-based sausage maker. When they run out of fresh vegetables, they run over to Sprouts and get more.

There are only two sizes we noticed, large and extra large. With great pizza like this, no one needs to order smaller pizza anyway. The prices are incredible given the freshness and local ingredients, and the handmade care they use. I think we paid $16 for their biggest pizza: The 5280, which is a meat-lovers paradise. They don&#39;t overload the toppings, which leads to a great hand-tossed, crispy bottom, with plenty of yum in each bite!

The guys that run the place are super nice. Our daughter likes to pull up a chair and watch them make each pie. The only issue they may have, is they&#39;re getting so popular you need to give them a little extra time at peak hours until they figure out how to manage the high number of orders. But I think any pizza place deals with that at peak hours, and let me tell you, we come from Elizabeth for their pizza, because it&#39;s worth it.

Avoid the chains, and get delicious premium pizza from Coloradough! The only downside...you won&#39;t have a lot of leftovers because it&#39;s too delicious!"

Delivery does take a little longer than most places because there&#39;s usually only a 2 or 3 guys working at a time but it&#39;s worth the wait. They just opened up another location off of Smoky Hill in Aurora that serves the same great pizza I&#39;ve come to expect from these guys."

The pizza- ohhhhh so good. We ordered the 5280 (all meat) sans bacon.  The meat was very good and not overly salty. I asked one of the owners why their pizza was so popular and he told me it was bc of the dough he created. The dough is out of this world. I love pizza and to me there is no such thing as bad pizza, but this dough was noticeably very good. It was crunchy and chewy all at once.

Therefore, my high expectations mixed with abundant pizza tasting experience makes it tough for me to like very many pizza restaurants! Coloradough exceeded my high expectations and I am so happy to have come across this place! Not only is the price incredibly affordable, but the pizza is absolutely phenomenal. Delicious dough, not too much sauce, stringy cheese, and the perfect amount of toppings. And to top it all off (hehehe), they opened a location that is much closer to me than their Parker location, so I will be having much more of their delicious pie :)"

My husband and I ordered a large pizza - half sausage and half Garden of the Gods. The pizza was fresh, extremely tasty, and only $12!
The brother (?) I ordered on the phone with was very nice and friendly, and the brother who delivered was very personable with my husband, telling him that if anything was wrong with the pizza we should call them and they would fix it.

We&#39;ve made the rounds, even sinking so low as to start using Costco&#39;s deep dish pizza to get our fix. After searching Yelp, yet again, we decided to give this place a try. SO glad we did. 

The brothers are personable and entertaining. They made waiting for the pizza to cook an enjoyable experience (coming from someone who hates making small talk with people--big deal!). They even asked us what March Madness game we were interested in and turned the Huge monitor around for us to watch. The crust was light and chewy. The toppings (sausage and black olive, of course) were perfectly proportioned. They even added extra cheese so the sausage wouldn&#39;t dry out. 

Only thing we wish-- served beer and had a better place to sit and eat!

Okay, so it wasn&#39;t deep dish pizza, but it was by far the best thin pizza we&#39;ve had since moving. Actually--unless you&#39;re giving me Rosatis, Coloradough is the best thin pizza I&#39;ve ever had. 100% will be back!"

Had it at the Federal Center at the Thursday Farmer&#39;s Market. I have always been leary about trying new BBQ. But this was P E R F E C T!  

I had the pork sandwich - the meat was moist and flavored just right. The BBQ sauce was sweet and separate so you could add as much or as little as you wanted. The server was so nice and made me feel like family in just those 5 minutes I was getting my food. 

I live in Highlands Ranch, but will definitely be making a trip to Aurora soon to get a bucket to bring home!

One warning though, Bubby&#39;s is from Texas where they normally put coleslaw on the meat (I don&#39;t like that and they didn&#39;t have coleslaw this time) so you might ask if you don&#39;t like that style.

UPDATE: I actually called him after that when I wanted to get bbq while I was in Aurora. He said they don&#39;t have an actual restaurant, but do catering and deliveries. He offered to deliver it to me, but I met him at the DFC next time he was there and brought a few buckets home."

The sashimi was incredible- Big pieces that tasted divine! The rolls were amazing- Las Vegas roll was on special... never had a deep-fried roll before, but it blew my mind! Shrimp tempura roll was good. The rest of my party had pad Thai- that was really good, sesame chicken- got great reviews from my kids, and teriyaki chicken served on the sizzling skillet on a bed of onions- my daughter loved it but I thought it was a little on the plain side.

Cheese wontons were yummy- very crispy and lots of cheese.

They gave me mango ice cream for my birthday dessert,  and that alone made the trip worth it!!

Monday night special was one dollar beer and one dollar warm sake!! (Good beers like tsing Tao and Heineken!)

The atmosphere was fun and modern, and they had lots of cozy spots for privacy.

Had to hunt someone down to ask for drinks. Twice. Ordered drinks and food all at once since we had sat for over 15 minutes w/o anyone talking to us. 15 minutes later we got our drinks. Then had to wait another 10 minutes for soups. Entrees came out after an hour. 3 of 4 entrees were correct, 1 was way off. One was low quality to the point of not being eaten. 

On top of that there was no heat in the restaurant. The guy at the front desk was wearing his coat. We were freezing our butts off. It wasn&#39;t busy, unless it was all takeout orders. One other table on our side, and maybe 3 or 4 booths on the other side.

Between all the issues, they comped nothing. 

I really liked this place 2 years ago, but something has changed for the worst. I think the name has changed slightly recently, so maybe it&#39;s under new management. I miss the old management. I won&#39;t go back until something drastic changes.

Not too pleased with the overall taste of the food. The wonton soup tasted watered down and the fried rice wasn&#39;t very fluffy and flavorful like the other location I go to. Even the shrimp with lobster sauce only had the jumbo shrimp in it and the sauce really didn&#39;t have much flavor to it.

The sushi was very good.  I got the Jacky roll and my friends got the volcano roll.  It was a lot of sushi and nicely presented.

We were seated and given menus and the waiter came and got our drink orders fairly quickly. It was all good up until my food was delivered. I then realized I didn&#39;t have any utensils or chop sticks. It took me 5 minutes to get someone&#39;s attention. Then they disappeared again. Not to be seen until he was about to dump the check off. I told him he were interested in dessert and he pointed to a card on the table that showed 3 desserts. None of them were the ones I had seen pictured on Yelp. So I asked about the fried banana as that&#39;s what my kids would eat and he said he would check on it. Up to the point that our food came, and we had one waiter, our drinks were re-filled, and all was good. After that we had another waiter and the service was not good.

Service was extremely slow and the restaurant wasn&#39;t full at all.  I had to ask for chopsticks and my husband had to ask for a knife.

Even though we are on the outer edge of their delivery zone, the food always comes hot and FAST!

All of the Chinese offerings I have tried are excellent. I had a waiter notice I didn&#39;t eat the green peppers on my Kung Pao plate one evening, and he told me they could leave them off. Not only did they omit them on my next order, but they made up for it by providing more of the other veggies. I was very impressed with that! Their lemon chicken is great-prefect proportion of chicken and crispy breading (not the soggy, doughy stuff you find all too often). I love thie Egg Drop Soup. 

My husband enjoys their sushi (at much better prices than nearby places) and has tried a variety of their selections. The real impressive thing is the artful presentation of thier sushi dishes - the plates are adorned with hand drawn birds,  tiny bonsai-esque trees, or impressive layouts. The dishes are never boring, and is something I have not seen done at all in the metro area."

There were two sushi chefs and they seemed moderately busy at 8 p.m.  When I arrived, there were several groups seated in the dining area, but I was the only person sitting at the sushi bar.

The waitress immediately brought me a menu and took my drink order (water and green tea).  

I decided upon three sushi rolls:  Philly, tempura shrimp and just a plain tuna roll.

The Philly roll was &#34;average to good&#34;.  Good portion of salmon and it tasted good.

The tuna roll was excellent for a basic roll.  The portion of tuna was larger than average and good quality.  A really good value.

Finally, the shrimp tempura roll.  The shrimp was cooked nicely.  Interestingly, the roll had lots of shredded lettuce in it.  It made for interesting and decent texture, but was honestly too much lettuce, making the roll very big in diameter.  Seems like many sushi places are making fancy &#34;mega rolls&#34; lately.  Tip for sushi restaurants.  If I can&#39;t fit a sushi roll in my mouth, it is too big!  I don&#39;t want to be eating sushi rolls with a knife and fork.  Just my personal preference.  I would not order this roll again.

The presentation was very nice and the rolls were served with ample wasabi and ginger.

I will definitely return."

We have visited Sunrise on a number of occasions and have always had good sushi and ok food. The service is inconsistent though.  It can range from having to walk up to the waiter and wait for him to stop flirting with the hostess to get silverware to so attentive that it bordered on stalking.

The main menu is very large and we&#39;ve tried a number of selections and the best I can say is, yes it&#39;s asian food.  There is nothing wrong with it and the portions are generous, but it is also nothing really remarkable.

The Sushi is very good.  They have a traditional menu that is augmented with selections to tempt every palate.  Commonly they experiment with special rolls that bring in exotic flavors.

Let&#39;s boil it down to this, I&#39;m forking over a 4 star rating even with spotty service and average non-sushi selections.  If you like to have sushi for a meal, you have to go.  If you&#39;re not a sushi fan, this place is probably a pass."

We had tried it before and ordered something new - we didn&#39;t like what we ordered, but thought sushi would be a good idea.  The decor is beautiful and the wait staff is very polite and fast.  We ordered several rolls.  

We received our sushi quickly and it arrived on a cool wooden boat, but it appears they only give you 4 or maybe 5 pieces of their specialty rolls, which is a shame because they are pricy.  I commented to my daughter that the sushi smelled fishy.  She said she didn&#39;t smell anything so we ate them.  The rolls were not that good - just ok; we have had much better.  They were not wrapped tightly so when you picked them up, they fell apart.  We ended up using our forks which takes away from the experience of eating sushi.  Our spider roll had a huge piece of lettuce sticking out of it and if you removed it, the whole thing just fell apart.  There was not a lot of rice around the outside - like they were short on rice or something.

We didn&#39;t complain and left our normal 20% tip- the food was not the fault of our waiter and he did a good job.  Before we left, we were given a coupon for $5 off our next visit.  Later that night, we were both very sick to our stomach.  I don&#39;t know if the fish was bad or not, but we were both effected and ate the same thing.  I didn&#39;t call the restaurant, but we won&#39;t be back."

After three visits all of which have offered bad service, I just can&#39;t recommend this place to anyone. 

On the plus side, this is an Asian restaurant with surprisingly nice ambience for a strip mall.  Great detailing like stone walls, ambient lighting and a granite topped bar in the center of the room.  Also a major pro is the food quality.  Yes, you get a lot for your money and some of the dishes are the best I&#39;ve had locally.  I am sure you are wondering why I gave this 2 stars then.

The service is just terrible.  I have eaten here 3 times for lunch and all three times service has been painfully slow.  Despite the fact that only a handful of tables are seated, I have had to wait upwards of 15 minutes to be greeted at my table, another 10-15 minutes for a drink and over an hour for food (each time).  Additionally, I have had to flag waiters/waitresses to the table to have my order taken and pay the bill as they are usually watching television on the plasma TV&#39;s with their backs turned to the customers.  This has happened each of the three times I was there and with three different members of wait staff, so clearly this is more of the norm than the exception during lunch.

The last time I went, I finally had to flag down the waiter 40 minutes after we ordered the food (I kid you not) because nothing had been delivered to the table and he never once came back to check on us or our two children.  He apparently had forgotten to submit our order even though there was only one other table with people in the restaurant.  At that point, we had run out of time so I asked him to submit the order and pack it up as a to-go meal, which he did do, but there was no apology, no attempt to make it right like maybe a coupon for a future visit or a free kids meal for the inconvenience.  So, 1 hour and 15 minutes with nothing but drinks served and a $61 bill for to-go lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids?  Ugggh.  3 strikes and you&#39;re out."

When I had sushi in the restaurant I went for lunch and the place was deserted.  Our server was nice and we had a mango something roll and some kind of hot roll which was deep fried.  Both were very good!!!  My neighbor recommended this place to me so I was looking forward to going.

Tonight I ordered the schezuan beef (not too spicy, but way too many veggies), general tsao chicken and shrimp lo mein (shrimp deveined.....yesssssss!!!!)  for delivery.  The young lady who took my order was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.  Although it took about 45 minutes from placing the order to receiving it, I will NOT complain because it&#39;s twenty something degrees outside, I did not have to get my family out in this weather AND the food was great and delivered hot!  My order was perfect and they even remembered the child chopstick helpers for my daughter. Spent $35, well worth it!  Will definitely be eating here again.

 I tried the asada and the diablo shrimp (the big ones).  I did have to wait, because the diablo shrimp was made fresh right in front of me.  The beans did not seem to add anything but bulk to the tacos.   Having said that, the tacos were still very good.  I got them to go, so I didn&#39;t get to enjoy the restaurant dining room.

The first time I came here it was fantastic. I ordered the &#34;surprise&#34; burrito because I was feeling adventurous and did not regret the decision. The burrito was much better than Chipotle, Qdoba, and Illegal Pete&#39;s. I highly recommend the raspberry salsa. Delicious! So, since I had such a great time I raved about this place and brought my girlfriend a few weeks later on October 22. First, the girl working there wasn&#39;t friendly. I told her we wanted the happy hour menu, and she told us that happy hour was upstairs. We went upstairs, and no one was working at the bar. We waited a long time, and still no one came. We went to tell the girl that no one was upstairs and ask if someone could come up to take out orders. When I told her that the bartender wasn&#39;t up there, she just said, &#34;Well, he should be,&#34; and left it at that. She wasn&#39;t going to do or say anything further on the topic. When I reiterated that he wasn&#39;t, she begrudgingly took us upstairs. When the bartender came, he told us that happy hour wasn&#39;t going on that night. Still not sure why the girl downstairs couldn&#39;t have told us that when we first walked in and why she told us that happy hour was upstairs. She should probably be informed of when happy hour is. 

We both ordered margaritas and burritos. The margaritas were too sweet and not very strong, but they were decent for the price. The burritos were very disappointing, though, after how good they were the first time. Both burritos were totally lukewarm when they came out and not very flavorful. Overall, super disappointed that this place isn&#39;t consistently great. The only positive is that the upstairs seating is open-air and has a cool view of Colfax and the bartender is very friendly."

The menu is simple so I ordered a 3 stack (of veggie tacos), and chips/guac. The food does take awhile because everything is not cooked until you order it, as I did witness this. 

The veggie tacos come with onion, mushroom, green pepper, pico, cheese, and a sauce. They did taste fresh, portion is pretty generous - I basically made 6 tacos since each one comes with 2 tortillas.

The chips are fine, but the guacamole was not cute. It didn&#39;t have flavor and was basically just smashed avocado. 

The motto on the sign here is &#34;if you don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t pay for it&#34;, but when I was asked how everything was, I brought up that I didn&#39;t like the guacamole, but was not offered anything and just told that &#34;it was freshly made&#34;. Just because it&#39;s fresh doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good tbh. I think that sign should be taken down. If I was offered a cup of queso (which I should have ordered instead), all would be good in the hood."

I wanted to just have a couple margaritas and maybe a snack and upon getting up stairs to the bar I walk into something much more. 

The mark down is because I got a non-frozen margarita and it wasn&#39;t that great tasting. I will drink a non-frozen margaritas buy I don&#39;t care for them. Ordered a basket of chips with guacamole. Chips were okay but the cup of guac was was tiny and not enough for the whole basket. 

Now onto what I did like, the infused tequila shots, the FREE dance lesson, the atmosphere and the delicious tacos. I ordered a strawberry and spicey pickle infused tequila shot and both matched what they were infused with. The strawberry one was sweet and bearable while the spicey pickle was hot and sour going down the hatch. 

So apparently on Wednesday they do free dance lessons that last about an hour. The instructor really gets the participants involved by going through the steps a few times before moving on to the advanced moves and then partnered dancing. This made for for an amazing atmosphere abd a chance to build a friendship in the bar.  

After working up an appetite I went down stairs and had a few of their steak and chicken tacos. To my surprise even with the white beans they were bursting with flavor and hit the spot. 

I don&#39;t if your experience will be the same as mine but if you go on a Wednesday night be ready to have a memorable night."

We got shut out of a nearby (closed) Mexican spot and I was craving it bad.  We did a quick search and found Los Tacos.  We were disappointed that we were settling on a place that wasn&#39;t a full Mexican restaurant, but it wasn&#39;t a surprise so we got over it.  We were pointed upstairs for happy hour and there is no doubt the tacos are worth the special price.  They are a tad watery for me, leaving a bit of a breakdown in the middle part of the tortilla unless drained, but the carnitas meat was very flavorful and the rest of the bits compliment it all very well.  Every street taco is different and Los Tacos makes some good ones.  The hand-made margarita is definitely better than the pre-made, without question.  The beer selection is sparse, but some standard locals are on tap.  The open-style upstairs is great.

She Said:

He is always on the hunt for the perfect Mexican food, and I thought we had found it for him with the place up the street. Sadly, it was closed. Happily, Los Tacos was nearby to appease my man. The bartender (name forgotten--I need to take better notes) was fantastic. Friendly. Hard working. Efficient. And he treated us out-of-towners as if we were likely to become regulars, while he treated the regulars like family. The carnitas were quite good. I could have eaten the meat on its own and been content. The beer selection (as noted) is not fantastic, but you won&#39;t have trouble finding something you like. Definitely plan to sit upstairs.

The experience here was just that horrendous from start to finish. 

First, there was a long ass line. Yes, but wait. There is only one cash register and one person tending to it. You can only order your food and a beer there if that&#39;s what you want. A margarita? You must go upstairs. Fine. So I go upstairs and it&#39;s damn near IMPOSSIBLE to get much of anything, not even a &#34;hey, I acknowledge your existence.&#34; There are not enough people working to serve everybody. The blonde was taking her sweet time chatting with people and not doing much of anything except pretending to check an entire stack of IDs. So yeah, pretty lame to have to wait in 2 different areas to get food and drink. 

And the tacos? Not even nearly worth the word &#34;good.&#34; The meat was mushy and gross. They threw on Mexican cheese blend on every one. The only good thing I have to say is that the tortilla was kind of good but nothing outstanding. 

Overall the service was terrible here. And all they could do is make the excuse of &#34;oh yeah, it&#39;s just a crazy night&#34; after I complained about standing and waiting at the bar for half a goddamn hour. That&#39;s not a great excuse, jerks. Bad service is bad service, end of story. Don&#39;t make excuses for it. Or maybe hire some people who are quicker and have more common sense. 

I&#39;m sure the experience is fine here during off hours, but the tacos themselves were pretty lousy. Oh yeah, had a taste of the guac too and it tasted powdery like it wasn&#39;t really made out of avocados. 

I don&#39;t do this 1 star thing too often but I really felt this experience deserved it."

That said, the bar area is loud. Really loud. It&#39;s like a night club with tacos. They do have some fantastic tequila infusions to try and their bartenders are always great. They make one mean margarita and can even do some interesting twists - just ask. My spicy food loving friend says their food is great and reasonably priced.

Unfortunately, many of them aren&#39;t that great, and some are incredibly overhyped (sorry Torchy&#39;s). I&#39;m happy to say that Los Tacos Famous Taqueria is a different story. They have a relatively simple menu, but there&#39;s something for everyone and the prices are very reasonable. You have an option of two taco sizes - the Jr. and regular. I found that two regular-sized tacos and one Jr. taco are more than enough food, even if you&#39;re starving. In fact, next time I&#39;ll probably go for two Jr. and one regular taco instead.

All of their tacos come in a double corn tortilla (I think they&#39;re grilled, which adds to the flavor and also makes them less dry) and are jam-packed with delicious ingredients. On my first visit, I tried the Veggie, Pescado and Diablo Shrimp tacos, and all of them were absolutely fantastic. In particular, I was surprised by the Veggie taco, as I didn&#39;t expect it to have as much flavor as it did. It was filled with caramelized onions, green peppers, mushrooms, pico de gallo, white beans and shredded cheese. Yummy! Both the Pescado (fish) and Diablo Shrimp were excellent, as well. Diablo Shrimp had some kick to it, but wasn&#39;t overbearingly spicy, which is totally fine with me. The person who took our order (I assume it was the owner) was also very friendly and helpful. I&#39;m definitely looking forward to coming back, especially to check out their happy hour and the patio/bar upstairs."

My hubs and I went on a weekend for a quick lunch.  We wanted to try something new and both of us had passed this &#34;new&#34; taco spot.  Let&#39;s just say that we are suckers for tacos.  And, as such, have pretty high expectations.

We each ordered three.  I went with the pork, chicken, and shrimp.  I don&#39;t recall what my hubs ordered.  We were the only people on the ground level (perhaps there were more upstairs?), and we were helped by one employee.  He took our order/payment, cooked up the food himself, and delivered it to us at our seats.  He was friendly, and the food arrived as ordered and fairly quickly, considering it was a one-man job.

Bottom line: these tacos just don&#39;t compare to others in the area.  They were decent.  I felt like the meat was a little overcooked.  And the pork and chicken was just too dry.  Even drenching it in salsa/sauces didn&#39;t help.  The tortillas fell apart for both of us, which made eating quite messy.  There was also an advertisement for free chips and salsa at our table.  We brought it up, and the employee informed us it was out of date, but he brought some over to us anyway.  Appreciate the gesture--but maybe your advertising should be more clear.

Another man stopped by as we were cleaning up our table.  Perhaps he was a manager or owner?  He was nice and said thanks for stopping in.  We made small talk for a little bit and he mentioned they had been there for a while now.  They do have some breakfast burrito specials on the weekend and on Tuesdays for Taco Tuesday.  While I love the sound of both of those, I&#39;m just not convinced we&#39;ll be back."

Margaritas were all mix and very little alch. Too tart. Bloody Mary&#39;s were good but we could only have one round because they ran out and didn&#39;t want to make more. They ran out of chips. Blonde lady from the kitchen who was food running was extremely rude and didn&#39;t know what she was doing. Our server was nice but at a loss. Our orders were messed up and took about ten minutes to come out between all of us (there were seven of us and we ordered Jr. tacos.) There was a piece of a metal can in one of our tacos but the server was apologetic and honestly it wouldn&#39;t have mattered except everything else was really bad. The tacos with the can shavings were comped and then we ordered mimosas and the champagne was flat. And the place wasn&#39;t even busy. There were half a dozen people at the bar and then our table.

There&#39;s 2 levels. Dining room downstairs and a bar upstairs. We went up to check it out and the first thing we see is some frat bros playing beer pong. In a restaurant. I was kind of shocked. I&#39;d expect this in a college town but not in Denver. Along with the beer pong bros there was awful EDM blasting and I couldn&#39;t even hear what my gf was saying. 

We went downstairs to eat. Got 4 tacos and some chips and queso. The chips were the best thing we had. They were in house and the queso was tasty. The tacos however were not very good. They fry the tortillas a bit which is fine but there was so much oil on the tortillas that made it unappetizing and messy. Had to use so many napkins. The tacos are huge. They say they&#39;re 1/2 pound tacos which is excessive. There&#39;s just nothing impressive about them. Sort of bland. I didn&#39;t really like any of them and especially didn&#39;t like the chorizo. There was nutmeg or cinnamon in the chorizo that made it taste weird. 

Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back unfortunately."

It totally turned my frown upside down!!!  

First of all, super friendly service. Since they&#39;re new, or just because they&#39;re nice, the bartender Freddy gave us sips of the infused tequilas.... Perfection!!!!  My husband couldn&#39;t stop raving about the Serrano tequila - a week later, he&#39;s still talking about it!  I had strawberry, and it was sweet and perfect, just the way I like it! 

I love the open air concept for when the weather is nice. It&#39;s right on Colfax, but there is something to be said for the cool breeze wafting in, and the sounds of the city life mixing with the tunes they rock in the bar.

The food... I don&#39;t know how else to say it, but they keep it simple, inexpensive, and delicious!!!! You can&#39;t go wrong with that combination.  Honestly, one of the best quesadillas I ever had was in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, two years ago.  It was a simple cheese, steak, and flour tortilla quesadilla, and I still dream about it&#39;s simple perfection today.  I found my simply perfect quesadilla here at Los Tacos in Denver!!! #praise

Ummmm... Forgot to mention, heaven in your mouth only costs $3.50.  I accidentally ate part of my food before I took my picture, but it&#39;s soooooooo filling!!!!! And seriously... $3.50!!?? You can treat your 10 friends to lunch, look like a baller, and not wipe out your checking account!!!!

Two more things.... The restrooms are immaculate, and there are hooks on the wall for purses/coats in the ladies room.  Also.... WORTH FIVE STARS ALONE: FREE PARKING IN THE BACK!!!!!! They share the parking lot with natural grocers, 45 spots during the day, and the entire lot after the grocery store closes. Seriously, how else can you go out in Capitol Hill!?  Parking is SUCH a pain everywhere else. #winning

So anyway... I had a great experience. I absolutely can&#39;t wait to come back!!!!"

Thanks, Groupon, for giving me the incentive to try out a new restaurant that&#39;s now my favorite food hotspot on Colfax.

Los Tacos offers fast-casual (first floor) and regular restaurant dining arrangements (second floor). Since I was on my own for lunch, I chose the fast-casual option, and even though I was notified that the food might take a little longer since it&#39;s all freshly made to order, the wait time was minimal for food on par with the best taco joints in Denver. 

The pollo and pescado tacos were succulent and perfectly flavored (not a given at many Denver taco spots where animal protein options are often on the dry side unless deep-fried) and came with the creamiest Great Northern beans I&#39;ve had the pleasure to scarf. I went with the Jr. Taco size (akin to the street taco portions at Pinche and Torchy&#39;s) but may try one of their mega tacos the next time I&#39;m in.

Just as good as the food were the friendly service and lack of ridiculously long lines. I like Torchy&#39;s and Pinche but am not a fan of the long lines and mediocre customer service. Los Tacos is a gem on Colfax. I can only hope that as it grows in popularity (delicious food? inexpensively prices? great service? how could it not?), I&#39;ll be able to beat back the hungry hordes to grab tacos to go. Thanks for the excellent food and service, Los Tacos! I can&#39;t wait to come back with hungry friends."

The cool, vibrant atmosphere in the upstairs bar area  with open air seating, topped off with multiple hi-def screens and an awesome sound system made for a great night of football!

We ordered the pork burrito and the pork tacos. The portions were large and seemed to have quality ingredients. The meat really was average though in flavor and texture, nothing to write home about. I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of the pinto beans which were in both. 

The salsa was probably the biggest disappointment. If you visit a taqueria in Mexico, you&#39;ll find that the salsa and pickle bar is pretty extensive, full of fresh and spicy salsas and pickled vegetables. Here, we were given two salsas, a mild and a hot/spicy. Neither had any heat and were pretty bland. 

Despite the great service, this place just didn&#39;t live up to the 5 star Yelp reviews we had read. There are so many places that offer a more authentic taco that pack more flavor along Colfax."

While walking upstairs, I thought it odd that I would be ushered away from the food considering that was my key intention of supporting this local business. Instead, I stood, ignored by the seemingly busy bartender (there were only two other people at the bar talking). With his back to me for about 45 seconds, it was clear--business wasn&#39;t happening up here either. I went downstairs to ask the person at the register where I can place my order, and he said, &#34;upstairs, my register is closed.&#34; Really? Three people in the restaurant and no one to take an order for food? Gladly took my business elsewhere. I would advise others to do the same. 

Bland tacos, poor customer care. As Manny B. says, if you&#39;re in Cap Hill you can do better. Dry chicken, unseasoned meat and poor guacamole &#34;spritz.&#34; Save your cash for a business that wants to take it!"

Is $6 a lot for a loaded taco? Sure, but you only need one so it seems like a fair price. There are a ton of places cheaper but they&#39;re either not close or you need 2-3 tacos to leave you as full, which seems to defeat the point. 

The chips and pico were a nice start, and I loved the simplicity in the pico. I would however recommend a separate dish for the pico, it can make the chips really soggy. I&#39;m sure Los Tacos is trying to cater to all palates, but the pico could use more jalapeño. The homemade cilantro sauce too. Both had great flavor, but were just a little too gringo for my taste. The tacos and quesadillas were great and the jalapeño was a nice touch. We&#39;ll definitely go back."

On top of being amazing foodwise, the staff was nothing short of wonderful and welcoming. They addressed me by name, brought me a fork, checked in with me to make sure everything was scrumptious. All the folks I interacted with were very attentive and genuine.

Before I go into this review, I want to be sure that readers know this review is based solely on service- the food itself, especially the drinks, are fantastic. If you need a taco on Colfax, this is it for sure.

The reason I will no longer be visiting this restaurant is because their promotions, sandwich board, menu prices, e-mail blasts, and facebook posts are never honored at the restaurant. Every time I have visited as a result of an e-mail or facebook special, the menu prices and specials have always been &#34;out of date&#34;, &#34;expired&#34;, or for some unknown reason, &#34;wrong&#34;. I read your e-mails, I follow your facebook, and I do NOT appreciate being lied to. Dishonesty about advertised specials can be easily remedied- just don&#39;t advertise them, or honor them when customers ask! If I find a flyer while sitting at your bar that indicates tacos are half off until  8:00 everyday and it is 7:05, I&#39;d appreciate the courtesy of, &#34;well, that&#39;s no longer correct, but I will honor the special since it was our error.&#34; Instead, when we questioned the owner, we were given rude looks, had to ask multiple times, and practically escorted from the establishment as if we were criminals. 

I understand that there can be human errors on busy nights- I get that. But when advertising dishonesty is the fault of the restaurant, customers appreciate respect. Due to the lack of respect at this restaurant, I can no longer support their business, which makes me very unhappy as I believe their business is a welcome and appropriate addition for this block on Colfax."

We had the $3 house margarita which was mediocre at best.  It was very weak and tasted like only ice and mix.

There&#39;s no complementary chips and salsa and the water cups are a tad larger than a shot glass.  Just because I drink water, it doesn&#39;t mean I drink less.  Upstairs in the bar, they don&#39;t refill your water so you have to walk back downstairs and to the back of the restaurant to get refill your 3oz water cup.   

The atmosphere upstairs was neat, but unfortunately it&#39;s on Colfax so be careful with your bike out front.  There are much better places."

I heard Mexican in Denver was good but this really exceeded my expectations. A group of four of us came in for taco Tuesday and we we loved both the deal and the flavor. Between the four of us we sampled the chorizo, carnitas, chicken and best on the menu &#34;secret&#34; taco. Luckily we made a close enough guess on what the secret was to score a free shot of tequila. To top it all off the bottomless margaritas for $15 and free nachos with salsa gave this place in my opinion a five star worthy value."

So here&#39;s the verdict: very Americanized. You can tell from the decor alone. It&#39;s a bit more price wise compared to US Thai. You can also tell when your food comes and you&#39;ve ordered a medium spice level, and the spice is barely detectable. I guess this is subjective though...
I also think the food is much sweeter and saucier than it should have been. All in all, if you NEED thai and it&#39;s an absolute emergency, this should cover your bases. It&#39;s just A-OK. 

What I will say is that this is a bit better than the other thai chains around Denver, just for comparison&#39;s sake."

We dropped in to Thailicious on a whim, and ended up eating two bites of our Pad Thai, paying, and heading up the street for some proper Thai. 

It wasn&#39;t that anything was particularly bad. It was just that the presentation and flavors seemed very catered to customers who aren&#39;t comfortable with the bold, adventurous flavors in authentic Thai food. The Pad Thai was soupy and overly sweet with little-to-no sour tamarind - and garnished with wontons. (?) 

To sum it up in, Thailicious looked and tasted like Thai food for the &#39;burbs. If you&#39;re less adventurous, it might be right up your alley."

The fates aligned and one night when friends wanted to go to US Thai it was closed, so we hunted up another and it was only a 2 block walk - woot!

Our waiter was fabulous - offered suggestions and what the best meat in a dish was and the outcome was nummy for my tummy!

I think their tom kha is the best i&#39;ve had in quite a while. Generally the meat is thrown in as an after thought so the flavor doesn&#39;t meld, they make a fabulous one - however they do it - the flavors go very well together!

I&#39;ve enjoyed the volcano - omg - wow! the skinny chicken larb dish (can&#39;t remeber the name ) was awesome!

We came in around 8:30pm, tired and hungry. Having never been here before, I differed to my friends who had and let them pick a variety of dishes for us to share family-style.

If I were rating on the food alone, this place would get 5 stars, no question. We shared some chicken satay skewers, a fried tilapia, massamun curry, papaya salad, and a stir fry. I would order any and all of it again. The flavors and spiciness levels were on point, and the preparations seemed authentic with other experiences I&#39;ve had (for example, the last time I had a whole, fried fish like this at a Thai restaurant was in Los Angeles). It was a great meal to enjoy with friends.

I have to detract two stars, though, for the service. Our waiter was pretty much comatose, and appeared to be irritated that we were there. We did come in for a late dinner, but it was a Saturday - not too unusual, I think. We had to ask for everything, including basics like rice and water. Lastly, after ordering dessert he came back to our table and informed us that the kitchen was closed and wouldn&#39;t serve us anything else. He didn&#39;t offer to let us change our order to something that doesn&#39;t have to be cooked (ice cream, for example); it was obvious he just wanted us to get out. So we did.

I would definitely come back for the food if I&#39;m ever in the area again; but I would probably get it to go."

This was my second time going and I love their food.

We tried the chicken Satay, shrimp sarong and spring rolls for appetizers. They were all delicious. The peanut dipping sauce is so good I would have liked to use my finger to wipe the ramekin clean but manners manners :)  

For drinks they offer a variety including $2 Sigha beers. Water is served in cool glass bottles and your cups are small tin ones, which may be native to Thailand but unsure. 

The entree I tried was the Thai Smile combo, which is papaya salad, grilled beef and larb, which is minced chicken with vegetables and spices.  It comes with a side of sticky rice and a spicy sauce. It is definitely a lot of food and big enough to share. 

The table has three or four dipping sauces including a fish sauce, hot chili oil and a few others.

The only thing that could have been better was the waiter forgot to bring us water even after a few requests. 

Many of their dishes are gluten free, which is nice."

Kudos to the staff as I&#39;ve seen many people In similar situations turned away. 

I&#39;m a huge fan of Thai food and love the spice, not Gonna beat any natives in a chile eating competition, but I&#39;d give most Bolillos a run for their money. 

I typically go to US Thai up the street because I know they always deliver legitimate Thai heat, but in my ongoing search I tried somewhere new.

We ordered some drinks to get things started and the fish cakes, drinks came out pretty quick but there was a slight snafu with our Appetizer, not a big deal, it was handled. 

Girlfriend had the yellow curry and I opted for the pepper and garlic stir fry. 

I ordered a 3 out of 5 heat level, after the waiter assured me and made some heat comparisons. 

I was definitely impressed, the dish had a great balance of flavor and spice, not overbearing but enough to get your brow a little moist. 

For anyone who doesn&#39;t eat a lot of peppers or spicy fare I would suggest respecting the number scale and staying low, in Thai joints you can always start low and ask for the spice rack, but once you go all in, there&#39;s no going back."

What&#39;s not to like about Thailicious? It&#39;s even fun to say! I find it interesting that the best places are snuggled in to little strip malls that look so lame from the outside, but then behold the glory that is inside.

Very nice selection of food items. Cheap drinks also help matters along. I really like the physical space with it&#39;s decor, style, and grace. Totally perfect for this section of town. It&#39;s easy and delicious and just what the doctor ordered.

Attentive staff. That&#39;s always a good thing. And, I like how they serve water. It&#39;s just so cool. I will most definitely be heading back to get me some yummy Thai food. Pad Thai to the max!"

It seemed like it has been sitting out for awhile. I&#39;m a vegetarian and I know if the vegetables and tofu were done fresh. The tofu had absorbed the color of the sauce when it was served. It only means that it wasn&#39;t freshly cooked. Otherwise the rest of the food were pretty good. The server was friendly, helpful and food came out in a timely manner."

There was only one server so service was extremely slow, however, the food totally makes up for it.  It&#39;s in the name Thailicious is delicious.

My friends ordered the Saturday lunch special which was pad thai with your choice of protein and I had the green curry with chicken.  Their dish came with a side of soup and a fried wonton.  We were also given a choice on how spicy we wanted our dish to be from a scale of 1 to 5; 3 being a nice kick and that is what we all got.  Since mine was a simmering soup dish it most likely brought out more of a kick than theirs.  It was good nonetheless.  However, next time I will definitely tone down the spice level to a two. We also ordered the thai sundae to share and it ended our meal perfectly.  It was a trio of thai tea, green tea, and taro ice cream with assorted fruit jellies."

My girlfriend and I got up early Saturday to run around Sloan&#39;s lake. We ended up running past a little strip mall where Thalicious was located. We ended up stopping in for lunch.

I love that they have lunch specials for every day of the week. We ended up getting the pad thai special. It came with a delicious vegetable coconut soup and wonton. The presentation was just spectacular. Even the water came in cute little metal cups.

I ordered the chicken pad thai with a level 4 of spice. It was the perfect amount of spice. It came in a wonderful little Asian bowl. It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s a lot of noodles but it really is a lot of noodles. I loved it. I had to take over half of it home. Which made for a delicious lunch the next day.

We couldn&#39;t leave without getting an order of the Mango sticky rice. The dish came in a martini glass. It was so pretty we didn&#39;t want to eat it. But eating out of this glass was easier than when we order it from different places because they chop up the mango and give you little seafood forks for eating it. 

It&#39;s all about the little detail.

The service wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d rave about hence the 4 stars. I would love to go back and try their dinner and see how their green curry is. Thailicious is Delicious!"

Popped in yesterday for some accompaniments to the curry I was planning on making;  papaya salad and an appetizer flight. I ordered the papaya salad medium hot. 

The appetizers were lackluster;  the fried egg rolls had very little filling,  the shrimp sarong were greasy and flavorless.  The papaya salad seemed as though someone had just stood over a pile of grated papaya and whispered &#34;flavor&#34;,  as opposed to adding any real ingredients.  Really disappointing,  and expensive;  $20.00 with tip for a weak serving of appetizers and some grated fruit.  I&#39;ll not be back any time soon."

I thought the service was a little lackluster and slow. There were periods of about 10 minutes several times where at least 3 or 4 people had no drinks or needed refills. The restaurant itself wasn&#39;t very busy so you wouldn&#39;t think we&#39;d be ignored as much as we were.

I got the drunken noodles with a heat factor of 4 (out of 5). I actually really liked them and thought the hotness was spot on. A couple of the people at my table got their meals &#34;as hot as you can make it&#34; and both thought it wasn&#39;t hot at all. I didn&#39;t sample theirs to compare them to mine, but since mine had some pretty good heat I wasn&#39;t sure if they were just whining, or it really wasn&#39;t hot.

Regardless, food was good, service wasn&#39;t so good. So a solid 3 star place."

We got the Skinny Noodles with Chicken and Sweet &amp; Sour Cashew with Pork. Both were essentially flavorless. We also got Mango Sticky Rice for dessert and it was terrible - not sweet and way too soggy. The only thing that was semi decent was the Tom Yum Soup...and that even lacked flavor. They don&#39;t give you any hot sauce or anything so I had to use some at home. Overall - really bad (and a bit overpriced). Don&#39;t go here - go somewhere more authentic.

I ordered a thai tea (not very good), and a crab wonton app. The crab wontons were burnt at the top and had decent flavor. The cucumbers at the bottom made a fabulous crunch at the end of your bite. I ordered the drunken noodle with beef as my entree. IT WAS SOME OF THE BEST I&#39;ve had. Meat was juicy and the sauce had awesome flavor.

Arrived at the restaurant on Friday night at 6 with two kiddos and didn&#39;t get out until 8:00...kids meals took 45 minutes to receive after ordering!  That&#39;s crazy and risky for a restaurant to put kids through that kind of waiting game - they were definitely impatient by the time their food arrived.  Service lacked all around...

We ordered classic Thai staples - pot stickers (for kids) - which were actually shu mai dim sum but good, tom kha gai soup (who puts cabbage in tom kha?!?), drunken noodles, pad Thai, Thai fried rice, and Massaman Curry for six people.  

Overall the food was average - we ordered a couple dishes Thai hot and they weren&#39;t spicy at all.  Their menu did have a couple other items that looked interesting.

The restaurant is very well appointed - great environment.  Combination of our service and food experience means we won&#39;t go back.  There are too many other great options in Edgewater!"

It is, everything was stellar when we visited for lunch on a Sunday. From Tom Kha Gai soup to chicken pad thai with medium spice, everything was perfectly seasoned, spiced, etc. They have lunch specials on the weekend but it only appeared to be one item and you pay $1 more for a wonton or spring roll and soup.

I find myself choosing Thailicious over US Thai Cafe pretty often during the week just because they deliver and don&#39;t have the long wait for food that US Thai Cafe has. Thailicious is more of a fusion-style sort of place. They have your standard curries and noodle dishes that you find at most Thai places, with the green curry being my favorite, but they also have a lot of unique items. The GI fried rice is actually pretty good! It definitely looks like something you might find in an old Better Homes and Gardens cookbook hidden in your grandma&#39;s kitchen somewhere on the menu, but the flavors come together pretty well. 

The view of Sloan&#39;s Lake and the Denver skyline is awesome, especially in the summer. The service has also been very friendly every time I&#39;ve been here, and they make great mixed drinks. My husband and I have been returning here for over a year for take-out and relaxing weeknight dinners out, so I can say I&#39;m definitely a happy customer!"

We went for a Saturday lunch and although it was warm and sunny out it was too hot for my comfort so we sat inside. The service was fantastic! We got about 5 menus each of all of their fabulous offerings and ordered some beers and a cocktail. We got a chilled bottle of water and some metallic ice water drinking vessels that kept the water super cold. After drinking the cool beverages in the AC I was going from hot to cold. Then, since I ordered the lunch special I got soup I warmed up real quickly. I was slurping the soup so fast, I actually got warm again. Then, I cooled off with more beverages. There was also a delicious wonton included with the soup before the lunch entrée.

The food came out and it was amazing. While the others in my group opted for &#39;Hot&#39; level spice, I went for mild. Then their temps started rising as they enjoyed their meals. The layers of flavor where delightful and the vibe was magical! The best part was that although I ate until I could eat no more, there was an ample amount of goodness remaining for left overs! And this was the lunch special. 

I am very much looking forward to returning here!"

They have  different lunch special each day. Sat and Sun is pad Thai. I really liked their pad thai, it is quite good. We also had the Thom Kha, and Panang curry. Thom Kha was okay, the Panang tasted authentic. This is a nice boutique Thai restaurant tucked into a strip mall. If you are new to curry they have something called the stop light, which is a sampler, of the red, yellow, and green varieties. They say their curry paste is imported from Thailand, which makes me wonder if any Thai restaurants make their paste from scratch. I think Thai Diamond, and Suvipa may, it can be a bit chunkier than other places. If you are looking for Thai in this area, I think you will be happy with Thalicious, or US Thai. 
They also had a sampler dish that I may order next time, it has grilled beef, Larb, and papaya salad for 14.99."

This place has amazing customer service! Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating to our vegetarian requests. The food is made to order and we know this because one of the chefs came out to ask us about our order! He wanted to confirm our request for adding egg/no fish sauce. We thought this was really sweet of him to come out to ask us this. Everyone had a smile on their face and were very friendly and nice. They were understanding of our requests and did not show any annoyance. 

Now for the food! We got panang curry with veggie and tofu, thai fried rice with tofu and veggies (add egg) and vegetable spring rolls. All of this was very delicious and flavorful. We really enjoyed the food- the spice level was perfect.

The dishes were on the small side and nothing was really a stand-out. So I didn&#39;t go back. Until recently and now I feel like I&#39;ve missed out. We gave them a chance last month because we really wanted some Thai and they have delivery and are just up the street so we figured why not go for it. And it was great. I love that you can put your order in online. The delivery driver was a sweet guy. And the food was REALLY good. We had Pad Thai, Stoplight Curry, Drunken Noodles, Chicken Satay, Egg Rolls and Crab/Cream cheese wontons. I like that we were also able to order a side of plan rice noodles for the kids for just 1.50. 
The Stoplight Curry was delicious. Neither of us could figure out which was our favorite b/c all three had great flavor and good heat. The Pad Thai was flavorful and plentiful and the Drunken Noodles were just right. The kids had the Chicken Satay and seemed happy. REALLY good peanut sauce. The crispy spring rolls are DELICIOUS.  Everything was great.
Fast forward to last night. Again, just ordered off of their drop down menu and piled everything into a cart for easy check-out. Awesome to be able to do at a red light on the way home so the food was ready to go when I got there. Reordered most of the same dishes. Added some pork dumplings which nobody liked and one had a big bone in it which didn&#39;t help. Everything else was consistently delicious. And I say consistently b/c we just broke up with one of our favorite Thai places in the neighborhood because they can&#39;t seem to get their consistency right (flavors vary and heat really varies to the point of inedible &#34;medium&#34; heat). Anyhow, we are fans. Check them out."

He didn&#39;t apologize for his tardiness, didn&#39;t ask if we wanted drinks or appetizers, just jumped right to &#34;Are you guys ready to order?&#34; Someone else brought out food, which was missing the appetizer that should have come before the food. When they brought the wontons, they were dark and over cooked. We had to flag another server that we recognized from previous visits, to have them sent back. The wontons that came second, looked just as dark, but were actually ice cold in the center. Hinting that they need to change their fryer oil, and stop freezing their wontons.

Got a table for two on the patio since it was such a nice night.  It&#39;s also nice because the view from the patio is Sloan Lake and the city of Denver.  We initially debated if we should leave after sitting there for a few minutes and were not greeted by anyone, yet the staff knew we were there because they were coming outside and serving other tables.  Just as I was using my yelp app to find a place nearby to go to instead of waiting around - our waiter shows up.  
Took him a long time to bring our drinks over, we ordered a beer and one of their bottomless wine slushies.  He was very inattentive and scattered brain.  We ended up ordering the pad Thai with shrimp and green curry with shrimp.  Took about your average wait time.  The food is REALLY good. The best Thai food I have come across since moving to Colorado a year ago.  The waiter continued to disappoint, we ordered another round but he blatantly forget to bring them over to us. Then we finally got our check, but we had to wait what seemed like forever for him to run our card.  Really frustrating when its the weekend and you just want to pay your bill and leave.

The price wasn&#39;t too bad, I think the total order came to $60 for 5-6 entrees which fed all of us well. Next time I&#39;d like to go into the place and check it out, but would recommend ordering from here as well."

I always order the Karee curry and it was good but my husbands drunken noodles were dry and bland. He has ordered the same dish for months now and it is always spectacular, when we talked to the waitress about the change, she said there are new chefs in the kitchen. We really hope the new ones can figure out how to make the food as good as it once was because this was our go-to Thai restaurant."

I ordered the mildest and it was not spicy at all, unlike at other restaurants. The rice was a little overcooked but with the curry on top you could hardly tell. I got one of the special sodas and it was good and unique (not of the shelf entirely) but a little too sweet. 

The atmosphere was really fun with an amazing view of the lake. I look forward to warmer weather to enjoy the outdoor sitting looking out on the lake.

Almost all the curries and soups were GF. My stomach did hurt some afterwards though. I believe it was from cross contamination. I did not emphasis the seriousness of my condition, so I am not sure if gloves and serving ware were exchanged causing the reaction."

We really like the atmosphere and the food was pretty good, but the service kept it from getting 4 stars.
The service was a bit off from the beginning. He gave us about 30 seconds to decide on drinks and asked us if we knew what we wanted to order before we had even opened the menus.  He took a very long time to come back each time he left our table. The food took a bit to come out, which wasn&#39;t a big deal. The main issue was that once we were done eating we sat there for over 30 minutes waiting for our server to come back. He never even walked close to our table the whole time and it&#39;s not a very big place. He had come by earlier to ask if one of us wanted another beer as his was empty and my friend told him he was done. Also, 3 out of the 4 of us had empty dishes and I had pushed mine away from me. Despite sitting there forever with empty plates, cups and beer bottles we still had to ask for our check and had to grab him to give him our credit card. He was just nonexistent and we wanted to head home.
The food was pretty good. We got Tom kha soup, pad Thai, Thai volcano and garlic &amp; pepper pork. The soup was good, but could have been spicier. My boyfriend asked for the pad Thai to be a 4 out of 5 spicy, but they made a mistake and my dish was super spicy and the pad Thai was very mild. The garlic &amp; pepper pork was super spicy (I had asked for a 3 out of 5 on the spice), which wasn&#39;t so bad, but was very salty. The leftovers were better the next day. The volcano wasn&#39;t spicy and is a very small portion, so beware if you are hungry. 
We likely won&#39;t return here as we live on the opposite side of downtown and the service turned a quick dinner out (we had just gotten back from a hike and were starving,but wanted to get home and clean up, so it wasn&#39;t so great to be left at our table for so long after we were finished) into a 2 hour meal. There are much better Thai places closer to home and that are faster."

First, the name of the place is sort of a put off and almost looks like a marketing ploy, and I&#39;m sure it is. Second, no offense, but people in Denver as a whole don&#39;t know what good Thai is so I have learned to ignore Yelp ratings for Thai places. Sorry, but I say this through experience.

After living in LA for almost 10 years, which is the home to the largest Thai population outside of Thailand, I&#39;ve had some amazing dishes! Did I mention I&#39;ve been to Thailand twice as well? 

This is now only the second legitimate Thai place I&#39;ve found in Denver. For one, they are not messing around with the spiciness level. If you ask for &#34;3&#34; you&#39;re mouth will most likely be on fire. Love it! I hope they keep the Thai scale and don&#39;t succumb to a weaker American scale (oops, did I just take another shot?!) ;)

In all seriousness, their food it really good. I had the fried tilapia, which is a dish a Thai friend introduced me to in OC. I thought they did a fantastic job with it and I would absolutely recommend it. The hot and sour soup was more hot than anything but on a cold night it really did the trick. The spring rolls looked a bit unorthodox but I found them rather tasty. Finally, I had the papaya salad, which was good but didn&#39;t rank among the best I&#39;ve had (and not the best in Denver either). It is, however, a Thai dish I absolutely love and crave!

I&#39;m happy to know I have a couple very good options for Thai now and both relatively close to home. In this case, I can order take out if the roads are super snowy! ;)"

So my girlfriend and I stop in for the first time, I live nearby and we had been walking the lake and decided to stop and grab a bite.  Very nice, comfortable environment.  Food was great and exactly what we were hoping for.  So why the mixed feelings?

Our waiter, the Joe Dirt looking guy not the black/grey haired guy, was overtly and obnoxiously flirting with my girlfriend!  Not just the friendly smile and nice compliment kind of flirt, he did those things excessively for sure, but while setting our beers down he lowered himself to eye level with my girlfriend and placed the beers in front of her staring intensely into her eyes with a sly grin!  WTF!  My girlfriend was like, &#34;what is that all about?&#34;  and tried to avoid eye contact with him the rest of our meal!  Totally weird, creepy, uncomfortable and very obnoxious.

IF, I decide to eat there again, it will be delivery so that I can enjoy the food AND the experience!"

I went in one day to get dinner and a glass of wine, the bartender poured a half glass of wine and was going to charge me a full glass. I asked for a glass of water, and the waiter gave me an attitude. I took ONE sip of the wine and decided to leave after the waiter was an asshole. I called to complain, and the manager gave me a credit. So I called tonight to order takeout. The delivery guy was an asshole and got pissed at me for the tip I gave. Not sure what he was expecting? A 20 dollar tip? Then I look in my bag, and I am missing a soda. So I call the place to complain about the attitude and my drink, and the manager gets pissed at me and tells me they could have called the police on me for walking out the last I was there. REALLY?! Then why did you give me a credit? And not only that, but seriously? The cops? I took a sip of the wine and had shitty service. I don&#39;t have to pay for anything when I didn&#39;t eat or drink the HALF glass of wine. I have a right as a customer to call your crap out and refuse to dine with you. So not only are they assholes, but they don&#39;t right their wrongs either. Thanks for the &#34;credit&#34;. Oh and instead of bringing me the soda since they forgot it, the manager told me to call the cops if I want the matter settled. How professional!I was a loyal customer up until the night their waiter was an asshole about giving me a glass of water. If they had just handled the situation properly this time, they could have gotten back a loyal customer.They basically took back their decision to give me a credit for my crappy experience the first time and basically said it was OK for the driver to be a dick and not bring my soda.

Update: The delivery driver came back to my apartment with two cops to give me my money back from the tip and the lack of pineapple soda in my bag. He then proceeded to argue with me about the alleged glass of wine I drank without paying for a few weeks ago and me posting bad reviews. Because of this unnecessary drama and the inability of this restaurant to apologize for their staff and management&#39;s rude behavior, my 1 star review still stands. Extremely unprofessional and unnecessary. As I stated above, the waiter didn&#39;t pour me a full glass of wine to begin with. I took one sip, then the other rude dude who works there gave me shit for wanting A GLASS OF WATER. That is when I left. I have a right to refuse service or refuse to pay for shitty service. On top of that, I am not paying the price of a full glass of wine when it was halfway filled up to begin with, you cheap assholes.I recommend trying the Thai food place down the street. I heard the food is better anyway. And I am sure the service is better because you can&#39;t get much worse than this b.s."

The folks who own it are Thai and so most of the food is very rooted. Jade has been to Thailand- so I asked lots of questions about authenticity and much of it checked out- including the friendly demeanor of the servers. 

The pad Thai is great, as well as the other noodle dishes and our server was really great when we told him about dietary restrictions. We got an appetizer of the spring roll variation and it was delightful.

I ordered shrimp pad Thai and fried vegetable rolls... The veggie rolls were greasy and the vegetable filling was literally MUSH. The pad Thai had no flavor and was poorly cooked = over cooked shrimp and noodles. The egg in the dish was also overcooked which meant bites which tasted very gritty.  A couple bites of that and the dish goes in the garbage. Just not good! Very sad and disappointed as I had previously given an excellent review.  I suppose the food may be better dining in, but the most recent reviews of the poor service there don&#39;t make that a more appealing option... Too bad."

Got delivery since I&#39;m at work. They quoted me 30-45 minutes and they arrived in 25. They asked when I placed my delivery over the phone if I was paying with cash or card, so everything was streamlined and fast!
My food arrived steaming hot! The crab fried wontons are alright, a little over fried in my opinion but not too oniony! The &#39;sweet and sour&#39; to go with the wontons is clear!? They make it homemade! I&#39;ve never had it clear but it is as advertised &amp; delicious! Actually some of the best sweet and sour I&#39;ve had!
The Pad Thai- I&#39;ve never had before anywhere but was wanting to do something different and a classic. And with the name &#34;Thailicious&#34; you should probably try something they&#39;re going to make perfect! They&#39;ve sold me! I got it &#34;Hot&#34; out of mild, med, hot, very hot, and Thai hot. My nose is running it&#39;s PERFECTLY HOT!! Big juicy lime to squeeze over the dish, a good amount of chicken mixed in, noodles aren&#39;t over cooked. REALLY AMAZED WITH THESE GUYS!!!

Thailicious is an exception with decently portioned meals and food that lives up to its name. My group ordered the pad thai, a seafood basil dish and G.I. rice. All three were pretty good with the pad thai having wonton strips that made the dish nicely crunchy along with piquant flavors of peanut, tamarind and chile. The basil dish was very basil-y and pretty spicy too with red peppers. It was also well apportioned with shrimp and calamari. I&#39;ve never heard of G.I. rice but it was an interesting and tasty fried rice with raisins, peas, fried chicken strips and ham slices...I guess the sort of thing an army private might make with whatever is in his kitchen.

We had the mango sticky rice for dessert...probably the best I&#39;ve had in town. It was served in a martini glass and had nice chunks of mango drizzled with a thick and excellent coconut milk. 

Thailicious isn&#39;t quite the best Thai in Denver (that would still be Dancing Noodle in Parker in my opinion), but it&#39;s still quite good and wonderfully quite close to home."

It&#39;s a bit out of the way for us but if you are familiar with the Michelin guide, their recommendation would be &#34;worth a detour.&#34; From now on, we&#39;ll be glad to make that detour as Thailicious trumps every other Thai restaurant closer to us. We had pad thai with shrimp and it was easily the best pad thai we&#39;ve ever had. The flavors were so well blended and incorporated into the dish, it was hard to believe it was possible with this very traditional dish. The massaman curry with chicken was equally if not more so impressive. They have steamed options on their menu under the title Thai Country Style which I can&#39;t wait to try next. While I opted for a Singha, their drinks menu is extremely varied with interesting wines, including Riesling, and many cocktails (can&#39;t wait to have the Thai Bloody Mary).

The decor is very hip, elegant and natural all at once. A spacious interior filled an eclectic collection of comfortable &#34;sofas&#34; and dining chairs, some of which are cushioned, a wall display case of fresh vegetables, a TV and a full bar area complements the outdoor seating area. While Sheridan Blvd is right in front, there is also the undisturbed view of the lake and downtown Denver.

The private parking is shared with the other businesses and could be tight when it&#39;s busy so you might have to walk a few extra steps. Yelp offered to make us a reservation about an hour and 15 minutes after we expected to arrive, but the restaurant was not busy at all and there were plenty of available tables at around 7 on a Monday evening. Highly recommended."

I used to LOVE this place when they were located on Peoria before the Light Rail forced them to move. Last night, my husband and I wanted really good cheesesteaks. I checked out the reviews here on Yelp and took note of how this place was under new management and different. Still, there were enough good reviews for me to check them out for myself. 

We drove 20 minutes to get these cheesesteaks. 40 minutes round trip. We get to the location and I&#39;m immediately disappointed. The door was propped wide open for some reason. Maybe the building got smoky and they were airing it out, I&#39;m not too sure. But it was 50 degrees in Denver last night and the whole restaurant (small space) was freezing cold. We had our kids with us, so it was definitely not somewhere that we could just sit and eat comfortably. The menu looked totally different, The woman ringing us up was nice, but seemed a little out of it. Everyone seemed a little out of it. My husband joked and said they all seemed high, but now that I think about it, that very well could have been true. They told us that they were out of French fries, and that sounded so silly being that they&#39;re a cheesesteak place. My first instinct was why don&#39;t they run to King Soopers and grab some more, but whatever. They offered to give us onion rings or sweet potato fries instead without the up charge and that was very nice. As we were paying, I watched the guy with the long hair start my sons chicken nuggets in the Fryer and he touched just about everything, including our food without any gloves. If you don&#39;t care about that kind of stuff, cool, but I was pretty turned off. 

As we were leaving, the nice young man that brought the bag of food out reviewed our order and confirmed that everything was in the bag. He let us know that they did give my son extra chicken nuggets and that was nice too. However, we get home and it turns out they in fact never gave us our onion rings to go with the adult sandwiches. This was extremely disappointing. They already didn&#39;t have fries and then they shorted us by not giving us the onion rings that came with the meal. The sandwiches were yummy, but completely wrong. I&#39;ll take some fault though, I need to start being anal again and checking my bag before I leave food places. The experience was just overall not great and I&#39;m definitely careful about how I spend my money and I want my $30 back! I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll never drive 20 minutes for a cheesesteak again after this. Hopefully this was just an off night and not an everyday thing, but I doubt it."

Atmosphere- Small cute place, just like most Philly places I&#39;ve ever seen. Everything was clean and inviting!
Service- The employees were great and personable. Very friendly, and it was also quick.
Food- Holy smokes my sandwich was amazing; just hearing and smelling it as it was cooked was almost torture because I couldn&#39;t wait to eat it! I CHOSE to get the philly with lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, and pickles; and I&#39;m very happy that I did. Food was incredibly hot and I really liked that I could see the chef cooking it.
Price- Perfect price point! 8 dollars for a sandwich that fed me twice and left me stuffed both times.
Overall experience- This place is really great and I will most certainly make a habit of visiting.
Hope you enjoy your visit as much as my husband and I did!"

Not a difficult task to make an edible philly. And that&#39;s exactly what this place has to offer. A mediocre sandwich for a premium price. If I am going to pay $8 for only a sandwich, i expect something more than mediocre.  The reason for two stars is based on my experience and the lack of customer service that came with it.

While we ordered, the cook and cashier stood there with blank and apparently irritated looks on their faces as we figured out what we wanted.  It took us maybe 2 minutes tops.  Strike one.

Secondly, there was no suggestions offered during our decision making process.  Some people scoff at this as being, &#34;you&#39;re an adult, figure it out&#34; kinda thing, but it DOES build repore and establishes some form of trust for first-timers.  Strike two.

Well the sandwiches were as expected.  They were tasty enough to calm the hunger, but not as good as a few other places I&#39;ve been to: Taste of Philly, Pat&#39;s, and Abo&#39;s.  But overall, as I&#39;ve got to give credit, the sandwiches were tasty enough to compete taste-wise, but not rise above the competition.  

Overall, if the atmosphere was more inviting (including the staff), and the selection was just a bit more robust (since two formerly offered menu items were merely blacked out on the menu instead of being removed, thus not conjuring an, &#34;I wonder what those were/why aren&#39;t they offered anymore&#34; response), this place might be more on the map.

We got a small, hand tossed cheese pizza and one of their medium specialty pizzas with sausage, green peppers, red onions, and mushrooms. Both were decent. The hand tossed crusts were thick and chewy. They could have benefitted from a slightly crispier crust.

Delivery charge was $2.00 plus a tip. The order arrived 40 minutes after ordering. It was exactly as ordered on line to include requests for separate spice levels on the Pad Thai. Since they felt that it took s little too long for them to deliver, the delivery included a free order of egg rolls. A nice surprise. The spring rolls were very good, stuffed with shrimp, rice noodles snd mint. The peanut sauce was tasty but  a little runny. The egg rolls were very good and included a nice sweet sauce. The Pad Thai portions were huge!  Plenty of shrimp and chicken and the flavor was great. There was enough to feed 4 people with the 2 orders. Next time I will try the Panang Curry. Having spent 7 years in Thailand, I am a fairly good judge of Thai food and these guys get 4 out of 5 stars. The only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is their use of Sambal Olek to spice the dish. If they had used traditional Thai dried chili, they would have gotten 5 stars. 

Second time ordering and taste was better than the last. Very good!

Tried a little something different tonight. Wife ordered Sesame Chicken and I got the Curry Chicken With Peanut Sauce. Both portions were very large, but the Sesame Chicken was extremely dry. The coating and sauce were fine but the chicken itself was close to inedible. Wont order that again!  The Curry Chicken was flavorful with lots of vegetables, but seemed just thrown together as the flavors really didn&#39;t blend well. In The future, we will stick to the Pad Thai and Panang.

Saturday lunch with my wife. She had her old standby (Pad Thai) and I had the Vietnamese Soup (Pho&#39;). Another great meal!"

I ordered the chicken pad Thai. It was ok, but not something I would come back for. The food portions were huge and the price was very inexpensive for the amount of food served which is nice. 

Next time I dine here I plan to order the sizzling rice soup! It&#39;s hard to find this soup in most restaurants and I&#39;m excited that they serve it. 

The service was good. Food came out in a timely manner."

Huge chunks of scrambled egg and to top it all off the &#34;beef&#34; tasted like breakfast sausage I ended up throwing it away. Waste of $11. Feeling disappointed and overall hungry.

I tasted the dish and realized, yes that is indeed what I wanted (regardless of what I had ordered).  I recommend the drunken noodles.

As one might guess from its name, it offers a plethora of pleasing plates not only from Thailand, but also Vietnam and China.

From the appetizer section, the &#34;Healthy Beans&#34; are in fact the steamed in-the-pod soybeans sometimes called Edamame; your colon will give you a hearty &#34;Thanks!&#34; for ordering these fiber-packed wonders. Lettuce wraps with shrimp or chicken are another waistline-friendly possibility, while the seemingly ubiquitous chili wings, spring rolls and crab/cheese wontons are also available if you feel more like splurging. Another very good option to begin is the chicken and coconut soup which sometimes goes by the name Tom Kha Gai. It&#39;s light, yet substantial at the same time - no easy feat! (They also have the tangy shrimp soup called Tom Yum Goong if that&#39;s more to your liking). But as much as the starters may dazzle you, the main courses will truly leave you breathless.

Seeing &#34;One Night In Bangkok&#34; on a menu may at first give you bad mid-80s flashbacks, but don&#39;t worry - this dish of soft-shell crabs liberally drenched in yellow curry will have you singing a different tune by the time you lick the plate clean. Similarly, the presence of &#34;Zinfandel Scallops&#34;, &#34;Tequila Lime Beef&#34; and &#34;Tofu Drunken Noodles&#34; may make you wonder if the kitchen is staffed with a bunch of lushes, but you can rest assured that it will all make sense on your first bite. Other ideas to consider are the chicken with a one-two punch of red curry and peanut sauce, the sliced duck with a bounty of shiitake mushrooms, and boneless panko-crusted pork. Don&#39;t forget to finish up with a fried banana or bowl of iced &#34;dragon eyes&#34; (longan fruit)."

We started with Thai egg rolls. They were a bit tough (over cooked maybe?) and bland.

I had pineapple curry (mild). It still had the signature &#34;kick&#34; but the rest of the nuanced flavors (that make pineapple curry my fav) were lost in a bland, milky mess. Even the pineapples had been sapped of flavor.

My wife had the Hong Kong Noodles (I know, not really Thai). The serving size was ridiculously large (but I guess that&#39;s not always a bad thing). The &#34;brown sauce&#34; was ... ok. But the beef was very chewy and tough."

Instead of being on the house as promised they refunded me $4 and the lady said I ordered the curry with chicken not beef and I know for a fact I ordered the beef.  When I got home there was a hair in the food.  So first they get the order wrong and then replace it with the right order that has a hair in it.  Very disappointing experience.

The people who are running this restaurant know what they&#39;re doing when it comes to food and service. I thoroughly enjoy every experience I&#39;ve had. The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is sometimes they can rush a person who is trying to take their time to decide. I have a son who is a vegetarian and kid offers for vegetarian food would be great! That could be something Else that would really make this place just rock. I always suggest that people eat their spicy foods as well as anything that they make soup wise.there always packed or someone packed but never dead I&#39;ve been there at lunch and I&#39;ve been there at dinner and I&#39;ve gotten the same service both times overall I have a great experience like I said I just sometimes can feel a little rushed when they&#39;re in a busy mode it makes me feel busy.

Ordered the chicken basil dish, expecting pad ka paow.. instead, came out something else that didn&#39;t even have any basil flavor in it. I asked the server to make sure she got my order right, and she double-checked it and said that was what I ordered.

Well at least it tasted good. Salty, but better with steamed rice.

One of my cousins ordered pad thai, and again.. something else that didn&#39;t resemble pad thai came out. We were a bit scared to eat it cuz the sauce was pinkish orange, but we tried a bite anyway and (as expected) couldn&#39;t finish it.

Ordered $50 worth of food, didn&#39;t even eat half of them &amp; didn&#39;t bother to pack them home. They&#39;re so not worth it.

Two stars cuz the chicken basil tasted pretty good despite lack of basil, and plenty of parking.

This place made me realize that, living in California with plenty of good thai eateries, I shouldn&#39;t take them for granted anymore. As you can guess, I won&#39;t be back. Next time I visit this state, I think I&#39;ll stick to pho and homemade asian food."

Came here with Sahib&#39;s baby-mama and her offspring. We ordered two types of rolls for starters (traditional cold Vietnamese and crispy spring), both tasty and with delicious dipping sauces - a sweet curried peanut sauce (same you&#39;d get for Satay), and Thai sweet&#39;n&#39;spicy - my personal favorite. Of course, they rock the Sriracha, too, so taste sensations abound!

Our mains were decent and Sahib&#39;s baby&#39;s mama&#39;s babies ate all their food, so that&#39;s a darn good sign. Plus, I like Fusion. Any kinda Fusion, really. Asian, European, Cold, Nuclear... it&#39;s all about the Fusion. We&#39;ll come back again.

Sure enough, it was indeed open. I liked the decor - a wall of colorful silk flowers and grasses greets you by the door, and inside there are life-size fake palm trees, and over-sized Ming-style vases. But it was so... empty. To cut a long story short, one of the servers explained that the restaurant had just experienced a partial powercut. Thus they had limited lighting and cooking facilities, but there was no AC, no TV, no music, and no telephone lines. Sucky... But at least we got our food!

The Tom Yum Goong ($6) was decent, but once again I sadly reminisced about the mind-bogglingly good TYG they served at our fave Thai restaurant back in Columbus. His Pad Se-Lew ($9) was a tad sweet but still really good (gotta love those wide rice noodles). Happily, the star of the show was my Crispy Duck ($12). I was a bit wary when I ordered it cuz you never know if you&#39;re gonna end up with a pile of ducky bones and fat, but this was definitely not the case. There was a LOT of meat, and the skin was perfectly crisp. The accompanying coconut/peanut sauce didn&#39;t taste especially homemade, but it was still quite good (drizzle sparingly. A little goes a long way). 

Despite the restaurant&#39;s setbacks, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate in returning. The duck was fantastic. I hope it wasn&#39;t a fluke."

Service *** (only did take out; -1 * as I hate those &#34;TIP&#34; jars)
Price $$  ****
Overall:  ****1/2 (Rounded to 5* for my YELP rating)

Alright.  Let&#39;s get something straight.  YELP can be misleading.  I skipped this place to try PEARL OF SIAM, and I must say...I SHOULD NOT HAVE!  IMHO, this is the best Thai restaurant in the neighborhood.

Jonesin&#39; for some Thai again (when am I not?), so I gave this place a shot a few weeks back.  Hadn&#39;t been here since it was Thai Basil, and at that time, I was not impressed.  At that time, Panang only came as MED-HOT.  Why?  Don&#39;t know.  But that was then and this is now &#34;Thai Garden&#34;, and all is well in Panang land (and Thai land for that matter).

A few weeks back, I ordered panang chicken (mild) and some Thai Spring Rolls (aren&#39;t these really Vietnamese?).  Must say that both were really tasty and well balanced.  The rice paper Spring Rolls were CHIPOTLE-esq (when compared to other Thai/Vietnamese restaurants)!

Went back last night and was not disappointed.  Got some Panang Chicken (med), Pad Thai (mild), Thai Spring Rolls, and TYG** (or Thai Spiced Soup).  All were great except the TYG.  It was so-so.  

Panang Chicken:  ****1/2
The Panang Chicken even had some tomatoes in it!  
And for your information, Wild Ginger, tomatoes in Panang Chicken is Da BOMB!   Don&#39;t give me the &#34;won&#39;t taste right&#34; line, Wild Ginger.  How about &#34;we are cheap&#34; line instead.  (vent over)

Pad Thai:  ****1/2
The Pad Thai was really really good for noodles.  Even with take out, it was not a glutinous mess.  The noodles separated well, the chicken was not dry, and the egg added nice flavor.  Maybe it could have used some more crushed peanuts and bean sprouts, but that was it.

Thai Spring Rolls:  *****
Big.  Soft.  Flavorful peanut sauce.

TYG:  **
(BTW, the BEST TYG is at Moon Thai Express; only thing MTE needs to add are some button mushrooms, and it would be perfection)
Not much in this soup except for 4-5 shrimp, onions, button mushrooms, and peppers.  Flavor was so-so.  I always add rice to mine, and that made it bland.
Compared to MTE:   6-8 shrimp, onions, pea pods, bamboo shoots, water chesnuts, baby corn, peppers, and carrorts, but no button mushrooms. :(  Plenty of flavor even with rice added.


The best kicker is that the amount of food provided for the money is AWESOME! 
Let&#39;s review...
32oz Panang, ($9)
32oz soup, ($6)
2 Chipotle-esp Spring Rolls, ($6)
dense Pad Thai* (must have been 5lbs of food), ($9)
2 fortune cookies 
--------------------
$31 (tax included)

Channeling my best Arnold (minus the love child)... &#34;I&#39;ll be back.&#34;


*(and for some reason I got shrimp in my Pad Thai.  Not complaining, but those allergic to shellfish need to be careful that their dish was prepared correctly.)

**[For those not in the Thai-know, TYG=Tom Yum Goong (hot/sour soup)]

thai-garden-asian-fusion-aurora,Kelly Q.,0nKJQPkKqPyXHlC1YOUcJg,"Niwot, CO",0,1,0,0,544,x8Ttc_s_kBdHPy4-oVakkg,3.0,2012-04-01,"I&#39;ve only gotten carryout  there once, but I&#39;d go again, so at least we can say the food didn&#39;t hospitalize me.

I went with basics - pad thai and chicken sate.  The pad thai, while not the best I&#39;ve ever eaten (it was a bit dry), was pretty good, and the portion size was awesome.  I also asked for tofu instead of chicken, and they gave me a lot of it.  Like the pad thai, it was a bit dry, but I was craving it so much I inhaled it anyway. 

On the sate, this was a little disappointing.  The amount was generous, but the chicken was a little overcooked.  However, what really annoyed me was the peanut sauce.  They gave me about a teaspoon of it in a miniscule container.  It was very runny, but also nowhere near enough.  I asked for more, and he gave me a larger container and told me it would be 50 cents.  Not a biggie, but seriously....when it&#39;s that runny, just give it to me already!  Also, it came with a couple bites of fresh pineapple.  That&#39;s when the &#34;pan asian&#34; kicked in and I realized this wasn&#39;t true Thai.

What almost bumped this down to 2 stars (but I&#39;m feeling generous) was the manager or whoever was on duty when I picked up the food.  He was surly to the point of rudeness.  For example, when I ordered tofu instead of chicken with the pad thai, I wanted to make sure he didn&#39;t assume I&#39;m vegan and leave off the egg, etc.  (I&#39;ve had issues with this in the past when tofu isn&#39;t listed as a menu option).    So I clarified that and he looked at me like I&#39;d just grown another head.  And then he copped an attitude about the extra sauce.

As long as people don&#39;t expect this to be totally Thai, it&#39;s decent enough, and the  prices are reasonable for what you get."

The chicken had a lot of veggies which is good.  The basil flavor wasn&#39;t there.  My sister had the sesame shrimp and that was crispy good.  The price was reasonable.

Ironic, since I hate chains ( except PF Chang&#39;s), but I get sick of driving into Denver for meals out.  last year I wandered into Thai Garden and could swear that it was a Thai Basil, but either way, I liked it.  
I gave it a 3 stars...but I have 2 different categories-- Budget and Upscale
This is a budget 3 star restaurant  Versus an Upscale 3 star like SwimClub, Broker, etc where you&#39;ll pay $100 for a couple and your expectations are higher.
So, on my 1st visit, I was inbetween appointments and had a good hour to kill.
I ordered a lunch special and was really pleasantly surprised.  Nice portion of meat/veggie, and although I didn&#39;t want the sides, you also get an egg roll and rice of your choice.  I did order a hot/sour soup ( the best hot/sour in the greater Aurora ) and wasn&#39;t charged.  Not sure if it comes with the lunch, or if they subbed the other stuff.
I&#39;ve been back at least a dozen times, and each time we had a great Chinese lunch -- I really can&#39;t call it Thai, but it doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s tasty."

Thirty five minutes of waiting and no food. Not even our appetizer. Our waiter was MIA too. The final straw for us was when we saw a table seated 15 minutes after us get their food. We asked for our check to pay for the beers and our waiter a.) had no idea we hadn&#39;t gotten our food and b.) didn&#39;t comp our drinks as an apology for wasting our time. We will not be back which is a shame as the food was good on prior visits. 

There is something so gratifying about a bowl of noodles even in the dead of summer. Meeting up with a friend we chose to give this a try. For the starter we shared duck buns. The buns were the perfect soft foil for the warm salty duck meat, hoisin sauce and basil. Take a swipe through the chili oil and you&#39;re in business. 

I went with the oxtail ramen noodles which were a gorgeous work of art when they arrived to the table. Slices of colorful fish cake, meat, fish roe, butter lettuce and gorgeous shimmering broth made a fabulous initial impression. The taste sensation that followed was among the best ramen noodles I&#39;ve experienced as of late. 

The hubs got the pork belly sesame ramen which was tasty but I thought the oxtail was the better of the two."

To start with, the two most important parts of any ramen dish are the noodles and the broth. I ordered the spicy and the broth had a very strange taste to it. I was tasting it for hours after.

The noodles are not what I&#39;m used to. They had a strang, almost thicker texture than most ramen I&#39;ve ever had. The meat itself was very fatty and disappointing. Really, there was nothing I liked about the dish.

I got the pork belly, which was good but I wished it was a bit more tender. The weird part didn&#39;t start until the middle of our meal. My friend asked for a coffee and then didn&#39;t get it. He had to ask 2 more times before they remembered. After that we tried to get our check for probably about 20 minutes. We had 2 ppl waiting on us and they kept walking by us over and over again. By the end of it I was waving them down which I absolutely hate doing! I used to be a waitress and I don&#39;t like doing that. Then my friend kept asking for a box and they kept doing the same thing... They just kept walking by over and over again. I think we counted 5 times. Finally she had to get up and track down one of the guys and he goes &#34;oh yeah!&#34; And hands her a box. While he&#39;s handing her a box our other waiter just waved to her... Just waved... Said hi... It was a super weird experience and by the end of it kind of comical.

I tried the ox tail ramen. Never had it before but the waiter said he grew up on it and loves it. I wasn&#39;t thinking I wouldn&#39;t order it but decided to give it a try. It was pretty flavorful but like other reviews mentioned, very oily/fatty in the broth and meat pieces. I also got a hard grizzly, round flat object in one of the meat pieces. I doubt I will order it again, but am glad I ventured to try it.

Someone else ordered the curry ramen and she seemed to really like it. Another ordered the duck fried rice which was okay but apparently not that special. All in all, the service was great,   food tasty, and group of us had interesting conversations."

My boyfriend wanted to try several of their drinks, esp the Calamansi. We also tried the berry sake, our waiter recommended, It was so different, but so good with the fresh berries. 
Their ramen broth on the menu was interesting. Not the usual soy or nutty pork fat. My boyfriend tried the Saigon curry ramen and I had the oxtail ramen. They were both rich in flavor and the garnishes fun. We sipped the bowl clean...! 

I think this is a creative twist I haven&#39;t found with other ramen shops. A must try for Ramen lovers. We are sure to come back. This place has our attention."

I tried the Dashi miso ramen, it was a little bit spicy, had small slices of chicken and some veggies. They serve a good portion of ramen noodles, not too much or too little. Overall this was a tasty dish, but not sure I&#39;ll find myself craving it. I would like to try their other dishes as well. I didn&#39;t care for the music playing, at all. It sounded like music I&#39;d hear at a nail salon. Overall not super excited about the restaurant&#39;s vibe, or lack there of, but food was good. They should add some decor and work on making it a better vibe, but think they know what&#39;s going on in the kitchen."

Starting to have a sore throat so i wanted a bowl of ramen even though it&#39;s almost 80 out today.  I had the oxtail and hubby had the pork belly.  Duck tacos for apps and hubby doesn&#39;t like duck.  He loved them!  Ramen broth was rich and beefy.  $14 is still really steep for a bowl of noodles but we are in Denver.  I&#39;ve had ramen at a few different places (Sushi Hai, Kobe An in Cherry Creek, Osaka Ramen and Bones) they are all on par with each other."

My only problem was that the chicken in my ramen seemed a little undercooked, and that tarnished the experience for me. I know beef  typically served undercooked in ramen and the hot broth cooks it more, but undercooked chicken is not good to eat."

We walked up to the restaurant for lunch today, and we loved every single dish.

We started with strawberry limeades (so fresh) and the duck sliders (served on large steamed buns). Our 11 year old son raved about the sliders, and for great reason - the sauce on the side was perfect - spicy but a little sweet, and much more interesting that a typical Sriracha sauce.

My wife had the chilled ramen with beef. I had the Red Seoul Ramen (with poached quail egg). My son had the &#34;kids ramen bowl&#34; with chicken. 

The ramen broths were top notch. They don&#39;t use pork, but use chicken, beef, and oxtail broths, so it&#39;s not traditional in that sense. However, the broths are very flavorful and perfectly executed. 

I&#39;ve eaten quite a bit of ramen, including at top rated places in Portland and Vancouver. Sera&#39;s does a very good job and has some interesting riffs on classic ramen dishes. 

Highly recommended."

Nice little outdoor patio and extremely friendly staff that sat us immediately and started rattling through their favorite dishes. We ordered the crepes and two different bowls of ramen. Everything came out speedily and our server checked on us regularly but not annoyingly. Food was excellent! Good blend of spice and flavor with nice accents to help cut the heat. We actually saved our ramen so we could have some the next day despite wanting to slurp it all up. Highly recommend!! But not too much we don&#39;t want it to get too busy!

The dashi miso ramen broth has a delicious authentic taste, the chicken is so flavorful, and the noodles have a fresh bite.  The curry ramen was everything I hoped it would be as well- spicy, fragrant, addicting. The veggie ramen  is good, but probably the least complex of them all and could use more veggies.  I am SO pleased to see this restaurant in the hood and can&#39;t wait to dine in with them and try more things. 

One thing I&#39;d love to see in the future- an authentic pho broth to add to their short list of amazingness...I just got back from Vietnam and would love a really good pho option closer to home than federal."

We got the Red Seoul ramen, the curry yakisoba, and the crispy crepes. The crepes were no longer crispy from the ride home, but the flavor was still great. I would really like to try them and other dishes fresh at the restaurant.

However, I will probably wait a little while before going back. It seems they are still working out some kinks of being a brand new restaurant. My husband did have to wait a long time for take out (15-20 mins longer than the originally 25 he was quoted) and he said that a lot of the people in the restaurant were impatiently waiting on food as well. Also, the portions were kind of small. But I think that if they can work through these issues, this place could be amazing!"

I absolutely love this little place and I hope the masses don&#39;t find out about... for my sake:/ we had the dashi chicken. The grilled chicken was delish. We also had the pork belly which had a super flavorful broth that I found better than the Dashi. As far as beverages go, we had the Thai iced tea and tamarind fizz. The fizz was tart but delicious. Try it. The server and hostess were also really nice which always adds to the quality. Anyways, new love!"

We had been excited about Sera&#39;s after reading about her story in Denver Eater and went to try it on Monday. We were seated quickly which was awesome and the waiter was attentive. The menu felt like it was still in the testing phase, unprotected sheet of paper that might have been printed at my house and still had some formatting quirks. There were no descriptions of any drinks, which were enticing by name, but not helpful otherwise. Here, our waiter gave good descriptions and recommendations. 

We ordered our food after reviewing the few selections, in the mood for ramen of course. My fiancé picked the spicy dashi miso ramen which was apparently the recommended fav, but he was disappointed with it. The noodle to broth ratio was way off--so many noodles and so little broth made it hard to enjoy soup and not a noodle dish. I found the broth to be rather smokey and didn&#39;t really care for it. The quail egg that comes with is cute, but the soft boiled egg that is typical with ramen was what we really wanted. 

I picked the flavorsome soup, which is made with oxtail broth and had pulled oxtail and I enjoyed it. The fatty richness of the broth was good and the oxtail meat fell apart nicely. One small issue was that their soup spoons, while pretty, were not so functional. 

I was most impressed with the drinks. I got the calamansi fizz which was basically a sweet carbonated citrus drink was tasty. My fiancé got the ikezo berry glacier and it was pretty cool--gelatin in texture but drank like a liquid. 

So three stars for food that wasn&#39;t bad but wasn&#39;t quite amazing, for an ambience that has yet to develop a personality and service that was expected. Hopefully as they get their sea legs, things will only get better. We&#39;re excited to try again!"

I&#39;ve had great ramen in other cities and Uncle just doesn&#39;t do it for me (not as authentic, too rich, salty and makes your stomach hurt after).

1. Like the location and fun hidden entrance to this place. The interior is nicely done. 

2.As a regular ramen eater in Denver the two dishes we order lacked flavor and came off relatively bland tasting when compared to similar dishes at several other Denver establishments. 

After ordering a dish and excitedly waiting for its arrival it was served with no quail egg. One of the reason I had chosen to order this dish, in the first place (eggs in ramen are the best!) 

After close to 10 minutes after my dish was served (they were not busy) the server came out to ask how everything was. I inquired about the quail egg and he told me yes, &#34;it should come with one.&#34; After checking with the cooks he came back and said, &#34; I was told we are all out of quail eggs, so yeah.&#34; 

Not exactly the type of response you hope to hear. No apologies, no can I get you something else, no Discount on the bill. 
I&#39;ve had years of restaurant and customer service experience and his was response and lack of action was pretty weak and did not make us want to revisit. 

Unfortunately, we won&#39;t be recommending to others in the future."

I didn&#39;t like it as well as mine, but he enjoyed it immensely.  The jellied, fruity sake drink was different and fun.

I ordered the veggie ramen it&#39;s the only thing I could order from the menu because Im Vegan. I asked for MY choices right up front..this is what I was told was my ONLY CHOICE. Me and my friend always go places for ramen She knows her Ramen. She took pictures before we started eating and it looked Good. I stired mine and then realized i DIDN&#39;T have anything 1 slice of some veggie and ONLY a very small amount of garnish. My girlfriend tasted both and  said they were very very Bland I tasted mine and didn&#39;t like it it didn&#39;t taste very good  just to blend  and I don&#39;t put salt in my food . So I asked the waiter and was told that was it. &amp; my only option. My friend decided to keep hers &amp; ordered xtra spice and added salt to hers to try to get some flavor. Although she wasn&#39;t very happy with it she kept hers &amp; are very little before asking for a box &amp; her check so we could go someplace else. The check had BOTH our food.Thinking it was a mistake we told the waiter he said it wasn&#39;t a mistake. He actually told me I HAD TO PAY for mine. I reminded him that I did not eat it and that I sent it back full. I started to laugh because I thought he was joking BUT HE WASNT. when i refused again. He insisted and became very RUDE and angry like he wsnted to BEAT it out of me. I asked for the manager and he said he was the manager and I still had to PAY for mine. I asked for the owner some girl came out of the back and told me the same. I HAD to tell them to call the police.Any place i have ever been to if you dont like it they will make something else or take it off.  These 2 assholes started talking CRAP about me and my friend like we were not even there. Saying we were cheap and lacked knowing good food.THIS place is the WORST PLACE to eat ramen &amp; on top of RUDE !!? I  WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS DISGUSTING PLACE EVER AGAIN. I have never been treated like this for something I didn&#39;t eat or like. Wouldn&#39;t this be LIKE going into a clothing store &amp; trying on something and then having to buy it because you tried it on??? I&#39;ve heard of you break it you buy it wouldn&#39;t that be like if I ate it I buy it??.. I didn&#39;t eat it ??   I didn&#39;t EVEN LIKE IT !!.. I didn&#39;t want it I didn&#39;t box it and I didn&#39;t take it with me..why should I have to pay for ANY of it??? This place will go out of business SOON ENOUGH. And by the way ANOTHER THING AS SOON AS WE LEFT my GF got a really bad stomach ache from her food. SHITTY FOOD! !! NO FLAVOR !!! CHEAP !!! RUDE !! .. I didn&#39;t even want to give them this one star but I have no choice

First off, having just moved to the Highlands it is refreshing to see another form of cuisine other than Mexican and Italian in the neighborhood. Secondly, with just relocating here from Seattle last summer we were prepared to adjust our expectations regarding the whole Asian cuisine of delicious noodles drowned in salty broth (pho, ramen, udon). Seattle&#39;s Asian cuisine is legit and we didn&#39;t have the highest hopes moving to Denver. Well, this spot certainly changed our minds. Amazing ramen, fried rice and service.

The meat feels a little greasy but the overall flavor is great. 

The cajun fries were tasty but it was not cooked all the way through.  Had a chef friend with me and she said sometimes people can get sick from real potato fries not cook all the way through like the ones we ordered. 

They are all located pretty far away from me.  I probably won&#39;t come back.  It wasn&#39;t anything extraordinary with the exception of the free toppings.  I don&#39;t usually like chains but I think Red Robin has better burgers....  and so does In-N-Out."

All I heard was how awesome it was for what seemed like forever.  Everyday on the way home from work it taunted me when I passed it to come on in and try it.  So today, before catching a flick with my hubby, we stopped in for a couple burgers and some fries.  

I like that the menu is short and sweet (or savory in this case).  And the fact that they have big boxes of in the shell peanuts for you to snack on while you are waiting on your order is a nice touch.  It is counter service and the seating area reflects that - tables and chairs with a refill station and condiment station - well ketchup.  

When they call your number you go and pick up a big brown bag with grease soaking through it.  I am not complaining :)  I like a greasy burger!  So I am ready to be impressed. 

We opened the bag to see a bag FULL of fries.  We got 2 orders of reg. fries (which is a little cup), but they fill the bag with fries.  Seriously.  Tons!!  The burgers are wrapped up in foil and when you open them up you are greeted with a two patties of meat, 2 slices of cheese, whatever toppings you chose (jalapenos, onions, tomato in my case) and a white bun.  I couldn&#39;t wait for the first bite, and after sinking my teeth - eh, good.  Not great, not the best, but a solid burger.  The fries were next - these are probably the best part.  Fresh cut fries with just a bit of salt. Simple, salty, beauty.  

For the convenience and value, Five Guys is a solid deal.  I suppose it was just built up too big to meet my overblown expectations.  Still I plan to go back and try it again.  I can hear those fries calling my name!"

As long as you remember that you are in a BURGER JOINT, theirs are pretty tasty.  I had the bacon cheeseburger, which is actually a double.  They cook it to order, so it might take a little while to get your grub, depending on how long the line is.  The fresh cut fries are pretty good - huge portions!  Tasty!

The have a long list of free toppings, including grilled mushrooms!  Most places would either have some sort of shroom burger or charge extra for that.  Kudos for the toppings!  I got the grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce and mayo.  The toppings were falling off when I opened the foil wrapped handful of cheesy, bacon-ey goodness.  Tasty!

The burgers are always amazing, a big variety of beverages to choose from and decent customer service. I&#39;ve had a couple orders get messed up but even when that happens, they correct it quickly and still with a smile. One other thing, the fries at this location are never cooked all the way and often times very soggy and too salty, I order the little fry and can eat maybe 5 before just being over it. I&#39;ve been to other locations where the fries are freshly made and cooked all the way through making them nice and crispy!

Many people just go thru the motions but they do seems to enjoy working at 5 Guys and making my burgers.

They are kind enough to give you the cup while you wait for your grease stained sack of burgers and fries.  Fries are near the best in the land but back off on the portion size and price.  

I was there today at lunch time, 12:10 pm and the place was 1/4 full. just walked up and ordered.  Bad sign.  Watch your price points.  Get that burger, fries and a coke under $10.00 pre tax and you will be packed like you used to be.

The service was awesome - the guy at the register was super welcoming and took the time to explain the menu and what the place was about.  For those who don&#39;t know, they&#39;re the east coast version of In-and-Out.  The place was spic and span clean and they had an rockin&#39; classic rock satellite radio station playing.  Great atmosphere.

My cheeseburger and fries ended up just over $9, so that was a bit on the pricey side for a hybrid fast food / sit-down burger joint.  But the burger didn&#39;t disappoint, it was hot, juicy, huge, fresh toppings.  It did take them 10 minutes to make it which I thought was weird considering there were 4 employees and just me and another customer in the place.  

The fries were also very good - thick cut fresh cut Idaho fries with the skin still on, my favorite.  I ordered the &#34;little&#34; size and ended up getting half a bag full.  Sweet.

They have an option for you to call ahead or order ahead online, I would suggest this is you&#39;re going to be in a hurry.  Bonus:  They have free peanuts in the shell when you walk in for your table to munch on while you wait."

So what happened to the flavor of my burger at Five Guys? I&#39;m not sure how you can have so much &#34;fat&#34; and so little flavor, but they managed.

The fries are fresh, but the oil was not. The fries are soggy and somewhat unappetizing.

Then there is the price. OMG! Who wants to pay almost $8.00 for a burger with no flavor? While they have an impressive list of condiments, which are all free, they don&#39;t add much flavor to the overall experience, they just add moisture, which makes the bun completely soggy!

The condiments SHOULD be free, since you are paying WAY too much money for a sub par burger experience.

If you want a greasy, flavorful burger for a little less money, make the trip to Fat Burger. You won&#39;t be disappointed. You can get a meal deal at Fat Burger, and you cannot at Five Guys. I really don&#39;t understand the draw. I wont be back."

My co-workers have been raving about it for months. I hope that it was my first and last experience with a 5 guys burger. Any place that has to assault you with plaques and banners that tout the tastiness of their food I am somewhat suspicious of, and here as it turns out I was rightfully so. 

I found two hairs in my fries. Not one, but two. You&#39;d think a place like this would have their employees be a little bit better about hygiene, national chain and all... but no. 

Anyways, the food is actually a decent price compared to others, but was it worth what I paid otherwise? No. I suppose it is really a matter of personal preference, but I did not enjoy anything about my burger. My meat was undercooked and nothing special, the tomatoes were really hard. The pickles aren&#39;t dill like you get everywhere else and I couldn&#39;t even taste the grilled onions that were on my burger. The bun was pretty much the only thing I really was able to taste, and that was like potato bread or something. It was so huge and so soft; it tasted doughy, like they hadn&#39;t finished baking it. 

The fries were okay, again not notable or memorable and WAY too much salt. Like, if you don&#39;t use ketchup to balance it out, you may as well stick your tongue on a salt lick. If I got free food, I might be inclined to return and give them a second chance, but otherwise I told my husband he can go back on his lunch breaks."

The tomato was so thin you could read the paper thru it and the lettuce was old and rusty, they brag about the peanut oil for the fries but no one told them the need to change it out or the fries are just greasy and nasty.  22$ for 2 burgers one order of fries and 2 drinks is a lot for a fast food mess.

It didn&#39;t fall apart like other similar chains do and wasn&#39;t over doing it. The only thing I wish was better about my burger was the cheese..sharp cheddar would have been the best.

The menu is pretty basic: burgers, hot dogs, and fries. They&#39;ve got 2 different sizes of burgers: junior and regular. Apparently the differnce is that the junior is one patty and the regular is a double. 

You can get pretty much anything you want on it: bacon, cheese, and a whole host of condiments. You pay for the bacon and cheese but everything else is free. I like my meat well dead so I&#39;m always concerned when I try walk up burger joints like this. I&#39;ve had bad experiences before, but they have a sign up that says all burgers are cooked well done, and mine was. There was no pink, at least.

I got mine with bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce. I honestly couldn&#39;t tase the BBQ at all and looking at the bun it looks like it just had a little dab on it, but other than that it was really good. The bacon was nice and crisp and the 2 pieces of chz really complemented the flavor.

They have 2 sizes of french fries and I got the regular, which I&#39;m glad I did. They gave you a paper cup full of fresh cut fries and throw an extra couple of handfuls in just for the hell of it. We ended up throwing some of them away because we were so full. You can taste the freshness of the fries with every bite and I have to say that the fries were about 10 times better than the burger, which was excellent in and of itself.

The regular burger was way too big for me. Next time I will get the mini-burger.  They have all the basic fixings and a little extra.  Cooked prefect.  

The fries were pretty good too.  They have tons of potato sacks sitting in the front stacked right on top of each other.  SO you can tell that they are freshly made and not frozen.  They were pretty darn good.

The person who was driving the car had trouble driving cause I was jumping up and down and screaming in joy that there was a Five Guys, heh!

The fries are INCREDIBLE!!!! Cooked in peanut oil, so no can do for the allergy people. Be careful though, they love to give you TONS!!! Get a small fry and share it with friends, it serves 4 VERY comfortably. 

Than the burgers, yum yum yum!!!! I love their burgers completely!!! They have the best yummy style soft, kinda soggy bread, which for me is like living back east again. So don&#39;t overload with toppings unless you want your bread to give away and be way messy.

Five Guys does it just right. All the ingredients are fresh and the burgers are made to order. They also have sweet tea which is always welcome. The natural cut fries are seriously delicious with the skins still on but bring someone to share with because that is a tone of food!

The menu simplicity is much appreciated, sort of an homage to my favorite burger joint that doesn&#39;t happen to have any locations in Colorado. I think everyone will have to learn about their unique (i.e. HUGE) potions the hard way.

How can you not love this place if you&#39;re being constantly bombarded with subliminal messaging telling you that you want to make sweet hamburger love to the meat patties?

Oh yeah, I know you can not love it.  You can taste the food and observe that it&#39;s a very average burger - not in any way bad, yet not really special, either.  And the fries are the super-thick ones that drip grease and still have lots of potato peel on them.  Meh.  I&#39;ll take crispy, oversalted McDonald&#39;s fries over these any day.

And it&#39;s a little stressful that half of the staff is behind the counter yelling numbers at you the whole time while you&#39;re eating.  It&#39;s 2010.  Please find a better system for delivering the goods.  I don&#39;t care if you have to implant an RF transmitter in my forehead, just don&#39;t yell at me while I eat.  Thanks.

In my handful of visits to Five Guys, they&#39;ve been consistently mediocre.  And maybe a little over-hyped.

Oh yeah, and my mandatory restroom review: A+.  It&#39;s a single, but everything is hands-free.  Water, soap, paper.  I almost expected to wave my crotch in front of the toilet and have it unbutton and unzip me.

When I open my own burger joint, RF implants and auto-depantsing will be standard."

I ordered a &#34;regular&#34; cheeseburger and fries. The burger was huge and juicy and the fries were old school. The bag held the overflow of fries which was almost as much in the cup.

The service was exceptional and personable. The counter person was hustling out on the floor, cleaning the tables which is nice to see. I usually need to ask the help to clean tables at the large burger chains."

I really despise the restaurant model where you have to tell the servers exactly how you want your food cooked. If I wanted to do that, I would just stay home and cook it myself. The fries are horribly oily as well, and they give you a big cupful of them. Thanks, but no thanks. There are better burger joints around, although (revealing my bias), I&#39;m from southern Cali and you really can&#39;t beat that for variety and quality. The lack of real competition here makes for greasy, overpriced burgers passing as good food."

Not a bad burger and a good concept, but lets be honest it&#39;s awesome compared to McDonald&#39;s, but it&#39;s not that great for the price. 

Everything is a la carte and that&#39;s why the price jumps up quickly. Add fries and a drink and you could be at $10 for 1 person. The fries are good. They are made with freshly cut potatoes so be prepared for that less crunch style (I like both, but I know some people don&#39;t care for the fresh style).

I am not saying it is bad by any means, I just don&#39;t get how some places get these crazy hypes like chic&#39;fil&#39;a, in&#39;N&#39;Out (too small of patties, this place is better but also more expensive), chipotle, wood fired pizza oven (just cuz it is cooked in a woodfired oven doesn&#39;t automatically make the pizza amazing), etc...

If you just want one patty, it&#39;s a junior burger. Having said that, let me tell you why I&#39;m a fan of this place. When you walk into the joint, you immediately notice the sacks of potatoes and extra oil and stuff stacked off to the side like the builders didn&#39;t add a storeroom to the blueprint and a place to put all the extra stuff was an afterthought. I think this is to show the customer that the stuff they say they use is truly what they use--peanut oil for frying and potatoes from some potato state. There is also a littering of peanut shells on the floor, as they offer free peanuts to gnaw on while you wait. 

This place truly is about the burger, as there isn&#39;t much else on the menu besides burgers (they also serve hot dogs, veggie sandwiches, and grilled cheese, I think)--no shakes, no chili. It&#39;s about the burger. I do love that some of the stuff you&#39;d have to pay extra for at other places--mushrooms, jalapenos, green peppers, grilled onions, A-1 sauce, etc.--are all standard and FREE condiment/veggie options. I got the bacon cheeseburger, and it was so big, I couldn&#39;t open my mouth wide enough to take a commanding bite. I wasn&#39;t deterred, though, and did a number on that burger!! I ordered fries, and they filled the cup to the brim and threw in extra in the bag, so you only need to order a regular size fries and it should easily accommodate two people. 

Both times my burger was juicy and pretty darn good. It was reminiscent of a homemade burger to me. It&#39;s definitely worth the $ you&#39;ll pay."

Couple things going on here that got you only 3 stars.  First of all making all menu items separate is just a way to nickel and dime and pisses people off.  Give me a combo option here for less than 10 bucks please.  One way you could probably accomplish this is instead of giving me half a 55 gallon trash bag full of fries give me a normal human being size order and make them less than $2.50.  Also for all the hype I just felt that the burger was like many that I have had before.  Not super duper but not bad.  I definitely would recommend not advertising the &#34;fry factor&#34; so much because I would take Good Times or City Grilles fries over yours any day.  Overall I wasn&#39;t totally disappointed about making the drive but I probably won&#39;t be making it again anytime soon.  Best of luck to you!

My personal favorite is cheeseburger just because a burger with no cheese is just too plain for me. Basically, the burger patty just melts in your mouth because the meat is super soft (which means very fatty) but doesn&#39;t drip any grease from it. I&#39;ve had burgers that had just grease dripping all over, but not the Five Guys. The patty itself is well-flavored as well. The fries are homemade fries that are both delicious and generous size (you can share an order of Large size with at least 3 people because we never can even finish regular size). The only downside of this place is the wait of about 8-10 minutes, depending on the wait line, however, since the burgers are made fresh and they come out pretty tasty, I think they are definitely worth the wait."

The waitress was very friendly and did a great job throughout the meal.

I really enjoyed their coffee (unsure what kind they serve). 

For my entree I had the french dip with fries and ranch. The au jus was very tasty and the meat, cheese and bread all went together well. With the fries I was very full at the end of the meal. 

The brunch options are fairly thin but it appears that most people come for traditional lunch or dinner options.

I did sneak of piece of the kids cheese pizza, which had a ton of cheese and good marinara sauce. The crust is thin but not so thin it falls apart. 

The pricing is not too expensive and parking is not too hard (at least on a Sunday around 11am)"

I sat on the patio and ordered a salad.  It had a hair on it when it arrived, so I immediately let my waiter know, and he replaced it.  It was really fresh and delicious, and he was very conciliatory about the mishap.  Despite the error, it is such a welcoming place.  I will eat here again."

The decor is homey and inviting; there are framed pictures that decorate the front entrance and the host or hostess leaves the choice of seating options (bar, stools and tables, or booths) entirely up to you.

I stopped by for their early evening happy hour that runs from 3PM to 6PM daily. As a huge fan of taco anything, I was immediately drawn to the roasted chicken taco and veggie taco that is only available during happy hour. Since every place that serves tacos makes their portion size different, I needed a backup dish to make sure that I would be full. After looking over the main dinner menu, I opted for the mango chicken salad as well. 

The tacos were brought out first. The veggie one had a great mix of seasonal vegetables but sadly lacked some flavor and kick. The tortilla was also soggy from the amount of juices coming from the cooked veggies. The chicken one however was a lot more tasty and was seasoned really well. The mango chicken salad was a delightfully light way to end the meal, with bits of chopped mango, chicken, tomatoes, and goat cheese atop of a bed of greens. 

The waiter was courteous and held a great conversation all throughout my meal, refilling my water as necessary and making sure my time at Silvi&#39;s was phenomenal.

This restaurant definitely is not afraid to make your food/order the way you need it to be, for special dietary needs. They state right there on their menu: gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, as well as low-carb, options.

I explained what I needed, what I could/could not eat, and the waitress was so helpful! We ordered a gluten free pizza, with very specific toppings, etc. The waitress did not flinch! It was awesome! Our pizza and salad were both very good! Actually, excellent! 

The interior of this restaurant is HUGE! The interior colors are brown, black, and white, with clean lines as well. There are plenty of booths, high top tables, as well as regular tables.  The interior is clean, open, and not at all crowded. Feel free to sit down, enjoy a drink at their big bar, or at one of the tables. Or, look at the art work on the walls, of food, and food preparation.  Have a happy hour there with a co-worker, or a friend or two. Enjoy a meal after doing some local shopping. 

Silvi&#39;s is not trying to be a &#34;chain,&#34; restaurant, and I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t try to be. They also are not trying to be one of those &#34;places to be seen&#34; restaurants either. Silvi&#39;s is simple, straight up, and just plain good!

I could hear my dining companions on either side of me, but the folks on the other side of the table were much harder with which to converse.

Our service was good, but our server kind of kvetched about how we split the bill, which she could have avoided by proactively splitting or at least better organizing it.  As for the food, I really enjoyed the appetizers we ordered.  The hummus was quite good and came with a small garden of side veggies.  The brussels were very tasty.  The mac and cheese (cavatapi with a good bechamel and bacon) was delicious.  My burger was decent, with good toppings, but seemed a tad dry.  I thought the fries were rather limp, but others enjoyed them.

All in all, it really was a solidly okay experience with some highs and lows.  However, I am definitely willing to come back and try them again."

So the eats: Peanut Chicken Salad &amp; the charred brussel sprouts. 

For overall taste the salad missed a few marks. it needed something - maybe a stronger ginger flavor in the dressing or won ton crunchies on top for texture...(is that what they&#39;re called?) or maybe a little thai spice to bring out the flavor more. 

I thought the Brussels were great. I had to bring some home...will see what I can do with them - maybe an omelet or something. But yes, they were good enough to bring home. And I don&#39;t like leftovers. 

I can&#39;t wait to try other things on the menu."

Started with stuffed breadsticks....they were not stuffed breadsticks. They were definitely more like mozzarella sticks, and while tasty, not sure they were worth the price. Actually, I feel they weren&#39;t worth the price. 

We got two pizzas, one Hawaiian and then made our own. They were okay... One was a little more &#34;well-cooked&#34; (read:charred) than the other, but it was ok.

We also got a beet salad that was really good and well dressed. Service was perfectly lovely, bartender was very attentive and nice.

I guess what it came down to was value: 2 okay pizzas, one beer, a glass of house wine, a small salad and 3 mozzarella sticks...$60? Meh."

In the month of June, I visited Silvi&#39;s Kitchen on two different occasions. With each visit I was very impressed with both the menu selection and service. I highly recommend the Silvi&#39;s Famous French Dip sandwich. The sandwich and dipping sauce was delicious, well-made, and very filling. The Silvi&#39;s Hummus is also an excellent choice. It is a great alternative for customers who are vegan and weight conscious. During my visits, customer service was also consistently excellent. Our waiters was professional and attentive. I would recommend this establishment if searching for a casual dining or upscale experience in the Glendale area. Lots of parking is available, the menu prices are reasonable, and this restaurant has a diverse menu selection. Perfect for couples or a work lunch location."

So... what&#39;s good? I&#39;m usually here for lunch so lets start with the pizza special Mon-Fri until 3pm that comes with a side salad. You can get margherita, pepporoni, artichoke basil or sausage all under $9.75. This is a personal size (9&#34;) with six slices and I&#39;m usually full by the fourth slice. Skip eating the crust and you might be able to finish. Otherwise, you can take two slices to go for an afternoon snack. The salads at Silvi&#39;s are huge. I would say a small size is good for just about anyone. You can add on a smoothie or bites (appetizer). But a full salad is just too much of a good thing. Depending on your preference, I&#39;d recommend the Silvi&#39;s Cobb (if you love ranch like me), Mango Chicken Salad (if you like sweet), or Robin&#39;s Power Salad (if you like kale). The sandwiches and burgers come with a side salad or fries. For $1.50 more, you can get the sweet potatoes fries which is worth it! The spicy-jalapeno cheddar turkey is my go-to sandwich. Tastes healthy, but delicious and has the spicy kick to it.

Now, lets drink! The reason I&#39;m here so much is to stop in for coffee and smoothies. My co-worker and I stop by so much for our routine coffee that most of the staff know our orders: a mocha and a vanilla soy latte. You can order coffee directly at the cashier and get it to go. Same with smoothies. I love the Blue Monday which includes blueberries, strawberries, oranges and bananas. And again if you like kale, the Mangolicious and Power Shake are good too! (I say this because there is a specific kale taste [sour] that people don&#39;t like.) I&#39;ve also been to the happy hour a few times (3pm to 6pm daily). The Floyd&#39;s Pink Lavender Lemonade ($4) is worth a try! It does have that lavender/floral taste to it so might not be for everyone. You can also ask for the daily shot special to get a $3 shot. My only wish is that Silvi&#39;s would open earlier in the morning. It currently opens at 10:30am so sometimes I need to get my coffee fix elsewhere. Haha, such a hard life."

The space is huge and there was some decent people watching for a Saturday morning.  The pricing is decent and the energy is welcoming.  You can crawl in hungover or bring the fam for some eats and both are acceptable here!

If I found myself over here during happy hour, I might give it a try but I am not going out of my way.  It seems some of the more harsh reviews  are in regards to this. 

This area of town is interesting and odd. We examined out options in the area for a high quality drinking brunch and this fit the bill nicely! It will definitely be added to the rotation."

My mother ordered the Jerusalem chicken sandwich, and her co-worker and I both ordered the French dip. All of us ordered fries. Now, I assumed this was one of those health-obsessed restaurants, with the gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options, and I expected that the fries would not be very good. Boy was I wrong. They have some of the best fries I&#39;ve ever had in my life. They are seasoned simply, not drowned in oil or overly salty, and they are delicious! The Jerusalem chicken was very tasty. The French dip... I have never had one quite like it. The bread is delicious, as is the Gouda cheese (that was new to me, I&#39;ve only ever had provolone on a French dip before).

Aside from it taking a bit longer than average to get our drink orders in (and I think they may have been short-staffed, so it happens), the service was fantastic. We never had empty drinks for more than 30 seconds before they were refilled. Three servers were very friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. Long story short, I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Udis offers the ability to make almost all meals gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan. Which is extremely nice, especially for those with advanced celiacs who are not only gluten intolerant, but sensitive to lactose and casein as well. 

I settled on a small bites plate, a salad, and cocktail.

The cocktail was a cucumber refresher that had gin, mint, and st germain. I probably should have realized that with the st germain, this was going to be more of a flowery sweet drink then I normally fancy. It was also a smaller sized martini and $9.

The roasted beet salad was very good! At first I thought they just gave me canned diced beets because some were vinegary tasting, til I realized that was the doing of the balsamic drizzle. The candied hazelnuts added a smoky and sweet taste that nicely off set the hearty beets, mild goat cheese, and balsamic.

The &#34;small bite&#34; was really the outstanding part of this experience. I was presented with  two plates, one heaping with chopped veggies and a nice chunked up portion of gf bread and one with a pool of hummus and neatly arranged falafel. The hummus was creamy and had good spice to it. The tahini was a little bitter for my taste so I mixed it in to the hummus. The bread was warm and had sage an sea salt on it. I&#39;m not usually a green olive fan but these were nice and firm and thickly sliced.

The quinoa was tasty, but I really don&#39;t get the quinoa craze that&#39;s been going around. Sure it&#39;s better than pretentious rice pilaf, but come on, it&#39;s not THAT much better than couscous. Regardless of whether or not we agree on quinoa, I think we&#39;d agree that their quinoa is pretty  darn good.
I jumped at the chance to go Greek when I saw a lamb burger with feta. Great combination, good flavor mix. But the texture of the burger was pretty disappointing. I don&#39;t doubt the quality, but I just didn&#39;t love tearing into the slightly rubbery, semi-ground-chunks texture of the patty. But really, it wasn&#39;t bad. Not bad at all.

Awkward entrance. It was raining, I was scooting my feet on the mat to dry them, hostess said hi and stared. I remarked that it was really wet. She said yes. She mumbled and I said thank you. Anyway I chose the bar as opposed to the high top tables.

After looking over the happy hour menu (3p-6p) I chose a veggie taco, green chili fries and a chicken slider with Brussels sprout slaw. Loved that I could choose several small things to sample. Loved the chicken slider with slaw!!!!!!!!!!! The fries were ok -- a little green chili goes a long way for me so I was tired of them quickly. I forget how much I dislike goat cheese until I order something with it like the veggie taco. Just wasn&#39;t my thing. But it was a small serving so I wasn&#39;t out much $ and I didn&#39;t waste much food. I like being able to do that!

I&#39;ll be back . I hear the pizzas are good too."

I had the French dip sandwich. I can only assume a restaurant doesn&#39;t have any faith in their protein when they have to use heavily flavored bread, which was certainly true with my sandwich.  However the real gotcha was the gouda cheese that was crunchy.  Seriously. I would have expected that it would have been melted cheese but what I got was a piece of hard, crunchy cheese.

My lunch mate had the Asian pear salad. She spent the entire meal searching for pear and eventually came up with about 1 tablespoon full. There wasn&#39;t much chicken either. 

I would recommend the place for times when the food doesn&#39;t matter but you need a friendly venue, especially for a business discussion."

I had a roasted half chicken with farro and charred Brussels sprouts. The chicken was very moist on the inside and had a beautiful crispy skin. My compliments to the chef!

Service you might find at a top tier steak house downtown, which was a pleasant surprise for a cafe style Sunday lunch with my pup. 

Service highlights:
-server: Jedd
- even though the patio was closed the hostess happily cleaned off a table and chair so I could enjoy the beautiful day outside with my dog 
- hostess quickly had water brought out for my dog and I (I was glad to see my dog was a welcome guest!)
-Jedd addressed me promptly and I placed my order (beet salad, iced Americano, gluten free Colorado BLT with a side of Taziki and sweet potato fries) 
- salad came out within monuments accompanied by my Americano 
- table was cleared and new napkin and silverware were brought out with my meal
- friendly banter with wait staff and condiments and such brought out as needed.
- no rush but no wait for check either


Food highlights;
-perfect espresso, not bitter
-slightly over dressed salad 
- excellent sweet potato fries with large chunks of sea salt
-perfect home made Taziki (which I recommend with sweet potato fries) 
-obvious plus with the Udi&#39;s gluten free bread
- fresh, crisp produce and perfect amount of guacamole to keep my sandwich from being dry

Bottom line: now that I&#39;ve given it the trial run I can easily say brining my picky, foodie, classy, LA, parents here next time they visit will be a success. Seeing as I am a student who can live off Nutella and toast, it&#39;s always a challenge pleasing the parents&#39; palate when they visit."

I&#39;ve passed by during past visits (recognizing their former name, Udi&#39;s, as the GF bread brand) and was curious to try.

We ordered a variety of smoothies and coffee.  The coffee took about 15 minutes to come out, which is way too long for this Jersey girl.  The smoothies actually came out way before.  I tried a sip of one of them and it was very fruity and fresh.  

For our food, some of us went with the breakfasty options (omelettes, burrito) and some with lunch (sandwiches).  Everyone seemed to more or less like their food.  I tried a bite (or a couple) of my sister&#39;s falafel sandwich and realized I probably should have ordered that! I ordered the mediterranean omelette and thought it was just okay (very small).  I did like the walnut cranberry toast and jam that came with the omelette.  

Overall, decent food but very slow service.  I wouldn&#39;t mind going back for the falafel sandwich, now that I know what to order."

Make sure you ask for Jedd by name, you won&#39;t be sorry.

Now the food--OMG!   I had the salmon.  The skin was crispy &amp; delightful.  It was served with Brussels sprouts &amp; cauliflower.  Divine!  Hubby had the Jerusalem chicken, with amazing spices and great veggies.  
But the highlight was dessert.  This is THE best bread pudding we&#39;ve ever had!  Chunks of challah, crispy and buttery on top, nestled in a silky custard.  It arrives at your table still sizzling from the oven.  I thought hubby was going to dive in face first.  He did threaten to lick the dish clean.  Jedd offered to hold up a napkin to give him the privacy to clean the plate.  Now THAT&#39;S service and a sense of humor!"

Udi&#39;s has been there for some time now and compliments the other establishments nicely, giving visitors a good variety of food options to choose from.  

Just like everyone else I was surprised to find this Udi&#39;s has a full bar, who knew?  It&#39;s a bit different than other Udi&#39;s because you can order at the counter or you can sit down and have full waiter service.  I think it&#39;s a little odd to have both options, it&#39;s like they don&#39;t know what they are, full service or counter service.  Pick one and stick with it guys.

I thought the food was average.  I ordered the Cobb Salad which was ginormous. The size could definitely be decreased some and price potentially reduced.  I would be surprised if anyone could finish that salad in one sitting, and who takes salad home and actually eats it the next day (admit it, you actually just throw it away).  The ingredients were plentiful and I felt as though I had a half a chicken in my salad, very filling indeed.  I also had their soup of the day, a spicy pumpkin soup, which was a bit thicker than a soup, more like a puree but the flavor was there and I enjoyed the warming effect.  The BF ordered a side of Brussels sprouts with some orange that were really yummy.  I would beware of menu descriptions on this one, on Udi&#39;s menu apparently charred means fried.  I don&#39;t mind fried just as long as it&#39;s listed as such on the menu and not deceiving. 

Our waiter for the evening was a funny guy and thoroughly entertaining during our meal.  At times he was a bit too much but he really had a great personality and made our experience enjoyable.

If I was in the neighborhood I would consider Udi&#39;s as an option but wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to return.  Your meal will be satisfactory."

Seated in a booth against the far wall from the entrance.  Our server Jesse was very attentive and took the drink orders right after we sat down.

I ordered a 4 shot dirty chai to have with my meal that was outstanding.  Came out in a large mug and had a great smell.  Perfect temperature to drink when it arrived as well!

For my main course I ordered the Mediterranean omelet with home fries and the house gluten free toast.  After a short wait the meal arrived.  Nice surprise to have some sweet potato fries mixed in with the home fries, the omelet was the perfect size and was made with fresh ingredients.  The goat cheese was not over done and the green olives were very crisp.  The house GF toast was very tasty when you used the cream butter and fresh strawberry purée.

The only down to today&#39;s visit was the hostess when we walked in.  She just looks like she was having a bad morning.  Everyone is entitled to a down day, and maybe today is hers.  The thing of note is that she was making the servers work harder across the board.  This blemish however didn&#39;t effect my overall impression of the visit."

I have to give this place two stars because they changed the sandwich to a falafel wrap.  I really wanted to like the change but it is awful.  The wrap has this trrrible lettuce mix on it that kind of tasted like it had French dressing on it.  The falafels were too big for the dry tortilla so the wrap fell apart.  I felt that the sandwich was the best vegan thing on the menu.  I&#39;m going to have to look for a new place for a good falafel sandwich.

Every time I&#39;ve been here, the service has been very friendly and fast, even during the weekday lunch rush. Almost everything I&#39;ve tried on the menu, so far, has been great. Mango Chicken Salad, Falafel Burger, Jerusalem Chicken Sandwich (with 21 spices!), Vegetable Tajine, pizza, and don&#39;t forget the freshly squeezed juices (you gotta try Liquid Sunshine - it&#39;s like an explosion of green juicy goodness consisting of kale, orange, ginger and lemon). Overall, Silvi&#39;s is good place to grab a relatively healthy and reasonably priced lunch or dinner, especially if you like good, fresh bread (which is part of why their sandwiches and pizza taste so good)!"

The place does get a little busy, so heading there for an earlier lunch time before noon would probably be better. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating is the service. I&#39;m not knocking our waitress, but I think they need some more servers. We weren&#39;t the only table looking around for our wait person to help fill up sodas, pay the bill, etc. I saw a couple of people at other tables trying to flag down wait staff with no response. I think they&#39;re just a little short staffed, easily remedied. I did like the bar area quite a bit, from what I saw. Full bar, couple of big TVs (only two, not a whole wall of them), nice set up.

This place has so much potential if they were to fine tune (or overhaul??) their operations. 
My first disappointment was the cappuccino.  It was too weak and was served in a paper cup.  My plate had to be washed, my silverware had to be washed - where&#39;s the ceramic cup?  If a joint that serves espresso can learn one thing it is &#39;stop using paper cups&#39;. Totally ruins the coffee.  Might as well go to a gas station. 
The Eggs Benedict was lukewarm which I think was the result of cold Hollandaise sauce.
The final straw was the fruit dish.  I found pieces of lettuce and a caper in the bowl.  I only hope this was not from someone else&#39;s plate. 
Again, this place could totally rule this hotel parking lot."

Midway through my bike ride along the Cherry Creek trail, I needed a little breakfast. I sometimes head to Moe&#39;s for a bagel, but this time I was not that motivated. So, I find myself cruising this new space, looking for a bike rack (hint, they are hidden on the west side of the building...) 

I stepped up to the counter, ordered a breakfast burrito &amp; coffee. The friendly girl behind the counter handed me one of those wireless pucks you usually get while waiting for a table. This one appears to mark your location. She brought out  my burrito &amp; grabbed the puck.

First time they didn&#39;t get the meal out on time for my friend so we had to leave.  This trip I ordered the short ribs for $21 and it was barely enough to feed a small mouse.   They brought the main dish out fast and my soup, salad, and bread for my daughter came much later.   Although the taste of the food was good, it was not worth the high price.

The entire room was pretty much empty but we were seated right  in front of a table full of dirty dishes which never was cleaned up during our meal. Our waiter served our drinks but we needed a couple minutes to decide on our food. After 10 minutes I went and found a waitress to take our order. Our food was good except our avocado salad was missing avocados. We never saw our waiter until I again found a waitress and told her we had to leave. Our waiter brought our bill and disappeared again. We were overcharged by  $5.  Again we found the waitress as our waiter was no where around.  She had the manager fix it.  The manager never came by. To top it off the women&#39;s bathroom was dirty. 
I doubt we will go back."

I went here for what ended up being an over priced lunch. I ordered the brie sandwich at the recommendation of the bartender. It had wilted lettuce, which the substituted out when I pointed out to them. The sandwich was dry and lacking in flavor. The service was lousy. The bartender is apparently going to culinary school to be a chef and cared more about bragging to other customers about his schooling and internship than making sure that I had service. I had to interrupt and ask for a refill on my water.

They upcharged me substantially for gluten free bread. I had a second upstage for sweet potato fries. My lousy dry sandwich was $17 after the upcharges. 

Udis, I will never go back. After the bad sandwich, I&#39;m hesitant to buy your products at the grocery store."

I started with the House IPA, brewed by the Uinta Brewing Company. With big hop aroma bursting with citrus flavors. Next up I tried a Boulder Buffalo Golden blonde ale. This is a popular flavorful local light beer, it was fine but I do prefer the IPA&#39;s in this town. Had a sample of Breckenridge Agave Wheat, the combination wheat and citrus makes a perfect blend of flavors.

I ordered the coconut shrimp as an appetizer to share, 3 large pieces and even though they were a little over cooked... they were really good.We also shared the lobster, crab and artichoke dip...yummy four cheese blend with baked pita chips.

If you know me, you know I LOVE YARD HOUSE.  I wish there was one closer to where I live or least accessible by train or mass transit.  Most of the time, I visit Yard Houses when I&#39;m doing my sports tours, Denver was no exception.  We were excited to see that there was a YH right by where we were staying.  A bit of a walk but we&#39;re New Yorkers.  We&#39;re used to it!

I walked out a bit disappointed.  

Usually the menu is pretty standard, but the place was pretty busy, and they were able to seat us right away...in like the crappiest area, right by the door at a HUGE table that was better suited for a family of four or EIGHT.  No joke.  But you know what, we were willing to overlook it because we are fans of Yard House.

My beer was a bit disappointing, as was my food which is usually my stand by (the grilled cheese with tomato bisque).  I mean, it&#39;s tough to be disappointed at this place but between the service, the food and beer (which are pretty hard to mess up here), I think I might eschew this place next time I&#39;m in Denver."

Lots of beers on tap 

Cons:
Service is soooo slowwwww!
Coconut shrimp way over fired.
Skirt steak was overly chewy and served pre-cut rather than as a whole piece 


The yard house was extremely busy on the night I stopped by.  I didn&#39;t stay for dinner, but was able to try a few apps and experience enough disappointing service for a long time."

PRO TIP #1- You may have heard that they have 100 taps and that&#39;s true.  If you don&#39;t like beer, DO NOT WRITE THEM OFF!  They have an excellent wine &amp; specialty drink list.

ATMOSPHERE- I blew in for an early dinner.  The place was bustling and huge.  What was really interesting is the vibe was what I would call happy casual.  Dozens and dozens of folks were munching and sipping and laughing and generally having a good time.  It really was infectious and a great sign.

CUSTOMER SERVICE- I sat at the bar and was served by 1  1/2 bartenders.  Don&#39;t ask me if the  1/2 was the top or the bottom half.  It&#39;s just that I had one primary and one occasional bartender.  My occasional bartender was really cute and I preferred the top half!  Both were friendly and competent.

ADULT LIBATIONS- This place will please everyone.  Beer, wine and specialty drinks are all there.  I was sampling small glasses of beer which here are called shorties.  I was a happy camper.

FOOD- As others have said the menu here is GINORMOUS!

Pro Tip #2- Portion sizes here are tricky.  Some are just normal and others are huge.  If you are thinking of ordering three or more items just for yourself I would be very very careful.  

FOOD- I began with Deviled Eggs and was delighted.  The portion size was normal with four halves.  The topping was a little spicy and bursting with flavor. 

Next I opted for Grilled Korean BBQ Beef.  It was presented on the menu like an appetizer.  I was asked if I wanted brown or white rice which was a nice touch.  It arrived quickly and was huge!  The beef was tender and the sauce was appropriately tangy/salty and it was all around delicious.

I was completely stuffed.  There was no chance I could even look at a full sized entrée.   This is what I mean about portion sizes!  This would be an Ideal place for a bunch of folks sharing dishes.

This is easily one of the best chain experiences I have had in a while and I would return in a heartbeat!"

Denver has happy hour till 6ish everywhere.

Service is attentive though.  Stop by here if you are super hungry as the portion size is pretty big."

This place was conveniently located in Downtown Denver and in between the convention center and our hotel. So naturally we stopped in for lunch one day. It was pretty much a standard Yard House, so you can expect a wide range of beers to choose from as well as great fast service! And most importantly, their food isn&#39;t too shabby as well! 

*Cobb Salad added Shrimp*
I decided to go with something healthier as I had been overindulging on burgers and other less healthier food as of late. This was a great choice. It was one of the better Cobb salads that I&#39;ve ever eaten. Adding the shrimp made it even better. I could eat this salad every day if I must!

*Denver Beer Co. Graham Cracker Porter*
I had this nice locally brewed porter to go with the salad. Normally I drink a porter or a stout with my burgers, but it went well even with a salad. It was not too bad and not overly sweet.

Overall, you should come here if you want something safe and more than decent in terms of food and libations. However if you&#39;re new to Denver and feeling a little adventurous, you should find somewhere else as you can go to a Yard House in practically any major US city."

Overpriced food and mood lighting? The food selection is huge, but makes me scratch my head.  Be prepared to wait awhile regardless of what you order. And then be prepared to scratch your head too and say &#34;huh&#34; aloud when the food hits your table.  The guacamole is pretty tasty but it&#39;s confusing when 11 chips and a thimble-full of guac arrive. Similar scenario when presented with the thai chicken pizza (crust very bland).  The overarching theme here being your money doesn&#39;t go far here for small, mediocre-tasting dishes

This place does do beer really well. Dozens of beers on tap and you can get them in their trademark &#39;yard&#39; glasses (think those hand grenades you get in New Orleans). They should probably offer more local brews considering they&#39;re in the (unofficial) craft beer capital of America, but you&#39;ll be sure to find something you like. 

If you&#39;re staying in the Sheraton downtown or perusing 16th street mall, this wouldn&#39;t be a bad place to swing by. I wouldn&#39;t seek this place out otherwise though. [See: Stout Street Social]"

We decided to order dinner after all to avoid leaving the hotel in downtown on a Friday. We ordered a single pizza and salads. After a $90+ bill we noticed we were charged $3.95 for extra dressing for the salads and we didn&#39;t even wind up with it. $3.95 for dressing is one thing but at least include it in the to go bag.

This restaurant was one of the 2 reasons we drove almost 4 hours to spend our weekend in Denver. Keegan was a wonderful waiter. I had the mooshu eggrolls for an appetizer, and my husband had the devilled eggs. My Caesar salad came out and while tasty, it had LOTS of brown middle parts of the lettuce, more than I cared for. The good news is that it was a BIG salad for the $3.50 add on fee. At least I got my money&#39;s worth. I had the pepper crusted filet and my husband had the enchilada stack. My steak was good, but I ordered it medium and it was medium well in the middle and well done everywhere except the very, very center. I would have told Keegan but he didn&#39;t come back for about 20 minutes so I just chowed down anyway. No worries, I just wanted to let the kitchen know to take it off the fire a bit sooner. My husband wasn&#39;t impressed with his stack, said the only taste on it was the red sauce. My sons food came out early, like we asked, and it was just fine.

They have a nice beer selection, with some good sours when I went. I think they occasionally have 120 Minute IPA on tap also. 

Their happy hour specials are great and the servings are enormous! I ordered chicken nachos and it was enough food for three people (and I&#39;m a big eater).

The decor is definitely a little chain-like, but I remember the acoustics being really good. There were 12 or so of us at the table and nobody had to scream to hear the people at the other end of the table.

-Southwest Salad. This was really pretty good. Had good flavor and was a very generous size. 

-Street Tacos, fish and chicken. These were really good. Rice was a little spicy, in a good way.

-Mac and cheese. Very underwhelming, especially after our server told us it was one of the best items on the menu.

We had inquired about the different desserts, and they had run out of a few different ones the previous night. However, our server told us that he himself had eaten about two of them. I think I know why they were running out.

It was delicious, tender, flavorful. Also comes with fries, which can be upgraded to truffle fries for just $1.

I had a horrible experience at the location in Atlantic Station back home (Atlanta) so I was a little hesitant, but I&#39;m glad I gave it a shot.  The food was OK both times, but what really shone was the service.  It was a little pricey, but the portions are huge.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have a fridge to keep any leftovers. I got takeout both times so I could eat in my hotel room and work. 

First time I went, I entered in through the hotel entrance.  The host opened the door for me and walked me back to where they normally handle take-out orders.  He was extremely pleasant and asked me about what brought me to Denver, where I was from, etc. As for food, I got the blackened chicken torta (sandwich).  It was tasty but I didn&#39;t think it was necessary to have 3 kinds of fat - cheese, mayo and avocado.  It was a bit much - and made for a messy meal.  

The second time I went I got the chicken nachos.  Unfortunately the chicken was a bit dry but I just covered it in sour cream and guac and it was fine.  Again, the service is what stood out.  The man who took my order over the phone was the one who got my food from the kitchen and rang me up.  Even though they were completely slammed with people from a nearby convention, he was very nice and took the time to double check that all parts of my order were in the bag.  When he realized they forgot something, he ran back to the kitchen to get it and then offered me extra napkins.

For starters, I found many GREAT vegetarian options on the menu! It&#39;s hard to find a place with a large beer selection (for the husband) that also offers vegetarian foods. 

I ordered the Gardein &#34;chicken&#34; strips. Boring, I know. I just really miss fried chicken. Haha I took one bite and was questioning if they accidently gave me meat. The &#34;chicken&#34; strips were sooo tasty! The texture wasn&#39;t too chewy and they were crispy and perfect on the outside. I found myself wanting to order more. (I didn&#39;t ) 

We also ordered the trio option for dessert. This came with crème brûlée, peach apple cobbler, chocolate soufflé cake. I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the dessert. The crème brûlée has the weird tasting chocolate in it that totally ruined it. The cobbler was my favorite out of the three. 

I honestly can&#39;t wait to go back and get more of the Gardein &#34;chicken&#34; strips!"

The beer was great and the music they were streaming was pretty good.  The French fries were good too. The rest of the food left much to be desired. Fish (from the fish and chips) was VERY fishy tasting, the chicken strips were bland, the jambalaya rice was sweet (found that difficult to wrap my mind around. Why sugar the rice? The enchilada stack sounded interesting, but there was an off taste in places but not throughout. Stick with simple far and enjoy the IPAs."

First, I&#39;m a beer lover and I love the variety (though I would recommend that you consider replacing a few with some more interesting micro-brews from the area, we have many that are awesome - my suggestions would be Billies Chilies and a couple of good sours).
 
Second, I&#39;m a pescetarian (for now) and my BF is a lifelong vegetarian, so we really, really love the Gardein section of the menu. It&#39;s awesome and I wish other chains would do this, but until that happens, we&#39;ll eat at YH anytime we are near one. We especially love the veggie buffalo wings - they were perfectly cooked here, crispy under the spicy sauce. 

As usual, we ordered the &#34;wings.&#34; When they arrived, there were a measly 3 pieces of celery in the basket. Since we order this dish EVERY TIME we come to a YH, we know that there&#39;s usually about 5-6 pieces. I asked about them, and the guy who was delivering them from the kitchen said he&#39;d ask the kitchen - but there might be an EXTRA CHARGE for any more pieces. I was shocked. We explained that the dish wasn&#39;t typical, and we know because we order it often. I  asked him to check with the kitchen, but if they decided they wanted to charge us for a couple extra pieces (we only wanted 2 or 3 more), I didn&#39;t want that - instead, I told him, I would want to talk to a manager. When he came back from the kitchen, with a basket of WAY more celery than I asked for (or needed), he came clean and told the truth: they were simply running short on celery and were trying to conserve. Jeez. Why didn&#39;t they tell the servers to let customers know when they&#39;re ordering? Or simply provide the normal portion until they run  out and then tell people they&#39;re out? Or, better yet...why didn&#39;t someone run down the street to the store and buy a bunch of celery? It&#39;s cheap! 

We will be back. But, we were definitely annoyed by the lack of customer service for a small request (and a threat of an upcharge to try dissuading us)."

I really like the food and beer at Yard House.  I&#39;ve been eating here and another location in Lakewood for about 12 years.  Their food menu is varied and thoughtful.  Their beer selection is incredible.

I&#39;m very disappointed with their recent beer prices, however.  Perhaps the overhead on the 16th st mall is super high, but who charges $7 for a beer?  That&#39;s pretty ridiculous."

When everyone arrived, our waiter promptly took our orders. We were celebrating a birthday, so we got two free mini desserts to share with our party of 5. Both were delicious.

The BBQ Chicken Salad is my favorite thing on the menu. There&#39;s so many toppings that it doesn&#39;t really feel like you&#39;re eating a salad. I always ask for the chicken to be warm, since it&#39;s typically served cold. The half size is the perfect meal portion for my wife, but of course I always get the full size."

Tacos never disappoint, burgers are always excellent, but the new addition this time was the pork chops. Juicy, and well prepared with an apple cider sauce to go with it. The other was the lobster garlic noodles which had a healthy portion of seafood and tasty noodles in peanut oil. Both were impressive and worth adding to the list of regular options, though I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had anything bad here."

It is a chain, so you can&#39;t expect much in the way of quality. Still, for the prices they charge they should do better than a microwave. 

Portions are huge here, much like their oversized bankets. If you order something, you probably won&#39;t finish or need a box.

It&#39;s too much to ask for them to cook your burger to the proper temperature, hopefully you like charcoal.  Also, your meal will likely be cold by the time they bring it to you after spending plenty of time in the window.  

The calamari is unseasoned, and the desserts are a molten mess of diabetes in a pan.  

In all seriousness, there&#39;s probably a McDonald&#39;s not too far away, at least you won&#39;t overpay and you might get lucky with a fresh order of fries, both are beyond the Yard House&#39;s capabilities."

The customer service from the friendly servers was above and beyond all expectations. They are doing an excellent job and should be recognized for it. 

Yard House is a restaurant and bar that is known for featuring more beers on tap than anywhere you have ever been before. The food here is also really good! I had the enchilada stack and had no idea what to expect. When it arrived I was extremely surprised to see how much effort and pride that the cooks put into the presentation of my meal. 

Back to the reason I am writing this review, the service. I believe that our servers  name was Lynnea and she was the best ever. She walked us through the humongous beer menu, making great recommendations and proving that she actually knew what she was talking about. We told her that we had just gotten to Denver and were wondering about a good place to watch the college basketball championship. She took the time to hang out for a little and tell us all about Denver&#39;s sub districts and her favorite local spots. She even wrote everything down for us and taught us about the best ways to travel throughout the city. 

The location for the Yard House is brilliant. It is located right in the heart of downtown Denver and along the 16th street mall. If I lived in Denver than this would be a place I went to regularly. There isn&#39;t a single thing that I could find to complain about. If you are in the downtown area visiting, give this place a try and you will not regret it."

They have a great beer selection. It&#39;s overwhelming which is a good thing.

They have plenty of TV&#39;s which was great for a Saturday with many college football games on.

The food was really good. We got guacamole for an appetizer and we both had pizzas which were very tasty. I got the margherita and my dad got the ham and pineapple. The portions were huge which given the price really surprised me. It was a great value.

Went around 3:30pm and it was busy with customers but most were ordering drinks only so no reason for the kitchen to take super long with 1 appetizer and 1 entree. The food took around 30 minutes to come out, was lukewarm, and when we asked for some paper napkins, we were brought bathroom paper towels. Kinda gross. Having barely eaten breakfast, we were too hungry to even bother mentioning it. The weird thing is that they had plenty of servers so there&#39;s no reason why the food should be cold. It probably would have tasted better if it was warm, but the food was ok. 

Besides all that, the entree I ordered came with significantly less vegetables than normal for that dish. I saw another review in which someone mentioned them conserving celery.. Is there a produce shortage in Denver?"

My husband ordered a burger medium- it came out well done! They also didn&#39;t have the whiskey he drinks.  Our waiter did offer to have another burger made, but my husband declined. The manager also came to our table (without us asking) to see if he could have another burger made or if we would like dessert. We thanked him, but told him that wasn&#39;t necessary. The burger wasn&#39;t so bad that it wasn&#39;t edible.  I thought that was great customer service just because so many places will just dismiss it if you don&#39;t make a big deal.

There is a large selection of discounted food options at rhe Yard House, which defines itself as American fusion cuisine, including Asian and Mexican flare.  I tried the Blue Crad Cakes ($7).  These were were fresh and slightly spicy, though had a little too much filling for my taste especially with the deep fried panko bread crumb like crust.  I also tried the Seared Ahi Sashimi ($8) served with red cabbage slaw with a soy vinaigrette.  This dish was fresh and tasty and complement well by the tangy slaw accompaniment.  Portions were appropriate to large.  Personal preference, I would probably not select the crab cakes again, since I have had more impressive elsewhere.  I would opt for the the Seared Ahi again, but also look forward to sampling thier large selection of other Happy Hour fare, including a very considerable portion of Poke Nachos, always look forward to discovering a good calamari, and their pizzas ($6 on their happy hour menu looked very appealing.

There seemed to be a bit of confusion with the servers, as it was super packed. Our food ended up taking over an hour, and it turned out that there were some issues with the kitchen. The assistant managers, Bobby and Jordin, were super nice and came by to check on us. They even comped our table! I do wish that we had received an explanation of what was going on earlier, but I imagine they were working their way through a packed restaurant of slightly peeved guests.

In terms of the food and drink, the drink list was super awesome. They have a great selection of beer, cocktails, and wine. For food, I had the kale Caesar salad with chicken. I was a bit skeptical at first, as it had both raisins and pistachios, but they ended up being super tasty. The chicken was well-cooked, and the salad was fresh. The raisins added a nice sweetness, and the pistachios added a very rich, nutty flavor to counterbalance the bitterness of the kale. The main stain on the night food-wise is that one of our party had an almost completely raw burger. They however came back to remedy the situation. Overall, I had a decent experience regardless of all the oddities and hope to come back and try some other stuff some time soon."

   ---   ---   ---

What do you do on the majority of your drive from Aspen to Denver? I&#39;ll tell you what I do:

Hardcore research on the best brewery to visit for our last night in town, before we take a red-eye home.

But that can&#39;t take 4 hours, you ask? Well, as you know, reception on that drive isn&#39;t the best. And Sunday nights aren&#39;t the best for visiting breweries. So many of them were closed by about 8:00 when we were getting into town. Others were way off the beaten path, and some just had a tap list that didn&#39;t seem worth the trek.

So... I had Yard House as the back-up the entire time, and ended up having to go that route. There&#39;s TONS of beer here, but almost nothing that I hadn&#39;t already seen a million times at places all around the country. It&#39;s weird - there are now places that can have 50+ taps, but not really feel like they have a great selection.

And while Yard House wasn&#39;t really what I was looking for, I can&#39;t really rate a place 3 stars with that much beer... even if it&#39;s mostly not local."

We got truffle fries ( basically garlic Parmesan fries) , French onion soup , a Margherita pizza, and a large brownie for desert. The food was warm, the soup in particular was piping hot, and aided the beer we drank. I ordered Breckinridge brewery agave nectar.

Usually I prefer the bar, as service is faster, but we experienced exceptional service at a table. Both our waiters were quick and attentive, including informing us that the first was leaving and introducing us to our new one.

We also had the pleasure to speak to Jordan, the manager, as we were inquiring about doing a group dinner. Unfortunately they don&#39;t have the facilities we were looking for, but Jordan asked his staff for ideas of other places and sat down with us to chat about it. Truly friendly and helpful.

And I finally had some of their food. The carnitas tacos are delicious, and there are many other tasty sounding options. Will probably avoid the fish taco next time, as it was a bit bland.

Beer list has gotten a bit more diverse since my previous visits, but they could still mix it up a bit more with brands and special tappings.

All in all, a good place to chill with beers and bites, and pleasant wait service."

We asked to sit on the Patio on a Tuesday afternoon. Not too busy. The host proceeded to tell us there were no tables on the patio(there were at least 4-5 that I saw we were willing to wait). The host didn&#39;t like when we mentioned this. Proceeded to take us to the farthest deepest corner of the resturant. So we left. I was on Vacation this was ridiculous

Came in after a couple of drinks at the bar ready for some American food.  Was sat for a party of 3 one in route immediately.  The place was VERY busy but luckily we got a booth and got some drinks!  Finally I am not sober driver this night so I got my fav which is a Cosmo, the drinks were mixed nice and it was a cosmo not a vodka cranberry.  Thank god some bartenders really do not know the difference... 

Checking out the menu and they had some great options and Yelp of course helped me out as well.  I chose something I haven&#39;t had in a few years and kept calling my name, the cuban with truffle fries. (truffle fries are a weakness of mine)  My sandwich was delicious a nice thick cut of pork with the right amount of sauce and was so large I could only eat half.  Luckily I had a fridge in the room sadly I couldn&#39;t eat the other half with all the other great places we tried! 

Service was on Par and the drinks came when one was empty and since I was not sober driver for once I greatly appreciated that!  LOL

Great food/cooks, Good bartenders and a Great server."

And when she brought it to me she told me that if it was still too much to let her know. Wife ordered the vegan burger and also a house salad. Waitress asked if she was truly vegan, or were the croutons in the salad ok. Wife enjoyed the vegan burger and house salad. I would recommend this place to everyone.

Today I decided to try to-go lunch with a co-worker. Service was great but I&#39;m disappointed in my food. Although it tasted wonderful, I paid approximately $4.50 a piece for a single street taco. My hand was waaay bigger than the tortilla and I&#39;m a 5&#39;2&#34; woman. My issue here is portion size vs price.

I ordered a blackened swordfish one and a carnitas one.

The blackened swordfish was delicious... I&#39;ve never had swordfish before but this was a perfect introduction, albiet I got two pieces of meat instead of it being packed full. Please please please look at the photos. Yard House nailed the flavor combos and swordfish had the consistency of a tender steak and wasn&#39;t very fishy at all.

Carnitas are one of my favorite dishes. I got a decent proportion of meat for the size of the tortilla, but was still disappointed by how overwhelmingly tiny a portion this was for lunch. It was very delicious, however.

I think I&#39;ll just stick to drinks and shared appetizers here. I know it&#39;s located adjacent/within the Sheraton and the ingredients are very fresh, but then again, so is a $6 sandwich."

I ordered pineapple chicken with fried rice. The Chicken was too burnt but the waiter said that is how it was suppose to be. I tried to eat it but could not even take three bites out of it.

My girlfriend and I stopped here while walking down the mall - we&#39;re suckers for a place that advertises itself as having the most beers on tap in the world. We found a seat at the bar and was immediately greeted by a very friendly bartender. We ordered our beers and an order of the Deviled Eggs ($3). The beer list is massive and are arranged by taste/type (Light, Fruity, Wheat, Malty, etc.). The beers tasted fine but were a little expensive - they cost between $6-7, and one of those was a Blue Moon. The deviled eggs were really good - spicy with a little bit of egg on the bottom of each one so they didn&#39;t slide around the plate. 

Overall, for pure draft beer variety you can&#39;t go wrong (the rest of the menu must be good since this place was packed at lunch). Just know that it&#39;s probably a bit more expensive than bars further away from the touristy areas."

Visit was at midnight on a Friday. Place was packed which certainly surprised me.  Very dark inside with electronic candles which didn&#39;t work.  I had to use my phone to illuminate the beer menu. This was a bit of a turn off.

The music was VERY LOUD to an uncomfortable degree.  And crappy electronic club music.  That&#39;s probably my problem but crappy, loud music makes me cranky.

Beer menu is impressive, I guess, although the novelty isn&#39;t quite the same after having visited a number of brew pubs within walking distance that night and the days before.  They advertise they have the world&#39;s largest selection of draft beers so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true, but for whatever reason it was almost too much.  A lot of it is European,  but also nothing SO unique that I felt like I was being treated to something.  This is a problem when the menu is so massive.  Shouldn&#39;t I have found something fun? Instead, it was slogging through lines and lines of beers I didn&#39;t want to drink.  Again, maybe this is my problem. 

We ordered the nachos which were giant.  Decent food.  

Service was spotty. Waiter was nice, but given it was the night before Halloween he must have had a costume as a ghost because we rarely saw him.  Beers came quick but we had to track down someone to grab a soft drink for one of our party.  It took awhile to get the check, too but we saw others having the same problem.  

Did I mention it was loud?  Good heavens.  

2 stars for a mixture of me just not liking the joint and for spotty service.  Much better places to go in the area of you&#39;re a beer drinker.  Oh, and for it being LOUD!


Updated after the comment by the business: Clearly this is a business that cares about its consumers and I very much appreciated their comment.  If it had been high energy classic rock I probably wouldn&#39;t have had the same issues and really had we come earlier in the evening I&#39;m sure my waiter would have been more attentive to my beer needs.  I would give this place another shot, maybe earlier in the day and when I had time to really explore the menu with help."

Yard House offers traditional American cuisine with their own flare. We visited during happy hour and got a great bang for our buck. Half price pizzas, sliders and appetizers. They also offered drink specials on everything from beer to martinis. 

With the friendly service and tasty options Yard House is a desirable option for winding down. Be sure to try the buffalo wings and the local pilsner, it takes seven minutes to pour but it&#39;s worth the wait. We also tried the classic and bearnaise sliders and they were both awesome options.

My usual fave is the chicken tenders piled up with some fries for $6... best deal in town! My last occasion I happened to also have the Margherita pizza and g&#39;all darn that was good too and only for $6.  

These delicious treats along with $4 off import/craft half yards and you got yourself a nice little deal to start the night!  Unfortunately, I have been here during normal hours and the prices typically deter me from having quite as good of a time so I really can only recommend the HH.

Also a choice between warmed up corn or flour tortillas, pico and choice of spicy sauce for $14.99. Placed order with a female associate possibly daughter or family member. The gentlemen who packed the food was friendly but the lady was not, maybe it wasn&#39;t her day or she was tired? The horchata was not good, couldn&#39;t even distinguish taste or how long it&#39;s been circulating in the machine. I actually threw it out. It was like sweet water but with a weird aftertaste and a small was $2.75. As soon as I ordered I heard the beeps of a microwave and I was the only customer in the whole place ordering. Ummm not sure about this. I watched her get ice with a scoop on the side of the ice machine because she couldn&#39;t reach the one on top. I could see her irritation. The man was friendly and explained what was in the bag. I paid by cc and she watched to see if I was gona tip. Still unsure of this because I am ordering and picking up myself and I could see her eyes on me when I put a 0 and just signed the amt. 
The food: The chicken skin was crispy and had descent flavor. The potato salad had a creamy texture of mashed potatoes and a different flavor and just not sure of the texture... The beans were mediocre and the rice was fluffy and taste ok. The pico was like a day old but spicy with the looks of the wilted cilantro. The spicy sauce was different. Maybe because it was a Sunday and slow but I was not wowwed. It was just ok and the chicken at Costco for $4.99 would be my choice next time.

Lots of options, from salads, burritos, tacos and of course the roasted chicken!! The potato salad is very creamy and delicious. They have a variety of bottled sodas as well. I would highly recommend if you&#39;re looking for a substantial meal on the go, or looking for something to take home to the family to avoid cooking.

You get salsa, tortillas, and 3 sides with the whole chicken meal.  They look small, but once you build a plate, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s a lot of food. I think 3-4 people could easily eat from that order. Please give it a try!

If you are from Southern California, and/or you&#39;ve had El Pollo Loco, it is like this only much, much, much better."

I don&#39;t know what spices are on the skin, but they are magical! This is the first and only place I rush to eat the dark meat because I don&#39;t want to miss out on all the chickeney goodness. I&#39;m pretty much a white meat/ breast only chicken eater..not here!  The first time my husband saw me gnawing on the little wing bits.. He said..&#34;who are you and where did my wife go?&#34; Tonight we ordered a whole chicken and medium sides ( rice, beans, pico de gallo and potato salad) for $14.99. ( side note:  The wonderful folks who run the place make this homemade salsa that is full of heat and just a touch of smokiness that sets off the flavor of the chicken so well...don&#39;t miss out on it! ) Even though I was worried about leftovers...we ate every single bit of that bird! With glistening fingertips,  I was only left with sadness that I didn&#39;t have room for more!

I&#39;ve been looking for a &#39;Mexican chicken&#39; place since I moved here last summer and when I saw a recent Yelp review a few weeks back, I knew I had to check this place out.  In DFW, I had a place called El Pollo Regio that I frequented to get my chicken, beans, and rice fix.  In SoCal, I had El Pollo Loco (even though it&#39;s a chain, it was pretty decent).  So a couple weeks ago I headed over to Juan&#39;s Super Pollo.

I went on a Monday to check it out for lunch with the plan to also get takeout for dinner if it was any good.  To begin with, they have a lunch combo for $6.99 that&#39;s not only delicious, but a hell of a deal.  For that price, you get two pieces of chicken, two sides, tortillas, and pico.  I got beans and rice as my sides and the two pieces of chicken I got were a thigh and a breast (you can pay $1 more for all white meat).  This was a lot of food for $7!  And it was good!  While I was there, I noticed an ad on their wall for the Monday special - $20.99 for the Family Pack (normally $24.99, this is two whole chickens cut up of course, your choice of three large sides, tortillas, pico, and house salsa).  It sounded like a deal so I got it for takeout, as well as buying some extra pico.  So for about $25 I ended up with enough food for me and the Hubs not only for dinner, but also two days&#39; worth of lunches for us - roughly $4 a meal!  My one economical purchase for the week!  I think on Thursdays they have a special on the Jumbo Pack, which is three chickens with extra large sides, etc. for $31.99.

They also do salads, chicken bowls, tacos, and burritos, but the whole chicken packs are the way to go for feeding a crowd, economy, or both.  I noticed they have pricing for party packs of larger quantities of chicken if you&#39;re planning a really big crowd (you might want to call them first if you want the 20-chicken party pack, though).

The décor in this restaurant is non-existent.  It&#39;s very clean (even the restroom), but not really a place to take a date or spend much time.  The day I went, the TV was blaring which is why I&#39;m giving them four stars instead of five.  No one was watching it and there were only diners at two other tables. Plus they had music going on the other side of the room.  My suggestion to the owners - turn the festive music up a tad and mute the TV.  I think the folks working there were the owners and they were very friendly.  I like supporting the local Mom-and-Pops.

Anyway, all of the food I had from here was excellent and even though this place is out of the way for me, I will return for more of that tasty chicken!  Soon!"

I couldn&#39;t findcthe full menu online so the lady who answered the phone told me about their lunch special. I couldn&#39;t make up my mind on hot or mild salsa so I asked for both. I only got one container so maybe the salsas were combined? Not sure but it was spicy, good spicy though. They had a good selection of drinks as well (horchata, tamarindo, pina, jarritos, soda in glass bottles) Restaurant was very tidy. I work in the area and will be back!"

This restaurant may not stand out from the street, but it is worth the stop for the Thai and Filipino menu. The pork drunken noodles are amazing... Chow Sun doesn&#39;t make them as spicy as Thai Monkey Club, but the dish is tasty and full of flavor nonetheless.

I also had the strawberry smoothie last time I was here - it tasted like a dream... smooth, creamy, and full of fruity goodness.

Service is reasonably quick and friendly, but we tend to visit on Sunday afternoons when the restaurant isn&#39;t too full."

Being Filipino,  choices are pretty slim for dining and groceries.  The Lotus Market next door has probably the largest selection of Filipino groceries in Denver.  I heard the owner of Lotus also owns Chowsun so I couldn&#39;t wait to give them a try.

I was expecting to order and pay at the counter, but it appears they have changed to full service dining.  Service started very slow;  acknowledged quickly but took awhile to take our order.  From there, service was friendly and fast.

My wife and I decided to try the lumpia, Lechon Kawalli, Diniguan and Halo Halo for desert.  Lumpia was a little disappointing for me;  they were fresh and hot but reminded me of some of the Frozen lumpia available next door.  Lechon was very good and it would have blown me away if the skin was crispier.  The meat was a little dry so making the skin crispy would have likely really dried out the meat.  Diniguan was delicious, my favorite of the two entrees.

Halo Halo was perfect....not overly sweet and the Ube ice cream just topped it off! 

Pricing is a little high but not unreasonable.  Looking forward to trying some of there other Filipino dishes, Thai offerings and especially their Siopao.  Overall
3 stars price and value
4 stars overall for food because of selection and overall flavor
4 stars for service after overcoming a slow start"

The lumpia is great, and made fresh when ordered. I personally like the pancit bihon - the rice noodles are cooked to perfection! My husband likes the sisig because it&#39;s marinated well and so tender. And of course we end our meal with halo halo, because it&#39;s such a good treat.

It was my last day (really, it was my last meal) in Denver and I wish I had found Chowsun much, much earlier!  I was in the mile high city for work, and I wasn&#39;t sure if my co-worker would go for Filipino food, plus it was out of the way from our work site.  So I waited until the weekend when my hubby came and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s glad I did.

After a week of not eating rice (c&#39;mon, I am Filipino after all), I was craving something from the motherland.  So on our way to the airport we stopped here.  Chowsun is located in a strip mall, next to an Asian grocery store.  You walk in and order your meal from a menu board at the counter.  The menu features mostly Filipino food, but there are some Thai dishes as well.  

I ordered the tapsilog/longsilog combo and my hubby ordered the longsilog.  The dishes each came with garlic rice and a fried egg (as it should).  I don&#39;t know what longanisa they used (whether they make it in-house, or if it&#39;s one that I&#39;ve never tried, but it was really, really good)!  The tapa had a perfect meat-to-fat ratio and it was seasoned well, without tasting overly salty, as I&#39;ve had in other places.  We shouldn&#39;t have, but we ordered dessert.  I had the ginitaan bilo bilo (tapioca balls and other fruits cooked in coconut cream) and my husband had the halo-halo (crushed ice with ube ice cream, evaporated milk, and various other items). 

We really wanted to try more food items, but (1) we were stuffed and (2) we had a plane to catch.  For sure, if we ever make it back to the Denver area, we will be stopping by!"

My wife had the Pad Thai and I had BBQ pork sticks with a side of Lumpia.  Both dishes were excellent with large portions.  Service was fast and friendly.  Three other diners in the restaurant.  There was one group of Filipina ladies that could have been a little quieter but, we still enjoyed the food.  Will definitely go back."

Fast casual dining. The ambiance Taylor&#39;s to this fact. 
The good comes out relatively fast and the presentation is acceptable but the best part of the visit are the flavors associated with the food. 
We started with the basics lumpiA Shanghai. The were very good, crispy and moist. The adobo we ordered was fantastic. The chicken was moist and the flavors were bursting from the chicken. Did they use a slow cooker for this??? 
The beef calderas a had very good flavors but the meat was dry.

We have been a regular to Lotus Asian Market next door, ever since our moved to Colorado.  Then when we found out that the Owners of Lotus Asian Market, intends to open a restaurant, we are super excited.  NOW, FINALLY CHOW SUN has opened their doors for patrons to enjoy what they offer aka FILIPINO and THAI cuisine...

When we arrived, THANKFULLY we arrived before the MAD DINNER RUSH...

Yes, you order at the Counter, pay your order, get your ticket/receipt and they will call your order Number.  

From what I could recall we ordered these following items :

*  Chicken Eggroll ($2.95)
*  Green Chicken Curry ($7.95)
*  BBQ Chicken Skewer ($7.25)
*  Aloha Canned Drink ($0.95)
*  Canned Soda ($0.75)

YES, everything comes in those disposable containers what nots..

YES, the food comes out hot either from the Wok, or the FRYER...

But in terms of flavors, YES THEY can DO BETTER...

Hubs order of Thai Green Chicken Curry was NOT SPICY at all, aka NOT THAI HOT that we requested...  Yes the flavor tones, of sweet, sour and spicy is there.. but NOT to our taste bud THAI HOT...  Oh Well..

As for the BBQ Chicken Skewer, its 3 skewers, comes with Rice and Shredded Cabbage and Carrots with some kind of dressing.  In terms of BBQ Chicken Skewer, its marinated with some BBQ sauce, comes out tender, though I wish they could &#34;elevate&#34; either by grilling or marinated more with other Spices etc..  

The Highlight of our Dinner, was perhaps the Chicken Eggroll.  Hubs kept on raving on those.. as outside it was Crunchy with Eggroll Wrapper, and it comes out hot from the Fryer!

After our Dinner, I also ordered the Honeydew Boba Smoothie ($3.95), which was just OK.  It ONLY comes in 1 cup size.  It more like &#34;slushie&#34; but the BOBA itself some overdone or overcooked.

All in all, Chow Sun has DEFINITELY ROOM For Improvement, and we don&#39;t mind returning when needed coz there are many other items we want to try in our next mission to Chow Sun.  Or perhaps to order TO GO ITEMS from here.  

We were somewhat felt &#34;rushed&#34; at this recent visit coz a BIG GROUP of Patrons tend to take all the seats..  right after we came and order our food.  YES, everyone from the Owners and the Staffs, are inviting, helpful and friendly.  The establishment is kept clean and the Decor Design is modern and simple.

Above anything else, we hope and pray for the success of CHOW SUN many more years to come.  Thank you CHOW SUN, see you soon...  3.5 stars at best for Chow Sun for this visit.  Left this establishment at about 18:30hrs ish.

CHOW SUN is open EVERYDAY from 10am to 8pm.

I can&#39;t describe it very well other than to say you must give it a try once in your life.

Lechon kawali was delicious and boyfriend enjoyed it, but I felt like the meat part was a little dry and minimal; however, lots of delicious fat, of course (yum)! I was pleased that it came with Tomas sauce, and the kare-kare came with bagoong. 

Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed the kare-kare was beef pieces rather than the traditional oxtail. The vegetables were very soggy and I hate to say this, but the beef was dry and the sauce was kind of bland. Luckily, the bagoong gives it that authentic, homey, taste to it. I understand a lot of people have different styles of cooking different dishes, but I love having crunch in my veggies for kare-kare.

I&#39;ll definitely come back to try more of their dishes."

As the saying goes, patience is a virtue, and although the project took a little while to come to fruition, I can personally attest that the restaurant now in that spot, ChowSun, is worth the wait.

Start your meal with a couple of springy Siopao (steamed or fried buns filled with chicken or pork), or perhaps some Ukoy (shrimp fritters) while you ponder your next move. Why, they even have chopped and fried pig intestines (Chicharrón Bulaklak) if that doesn&#39;t sound too offal to you. (OK, I admit that was corny). If you arrive early enough in the day, you can try a breakfast specialty, like marinated beef (Tapa), milkfish (Daing na Bangus), or a variation on corned-beef hash (one of the United States&#39; historical gifts to the Philippines).

But if you woke up just a bit later than you planned, don&#39;t worry - there are still a number of culinary possibilities waiting for you. Kare-kare is a long-simmered beef stew fragrant with peanuts and annatto seeds, and chock-full of soft eggplant, green beans, and bok choy. (Don&#39;t forget to ask for the little container of purple fermented shrimp paste [Bagoong] on the side to really make it sing!). But then again, the quintessentially Pinoy garlic/soy/vinegar chicken dish called Adobong Manok is equally likely to get those salivary glands working overtime. And I can&#39;t forget those moist, plump, juicy BBQ pork skewers either. (Each main course also comes with a nice big scoop of steamed jasmine rice in case you thought they&#39;d forgotten). 

Oh, some members of your party were more in the mood for Chinese, or Japanese, or even Thai? Never fear - ChowSun has you covered in this scenario as well. In addition to three (count &#39;em!) Thai-style curries - red, green, and the Indian-influenced one known as Mussaman - you can also avail yourselves of noodle offerings which have been the pride of Siam for centuries, such as Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. Dishes representing Japan include wheat noodles and assorted veggies fried in oyster sauce [Yakisoba] as well as a version of chicken teriyaki. And folks seeking a little Chinese-food lovin&#39; won&#39;t be disappointed by fried rice (available with several choices of protein) or the like-chow-mein-but-even-tastier creation called Pancit Canton.

Complete your meal with a boba drink (I like the one with molasses-based black sugar in particular) and a dessert such as Gulaman (sweetened grass-jelly cubes) or even the fruit/beans/milk/crushed ice extravaganza known as Halo-Halo. [BURP]. Oh wow, excuse me - that was a bit rude. But after you&#39;ve tasted all the delicious items at ChowSun, I think you&#39;ll sympathize."

We got the bangus, sisig, lumpia and pancit bihon. Everything was alright but I definitely won&#39;t be going back for the sisig or the lumpia. I like Sunburst Grill much more so far. This place is no where NEAR authentic but not ready to give up on this place though so maybe I&#39;ll have to try different dishes."
chowsun-aurora,Privat E.,cOm74EDERn7FCF4F95UfvQ,"Broomfield, CO",0,1,0,31,22,Jb6MRMZbuBOI75XNdZpxSg,2.0,2015-06-21,"Yesterday was my second time eating at Chow Sun. The first one was when they first opened. Back then, there was definitely a crowd. Yesterday, there was just one other table occupied (dinner time). 

CLEANLINESS. Things are clean and nicely laid out. They got it right.

SERVICE. It&#39;s counter service. I think they are efficient. 

FOOD. This is where it&#39;s really mixed. Let me make an important distinction here. My perspective is coming from a Filipino guy that can cook Filipino food well. My expectation is for Filipino food to at least meet or exceed food I grew up with in the Philippines. That said, the food that I tried did not satisfy the &#34;authenticity&#34; test:

* Tapsilog - a traditional Filipino breakfast combo I look forward to eating even for dinner especially last night. I was especially looking forward to dipping the meat in spiced vinegar. 

Overall, the Tapsilog did not meet expectations and surprisingly so. I really did not expect them to fail on the tapa itself. It&#39;s so easy. Beef, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, salt, pepper, and sugar. That&#39;s all there is to it. The tapa they served did not resemble any tapa I have ever seen/tasted anywhere in the Philippines or in Filipino households here in America (I asked and they insisted that it was tapa). It was odd. The appearance was more like a cross between Tocino and Tapa. Kinda red kinda darkish but  did not taste like either. I ate it anyway so as not to waste food. It was edible but just not tapa.

It also came with garlic rice, egg, and longganisa. The rice was okay. The egg was not the sunny side up I was expecting just fried to a crisp on the outside and kinda rubbery on the inside. The vinegar was store bought, which is okay I guess. Unexpectedly, it also came with sweet longganisa (Filipino sausage). Nothing special. Feels store bought and fried. It was close enough to a mediocre Filipino brand of sausage so I would say it&#39;s authentic. Not spectacular but authentic enough. 

* Curry - I actually honestly enjoyed their curries. It&#39;s definitely NOT Filipino-style curry but who cares... it tastes good. I like it spicy and they make it spicy.  

* Lechon Kawali - They got this acceptably right although the portion size was a bit small. I still prefer the way they make it (and portion size) at PinoyPinay in Panorama City (LA Area). Chowsun&#39;s rendition had nice texture on the meat and crunch on the skin. However, this crunch was not like the chicharon-like crunch from PinoyPinay. But I guess it passes the authenticity test - I can see this served in the Philippines just not at a place I would consider that makes it &#39;just right&#39;. If they can achieve the &#34;lechon&#34; style meat taste and texture combined with the chicharon crunch  - now that would be awesome!

* Pork BBQ in Skewers - We had this in our first visit and I still remember it being okay but not quite there yet. It was a little dry and the taste wasn&#39;t particularly Filipino. Chowsun&#39;s was more akin to Indonesian satay than Filipino BBQ. It doesn&#39;t have that delicious interplay of sweet (from brown sugar and banana ketchup), sour (mainly from Calamansi lemons), salty (from soy sauce), and spice (from garlic, pepper, and maybe from using &#39;hot&#39; banana ketchup) - I just made this last week. For reference, try the one at Sunburst Grill. I think they have a better rendition of this although theirs incorporate peanut sauce, which is not exactly part of the traditional recipe but does work. 

* Halo Halo - This one is good. For most places, I do not expect homemade ingredients and just the pre-bottled kind. The format is like Jollibee&#39;s and that&#39;s alright. Nothing stunning but it was tasty. For reference, what I consider the best Halo Halo I&#39;ve ever had was in South Cotabato. It was served in a coconut husk with all ingredients artisan-made. The coconut water also somehow made it into the halo halo I was just not sure how. You can taste the difference. This is not necessarily a comment against Chowsun&#39;s version just a reference to what I consider great and so far unmatched by many commercialized versions of the halo halo.

Overall, I am disappointed with this place. I do not think I am going back. Other reviewers seem to like the adobo and pancit. That&#39;s great I really hope they improve. For now, I think I&#39;ll stick with Sunburst Grill and any other (crossing fingers) Filipino restaurants that come along. I think a major (though not insurmountable) obstacle to Chowsun being more authentic is just the mere fact that they are not owned nor operated (staffed in the back maybe?) by Filipinos and while eating there was never really anyway for me to chime in on how the food tasted or how I liked it. It&#39;s a shame though since a good Filipino restaurant located right next to the only Filipino-centric grocery store in the Denver Metro area makes a lot of business sense. It&#39;s just not good enough... YET! I wish them all the luck and that they would strive to improve and achieve a &#34;Go To&#34; status"

There were two of us, and we had the chicken pad Thai, a chicken steam bun, and the bbq chicken skewers. Everything was delicious and fresh. 

The cons were that they&#39;re only serving food in disposable take away containers, and because of that their trash was overflowing. 
There was also a really big lack of veggies with the bbq skewers. I had two pieces of cold steamed broccoli, and three pieces of cut raw carrots. It felt like an afterthought. Maybe in the future they could add more veggies that are warm. It would really be the icing on a already very good dish."

The place is clean and got my food fast. I tried the pork bbq. A+ on the portion and taste. Reminds me of the times I would buy bbq at the corner street vendor. BBQ on a stick is classic Pinoy. I only gave this 4 stars because I think they can improve on their condiment that goes with the food. Shredded cabbage and carrots topped with ranch is not a good combo. Make it truly Pinoy and use atchara and/ or vinegar with garlic to balance out the flavor. The bbq has a sweet taste to it so it would have been really nice to have it with my meal rather than ranch dressing."

I ordered the Mami Soup, Beef Caldereta, and Pancit Bihon combo to go. After my 50 minute drive back to Denver, I then pulled out my to go dishes and was really disappointed in what I paid for. How is it that I paid almost $10 for Beef Caldereta and the rice was in the larger compartment than the actual entree!? If I knew I was going to pay for mostly rice, I would have passed on this place. Then onto the combo pancit.... And no shrimp, barely any meat. $11 for noodles.   Even more disappointing!? As for taste, the authentic taste was missing. Makes me wonder of this was made by Filipinos or Thai (since part of the menu had Thai dishes). I highly doubt I&#39;ll be back again. 

If you&#39;re looking for authentic food, don&#39;t bother. It&#39;s worth a try, but this place may suit those who aren&#39;t familiar with this cuisine."

Denver has a mainstay place in the Sunburst Grill, but service and food there can be hit or miss, but it&#39;s never top shelf.  Chow Sun avoids some of the issues with service because it&#39;s counter service.   They have 4 or 5 people in the back cooking to order, and depending on the day or time maybe 2 or 3 up front, so they are better staffed and they have a comparable number of tables.

Since the owner is Tum from Lotus Asian Market they seem also to have freshers and more ample stock for preparation.  And just like Lotus Asian the place has been meticulously clean each of the 4 times we&#39;ve gone there.

The menu has changed and bit, they added Lechon Kawali and it seems both larger and tighter.  They&#39;ve learned a lot about this business in the three or four months since they opened.

Sure at Sunburst you get real plates and at CS you get take away cartons, but I think the foods a touch better, the service is better and my hands have never stuck to the table when I say down.

The menu is broader than Sunburst&#39;s as well, with Filipino classics like Pansit, Sisig, Bangus, Chicken  BBQ, Siopo, Sisig, Turon, Lumpia, Dinuguon, etc and etc.  But also PadThai, Masaman curry, Tom Yum, Drunken Noodles, Soba etc.   They don&#39;t server baluts but if you need to they have them at the store next door.  There&#39;s somethings us Kanos won&#39;t always eat.

This is a great little restaurant in a strip mall off Buckley, the difference is that the values of this hard working family show in the quality of their food.

Oh and the Halo Halo is top notch..."

We had Tapsilog, Bansilog, Longsilog, Pork Lumpia, Pork Siopao, and Fried Pork Buns. All of their breakfast plates come with an egg and cucumbers, missing tomatoes though. How can you serve Filipino without tomatoes!? The eggs were over cooked also. The Bansilog that we had ordered was missing an egg when the menu states it comes with an egg.  Their Boba was actually good and their Thai Iced Tea. They serve Thai food as well. I actually had their Pad Thai here a month ago, pretty decent. The only one I found good enough to eat here in Denver area. Rated 2 stars because the food needs a little improvment. Can&#39;t half ass your food. &#34;Chow Sun?&#34; sounds like a knock off of &#34;Chow King&#34; from Cali obviously with better food.

The Thai tea tasted like other Thai teas I&#39;ve had and was strong and creamy.  There was a very nice green beans with chicken curry sauce.  The garlic rice was interesting and had to take it home and the plain rice was pretty decent and tasted fresh. I also tried the Pilipino version of a egg roll it has a nice thin dough crust.  I also tried the banana fritter which was a quarter of a banana wrapped in the same dough as the Pilipino egg roll and deep fried then sprinkled with a little confectioner sugar.  I loved the thing.  As a dessert its not very sweet.  I actually would order it as a appetizer or side to my main meal.  The garlic rice was nice.  Its not like a fried rice full of soy sauce.  Its the regular  rice with very fine fried garlic powder sprinkled on the top with I think some green onion and possibly other seasonings.  Like most rice dishes It didn&#39;t reheat well in the morning in the microwave but still had a ok taste.  Best served fresh  A very big portion so two people could share it as a light simple bowl of rice lunch.   I also looked around the dining room and thought the place was pretty much spotless.  Ordered more than I normally do just to try a few new things.  Overall happy with the meal and a nice surprise.  Update went back again food ok warning found out the do not have a public bathroom.  Had to return home to wash hands.  Planned trip to park and eat dinner watching sunset cancelled.  Why would a restaurant not have a public bathroom? Removing a star

None of us have been there before, and we ordered a couple of appetizers and main dishes to share them so we could all sample several items.  I heard it was a filipino restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised to see they offered many Thai dishes as well (I have been looking for a Thai restaurant closer to my work).
The staff was very friendly and the the food was very good; lots of flavor, my favorite was the Pork Adobo. All of my coworkers and I thought everything was good. 
The only reason I am giving Chowsun 3-stars (not 4 or 5) is because of how we received our food.  In most restaurants, all of the people at a table receive their food at the same time so they can all eat together.  That was not our experience.  Instead of bringing all of our food out at once, one person received their food and the rest of us waited... and waited... and waited. Then the second person got there food, and again we waited &amp; waited, until the next person to get their food... and so on, and on.  This was the only negative comment: the very slow service."

2 1/2 stars.

We ordered a few things to see how good it was. 

-We didn&#39;t like the shrimp pad thai. It had a weird taste.
-Lumpia was ok. No bold flavor. But still ok.
-Pork skewers were ok, thin. Only came with a scoop of white rice. 
-pork adobo was very good. 
-coconut smoothie was uh, okay.

I wanted thai boba tea. (I love thai boba tea).. but they wouldn&#39;t do it for me. I thought it was weird but doesn&#39;t really factor into my overall score much."

I&#39;m not easy to please when it comes to Filipino food, adobo especially. Their chicken adobo is spot on. The lumpia rolls are thinner then my Gma makes them but their still good. Skewers are pretty damn good and $1.50 each! I&#39;ve had the panang and green curries. Both are great but I prefer the panang, medium or spicy. The spicy level is totally enjoyable. The wife really likes the pad thai. It&#39;s a very generous serving size. It&#39;s very typical and very delicious. The chef has Filipino specials available which are nice for regulars. The menu is large and paralyzing for those not familiar but the staff are very helpful and pleasant. 

It is modestly decorated and not a place to expect much other than delicious food. 

For those who haven&#39;t enjoyed Filipino food before, start with the adobo chicken. You won&#39;t be sorry. Don&#39;t doubt their thai chops either, it&#39;s allllll good."

(I hate Sunburst Grill).  This is a Filipino/Thai restaurant.  Bare in mind that I also have a Filipina mother who is an awesome cook.  So, I kinda know what I&#39;m talking about when it comes to good Filipino food, lol. 

When I first realized this place opened I went there about three different times in a month because I wanted to try almost all of the Filipino foods that I&#39;m familiar with and know that I like. I tried a little bit of the Thai food and boba as well. Now, some of these dishes are made a little different than how my mom makes them, but they were still good.  Among these was the lumpia. Theirs is rolled thinner than I&#39;m used too, but it still had a flavor very close to my mom&#39;s lumpia. I&#39;m used to kare kare being made with ox tail, but the beef kare kare is still really good. I tried many other dishes and I wasn&#39;t dissappointed. The steamed siaopao, pork adobo, beef skewers, and pancit bihon - just to name a few. The halo halo and boba are friggin amazing here as well. I&#39;d never had or even heard of &#34;popping&#34; boba before trying it here, but it is crazy good.

The menu choices here go on seemingly forever, which usually worries me with small businesses. It seems like other restaurants who try this spread themselves too thin, but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any negative effect on the cooks. The food is always hot, fresh, and fast.

It is counter service here rather than waited service, which I think was a great idea. This makes sense since a lot of Americans are not familiar with a lot of Filipino and Thai dishes. Thus, they probably have a few questions. I know I&#39;ve asked those dudes a million questions about the Thai side and even the Filipino side of the menu. I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable doing so if I was being waited on while drastically and rudely slowing down other customers&#39; service. By the way, the service has been fast, friendly and knowledgeable every time I&#39;ve been there. If you&#39;re there just trying something different, the counter help can make some good suggestions for you.

Prices are very reasonable. Unless, you&#39;re gluttonous fat fu** like myself, you should be able to get a full meal for less than 10 bucks a person. 

Also, the Lotus Asian Market next door is owned by the same family. There are some other Filipino dishes you can get there that may not be available at Chowsun. Tocino, balut, and puto bread among many others. 

Anyway, I could rant and rave all day long about how awesome this place is, but you really should just check it out for yourself."

Ordered lumpia, diniguan, beef caldereta, and kare kare. Husband enjoyed the kare kare after he asked for some shrimp paste to go with it, the beef in the caldereta was a bit tough and so were the veggies, but the sauce was ok. The diniguan was good as left overs!  The sauce thickened a day later. Overall, the food was ok. I might be back for some more diniguan and maybe I&#39;ll try other Filipino dishes."

Arrived in the restaurant and didn&#39;t seem that busy, told to sit anywhere.  After about 10 minutes we hadn&#39;t been given a menu or anything so I just decided to go up to the front counter and get it myself.  Staff were hanging around there and didn&#39;t say anything.

Then it took a while for staff to come over and take our order, we waved to them but they ignored us, they were standing around doing nothing.  Just when we thought things were getting back on track we had received 2 wrong dishes so asked for the correct order.  Well, the staff member gave us really bad attitude, I really wasn&#39;t expecting that at all.  Eventually they agreed that they had made a mistake, we got 1 dish changed.

The food was not that impressive, tasted bland, had better but also had worse.  I would say the food is Americanized, even the more authentic Chinese style dishes.  I would say 1 out of the 5 dishes we ordered was good.  We had quite a few leftovers but just decided to throw it away.

From an ambience perspective its quite obvious they haven&#39;t put a lot of effort into the place but that&#39;s ok if it keeps the prices down, it appears to attract quite a few students.

It appears to be a family restaurant and they just don&#39;t gel together at all.  We heard arguments coming from the kitchen and they bought that into the main dinning area.  They appeared to have friends dinning in there and they got more attention than anybody else in the restaurant.  Some customers were leaving feeling quite upset not talking to the staff on the way out.

I think its quite safe to say that we will not be returning to this place."

I ordered take out, asked for chicken in garlic sauce and hot and sour soup.  

First....Evidentially I pulled the wrong menu, because when she gave me my total I almost passed out and I questioned the price; I was told it was an old menu, probably more than five years old. The problem was that I could not find another menu that was any more recent. Asian food, prices go up in the evening, I was still ok.  My order was repeated back to me and I was told 10 minutes....

Second...Instead of chicken in garlic sauce I was given curry chicken with vegetables.  Gahhhhh.....I was already at my destination when I found out.  I never thought twice about my order being wrong because along with the comment about looking at an old menu, she again repeated my order...

Third....I called to explain the situation and asked if they could deliver the correct order to my current location, less than a block away, I was told NO...I ordered curry chicken and she was busy.  WTF, $16 for my soup and entree and you can&#39;t give me a little customer service?  I told her I would be back a little later and would expect the meal that I originally ordered and paid for....I sure hope the attitude has changed!Horrible customer service is a huge pet peeve of mine....I was bringing myself, a new customer, to spend money at China Jade and was treated so poorly that I will not be back and I will tell everyone I know about how I was treated.  Next time I will give my hard earned money to a business that appreciates their customers!

Ps....I will be back tonight to get what I paid for, you have one and only one chance to change my mind about your restaurant.  I am guessing you probably don&#39;t care, so I will just take my chicken in garlic sauce and won&#39;t return!

Update 12/30/15, 9pm....went back to restaurant after my event, explained my situation to a different person.  The situation was made right and I received the correct order, chicken with garlic sauce and an apology!  I really appreciate that they made this right, thank you."

I&#39;m so happy we stumbled upon this place. My first suggestion: don&#39;t order blatantly obvious Americanized-Chinese dishes; relish the opportunity to eat some delicious Chinese dishes! Dishes are family-style, and are about 4 or 5 servings, so 4 dishes in total are plenty to feed a group of 4 or 5 people. I&#39;ve been to many Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles, and the food at China Jade is on par with the LA Chinese restaurants--so you know it&#39;s pretty good.

Find another one, like Golden Shanghai. You will thank me."

We literally sat across from a couple who got the grand service, they were so chatty with them they even brought them out an entrée that wasn&#39;t on the menu for them while I was told I couldn&#39;t order their &#34;sweet and sour combination &#34; which they had on the menu.

The store-front is very unassuming (yes, it&#39;s the place that has frosted glass without a very obvious front door), but when you walk inside you know you&#39;re in business because many of the patrons are Chinese students.  

Food/Beverages: There are two menus - the authentic Chinese menu and the Americanized Chinese menu.  The authentic Chinese menu is two pages, but has enough for multiple visits.  My favorites include the kidney (could use a bit more peppers and onions, but you do get a good helping of delicious kidney), the fried large intestines, and their sweet potato leaves with minced garlic.  I actually think they do vegetables the best of all the Chinese places I&#39;ve gone to.  The flavors are great, and for those interested in heat, you can definitely find it here.  

Ambiance: Clean, utilitarian with some touches of &#34;Asian-esque&#34; pictures up on the far right wall.  Seating available for small and larger groups.  Also, as mentioned above, the exterior has frosted glass so you can&#39;t actually see into the restaurant. Don&#39;t be deterred, just open the door and walk in.

Service: Can be slow, especially around dinner when the customers start rolling in.  Don&#39;t expect them to wait hand and foot here and take initiative if you need your rice or tea refilled.

Pricing: A little bit on the pricier side (as compared to HK BBQ) but some certain dishes are worth paying a little extra.

Hours: Closed on Tuesdays! Don&#39;t make the mistake that I&#39;ve made several times going there hungry on Tuesday nights. 

Tip: If you&#39;re looking for the authentic experience, make sure to ask for the authentic menu."

Well, Well, Well...  Now this China Jade has moved to a BIGGER Space, aka more seating areas for Patrons alike.  Recent visit was for a farewell party, I suggested to my fellow Singaporean friends to go here for the HOT POT!  Thank God, they are willing to go to this China Jade.  2 of my friends made the reservation.  I came early as usual since Hubs need to run some other errands.

  That evening was on Saturday June 14th 2014.  Time was 18:00hrs.  The reservation was for 18:30hrs.  Thankfully, the owner and staff allocated us in the PRIVATE Room!  SCORE!  The seating arrangement and all the Burners are all ready for us, including the RAW FOOD such as 3 Plates of TIGER Shrimp ($26.85), 2 Plates of Fresh Cod Fish Fillet ($15.90), 2 Plates of Hot Pot Fish Balls (L) ($13.90)  and other condiments are all set.

  We opt to have the DUAL HOT POT aka House Yin-Yang Pot, which one half have the SPICY Base and the other was the Herb Base.  Just take note, this REQUIRE RESERVATION IN ADVANCE if you want to do the HOT POT!  The items you want for your HOT POT can add up!  So just be warned.  Since there are 12 of us, the SOUP Base cost was $47.40.  Hence that is like $3.95 for each person.  4 of us share one HOT POT.  Doable to some.

  With the choice of food we opt were :
*  1 Plate of Hand Sliced Fatty Beef ($8.95)
*  3 Plates of Lamb &amp; Beef Platter ($29.85)
*  3 Plates of Chicken Breast ($17.85)
*  4 Plates of Beef Tendon (L) ($23.80)
*  3 Plates of Napa Cabbage (L) ($11.85)
*  3 Plates of Glass Noodle (L) ($11.85)
*  3 Plates of Fresh Soft Tofu (L) ($11.85)
*  3 Plates of Enoki Mushroom (L) ($17.85)
*  2 Plates of Pancake ($7.00)
*  12 Bowls of Rice ($12.00)

My friends also order a couple of Beers, Soft Drinks and Tea.  We are indeed stuffed at the end of the HOT POT DINNER.

  4 of my other friends also order the Pork Belly ($5.95) for their HOT POT Dinner.  At least throughout the HOT POT Dinner, one of the Staffs checked up on us, to make sure we need other things and also provide refills of Water, and other Beverages that we need.

  Since it was a farewell party for my friend, each of us paid like $35 with tax and definitely generous tips to boot!  Take note, in our check, 18% Gratuity is already included.  All in all, its THE Company that counts.  THANK GOD, all my friends are OK with the food.  In terms of the HOT POT items, China Jade can do better hence this 3 star review.

When we walked in, the restaurant was almost full, bustling with people happily eating dishes of steaming Chinese food. We were immediately seated and brought two menus. I asked for the hot pot menu, which surprised our server, but he gave us one and told us there would be a wait. My guess is that it&#39;s not ordered often, so they were going to have to prep. 

We were there to catch up, so there wasn&#39;t a rush. We ordered fatty beef and fish filet, bok choy and cabbage, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, corn, fish ball, bean curd, quail eggs, glass noodles and spicy broth. The server brought around a cart so that we could dress up our sesame sauce. 

We had a great time. Our table soon filled with plates of ingredients, larger portions than we expected, as we soon got to work. The veggies were nice and fresh, the meat was tender, and they gave us a bowl FULL of quail eggs. The spice was just right, and three people were filled to capacity, with food left over. 

It&#39;s not NYC equivalent, but it was pretty good. 3.5 stars, rounding up because the service was friendly."

That&#39;s not how we are comfortable ordering so I got dressed to go pick up a paper menu!
Came back home to get the families picks!

We decided on:
The Pupu Platter....which we ended up not eating most of.

Shrimp with snow peas and Orange Chicken...both  actually kind of yummy.

Next was our shrimp and snow pea dish, the snow peas were fresh which was positive however the shrimp did not taste fresh. Once again I felt as if the dish lacked flavor ie garlic, oyster sauce, and SALT! 

Finally we ended on BBQ pork chow mein, this was nothing like any chow mein I have ever had... There were no soft noodles and it only had those deep fried crunchy ones on top. 

After reading this review you must think I love salt... Truthfully no I don&#39;t I just did not get the sense that the cook was serving authentic Asian food... And quite honestly I believe that I could have cooked these dishes better at home....

I decided to try this place out with a couple of my friends from Chinese class and loved the new decor (they had recently remodeled) as well as the food. Everything was fresh and just the right amount of proportions. 

The hot pot was especially delightful. We all decided on the spicy variety and added bits of sliced beef, dumplings, and mushrooms, as well as clear glass noodles. The dipping sauce was a delicious compliment to the spicy soup as well. 

The staff was friendly and there were a fair amount of customers who looked like they greatly enjoyed the meal they were having. By the end of the night, we were definitely part of that group! 

All four of us are planning on coming back again very soon."

We ordered one noodle dish and two chicken dishes and got zero rice. I was also bummed because I was sick and really wanted some chicken rice soup and they refused to make me any even though it is literally chicken broth and a scoop of white rice and in my experience any chinese restaurant will do this for you even if they don&#39;t list it on the menu.

We did get the extra hot mustard and duck sauce my boyfriend asked for."

They have a broad selection of classic Chinese food, I ordered the kung pao chicken with white rice, beef fried rice and crab meat cheese wontons. Everything was delicious!

No menu showed any signs of them, so we ordered Ma Po Tofu, which we were told typically contains pork, something I have never seen before, and the waiter recommended the vegetable delight.  We also ordered a large hot and sour soup, which was surprisingly vegetarian.

Ma Po Tofu seems to be for people without teeth, as it is a limp bean curd that quickly becomes mush.  The tofu was cannonballing into a hot sauce that showed strong separation, which I assume to be disgusting oil.  The vegetable delight was $9.95, and was just an asinine offering of sauteed bok choy, shitake, wood ear fungus, broccoli, and bamboo.  No sauce, no sign of being a Chinese dish except for the style of vegetables, and the fact that it was completely overpriced.  I have had large hot and sour soups, and this one fell quite short, as the large&#39;s I have had before have been about 2x the size for the same goddamn price.

This place fails to acknowledge that they use serious amounts of MSG.  I am quite allergic to this, and once home, immediately fell asleep.  Upon arising, I had a nice trip to the john, due to this fecal food.  I hated everything about this experience, and for my efforts, am $32 poorer."

Today I couldn&#39;t believe the customer service in this &#34;restaurant&#34; . I walked in and I was the only one there, two ladies (employees, owners) were just standing there and starring at me while I stood at the counter almost begging them to take my order. I set down and 5 min later my food arrived. The only interaction between me and one of the ladies/server/owner (who knows) was that I was served my order by one of them. Best part was while I was eating that one of the ladies brought out her nail kit, (she was doing her nails) at the table next to me. Not once was I asked anything like is the food ok, do I need anything else etc. I finished my meal got up, paid my bill (left the tip line blank). I wasn&#39;t waited on and didn&#39;t feel like anyone deserves my money if they are not working for it. As I was walking towards the door the lady that felt like she was my waitress, was saying something and holding my receipt in the air, I went back and wanted to see if I signed a wrong copy or something. She was pointing at the tip line, without any english knowledge she said: &#34;No tip for me?&#34; and handed me a pen. LOL. I took the pen and wrote 0 and turned around and again after I was about to leave she said: ASSHOLE to me. I just turned around looked at her and left. Yes, this is a &#34;restaurant&#34; where you as a repeat customer get treated like shit and get called an asshole. Obviously her english got better with those type of words, but speaking more beyond that is impossible, since I was never approached by this so called &#34;waitress&#34;. Just because you work at a restaurant doesn&#39;t mean money will be thrown at you ;)

Don&#39;t come here expecting syrup sweet Chinese food; this is the real deal. The tendon and beef flank appetizer (served cold) is phenomenal and the boiling fish soup is the best dish on the menu (yes it does have numbing sichuan peppercorns). The pepper chicken is fantastic too but if you&#39;re afraid of spicy stay away. The only downside of their menu is that some appetizers are grossly overpriced relative to the portion size such as the sichuan green beans for $10.

I tried something labelled &#34;zumin flavored lamb&#34; and found out that zumin=cumin. Not my favorite dish but it was not bad either.  My friend Jessi ordered chicken fried rice.

Looked to Yelp for reviews.  When we called to place our order we were told they do not deliver, but were able to do take-out (which was okay with us). We ordered the crab cheese wontons, fried dumplings, beef chow ho fun, pork in garlic sauce, and the szechuan kung pao chicken.

The crab cheese wontons were a bit on the chewier side and the fried dumplings were okay, but nothing spectacular. The beef chow ho fun had good flavor and the beef was perfectly cooked, but the noodles were a little overdone (too soft). The pork in garlic sauce was excellent - the kick of spice was just enough. The szechuan kung pao chicken was one of the best kung pao chicken dishes I have had from a Chinese restaurant! Normally the dish isn&#39;t spicy enough for me, but the one was China Jade was spot on. I also liked how the chicken was cut into thin strips versus chunks (never seen that before).

Overall my family enjoyed the food and it was reasonably priced. We are looking forward to trying other items off the menu."

I certainly agree with reviews criticizing the new waitress, but don&#39;t let her punish this restaurant. Let the owners know that you are not pleased with her service.

I finally got to take him to this place.   It was my third visit but the first since the remodel.   This place is the type of place to take a large group and try a lot of items.... I will take it however I can get it.

The place is newer, cleaner, nicer but basically the same.  I missed all the post construction chaos and we arrived early on a Saturday--about five.  We lingered for an hour and a half and in that time no one that was not speaking Chinese was there, except a group of Asian twenty somethings ordering take out.  I always ask for the &#34;Chinese&#34; menu not the &#34;American Chinese menu&#34;.   There are a lot of &#34;variety&#34; meats on it and a lot of regular items too.   Take your pick.  

This time I repeated the Shanghai smoked fish (which has received the same glorious accolades and been eaten down to the skin all three times), and had the Simmered/Stewed Pork Roast with Vegetables, and also the Szechuan fish and tofu (sorry my memory for specific names is terrible).  The Pork was 5 star.  The complexity of flavors (not spicy, mild) rivaled the best Indian cuisine I have had.  Absolutely memorable, and the pork was moist and fell apart--clearly indicative of a good preparation method.  The vegetables were crisp and held their own flavor so I am pretty sure they were steamed separately.  The hunk of pork was right off the roast, whole, and I estimate it was a pound and a half, if not more.

The fish and tofu(firm) was the right amount of spicy for someone who is used to Korean spice but doesn&#39;t want the mild fish and tofu totally overwhelmed.   I took this home (portions are huge, the three dishes would have served 4-8 depending on appetite) and it was great microwaved leftover twice, on some jasmine rice I made.  That was fresh fish.

So five stars on two dishes and 3-4 on the third.   It is a small place and I imagine if you arrive at rush hour on a peak weekend night you might be impatient for the service, but I don&#39;t know.   I have been here when large groups of Chinese or other Asians were dining so I can imagine the dining room of about (estimate) 20 small tables could get overwhelmed.   

Definitely go, though.  You won&#39;t be disappointed if you have an adventurous palate. this is definitely as good as it gets in Denver/Aurora, but I have a dim sum favorite place on the west side too."

In a good way though. Now it&#39;s twice as big as before, new granite top tables, nice tile floors, curtains, just much better atmosphere. I am so glad their business is expanding and doing so much better!

Now the food. We order the fish and tofu boil, twice cooked pork, boiled beef, tofu and shrimp, also beef tendons. We had a friend didn&#39;t eat red meat otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have ordered tofu and shrimp, it was pretty plain, not much flavor at all.

My favorite was the twice cooked pork! Best flavor ever! 

Spicy boiled beef and fish and tofu were decent too, especially fish and tofu. Beef tendon was ok, not spicy enough.

There are translations on the right side of all the Chinese dish names, I don&#39;t see why some people can&#39;t figure out what to order? Do you really need pictures for everything??

Oh did I say the service was fast and our food came out within a few minutes? 
Love this place! Will definitely go back again!"

1.) do not eat here if you can not read chinese!!
2.) bring a warm jacket as the wind blows through the front door when ever anyone opens it..
3.) expect to be frustrated regards the menu as they have their own ideas about what stuff means
4.) it is expensive.

In general a total and complete failure as far as our meal there went, we hated everything and actually stopped eating, asked for the remainder of our weird meal to be placed in takeout containers so we could throw it away at home without embarassing ourselves or the chef and went across the street and ate at Quodoba and had a burrito.

Nice restaurant, very clean, nice waiter,  but who really wants to eat crispy fried pig intestine??

As an aside, recently, my daughter had a speech and debate tournament at Overlook HS, up the street, some students ordered food from this place, according to her everyone hated everything they got, I am confused by the great reviews, really confused, I am serious... be careful here If you need authentic Chinese I think Chef Liu&#39;s is often awesome for its spicy and well prpeared food and is close by.."

I tried the beef in hot sauce and other staples of my childhood. I was born in Chongqing which was a part of Szechuan years ago. I love spicy food and the taste experience here is one of the only places in Denver where you can find these dishes. 

Although the spice level of the dishes are not near as spicy as it is in Szechuan. I may ask them if they can make it as spicy as that of China next time I visit. 

They also seem to have standard items too if you&#39;re looking for more traditional staples of Chinese American food. e.g. Sesame chicken, broccoli beef, etc."

I couldn&#39;t find what looked like an up-to-date menu online and so we stopped in at this location and easily picked one up.

We placed and order for mongolian beef, broccoli with garlic, lo mein with chicken, and spring rolls. As we were picking the order up, the wait time was quoted as 15 minutes. We showed up and they appeared to be running a bit behind. After waiting an extra 10 minutes, we had our meal, along with an extra pint of hot and sour soup. A lovely touch!

When we got home, we discovered that we had been given another beef and vegetable dish instead of the broccoli. Not ideal as it was super spicy like the mongolian beef, but it was still tasty. All ingredients were very fresh and properly cooked. The lo mein was delicious and had a nice garlicky taste to it. There is a large presence of oil in the dishes and I will request for less used next time (if possible).

Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Our total was $38 for the 4 dishes and they fed the two of us for 5 meals."

I absolutely love Crabmeat Cheese Wontons. Love, love, love them. China Jade has the best Crabmeat Cheese Wontons I have ever had. They are like little pillows of heaven. There is no hunting for the filling in these bad boys. Some places skimp on the filling leaving me wanting more. China Jade fills them full of delicious goodness. I always feel like I&#39;m getting my moneys worth when I order these. Which is, uh, every time I order. In fact, I just placed an order this evening and it takes every ounce of my will power not to eat every single one of them in one sitting. I highly recommend them.

Their Teriyaki Chicken is delicious. By far one of my favorites to order. I also love their Sesame Chicken, my only desire is I wish it was a bit sweeter. It is still delicious none the less."

The old adage is soooo true.  Literally every time I have been here I walk in and almost every seat is filled with an Asian face that will stop momentarily and glance at the largish white guy filling the door way, smile politely and go back to eating. 

The variety, authenticity and spice level are amazing.  While this is nestled in a strip mall in an un-remarkable space the food is anything but!

My Wife is Half-Chinese and she almost cried when she tried their Mapu Tofu as this was a favorite childhood dish and China Jade has been the 1st place in 15 years to get it right for her.

I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu (including the stomach and intestine dishes) minus their  seafood offerings and they are all delicious.

I recommend the Ziran Beef and the  Garlic Green Beans.  All of the food is amazing regardless of which menu if comes off of, but the &#34;Asian&#34; menu does have a larger selection of dishes to choose from.

The staff is  all Asian (and related?) and fantastically attentive and FAST.

China Jade isn&#39;t your everyday run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant - yes, they have your everyday &#34;American&#34; Chinese food such as lo mein and sweet and sour pork, but they also carry authentic dishes such as peking duck and sesame balls on a separate menu in chinese (both of which are AH-MAZING).

Lately, I have found myself venturing back into the &#34;American&#34; delicacies such as beef with broccoli and lemon chicken - my recent cravings. They do have a pretty gnarly lunch and combo special (which runs all day) and includes a soup, an egg roll, a deep fried shrimp, and a crab cheese wanton for a pretty reasonable price. They used to deliver, however, the last time I called, an employee told me they weren&#39;t; so I don&#39;t know if this is due to staffing that day or if they don&#39;t deliver anymore.

Now, China Jade isn&#39;t the most fancily decorated restaurants. Tucked away in a shopping mall off of Iliff and Peoria, it is what you might think of when you think of a strip mall restaurant. Yet, you wouldn&#39;t expect this to be the location for some worldly food, and here it is. Everything from the food to the workers to the customers all tell a great story of some genuinely tasty food.

Anyways, China Jade is a truly great find for Chinese food. Whether I am eating in or getting it to go, China Jade is my go-to place for some tasty Chinese food. If you happen to be on that side of town or wanting to go on a cross-town adventure, I recommend it hands down!"

Although most of the other Szechuan dishes on the menu are good, the Ma Po tofu is the best and most authentic tasting of all IMO.

For $2.50 each, you get a selection four different types of sliders, all of which are tasty. Other options include chips or a drink. However, four sliders does not make a must visit establishment.

Like, standing outside the truck is legit difficult because of how good it smells. Believe you me I did quick mental math on if I could hoist myself up through the order window and steal literally all of the burgers before they noticed. I opted instead on paying and waiting like a normal human being. 

I ordered two doubles, and they were both amazing. Though honestly I couldn&#39;t quite tell them apart. Would&#39;ve loved a little more aggressive flavor -- but I also don&#39;t really care too much.

Guys, they&#39;re awesome. They&#39;re SO good. Two doubles is perfect if you want to pretend you&#39;re fat but still be like hey it&#39;s not THAT much food! They&#39;re just so good. I was angry I wasn&#39;t starving to death because I wanted to eat like 400 sliders.

Not two minutes later, I made it to the front of the line, ready to finally get to the front to order. I ask for a modest 3 on the tiny sliders, one for each of us. I&#39;m brusquely told they are only going to serve 2 per person because they are moving so slow. I politely explained 3 of us had been waiting a really long time, but my young child couldn&#39;t handle it and all we wanted was one measly slider each. The guys in the truck were pretty much huge jerks about it and yelled back only two or nothing. I chose nothing since I didn&#39;t want to give business to a couple jerks so 3 people could pick over 2 sad little sliders.

 I live in the &#34;RINO art district&#34;/ ghetto Globeville. 
The 5280 sliders truck parks on Tuesday and now Wednesday nights at the Mockery Brewery off of 35th and Brighton blvd. I happen to live around the corner and have seen the truck there weekly. 
Tonight was such a beautiful night that I walked over to check it out and taste a delectable, juicy &amp; made to order absolutely spectacular American Slider! I am so glad that I did. 
The gentlemen who run the truck were super sweet and friendly. I talked to them the entire time I waited for my order to be prepared. 
I informed them that my cousin owns The Monkey Barrel over off of 15th and Platte and recommended that they talk to him about parking the delicious 5280 Slider truck over there on available evenings.

My wife and I both had the Filet Mignon special with a mushroom marsala sauce.  It was amazing (certainly far better than Del Frisco&#39;s). Cooked to the perfect temperature, very tender and full of flavor. The accompanying potatoes and squash were equally amazing.

Service was by Kyle was great and he made an excellent Bloody Mary from scratch, something few restaurants can do anymore as they all used bottled mixes.

Wow, what a great small, cozy and welcoming bistro in Greenwood Village. From start to finish, it was a great dining experience.

We were greeted immediately upon entering by Erica Sansone, co-owner. She was very personable and took us right to our table. Our server Kyle, was very friendly, gave great suggestions and was available right away if we needed anything.

The bistro is small but very comfortable and I loved the warm and inviting decor. There was only two couples at the restaurant when we arrived, but within 45 minutes the place was packed. It looks like it is a favorite neighborhood restaurant and I definitely can see why!

I ordered a lemon drop martini (well-prepared and delicious!) and my daughter a glass of white wine. At first she couldn&#39;t decide between two of the white wines and Kyle brought out a sample for her to taste without any prompting.

We decided to start of with an order of the calamari Portuguese (fresh mint, banana peppers &amp; olive oil with fresh marinara). Our entrees were the Sole Picatta (egg battered and sautéed with capers, broccoli, finished with lemon, sherry wine, and butter served on angel hair pasta), and the Wiener Schnitzel (award winning house favorite) (traditional thinly pounded veal, breaded and pan fried, served on their house brown sauce, garnished with lemon, capers, and anchovy). Both were so well-presented, well-prepared, a good portion and delicious!! All the flavors blended perfectly with one another.

We got our entrees before getting the calamari Portuguese and told Kyle it was okay, he didn&#39;t have to bring it out. He apologized profusely but we told him not to worry about it. He came out with two to go boxes with the calamari and didn&#39;t charge us for it. Now that is great customer service and was so appreciated!!

Since we arrived around 5:15 pm on a Friday, we got complimentary desserts with our meal. (complimentary desserts are available between 4:30 pm and 5:30 pm Monday thru Friday).

I chose the Blackberry Buckle and Calina the decadently delicious Chocolate Cake. Both were so yummy and were a perfect ending to a wonderful meal.

They also have a frequent dining rewards card you can fill out when you get the bill. They also gave us a coupon to try out Fins &amp; Noodles Italian Seafood Restaurant (their sister location).

The prices were very reasonable and the entire staff was friendly and attentive.  Will definitely be coming back--want to try their crispy duck entree and other items on the menu!"
sansones-bistro-greenwood-village,Carol T.,7HIdhn7PiWBcTeVXIH5wqA,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,19,2,R0LLWJdxrq0_h1XM_w_epA,4.0,2016-07-29,"I have to say that I really enjoyed my dining experience. Initially I was a bit put off as I was dining solo and I had a reservation and I felt a bit odd standing in the very small area at the front of the dining room and there I am peering into and at a handful of diners. I think it simply had more to do with the fact that the manager wasn&#39;t aware of the reservation and was making sure my table wasn&#39;t reserved too soon for a following reservation.  That and the fact that a solo diner is perhaps a bit of a curve ball for this establishment as it really is a nice cozy dining room.  I saw quite a few regulars being welcomed warmly so it is obvious service their customers is important.

They brought me water quickly and of course I had the menu to look over and I was told that they were trying out a new menu. The classics were there along with some new Chef specials. I opted for the Manicotti Florentine and I absolutely loved it!

The dish was very appealing with the Manicotti topped by crisp &#34;flash fried&#34; (?) spinach leaves that gave the dish a better presentation than most traditional Italian dishes involving melted cheese on top. The spinach leaves just melted in your mouth. I did drive in to the manicotti quickly after that and I have to say that the balance of flavours between the spinach filling, the marinara, cheese and spinach shells was well worth ordering and scoring along with the fresh spinach on top. This dish was quite wonderful since the pasta and marinara didn&#39;t over power the dish. They even paired some cauliflower and asparagus on the side. These were not afterthoughts as they were cooked to perfection and the asparagus spears had a good flavour with the wine reduction it was sautéed with.

Interestingly enough, I was the first person to try the dish as I was told by the Chef who politely came out to check on the diners enjoying his new creations. I think this is something that probably occurs in any evening before the crush of a full dining room.  

They offered a great selection of wines by the glass as well as cocktails. I enjoyed 2 very good glasses of Pinot Noir at a reasonable price.

Despite the fact that I left barely a crumb ( except for the bread crumbs - which I am glad I did not overdo it), I ordered dessert. It was a blueberry, pear and pecan crumble a la mode. Yummy-licious! It was served as a pie slice but it still had a soft but somewhat firm texture combined with the crumble at the base. Again, another delicious choice. The desserts are made fresh so it is likely that you won&#39;t have the same options the  next day. 

The only dessert that they feature regularly is a Grand Marnier souffle. And I heard other diners asking if It was still going to be offered on the new menu. Obviously a pleasurable experience with the number of people who asked... warning, you want to know if you want to order it at the beginning of the start of your meal as it is a 20 minute prep time for the dessert. I think it is great that they ask you early in the ordering process so you know that it will take time to get it out. I think that shows great service to make your guests aware so they cannot be surprised at the time they want to order it.


5 stars could definitely be a review ranking on my next visit.
 Definitely worth a return visit."

Extremely surprising this place !
The Calamari and Mussels Provençal  were amazing !

I think all of us enjoyed our entrées also very much. 

It was amazing that the Chef Kevin came out to say hello and asked how he felt about his great food. It is rare these days that A restaurants chef comes out and asks  anymore. I&#39;m a little old-fashioned and I think it&#39;s great.

When they came out from the kitchen, I was questioning why they were on the half-shell. When I order mussels at a restaurant, I typically think of a bowl of fresh mussels still in the full shell, nicely popped open from cooking... call me crazy. After tasting the leathery, chewy, tasteless things on the half shell, I couldn&#39;t understand why any chef in their right mind would serve something like this to a paying guest. I came to find out that the restaurant orders their mussels preshelled from their food supplier, rather than buying fresh mussels and cooking them properly on site. I specifically asked and was met with a response &#34;I wish we could get fresh mussel.&#34; Whole Foods sells them, as do many other markets. I&#39;m pretty sure that US Foods or Sysco could deliver a bag of fresh mussels to this restaurant.

Suffice it to say that nothing else that came out of the kitchen was really worth eating. I know I&#39;m not in Little Italy, but they really should be ashamed with the food they sent out to our table.

The staff was very nice, the location was fine, but I can&#39;t understand why this place has such a high rating."

My husband and I went for Restaurant Week, mainly because of the location closer to our house, the menu they had to offer for Restaurant Week, and the great reviews it has received on Yelp! It beat every expectation we had.

That being said, don&#39;t let the outside of the restaurant deter you. It is located in a small little strip of shops/restaurants on University, but the inside is quaint and inviting. As for the food, we started with the gnocchi and greek meatball appetizers and we both licked the plates clean. The gnocchi was in a spicy sauce and paired with cantaloupe for sweetness, an amazing combination. For dinner I ordered the pork tenderloin, which was one of the best pork dishes I have ever had and my husband ordered the Osso buco and finished his entire plate. Instead of a dessert, we started with the beanless chili, which I could have eaten the entire pot of.

Needless to say, we will be visiting Sansone&#39;s again very soon. Thank you for the great experience and date night!"

The drinks were reasonably priced,  and I am always happy when I can have a Moscato.  Dessert was delicious,  but skimpy.  With the drinks, tax and tip,  our $60 meal came close to $100.00. Ow.

The chef is so gifted, and puts lovely hints of herbs into his creations that keep you guessing. 

The menu has new additions regularly.

Its small and quiet, so you need not yell over your table to the folks you are with.

There is no rush. We often are headed somewhere afterward, but for the times we are not, I always feel like we could sit there all evening, and they would not mind.

OK it was on a Monday night the day after Father&#39;s Day.  Restaurant was not crowded but our server seemed tired.  I ordered the Wienerschnitzel and my husband ordered a rib eye that was a special of the evening.  Our salads were small any only lettuce.  No other vegetables.  My dinner was very good except I am surprised the server didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted the smaller portion.  It was HUGE and I took half home.  My husbands steak was tough and full of grizzle.  You don&#39;t expect to pay $28 and get a bad piece of meat!  We should have sent it back but we didn&#39;t.  We ordered the special dessert of the soufflé.  It was nothing but a bunch of egg whites and sugar and some sauce.  Other desserts would have been much tastier than that one.  The Pino Noir wine was excellent.  Might give this place another try sometime but definitely disappointed for a special occasion.

We were looking for something outside of downtown, and the reviews here were rather good.  I am very glad we went here. We had a chance to chat with chef/owner Robert Sansone and his gracious wife, Erica.  It was very nice meeting them, and I can see they take a lot of pride in their restaurant. Our server for the meal, Jessica, was excellent.

We were a party of four, and I was able to sample several dishes.  For your three choices here, you get an appetizer, an entrée, and somewhat uniquely, for your third choice you get to choose between a salad, soup, dessert, or a glass of wine.  This allows you to decide if you are more hungry, thirsty, or wanting to indulge your sweet tooth.  They also had wine specials for $7-8 per glass or $25 for the bottle.  We killed two bottles of a nice Malbec (the Alta Vista) from Argentina.  It was a well-rounded and soft red wine.

For my starter, I went with the Italian Sausage Stuffed Mushrooms (Three Crimini mushrooms stuffed with spicy Italian sausage and drizzled with our homemade Bleu cheese dressing).  The sausage is made locally, was nicely spicy and flavorful, and went well with the shrooms.  I was able to taste the B&#39;stillas (Moroccan Chicken and Almond pie).  I have had this dish before at Morrocan restaurants and this tasted as I remembered.  I also helped my friend with his Pate de Foie de Canard (Smooth, rich, and decadent duck liver mousse served with Lingonberry jam, Dijon mustard, chopped egg, red onion and rice crackers).  I wish that I had been adventurous enough to order this dish.  I was afraid it would be &#34;too livery&#34;.  However, it was amazing.  Rich, flavorful, well-spiced, complex . . . very impressive.

For my main course, I opted for the Pork Cassoulet (A rich, slow-cooked casserole originating in the south of France).  It was a rich and creamy dish with nice notes of salty pork and reduced beans and veggies.  I liked it, but would probably not order it again. I had some of the Varenga (Roasted shredded Beef in the classic style of Madagascar) my friend ordered.  This was like an exotic pot roast, and was a lot of meat.  What I almost ordered, and wish I had, was the Sansone&#39;s Chicken (Artichoke Sautéed Chicken and Artichokes in Lemon Sherry Butter). This was reminiscent of a Chicken Piccata.  The chicken was fork tender, uber moist, and the artichokes and lemon sherry butter brought a wonderful sourness to the dish.  Both the chicken and the beef came with a side of African Broccoli.  This was marinated in mayo and sour cream (I believe that was what they said) and had aggressive coriander flavors.  I really enjoyed this side.

They also had four desserts to choose from (two of them were bread puddings).  I went with the chocolate cream pie, and it was a nice way to end the meal.  I will definitely be back again."

The bread was brought out hot and fresh from the oven (and was delicious), the caesar salad was good,  and my chicken parm was some of the best I have had in awhile. I am guessing my boyfriend enjoyed his pasta as well since he wolfed it down before I had a chance to try it! will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"

The first was our anniversary dinner with my dad and his wife.  We really enjoyed our meal that night especially the special souffle for dessert.  When I heard it was open for lunch I really wanted to give it a try.  Luckily that happened by surprise yesterday.

I wanted soup but it was cream of eggplant and did not sound good. Was I wrong .  I had a taste and it was delicious.  My grilled romaine Cobb salad was tasty.  My dad had a duck salad and ate every bite.  

This restaurant is in a strip mall next to antique store and a flower store.  There is also a fish restauant nearby.  This is a good place for a nice quiet meal and the owner just happens to be the chef.   At dinner there seemed to be an older clientele and during lunch there were only a few people so can&#39;t be sure if that holds true at lunch.  It is a place I would try again but there are so many on my must try list.  I would probably try something new first."

Absolutely charming little &#34;find&#34;.  Easy to locate, easy parking situation.  Felt comfortable as soon as we walked in. Greeted by the owner, really nice!

Pairings and flavors were fantastic.  We both had the filet mignon and it melted in our mouths.  For dessert we shared the brownie, which was dense and decadent as well as the grand mariner souffle.  Both were wonderful!

I love that it has the cozy ambiance you would expect to find in a small, family run business, but leaves you feeling treated."

I was most impressed with the uniqueness of the foods and their flavors and that Robert Sansone (the ower and chef) brought it out to the table and described the dishes to us with such love.  I was least impressed that the staff almost refused to say &#34;You&#39;re welcome&#34; to our &#34;Thank you,&#34; other than the busboy Zack.  For being an upish scale restaurant, I don&#39;t expect the girl bringing the drinks from the bar to say &#34;Yep&#34; when we say &#34;Thank you&#34; or, the waiter to say &#34;No Problem&#34; when we thanked him.

Towards the end of the meal, when Robert came out to ask how the special desert was, we ordered the Grand Marnier Soufle at the start of the meal, I told him about this and was concerned for the restaurant experience.  We could see him talking with the staff shortly after this.

Later on we thanked the waiter and he replied &#34;No prob... You&#39;re welcome.&#34;  My daughter just about did a big giant spit-take with her soda.  I laughed a little on the inside.  The busboy came over with a big ear to ear grin and said thanks for saying how polite he was.  Hopefully everyone came away the better for it.

The food was very good although I wouldn&#39;t call it wonderful.  The price was very expensive, overly so.  We spent about $80 and I had just 2 beers and my daughter had a soda.  Service was a little on the slow side so, I&#39;m giving it 3 stars."

Our waiter rarely responded with a &#34;you&#39;re welcome&#34; and seemed unfamiliar with the restaurant&#39;s dishes and wine list.

I love that it is local and I would certainly prefer a place like Sansone&#39;s to Chili&#39;s but feel there are much better options in the Denver area."

No expectations.
$52.80 Restaurant Week...my only one this year.
Easy to find.
Plenty of parking.
Seated immediately with a smile.
They took our coats.
This is service.
The wine suggestion was divine.  &#34;Another bottle please.&#34;
The first course was, shall I say, the best, without a doubt...
The best pate I have had in my entire life...
Here in the States or in Paris.
I can&#39;t describe the smile on my face with one little bite.
&#34;My Precious. My Precious.&#34;
Pate de Foie de Canard (smooth, rich, and decadent duck liver mousse served with Lingonberry jam, Dijon mustard, chopped egg, red onion and rice crackers)
I could have just sat and enjoyed another serving and ignored everything and everyone else all evening.
But I didn&#39;t.
The Chef introduced himself.
The wait staff...amazing.
Then the main course.
I tried the Varenga (roasted shredded beef in the classic style of Madagascar)...very boring...sorry.
But, my dining partner shared her Sansone&#39;s Chicken ( sautéed chicken and Artichokes in Lemon Sherry Butter).
This chicken may be one of the best dishes I have enjoyed in months.
Then a coffee, not just any coffee, but espresso and a piece of wonderful Chocolate Cream Pie.

We were one of the latest seatings. Overall, food was excellent. I only gave it 4 stars because of a couple of minor things: the green beans were fiber like. Mine were inedible and it was obvious they were running out of food as  our pieces of pecan pie were much smaller than what we saw served earlier. Service was friendly and attentive and the place obviously has a loyal local clientele. Almost everyone in there was over 65 when we went. We would go back and try their regular menu."

Good wine, decent food, nice atmosphere.  This has an older crowd, but Mr. Mixer and I didn&#39;t feel out of place.  

We did wait about 20 minutes beyond our reservation time for a table and then the service was pretty slow.  That&#39;s ok, the food was nice.  Especially the veal (which I don&#39;t eat, boo, but Mr. Mixer loved it).  The gnocchi were good, but very heavy.  Salads were fresh and the homemade dressings were great.

We had noticed this place many times in a little throwback strip mall.  An email from Open Table listing it as a &#34;neighborhood gem&#34; got us to go.  As other reviews have stated it is very small, and the interiors are pretty much what you might expect considering the look of the exterior - it&#39;s a throwback.

To say they &#39;cater to an older crowd&#39; is one way to put it. It was like we were at a cast party for Cocoon.  I&#39;m in my 40s and literally the only people there in or below my age bracket were there with their parents.  This is not an exaggeration.  We were surprised no one yelled out BINGO! during dinner.

But you know what else surprised us?  The food was really terrific.  It&#39;s not really like any menu I can remember seeing - schnitzel, veal liver, lamb.  My wife had a lemon chicken (no, not Chinese food) which was wonderful, and really well presented.  I had a rack of lamb special which was fantastic.  Perfect medium, on a bed of asiago mashed potatoes.  The common side was a pickled cabbage dish with the deep merlot color of canned beets.  Despite a slightly off-putting pungent aroma, it was terrific.

Service was earnest, though a tad overwhelmed when we got there.  (I think the Open Table email had given them a somewhat unexpected bump).  But once things settled down all was professional and attentive.

So yes, I would concur - this really is a neighborhood gem.  Charming, a bit old world, and a great change from what we&#39;re used to.  Well done!"

Now is a prefect time to try this enchanting European style family restaurant.  During Denver Restaurant Week you can sample Robert Sansone&#39;s creations at a budget friendly rate.

My first course was a wonderful Calamari Posilippo which is tender calamari, lightly sautéed and served in a savory white wine broth.  My main course was Veal Piccata that was thin, tender, and skillfully sautéed.  The Piccata sauce was delicate, bright, and zesty.  The entree was plated with snap peas and a side of linguine marinara.  The finale was a beautiful soufflé served with two sauces (add $4.50 premium dessert).

The wine selection is nice and they are offering some special bottles paired with the 5280 menu.  We really enjoyed the Cocetti, Grape Feet Red, that is a nice red varietal blend from California.   

We thought it was a special touch that Robert Sansone brought our meals to the table and was frequently in the dining room checking on guests.  The restaurant is small and intimate, capacity is only 49 patrons, and crowded during the 5280 event.  Make a reservation on www.OpenTable.com and prepare to enjoy a unique and truly exceptional dining experience."

Some of us are fortunate that we can charge for our craft and some simply reformulate things we buy from other stores. Tonight was disappointing, frankly I will not give this place another try. I am uncertain how anyone can look past the mediocre food, dated decore and rate this place with more than 2 stars.
Upon our arrival we were sent to the bar in the back where it took about 15 minutes for the bartender to even look at us and say hello. Once acknowledged, the spouse ordered a glass of wine (house special), well it was flat and tasteless. Hey stuff happens. We were seated, as the spouse asked for something else, a taste glass was brought to the table with something &#34;swimming&#34; in it. Again, things happen.
We ordered the following:
The pate de canard - goose liver, the description sounded good. A few minutes later a sloppy looking pate was presented on a plate with a side of store bought &#34;crunchmaster&#34; crackers. Sadly, it appeared like it the pate has already been once.it was runny, salty and &#34;paired&#34; with the salty crackers was simply not good.
Our friends ordered the Morrocan / French chicken filo dough pie with pistachio and powdered sugar on top. Although a decent presentation, half got left on the plate with the &#34;weird&#34; as the final comment on it&#39;s taste qualities.
For entree we chose the ciopinno, a rather simple dish that I have had all over US. This one was simply the worst. Salty, unappealing, seemed like it came from a can with a few &#34;seafood&#34; items added.
Friends had lamb and chicken - although the chicken was tasty the side of eats that also looked like they came from a can did further place this place as suspect.
I would go on but why bore you with more mediocre details. 
Perhaps chef Gasteau (Ratatouile) was wrong, not everyone can cook ..... C&#39;eslt la vie."

However, not to many are budget friendly.
But you never have to go far for that special occasion.
This night being one of them.

My husband and I rarely get the chance to go out &#34;alone&#34;, we had the opportunity to drop the kids off at a local movie night for 3 hours of peace.
We thought what a great night to take advantage of a nice dinner out.
I purchased a $25 certificate of Restaurants.com for $2. Which I thought was a great deal to try this place out. However the small print... you need to spend at least $50 which can not include alcohol.
That&#39;s not that hard to do here, so really, no small print needed.

We were greeted right away by VERY friendly staff! They checked our coats for us, which is a small plus in my book. ;)
They had a great special on 3 wines that night for only $25 a bottle.
So I couldn&#39;t resist. However the husband stuck with Coors.
I thought the wine list was just fine. Not a huge selection, but definitely enough and in a wide range of pricing.

We started with an appetizer which was a hard decision! They had so many tempting things on the menu. But we figured we&#39;d try out the Calamari. It was wonderful! Almost a Mediterranean style with banana peppers, lemon and a tomato sauce that was more the consistency of a soup with wonderful flavor!

My husband went with one of the dinner specials, not on the menu, the buffalo prime rib encrusted with pumpkin seeds and served with roasted winter veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.
This was by far some of the best prime rib. Cooked perfectly to my husbands liking. 
I went with the Veal Parmesan, I usually do chicken, but thought what the hell, give it a try. It was topped with smoked Gouda cheeses and a homemade marinara sauce. While it wasn&#39;t the &#34;best&#34; thing, it was still delicious! I&#39;m sure the chicken would have been more my flavor.
All entrees come with soup or salad, husband getting the roasted pepper lentil soup, which he liked and myself the salad with a strawberry vinaigrette. FABULOUS!

I was stuffed!, Couldn&#39;t even finish half my meal. However! I MUST try dessert here! This is where they lose a star from me.
I tried the Apple Streusel which I&#39;m sure to some, they would have loved it, but it was not my taste at all! Hardly any pastry at all wrapped around it and the spices were so overwhelming I couldn&#39;t take more then one bite.
I sent it back, which is hard for me to do, but with that kind of price, I&#39;m not paying for it! They were very apologetic, and made me a new dessert, which was a banana chimichanga served with Ice Cream. At this time, we wanted it to go. This was not smart on their end since they threw in a scoop of ice cream with the hot dessert in a to go container. Needless to say, by the time we picked up the kids and got home to eat it, then ice cream was a huge melted mess and the dessert now soggy. 

However, one of the things I thought was sweet, although a tad embarrassing, was the actual chef came out to apologize about the dessert and to make sure everything else was to our liking. I&#39;ve never had this happen, usually the chef could care less about what someone thinks of his cooking OR wouldn&#39;t want to come face to face with a complaint. I also noticed he went to a lot of the tables to check on them.

YES, the crowd is a bit older, however you can tell they&#39;re all the rich old money from the neighborhood that make this their regular spot for dinner. The owner and waitresses knew most the them by first name.

I would definitely go back. It was great service, great food in a great neighborhood!"

Very unassuming from the outside. The restaurant itself is quite small and probably caters to more of a middle aged crowd. The atmosphere is kind of quaint- table cloths on the table are a nice touch. There is a small bar - kind of a personal neighbhood kind of bar. You are greeted warmly at the door and the service continues with the wait and table staff. Very friendly and attentive without being distracting. Waitress was also knowlegeable about the menu and ingredients.She was also comfortable offering suggestions.
I tried the Vietnamese Basra fish which was on special that evening and it was great! Cooked perfectly and the bolognese sauce was not something I would have thought to put on fish, but it was a very good combination and did not overpower the flavor of the fish. My friend had the filet which was a little over cooked for my taste, but seemed to work for him.  The wine list was adequate for this size restaurant and affordable. 
While this restaurant might be a little too sedate for some folks, it was a nice change from some of the large noisy restaurants and sports bars that have become the norm.
The chef also comes out to check with the guests about their meal and dining experience. Nice personal touch!!!"

We have visited this restaurant a few years ago and did not like their wine list so didn&#39;t come back... This visit I liked their scallops and their souffle--- delicious!   But my husband did not like the vienner schnitzel-- too thin a cut of veal and too much batter for his liking.   I also liked the artichoke appetizer.   yummy!   The brie appetizer must have been a hit at the other end of the table as I didn&#39;t even get a bite!

Wine list was limited.  I ordered a bottle of the low end Pinot Noir (they had two on the list), and I was informed that they were all out.  So I ordered their more expensive bottle of Pinot. (nice way to upsell).  I read good reviews and how the personable chef  visits with his patrons, which inspired me to check it out.  The chef visited all seated guests except for us; probably a coincindence that we were the only couple under 50 and not caucasian.  I noted on the res. that it was my wife&#39;s birthday, and at the end of the meal she was presented with a cardboard to go box, shaped &amp; decorated like a pie, with a handful of dinner mints inside. (very tacky)
And, they don&#39;t take American Express.

There are too many really good restaurants in the area for us to go back to Sansone&#39;s."

A frittata as I understand it is beaten eggs enriched with various meat and veggie fillings fried in a skillet and often finished in the oven--almost like a crustless quiche. The dish I received in no way resembled this. My plate contained a watery pile of slimy scrambled egg substitutes (not even fresh eggs), crumbled greasy pizza sausage, a few small chunks of potato and broccoli, and pepperoni slices that were stuck together because no one could bother to pull them apart so they would cook properly, all of which was mixed together and topped with unmelted shredded cheese. It was underwhelming and left me feeling queasy. 

The prices and portions were on par with most restaurants and the service was friendly and efficient. However, food is paramount for me and a breakfast restaurant that can&#39;t properly execute an egg dish or use real eggs won&#39;t be earning my return business."

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been treated as awful at any other restaurant. 

From the moment calling this place to order food, the guy on the phone was rude and unfriendly.

Showing up to pick the food up, the guy who took our money (I&#39;m guessing the same person), Damion, didn&#39;t even acknowledge me or my friends who were there. He didn&#39;t say anything to us. He just took our money to pay for the food. He was also annoyed that we split checks. Like c&#39;mon, I&#39;m sure we weren&#39;t the first people to frequent this business and wanted to split the check. Overall, he was extremely unpleasant. 

So if you want to be treated like shit for no reasons, then come to this business.

Otherwise, I&#39;d rather go to the local IHOP and get some pancakes without a side of rudeness."

However, we&#39;ve gone to this place twice and both times it&#39;s been subpar.  The menu is very limited, the coffee is super weak, and the potatoes have been undercooked both times we were there.  On this visit, I ordered the eggs Benedict and the eggs were overcooked to the point that the yolks were solid and the bacon was too salty.  

I was hoping the first time was an off day but apparently this is the norm.  

I wouldn&#39;t go back."

I was able to grab a seat at a table just before it started to get crowded.The staff was friendly and the atmosphere here is warm and welcoming despite its strip mall location. 

Inside you will find a small bar with seating for four and about 15 small tables for two, which could be combined for larger parties. I took a look at the menu and decided to go with the Classic Benedict, which was served with breakfast potatoes. Overall this was a solid choice, and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned. The perfect portion size for the price, which was only about $10. I seriously considered an order of their Evalskivers, which were Danish style pancake holes filled with either fudge, lemon curd, or their seasonal selection but I resisted the temptation.

Overall this was a pretty good choice, and I am more than likely to try to return if I am in the area again as their griddle bananas foster toast sounded excellent too."

We arrived at about 11:45 am on a Sunday for brunch. We were quoted a 45 minute wait but ended up being seated after about 20-30 minutes. The food was decent and service was decent but nothing above average that makes me want to go back for more. 

Three of us had a build your own omelet and were all satisfied.  The fourth had a two egg breakfast of some sort with an added biscuit.  The biscuit was dense and tough which is our only major food complaint.  

Everything was good just nothing special. If I leave a meal feeling like I could have created it at home myself then it really wasn&#39;t the experience I was looking for.  If I were in the area and there was no wait I&#39;d eat here again but I won&#39;t be going out of my way to visit this establishment in the future."

We visited thanks to the great yelp reviews and it exceeded our expectations. We ordered the shrimp and grits---it had run out.  Now we were intrigued. We ordered the Red Eye ham with grits and egg as well as the pumpkin ebelskivers. We were in gastronomic heaven. Two days later we were determined to partake of the shrimp and grits. We added cinnamon rolls to the order and the biscuits and gravy. Nothing disappointed but those shrimp and grits had us promising to return from California for just to have them again.

I also got a fritatta and, of course, this being a week later, I can&#39;t remember what the heck it was called. But it had sausage, pepperoni, broccoli... wait, wait, wait, where are you going? Come back! Hear me out on this. Any way, broccoli, potatoes, eggs and cheese. 

Y&#39;all, it was gooooooooooooood.I know it sounds like a weird combo, but I was a little hangy that morning and this was the perfect combination for my rumbly tum.

Yes, it&#39;s WAAAAAY outside of Denver, but it&#39;s worth the drive.

It is definitely worth the wait! Came here around 10AM on a Sunday. The wait was about 40-45 minutes for a party of 2 with a baby. And we all know babies don&#39;t do well waiting, so thank goodness there is an Albertson&#39;s next door to stall time. They don&#39;t have much space inside to wait in the restaurant anyways.

Atmosphere: It&#39;s a small restaurant, but enough space between tables so you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re trapped. Cute simple decorations to make it feel homey. Nice thing is you can hold a conversation and not feel like you&#39;re shouting. Super kid friendly. They have lots of high chairs and enough space to bring in the carseat for super young infants. (:

Service: We have had nothing, but wonderful service from all the workers since we walked in. We loved that they had the option of waiting in the restaurant or they could text us when our table was ready. Our server was very pleasant and even sat at the table with us while taking our order so we were eye to eye and was able to feel like we were having a regular conversation.

Food: GRIDDLECAKE and SPECIALTY EGGS BENEDICT (oh and if you love sweets, their cinnamon roll). 

How have I never heard or had a griddle cake before. It&#39;s like the best thing that can happen to breakfast. Pancake, hash browns, eggs, cheese, breakfast meats all in one large pancake looking thing?!?! It definitely could not be better! So fluffy, airy, melt in your mouth, deliciousness in each and every bite. Can I have one right now? Seriously. It will hit every breakfast craving you have. They have the options of three meats, vegetarian, or their specialty (I can&#39;t recall right now). 

Who doesn&#39;t love eggs benedict? It&#39;s a traditional breakfast classic. But add in some chorizo and jalopenos. You got yourself a spicy bomb breakfast. Especially if you love spicy foods. Their house potatoes. Delicious with the runny yolk. 

Cinnamon roll: Drenched in their original frosting or cream cheese. We went with the original and it definitely did not disappoint. It&#39;s really heavy with the sugar... so I would definitely eat this in a couple portions. There is definitely fluff and richness in each sweet bite.

Too bad they aren&#39;t open past 2. I can definitely eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner"

We came in around 1030 on a Saturday, I know what you&#39;re thinking, peak breakfast time!  This restaurant is a small outlet within the Albertsons shopping center. If I were to guess, it seats maybe 60 people but don&#39;t quote me. First, the waiting area is a bench that fits maybe 6, so better to send just one person in your party inside to get on the list otherwise you are about to get friendly with those already dining. 

We walked in and it was hectic near the door but we were committed.  Someone approached us immediately and after seating two other parties we were able to get on the list. She said about 25 minutes- great! We stroll over to Albertsons and grab some things we needed and after not even 15 minutes we received a text that our table was ready. Woohoo!

We were seated at the back and the hostess explained the specials. Shortly after we were greeted by our awesome waitress whom brought us water and offered additional drinks.

Time to order! Our food was in front of us before we knew it! Probably in less than 8 minutes (all cooked to order).  I ordered one of the specials &#34;Chunky Monkey&#34; three (good sized!) griddle cakes with chocolate chips and banana slices cooked in and a side of syrup. Also a side of cheesy grits (why not, right?!). My guy ordered eggs benedict (cant go wrong) it is prepared the traditional way and included home fries. He said that the hollandaise was heavenly and the english muffin they used was fluffy, tangy goodness.  We both had leftovers and probably could have shared one dish. 

Usually when we go out for breakfast on the weekend, we prepare ourselves for long wait lists, slow service and long cook times. Not here!! We were in and out in an hour.

We will be back for the great priced, delicious food, friendly staff and open atmosphere!"

Instead of sweet toppings, this one is made of vegetables mixed into the batter with a lot of cheesiness on top. It&#39;s topped with sour cream, salsa, and avocado.. and everything just works so well together. It&#39;s super savory and delicious!

I&#39;d give it 4*. It was good, filling and enjoyable. What gives this establishment 5* is that they use Dazbog coffee! You need to understand that coffee is an afterthought in most diners and barely drinkable, but TLG uses my favorite chain (local!) as their coffee provider. Brilliance given that most of my Yelp is about coffee.

It&#39;s the only restaurant that shows up as a breakfast joint out in Southlands, sending an ample market its way I imagine. It&#39;s easy to get to, and the real estate has the potential to be very inviting and warm... Instead, it&#39;s a concrete unloved floor. Wood benches. Minimalistic chairs. Industrial feel. Overcompensating red to attempt to add some flare. My feet are cold and I actually asked that they turn up the heat. Cold in temperature and ambiance. 

The servers were quite sweet, and the burrito was fantastic. A little redesign and I think they&#39;ve got something to talk about."

After being sick for a week both my husband and I needed out of the house. Instead of going to our old stand by diner for breakfast we decided to see what else was around. When we got to Three Little Griddles the line was out the door. 

This place is small, but they did a great job with the name. We put our names down, they said it&#39;d be about 25 minutes and they would text us when our table was ready. We chose to get a trip to the hardware store out of the way while wating. 

The servers were fast and friendly. My husband got the Biscuits and Gravy and I got the Classic Eggs Benedict.  We shared an order of the Little Dutch stuffed pancakes. We got the fudge.

Everything was amazing, the portions are big so we will likely share next time. We each took home half our meals. My husband said the biscuits and gravy were just the right amount of creamy with a touch of heat. My eggs Benedict was perfection, and their home fries are amazing, all I can assume is they are finished in butter!

Can&#39;t wait to try this place again!"

There was a 30-45 minute wait and their computer system was down. There are patio type chairs to sit on to wait outside. The place is very small inside. Party of 3. I ordered an orange juice, coffee, and the 3 meat griddle cake with a side of green chile. Huge size, can be 2-3 meals or serve 2 or maybe 3. I ordered the special pancake balls but sent them back as they were not cooked all the way and had wet batter dough inside. $20 with tip. The griddle cake was unique but I think next time I will try the shrimp and grits. Our waitress was somewhat attentive."

They knew lots of customers by their names and gave hugs and kisses so you can tell they&#39;ve got a loyal fan base. Customer service wise, I would give them 4 stars, but I&#39;m also taking into account their food. 

Food wise, this ranks as probably the worst breakfast places I&#39;ve been to in Denver. If I had to describe the food in one word, it would be &#39;mushy&#39;. I ordered the Nutella Swirl pancakes and they tasted like Nutella, but it was so mushy. The entire top piece was just covered in sauce. I ate the bottom pieces which didn&#39;t have as much sauce on them, but they were still mushy. I don&#39;t mean soggy either like they&#39;d been sitting out and the sauce soaked into them. I mean mushy like undercooked mushy. 

My wife ordered the Keeping It Simple with bacon, white toast, and scrambled eggs. The eggs were the worst eggs I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Visually they looked liquidity. Taste wise, they were undercooked and runny. They were also just one giant piece of scrambled eggs. Not good. The bread was white toast. Only the top pieces were buttered. The bacon was okay. The only redeeming factor were the fries. My wife loved them because they were actually seasoned. 

Side note, they don&#39;t give you ice with the water so you have to ask for it. Kinda strange. 

Overall, definitely not a repeat in my book, but I&#39;m happy to see others do."

Nothing. Not a Jew friendly place!

It&#39;s great to find another independent restaurant near home! The servers were attentive and helpful with the menu. All of the food tasted very fresh and the Eggs Benedict was one of the best I have had. It is my go-to at Snooze and Three Little Griddles edged out Snooze! My hubs had an omelet and had no complaints. It had plenty of fillings, the eggs tasted very fresh, and was just the right amount of fluffy.
They serve Daz Bog coffee which is a big draw for both of us--they had Mocha Java when we visited and it was the best coffee we&#39;ve had in a restaurant in a while.

Pros:  Great food, large portions, generous pricing

Cons: the wait, we sat down immediately and ordered but didn&#39;t get our food for almost 30 minutes.

With that said, the staff / manager apologized and told us they were experiencing delays in the kitchen and discounted our check the coffee&#39;s for the inconvenience.   So no complaints really.  That&#39;s the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review.  We will be back again!"

I had just returned from four months in Iraq, my wife and I were headed home from the airport and we needed breakfast. Griddles was close to our route home so we decided to stop in. 

Mind. Blown. 

The GF Eggs Benedict was a huge hit with my wife. She said the Hollandaise was perfect. I had the biscuits and gravy. Perfect flavored gravy, perfectly prepared biscuits. I added some cheese grits because I was still hungry and even added some of the Monte Christo ebelskivers. 

Everything was awesome. The wait was totally worth it. They are going to have to expand within the year to keep up with the popularity at this rate."

If you live in the Southlands area you are probably already familiar with this little joint.  Standing strong as one of the only breakfast places in this area, this little family owned joint certainly has made a name for itself.  

Whether you are into savory or sweet, they have you covered at three little griddles. Serving up options like Ebelskivers which is are much like a donut hole.... but made of pancakes.  That&#39;s right, who wouldn&#39;t love a pancake hole! They also have cinnamon rolls the size of your head, pancakes as big as mountains... including one called the Elvis which includes... you guessed it... peanut butter and bananas! 

I got the &#34;keeping it simple,&#34;  which is the traditional egg bacon and hashbrowns breakfast.  Their potatoes were tasty, the eggs were poached perfect, and their bacon is crispy and delicious! MY partner got the red eye plate, which is the same but has grits underneath and covered in gravy.  

This has become a staple for our family and we will continue to come weekly and enjoy a lovely breakfast.

Five of us had brunch there today. Two are vegetarians with a gluten allergy. We made this extra clear to the server. 

My granddaughter&#39;s gluten free, vegetarian French toast came with bacon crumbles, even though it was ordered with no bacon.  The replacement order still had a few bacon crumbles on it. 

My grandson&#39;s pancakes were not the ones he ordered. 

The bill included the wrong pancakes as well as the correct ones. 

To cap off this already bad experience, both my daughter and granddaughter had gluten reactions, suggesting contamination."

It seems to bring a smile to my face when I say it.  It must be the way it sounds like &#34;liddle griddles&#34; to me.  And, I definitely was smiling when I left this place this morning.  I don&#39;t typically walk around just handing out five star reviews.  However, I definitely feel it was merited here based on my experiences.

This area has (in my opinion) sadly lacked for breakfast choices.  I had dropped my dogs off at Club Pet (east of Parker) and did a quick Yelp search for breakfast options near Smoky Hill and E-470.  Three Little Griddles popped up as the number one Breakfast and Brunch place.  This name was new to me, and I drilled down to scan the many positive reviews.  A short drive later, I found myself walking into the restaurant.  I remembered this location from when it was a &#34;Nick-N-Willy&#39;s Pizza&#34; several years back.  The place is cozy (it seats 44), but seems a bit roomier than one might expect.  It was maybe half full when I walked in, and I was quickly seated at the counter.  From talking with the staff, this place is much busier on the weekends, but then again, what good breakfast place do you know that isn&#39;t?

My service, from the time I entered, until the time I left, was top-notch.  Very friendly people were all working, and I think I met all of all of them except for the nice waitress from Scotland.  The place is family owned, run, and mostly staffed.  I met the patriarch of the business (Ron), and very much enjoyed talking with him about Three Little Griddles.  I also met chef Kelly (Ron&#39;s son), who was cooking up a storm, but still had a couple minutes to chat.  Also slinging hash was Megan, whose breakfast wizardry was fun to watch.  Although the cooking area is modest in size, this is an open window to the kitchen for those who like to see where the action is.  The upscale restaurant backgrounds of these two become apparent both when you watch them work, and when you dig into your food.

I had the Special Benedict.  This rotates seasonally (which is wonderful).  They are currently taking advantage of tomatoes being at the peak of ripeness.  My quite large breakfast consisted of two over-sized English muffins, covered with lightly sauteed spinach, slabs of heirloom tomato, perfectly poached eggs, and an unctuous cream cheese Hollandaise sauce.   This was so filling that I only ate half of my home fries.  These are cubes of lightly seasoned, flat-top griddled potatoes, that were about the size of large casino dice.  I would have liked my muffin toasted a bit more, and a heavier sear on my potatoes, but this is personal preference and a very small complaint.

I will definitely be back, as there are many more items on the menu I want to try.  The sweet items (particular the french toast) were putting out a siren call to my nose, long after my belly was full.


P.S.  I have been back several times now, and it is always, consistently, wonderful and delicious.

P.P.S. Fudge Ebelskivers are the best!"

My husband and I came here at the recommendation of a friend. Huge portions - he ordered a savory pancake and it was bigger than the plate. I got the uptown frittata with a short stack. Delicious! Sausage is slightly spicy and the combination of eggs and pepperoni is good. 

The only downside is the size of the location. I&#39;m not sure I would dare coming on the weekend. Very small location and it was packed on a Thursday morning. Otherwise this is definitely a place to check out!"

My hungry toddler son was on a breakdown because we had been in the car too long. Instead of a breakdown, the chef noticed and offer a little ramekin of chocolate chips. Made all the difference and we had a wonderfully happy meal! The menu is creative and delicious; there were several dishes I wanted to order. Wait staff was very attentive and patient with us as we got situated, even though it was very busy. 5 stars, deservedly so."

Every time I&#39;ve come, they&#39;ve been very busy, sometimes with a line waiting at the door.  I came for breakfast on a Tuesday at 10:30 am.  The only place open was the small bar, which was fine.  I was promptly greeted at ordered my breakfast of coffee and pancakes with a side of bacon.
Coffee service was prompt.  Breakfast also came out quickly.  Strangely though, I had to get the attention of the server to ask for some butter with my pancakes.  The gentleman next to me did too.  Obviously he is a regular because he stated, &#34;you always have to ask for butter, I told them to change that.&#34;  Guess they haven&#39;t.  The pancakes were well prepared otherwise.  Tall and fluffy.  Too much food really. Now for the bacon.  Well, the three pieces I received were crispy but were also barely warm.  I tried a piece right after the waitress brought it and it was barely above room temperature.  This is whey the restaurant gets 4 stars and not 5.  If you are going to pre-cook your bacon, figure out a way to get it to the customer while it is HOT. Please.  Service was prompt and courteous.  I will say, their little coffee bar, cash register, sink, dirty dishes area is far too small for 3 wait staff to maneuver around in.  One waitress accidentally tipped over and broke a bottle of water just trying to leave.  Not really her fault.  I will come back."

I was so happy to finally get breakfast at this place. The wait was 50 min at 9:30 on a Sunday. I expected this based on how small the place is. But very worth the wait. Started off with the cinnamon roll with regular frosting. Amazing- everyone at the table kept stealing bites. I then ordered scrambled eggs and a short stack. Both were cooked very well- the pancakes were nice and fluffy and the eggs were neither too dry or too runny. I also tried a breakfast burrito and home fries from someone else&#39;s plate. Delish.

The decor is so cute. It is a really small place, but it had a nice personal feel because of it. I love supporting a family business rather than a chain. This place has mom working the front while her kids work the grill and serve. They even had their grandson helping out. Great family and great service.
Plan on returning soon."

A few little things like long wait times can be annoying, buy hey... its good, gotta deal with it. My only 2 points of feedback would be that is kinda hot inside during the summer and the water that comes out in the bottle is not usually cold. As such, ask for ice. 

All and all i like coming here fkr the great food and good service."

All 3 of us were absolutely delighted by our experience and I couldn&#39;t wait to write this review!  

We got there pretty early - about 8:30am, and there wasn&#39;t much of a wait.  As I&#39;m sure others have already commented, the waiting area is teeny-tiny.  The restaurant has several very comfy Adirondack chairs sitting outside their front door, which would be a great place to wait during the warm summer months.  However, when it&#39;s cold, the front area has got to be super congested while people wait for a table.  This was not our experience, just an observation.  I&#39;m not sure what they could do about it, other than take out a table or two - but then they wouldn&#39;t be able to get as many diners in.

Nearly every moment of our meals was perfection.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable, and was quick to bring us water and coffee.  The coffee was hot, delicious and Daz Bog, which I really have an affinity for, so it was great to see that 3LG serves it.  We started with the Cinnamon Roll with cream cheese.  YUMMMM!!  It was a perfectly gooey balance of tender, warm roll, butter, cinnamon sugar and topped with the most luscious cream cheese icing.  I think we may have finished it in 60 seconds :)

I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict.  It came with an enormous, fluffy English muffin - not the little ones that I&#39;m used to at other restaurants.  The slab of canadian bacon on each slice was also very thick, almost perfectly matching up to the size of the muffin.  I like my eggs poached hard, and that was done perfectly.  My only complaint would be the Hollandaise.  I LOVE Hollandaise with all of my little heart and rarely have a complaint.  This one was more citrus-y than those that I&#39;ve had in the past.  It wasn&#39;t awful, just more tart than I would prefer.  The potatoes that came with were cooked to perfection, and I adore how they are all cut into perfect rectangles.  Fun touch :)

My older daughter ordered the griddle cakes with blueberries.  The cakes themselves were light and fluffy, and came with an abundance of juicy blueberries!  They come out of the kitchen as 3 VERY large pancakes, and we brought 2 of them home.  I had the leftovers for breakfast this morning - still very yummy and very filling.

My younger girl ordered the Biscuits &amp; Gravy and WOW it was an enormous place of gravyish goodness.  2 very large, light and tender biscuits were topped with an ENORMOUS amount of very flavorful sausage gravy.  We brought those leftovers home to my husband, who ate them immediately with two great big thumbs up!

This area of town has been in need of something new and different in the breakfast realm, and 3 Little Griddles is a great addition.  We look forward to many more visits in the coming years."

It was a 35 minute drive, but I figured if the food was as good as the reviews stated it would be worth our time.

When we got there, there wasn&#39;t a wait; we were seated immediately. However, after that our server, took a very long time, when we finally got to order I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of cheesy grits in place of home fries and a cup of coffee. My friend ordered the large order of lemon curd Æbleskiver.  

The coffee is Dazbog, not my favorite but decent. However, my breakfast was not very good. When the server brought it out, I thought the Hollandaise had a very potent smell, and then I realized I was smelling the vinegar from poaching the eggs. In fact, the Eggs Benedict was not only vinegary, but it was room temperature, the English muffins weren&#39;t toasted and the Canadian bacon was very salty. Additionally, instead of replacing the home fries with grits, she brought out a side of cheesy grits in a mug. The grits were pretty good: creamy, but the only cheese I tasted was the light sprinkle of shredded cheese on top. I&#39;m glad I got the side because the home fries were undercooked. I had one of the Æbleskiver they were also very good.

As previously mentioned, our server was slow. Not good on during breakfast service on a Saturday. Several tables, ours included, should have been out much quicker so that people waiting could be seated.

So ultimately I&#39;m giving them 3 stars, and frankly that&#39;s generous. Maybe it was an off morning for Three Little Griddles, although I&#39;ve noticed that the other low ratings have similar experiences to mine. And, considering that it&#39;s a 35 minute drive out there, I&#39;m not willing to return and find out."

Although there is usually a wait for a table, you can go run off and run an errand and get a text when a table is almost ready for you. LOVE this concept. Wish more places did this!

My husband is very picky and it takes a lot for him to say something tastes great. While sitting at the table, he said the biscuits and gravy were the best he&#39;s ever had. And he&#39;s had a lot of biscuits and gravy. I very much enjoyed the Classic Toast (French toast). It just melted in your mouth. 

We will be returning and I can&#39;t wait to try other items on the menu!"

I got the chili on the side so I could split it with my 5 year old.  He liked it sooo much he ate half!  The chili is very similar to Santiago&#39;s green chili (which is a good thing since the is no Santiago&#39;s near us)  
One thing, don&#39;t bother with the ebelskevers (sp?) They were kinda gummy.  Tasted ok but the texture was not good."

If there was it would be packed.&#34; Pulled up yelp and saw a new place right near us close to Southlands Mall. Woke the kids and were there in two minutes. 

Packed.  And GREAT food.  You can tell there was allot of thought put into this little spot.  Only problem, not enough tables.  I&#39;m sure this was discussed before they opened... But hopefully they can expand a little. 

I had biscuits and gravy. Finally.  Someone who serves some good B n G. Great gravy filled with Sausage.  Only thought here was one piece was the the size of a large meet ball!  Ha. Not complaining for sure but had to use a knife to cut it. A little more constancy there perhaps.  Biscuits not to huge served open faced.  Just great.

The quiche was large and filling but not dry at all.  Very good. 

The only thing we thought was the griddle cakes were a bit I thick... SUPER good, but a little hard to not tap out after about half way through the stack.  Any thicker and they would be to bready for sure. 

Thank you for using real blue berries. Compote belongs on toast not in a pancake. 

Also some egg thing. Awesome. 

You can tell there are some new Peeps working front of house but they will improve.  

Before you give one star, just remember everyone has a bad day :) 

I thinking the owners are cool and probably wear funky glasses.  Loved it.

But unfortunately my visit today for breakfast will be my last at this place. I  recommend taking your business elsewhere for breakfast . I was taking the visitong family out before they had to drive the rest of the way home. We stopped by on Tuesday morning at around 10 o&#39;clock and there was a 20 minute wait which is usual but I was surprised for it being just a Tuesday. Once we were called we got seated had to wait a little bit to place the order but once we did the three of us all ordered the same thing which was eggs benedict. Unfortunately when the food came out only two of the three eggs benedict orders were put in, the waiter told me he was sorry and dodnt know why he forgot to add my order as well but he went ahead and told the kitchen to start my order after the other people had gotten theirs. It was a huge dissappontment. My table was eating and I did not have my food but sometimes these things happen so I tried not to let it upset me. Once I got my eggs benedict the Egg was raw, at this point the other people at my table we&#39;re almost done eating. I then asked for the waiter to take the plate away and to remake the order as the eggs were Raw he apologized and took the plate back and put in my order again for an eggs benedict. By the time I got that order everyone was completely done eating and all the plates were cleared it was embarrassing that I had to get my food once everyone was done eating even though I had given my order the same time as everyone else.  I decided  just to eat it at this point and not make a big deal about it because I was in front of family and was trying to not ruin the experience for them. We got our bill, I  was shocked to find out that no discount was given or no apology was given as to the poor customer service or apologizing for the egg being wrong or not even placing my order originally which would have avoided this entire situation. I am extremely disappointed in how this was handled, management should have stepped in to apologize for the continued inconveniences that we were getting and poor customer service as well or given us something like a discount or money towards or next visit for the terrible experience we had today, something!  Instead you made me feel like you just wanted my money and didn&#39;t make up for the poor experience we had today.
 I&#39;m sorry but raw eggs? No thank you."

The staff said, you can choose where ever you want to seat.  So we decide to seat ourselves at the Bigger Dinning area located at the Left wing of the establishment.  Perhaps the one, at the Entrance, the &#34;smaller&#34; section of dining area, are meant for TO-GO waiting area etc etc..  My bad, did not ask our lovely server about the different seating areas.

This recent visit was on Saturday January 18th 2014 after running some errands in this neighborhood.  That evening was about 17:30hrs ish.

Once we seat ourselves, our lovely server gave us the Menu and ask if we want anything for our Beverages.  At first Hubs wanted to have Coke Cola, but our server said, they don&#39;t have Coke Cola, but they have Mexican Coke Cola in a bottle.., hence that was Hubs choice of beverages, while I opt for water.  I ask our server if I can order different types of Tacos and she said &#34;YES&#34;...  SCORE!!

We ordered the following items :

* 1 Lengua, 1 Beef Asada, [1 Tripa (Tripe) + $0.25] and 1 Birria aka Tacos Mixitos ($8.00)
*  Beef Asada Street Tacos ($6.75)
*  Mexican Coke Cola ($2.75)

While waiting for our food to be ready, our server gave us the Chips and Salsa.  We like the Chips and Salsa coz they heat up the Chips and the Salsa was put into a tortilla bowl.  Addictive Chips I must add, OR perhaps we were &#34;starving Marvins&#34;....

After waiting about 15 minutes or so, we received our Tacos orders.  The Taco Plate comes with Diced Raw Onions, Cilantro and 2 Limes Wedges.  Each Taco Plates comes with 2 kinds of Salsa, one was Green and the other was Red.  The amount of meats in each Taco, can be split into 2, hence in total you can get 8 Tacos.  Decent Tacos Hubs said.

The Lengua was my least favorite coz they do not cook it further though I cannot deny its tender.  The Beef Asada Tacos was Okay.  The Tripa aka Tripe, they FRIED it.. so crunchy, very addictive and I like those too...  Isn&#39;t &#34;CRUNCHY&#34; and &#34;FRIED&#34; good in the books??  The BEST Taco I have from this establishment was the Birria, the steamed goat.  Its so tender and melt in the mouth...  With all &#34;8&#34; Tacos each, indeed the Taco Dinner was filling.

Once we were done with Taco Dinner, there are many more patrons dining in and this establishment really got filled up.  There is also a Bar Area allocated at this establishment. 

The service was prompt, efficient and our server her name is Evelyn was very accommodating and attentive.  Our Dinner was $19.17, with tips was $23.

The Qualm we have or I guess it was just me, the Parking outside can be a nightmare during PEAK HOURS of Dinner while we were there, be it before or when we were about to leave the establishment.  Just be extra careful.  Left this establishment about 18:20hrs ish.

But let&#39;s talk about the giant bowl of boiling meats that you can see in the pictures...

I&#39;ve never seen a giant boiling cauldron of meats before; it&#39;s insane.  Similar to a fajita plate, they bring it to the table with contents boiling around the edges and topped with cheese.  The meat is quality, the tortillas are fresh, the service was fine.

Honestly one of the most unique dishes i&#39;ve ever had, and so delicious.  If I take anyone here, I won&#39;t even allow them to order anything else.

**Don&#39;t let the $15 price tag drag you down, this thing feeds at least 2-3 people; I made 2 extra meals from the leftovers.  Just order it and be amazed.

ALSO - if you didn&#39;t already know - there&#39;s a super sicky &#34;Phat Mart&#34; right next Los Gordos if you feel like seriously copping some style after the cauldron fest."

Had been in before to order take out but it seemed a bit pricey for to go food so I left. We decided to give it a try. Good margarita, and only $4 or $5. That&#39;s a steal nowadays! Really liked the chips and salsa and wanted a refill but there&#39;s something about having to pay for refills. Sorry, your a Mexican Restaurant. I&#39;m guessing you charge enough on other dishes to cover your cost for a second basket of chips. What really sucked is that I had ordered a side of gaucamole and would have loved more chips to finish it. Excellent gauc! I had a torta, lots of meat and cheese but was disappointed in the toppings. A few small onion ringlets , I got the core of the iceberg lettuce on my sandwich, sad little tomatoes, and the biggest bummer was the tiny little sliver of avacado that I had to hunt for . But was good, not the best I ever had. My hubby got a combo plate, chile rellenos were excellent, yummy tamale, and I didn&#39;t try his enchilada. He was very impressed. We eat a lot of Mexican food out.  Got a horchata that seemed like something was missing. A bit flat in flavor, seemed almost watery. But I drank it and was happy. Service was great but it was 2:30 . Only 2 other tables in the place. The guy behind me ordered gaucamole and the size was incredible! I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the molcjete! And tacos. I hope they have good tacos. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they charge for refills on chips and salsa. Perhaps you should change your policy to 2 baskets are complimentary. We charge for a 3rd. Or make bigger baskets, and cups of salsa!"

Service is very slow, only had one drink refill, they charge you extra for every little thing, food is not well prepared, atmosphere is good, burritos are loose and basically filled with more green chile and juices than meat, cowboy tacos had more lettuce as if they were feeding a rabbit, and basically isn&#39;t worth the time, money, or gas to drive here."

Very light, fluffy, and flavorful.  Skip the rellanos though, They were soggy with grease and had no flavor.

Due to the raving Yelp reviews on the Garlic chicken ($10), my friend ordered that. It&#39;s deep fried chicken with garlic sauce. It came with a side of rice and cold macaroni salad. The garlic chicken was alright. The sauce was definitely tasty but my friend didn&#39;t seem to be the biggest fan of it.

I go the chicken katsu ($9). I thought it was meh and I was pretty disappointed. It was very crunchy yet didn&#39;t have much taste. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauce it came with on the side. I&#39;ve had much better katsu at other places.

Located in a strip mall, this place is unassuming and has a sign outside saying SUSHI.  Stop in and stay for a bite.  

The meals being produced out of the kitchen are flavorful and delicious.  I ordered the teriyaki beef lunch plate which came with the traditional scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.  The beef was super tender, thinly sliced and cooked in the house made teriyaki sauce which was sweet with a kick.  The macaroni salad was simple but so good!   

My husband ordered the garlic chicken which I regretted not getting but he was kind enough to share.  They are bite sized pieces of chicken thighs that are marinated in a garlicky sweet sauce then dredged in what I believe is corn starch and fried and then lightly tossed in a sauce.  Sooooo good!

We also shared the spam musubi which was unlike the traditional way of serving it and actually made into a roll and sliced like sushi.  Delicious.  

The restaurant is pretty small but I appreciate that they aren&#39;t stacking tables on top of each other and space them out so there&#39;s some privacy between the patrons."

We started with the oysters, which was okay. They were huge and it came with some sort of sauce (kinda bland in our opinion). They were also topped with salmon roe, which I could&#39;ve done without. However, the oyster did taste really fresh. 

For sushi we had the Denver D. Roll and a spicy scallop sushi. The Denver D consisted of spicy salmon topped with shiso, lemon, &amp; hamachi. I&#39;m not sure if there was some sort of sauce that was in the roll itself, but this roll was very citrusy, it kind of overpowered everything else. The spicy scallop was good, if you&#39;re not a fan of spicy mayo.. I&#39;d stay away from this.

Our favorite dish of our meal was the garlic chicken. Now this was delicious, I&#39;ve never had this anywhere else. It&#39;s basically little pieces of deep fried chicken, I&#39;m not sure if they cover it in a garlic flavored batter or if it&#39;s a garlic sauce, whatever it is. It&#39;s good. 

Service was great, everyone was super nice and welcoming. Our server was very attentive, as well as the sushi chefs, who every once in awhile checked in on us to see if we were doing okay (we weren&#39;t even sitting at the sushi bar)"

My aunt said that during the weekend this place gets jam packed and there can be a pretty considerable wait time. We were able to get a table right away on a Tuesday night, but it was still pretty busy for a weekday. 

It&#39;s a very small restaurant with a long sushi bar on the right side and tables and chair on the left side. Pretty traditional sushi joint atmosphere, not a ton of frills here. 

Our server came over right away and it was awesome to hear that pretty much anything except for a few kitchen items could be modified to be made gluten free. My aunt and I shared the fish tacos and I ordered a couple rolls including the Philadelphia and a tuna and jalapeño roll which had gf sauce inside. My uncle had the butterfish and my fiancé the katsu.

Everyone really enjoyed their food and I was super pleased. The Philadelphia roll was pretty standard but that tuna jalapeño packed a punch! It was awesome! The fish tacos were excellent as my aunt promised. I also got a glass of wine and I have to give them a shout out for almost filling it to the brim, now that&#39;s a glass of wine!

Service was great and food came out quickly. Price and quantity were very reasonable. I can see why this place is so popular."

Service is always the best, fish is the freshest and most importantly, I learned what spam was (see pic).  It taste like bologna.  It&#39;s cooked and served over rice, wrapped with seaweed in a little roll.  Philly roll was fresh. The tempura shrimp was lightly battered and deep-fried just to perfection.  Big pieces of shrimp.  The coconut cake was soft and moist.  Really, nothing had changed since last time I went.

It took us a while, but we finally made it. It was a Saturday around 6 so they were busy. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, but the tiny interior of Iwyama wasn&#39;t what I had been anticipating. There are probably 12 tables and some bar seats - that&#39;s about it. We&#39;re lucky we got a seat.

We ordered three rolls (Philadelphia, spicy tuna, and California with mango) and the chicken teriyaki, because we had read that it was so good. 

The teriyaki came out first. It was good. Not mind blowing, out of this world good, just good. It was on par with other teriyaki I&#39;ve had. The texture was really soft, which was surprising. 

The sushi was fresh, that I could tell. I think the Philadelphia was my favorite, followed by the spicy tuna. I didn&#39;t love the California with mango - it was a little spicy, which isn&#39;t really a flavor profile I expected from what I ordered. But whatever, I just wouldn&#39;t get that one again. 

Service was great. Our waiter was really nice and gregarious. No complaints there.

So why 3 stars? The sushi took a REALLY long time to come out. I know it&#39;s Saturday and they were busy and the chef was behind. That&#39;s fair enough. But going somewhere and getting half of my food and then having to wait a long time for the rest of it never sounds all that appealing to me personally.

Also, the coconut cake everyone raves about? The table next to us got the last slice. 

I know people rave about this place, and I&#39;ve read plenty of reviews saying that the wait here is worth it for them. I can appreciate that! But based on my first experience, it isn&#39;t for me. My quest for amazing sushi in the area continues!"

A giant melting pot of cultures and cuisines. Yet, you will not find true Hawaiian food. And this makes me very sad. So whenever we visit the West Coast or Utah/Colorado, we make it a point to find good Hawaiian food. I 

Upon arrival in Denver, we were hungry. A Yelp search for Hawaiian food led me to this place, so we detoured slightly to get there.  We arrived just before the lunch rush and the place was empty. I mean, dead empty. I was questioning my decision to come here, but Kalua pork was calling my name.  

Our server was friendly and helpful. He set us up for sushi, but I was there for Ono grindz! We ordered a plate of Kalua pork and a plate of Kalbi. Because we&#39;re fatties, we inhaled every last morsel. Everything was delish! With the Kalbi being the overall favorite. For dessert we had a banana egg roll thingy that was fantastic!

Luckily, I took a chance on these guys and got a belly full of aloha. 

Don&#39;t be deterred by the location in the burbs or being tucked in a small strip mall that has seen better days. The restaurant is small inside, too. Maybe ten tables and seating at the sushi bar. But it&#39;s clean and modern inside with some Hawaiian decor that&#39;s very welcoming. And I&#39;ve always been seated immediately. 

So, the food. They have local style plate lunches - teriyaki, kalbi, katsu, loco moco, garlic chicken and more. They all come with the standard two scoops of rice and a scoop of creamy tasty mac salad. Teri is rich and delicious. The garlic chicken comes out in nugget to popcorn size pieces, very crispy and garlicky. Not on par with Side Street Inn, but that&#39;s asking for the impossible. I ate it all, even though I was full. So ono! Speaking of portions, I&#39;ve only been at lunch and had to waddle out, so I can&#39;t imagine the dinner size plate! Can&#39;t wait to make my way through the entire menu. 

Of course, they also have sushi. Great combos and the ability to customize. Fish is very fresh and rolls are expertly made. I&#39;ve only tried a couple items, but I&#39;ll be back for more. 

Mahalo, guys!"

Me and my girlfriends went here to enjoy some food. We were sat rather quickly and given water and then watched the waiter pass us about 20 times, at least 10 minutes had passed before we were asked if we wanted to order. Keep in mind there are like 6 tables in this restaurant. We order sushi and miso soup. Our sushi comes out and our miso soup was forgotten. Lady comes up and says it&#39;s &#34;on the house&#34;.  We pay our bill in cash and leave $64 on a $50 tab. We go next door to the liquor store before heading to our car. As we are almost to our car we hear some lady yelling at us from the patio of the bar in the same center. She has the cash in her hand and the bill and says we shorted her $7. Hmmm weird. $7 equaled the miso soup that wasn&#39;t on our bill. So anyway we give her $7 even though it makes no sense because we left $64 on a $50 tab and now all of a sudden $7 is missing from a $50 tab meaning there was only $42 left?

But... Sigh... I have to.

It&#39;s a gem of a find in an unassuming strip mall in suburban Littleton.

I love the Chirashi (see photos) ... Lunch is around $14 and Dinner is $21.50.  Right in line with where it should be.

Hubby liked his Salmon Teriyaki too, and since he isn&#39;t a huge Mac Salad guy... BOOM! I get the Mac Salad!  Can&#39;t beat it.

This past time, we tried the Banana Egg Rolls for dessert.  YUM!  Bananas and White Chocolate fried in egg roll skins (they weren&#39;t wonton wrappers, more like spring rolls) and served over Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Syrup.  

Yes, Please!

Instead, it was just like the food on Big Island -- average and nothing to write home about. Maybe we are spoiled by the great sushi we get here in Boulder. 

This is a small restaurant in a nondescript strip mall. Clearly they are doing very well as it was packed and there was always someone waiting for a table. We were lucky that a table cleared just as we got there and we did not have much of a wait. 

Our miso soup was very salty. So salty that my husband who usually puts salt on everything could not finish it. We ordered two sushi rolls and da Big Kahuna burger. We ordered the regular burger, not the Juicy Lucy or the Santiago. Unfortunately the burger came out before the sushi. The burger was fine. I was looking forward to the mango salsa it is supposed to have on it but there was none. I could have asked but by this time I just wanted to get out of there and for no fault of the restaurant. Well, maybe. The table next to us was really really close to ours, and so right next to me sat a woman with a terrible cold. Every two minutes, she would blow her nose violently into a tissue which she then proceeded to open up and lay out to dry on her purse so that she could get a few more uses out of it. It didn&#39;t help that there was someone else two feet away with a very wet cough. 

The sushi was average. We ate it. We left. It was expensive for the quality of the food. The service is great and it looked like no-one was waiting very long for their food, despite being so busy. So for a small strip mall in Littleton, I think this was fine."

I was craving sushi the other day and literally typed &#34;sushi near me&#34; into my favorite search engine and this was one of the three that came up.  Not only did they have great reviews, but having lived in Hawaii before, this one pulled at some familiar heart strings and ended up being the one I decided on.  

As I pulled up, I realized it was in a strip mall type of setting, so I thought to myself &#34;I hope the reviews were on point and not just friends of the owner hyping it up.&#34; 

It was crowded and I figured there would be a wait for a party of two but as I gave the gentleman my name, he quoted me 5-10 minutes.  I stepped outside and started chatting with my companion waiting for our turn.  Less than 10 minutes later, my name was called and we were sat.  He kept his 5-10 minute promise!

I took at peek at the menu and was thrilled to see some of my favorites from the Islands as well as a big selection/variety of sushi, sashimi, nigiri, miso soup, etc.  We picked a few different things, placed our order and eagerly began to anticipate its delivery.  

The tables are a bit close together so me being the Chatty Cathy that I am, I struck up a conversation with the table to our left.  Come to find out, they are serious regulars and come 2-3 times a week.  As we were chatting, the server brought out a HUGE platter of deliciousness for them and said &#34;here&#39;s your regular&#34; before setting the bounty before them.  

A couple minutes later our deliciousness arrived and we dove in...

...the long and the short of it all?  

The reviews DID NOT LIE!  This was amazing!  Fresh.  Tasty.  Expertly hand-crafted.  So YUMMY!!!

All-in-all, this has become my favorite sushi place, so much so, that I still have yet to try any of the Hawaiian delights, lol.  

DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!"

The Kalua Pig, Miso Butterfish, and Chicken Katsu is also excellent.  -- Actually, we&#39;ve never had a bad meal here and always had friendly service.

We ordered some sushi (spider roll and po boy roll) and they were quite good, fell apart a little bit delicious none the less. Then we received our entrees and we were both quite disappointed. I order the pork tonkatsu, the sides that came with the dish were ok but the quality of the meat was awful. It was chewy and had tons of tendon, in hindsight I should&#39;ve said something to the wait staff. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki, again the sides were ok but his chicken as slippery and chewy tasting. 

Overall, the service and sushi was great. The quality of the meat for the price you pay for entrees is not worth it. We won&#39;t be back."

I also had a soft shell crab roll with avocado.  It was amazing.

This place can satisfy most of your cravings from the Big Island.  The Kalua pork is simply amazing!  Garlic Chicken looks so good that it should be on a magazine cover.  Take a peak at the menu or the pictures for some of the other treats they offer, just try not to drool too much :D With some plate entrées, you may request two half portions of protein instead of one, if can&#39;t make up your mind ;)  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.

There ends the good, now for the bad. 

The rice was by no means sushi rice and the rolls fell apart like crazy, very bland and tasteless as well. The tuna was not cut from standard sushi fish, (before a sushi restaurant cuts a filet into slices, the fish market that sells the filet must cut it the right way; making it sushi grade fish. If you do not buy this to cut for your customers, they can get very sick.) Upon arriving I couldn&#39;t help but notice the 10-12 signs asking people to be patient on their busy nights. Seriously one will do, just fine.

Now for the ugly, the tuna was disgusting because it wasn&#39;t sushi grade. Then I got to the Unagi, after chewing for about a second I could taste the off, horrible rotten fishy taste. It was not only bad, it was dangerously old. I quickly warned my fiance not to eat it, and ended up running back and forth to the bathroom for the majority of the evening. Words cannot express how horrible the Unagi was, just writing about it makes my stomach turn.

Summary, I will never be going back there. I also question all the good reviews validity. They are in serious danger of making someone extremely sick. DO NOT EAT HERE."

Very good quality sushi, they take their time creating the food they serve. Which is appreciated by me. Being from the Northeast and having had off the boat to my stomach sushi and fish in general, this place is about as good as I think you can get in Colorado. 

Cooked-

I&#39;m quite happy with the sushi I&#39;ve had here, I&#39;ve only had hot food once. It was delicious and well presented.

Their loco moco was delicious along with the Patrice roll and the low carb lollipop role. If wine, beer or soda doesn&#39;t pair well with your sushi then try a fruit punch.

The place is a little hole-in-the-wall, not recommended for a date night because none of the tables have any privacy whatsoever and the overhead lights were really bright! The sushi was ok, definitely not the best I&#39;ve had in town, but the service was pretty bad. Granted, it was a Saturday evening so they were busy, but our order of 4 rolls took over 30 minutes to get to our table. It was tough watching tables who were sat after us get their dinner way ahead of ours. When our rolls were delivered, it was unclear which was which and they weren&#39;t pointed out to us, which as a sushi lover, has never happened to me.

Prior to ordering this, we asked the waitress what fish was on the rainbow roll and was nicely advised that all different types on fish and that was why it was called a rainbow roll. HAHAHA.
We got our apps. Again, it was okay. We then ordered our main dishes. The pork katsu was dry and chewy. The garlic chicken wasn&#39;t crispy enough and there wasn&#39;t enough sauce. The mac salad didn&#39;t include what you would find in a normal hawaii mac salad. It was basically noodles and mayo. We did need to ask for additional utensils for the loco.

It was a Saturday night and very busy, but we were able to get a table after waiting only 5-10 minutes.

I couldn&#39;t decide what to eat and I was starving (minimal breakfast and no lunch) so I decided to order two things to try - the garlic chicken and the daily special, a burrito made with Kalua pork.  My husband is a big sushi fan so he went with a variety of rolls and nigiri.

I LOVED both of my dishes!  The garlic chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful, and the macaroni salad that came along side it was great.  The Kalua pork burrito was so good - the pork had that awesome smoky flavor and was very tender.  The servings were huge and there was plenty for leftovers.  My husband really enjoyed his sushi and commented on how fresh the fish tasted.  

The service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  We appreciated the Hawaiian hospitality and plan to come back often."

We went on a Friday night and waited nearly an hour to get a table. It was definitely worth the wait.

Our order:
2 orders of Walu sashimi (the best dish since we had to order another one after devouring the first serving)
1 Fransisco Roll
1 Italian Stallion Roll
1 Rainbow Sashimi
1 Gyoza
1 Loco Moco

Sushi was very fresh and just as good as Sushi Den! Yes, that&#39;s correct, Sushi Den. The fish was fresh and the creations are unique. Like the Walu Superwhite Tuna sashimi topped with ginger pesto and ponzu. The Italian Stallion had spicy tuna with avocado, asparagus and tempura shrimp. Aside from the sushi, the Loco Moco was great as well. Tender ground beef patty with a perfectly fried egg and savory gravy over rice. 

This place is small and on Friday and Saturdays make sure you arrive early because it gets packed quick. If you&#39;re in a hurry, don&#39;t bother paying a visit. They are a staff of 4 with only 2 people running the kitchen. Chef Lee has a very cool and relaxed attitude towards his dinner service. If you&#39;re lucky to get a table, sit back and be patient because the reward is incredibly delicious."

UPDATE 10/23/15  My wife and I have been back many times.  This place is awesome.  Our favorite off the sushi menu is the Danielle roll.  Today we had that plus Lee&#39;s Special Spare Ribs.  Wow, these were amazing.  I&#39;m not on Facebook and vowed never to join, but I just might have to so I know the next time Lee makes these.  Fantastic meal as always. I would add a sixth star if I could.

UPDATE (9/12/14): Well here it is only two weeks later and I have already been back.  I just had to try the fish tacos (see the picture in the photo section that someone posted).  All I can say is delicious!  They had a little bit of kick to them and the fish was wonderful.  

I foolishly ordered some sake nigiri too, because it was so good last time; it came first and was fantastic.  I was beyond stuffed, the taco plate is plenty (3 tacos), but the sushi was too irresistible.  I will certainly be coming again soon.

Original review:
I am a sushi novice, however I know what I like, and I really like Iwayama!  I can&#39;t believe we haven&#39;t been before, it is so close to home.  Damn it....I have been missing out for too long.  My wife and I came for lunch today and I can&#39;t wait to come back.  The food was delicious and quite reasonably priced.  I am already looking at their menu thinking of what we should try next time."

I tried a sushi salmon roll with jalapeño and cream cheese, it made me cream cheese in my pantaloons.. FINALLY found sushi I will gladly devour every night and day if I could.

The Kalbi is the BEST. The marinade is tangy and it comes with rice and macaroni salad - the macaroni goes so well with the meat! 

I also had a California roll, which was good, They make their California Roll the standard way with the crab salad instead of the bland crab stick. Their Shrimp Tempura roll was perfect. Most Japanese restaurants will serve the tempura cold, but this was warm and delicious!

Our family&#39;s Kalua Pork and Chicken Katsu were excellent- the Katsu was light and fried perfectly, and the Pork was full of flavor. The Teri Beef had a great taste and fell apart in your mouth.

I had the Loco Moco, and it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had outside of Hawaii (Da Kitchen, in Maui, might be the only better I&#39;ve had). Often restaurants just brown some meat and toss a scoop of barely heated brown gravy on top; Iwayama mixed the gravy throughout (so you don&#39;t have dried rice on the bottom) and put a real, honest-to-goodness tasty burger on top. If they pay attention to the little things on a dish this simple, it speaks well to the rest of their menu.

We did not try the sushi but all agreed we&#39;d go back.

This place gets busy- on a Tuesday night it was full with a line outside the door, so plan accordingly. Even with that, we had friendly, fast service."

Here was why I was nervous, a couple of weeks back before the event scheduled, I called Iwayama.  The caller who received the call, told me that THEY DO NOT ACCEPT RESERVATION ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY evenings.

But I told her, expect a PARTY of 12 to 15 people on Sarurday March 19th 2011 for a 6:30pm dinner.  Then when I arrived on that evening, from what I heard from my friends, the waitstaff told them, there was NO reservation made under my name.  HELLO???...

Okies, I settle my cool, and go with the flow despite still being all &#34;nervous&#34;.  

The group ordered the food.  The kitchen was indeed swamped with all orders from other patrons that evening.  Man this place is indeed jam-PACKED.

*  Kani Nigiri

I was slightly dissapointed when they ran out of some of my favorites, but oh well life goes on.  Another slight disappointment, some of the Nigiri or the food I ordered, have more &#34;citrus&#34; dressing or lime or lemon after taste.

All in all, though things went well.   Some of the food came out on a timely manner but some last minute decision food took slightly slower but I can understand why that evening.  One of my frens who is Japanese was indeed pleasantly surprise with regards to this establishment on what they had offer.  Even one of the waitstaff is Japanese.

Thank you Iwayama, your waitstaffs and crew for making that evening, enjoyful for my friends and I to have a feast at your establishment."

They are so packed on a Saturday night and they still had time to make my favorite musubi. I love their sushi and food in general. I really didn&#39;t like the salad too much but it&#39;s salad so don&#39;t waste your calories for the day on salad. Get the sushi or the spicy chicken. I haven&#39;t tried the Loco Moco yet but I will have to update when I hit that. The coconut cake is so good but I forgot to get some to go. :-(   The young guy that works there is really nice and you can tell he is a hard worker. I like it&#39;s a family owned restaurant kind of a feel and I like to support the local food scene. Keep up the good job!

Who knew there would be such good food hidden in a remote suburb of Denver?!  Right when you step in the door you know this place is legit--it&#39;s ran by this happy Hawaiin gentleman, ready to suggest yummy selections from his menu.  

One of such suggestions is the fish tacos.  Best I&#39;ve ever had!  Fresh, juicy, and an absolutely perfect combination of texture and flavor with the mango salsa and avocado.  I had the kalua pork and garlic chicken combo lunch plate the next day and that was amazing too!  It&#39;s a passage to the islands I tell ya!  

I look forward to this place when my work requires me to travel to Denver... have gone back for lunch every time I&#39;m in town."

The food was awesome, the service was great and it was close to home.  The prices were right, too.

The last time we went, we were disappointed.  The garlic chicken everyone seems to rave about was almost inedible.  It was like eating deep fried chicken fat - chewy and soaked in grease.  It just had a bizarre texture that I can&#39;t really put into words - suffice to say, we weren&#39;t fans.  And, we found that the sushi rolls we got (basics, always spicy tuna and salmon) were lacking and very light on the actual fish.

So, it wasn&#39;t a good experience.  But, I wanted to go back again, give it another try.  So, we did just that tonight.

Unfortunately, the experience was just as bad.  We had a spicy tuna, spicy salmon and a tuna roll.  The spicy rolls were seriously lacking in fish.  Like, there was hardly ANY fish in them.  I don&#39;t expect them to have fish pouring out of them, but the avocado and cucumber were 80% of the roll, and that&#39;s not okay.  To make matters worse, I kept getting bites of sinew and gristle, as though they aren&#39;t cutting the fish properly.

Shortly after we started eating, our waiter came over and asked how things were.  I gave him an &#34;ehhhhhhh&#34; and the wavering hand that indicates things are only so-so, and his response was, &#34;Great, glad everything is good&#34; and then he walked away.  So, basically, asking for the sake of asking, but not even listening to the response.

When another waitress came over to take our plates, she also asked how things were.  I said, &#34;Honestly?  Not great.&#34;  And, I told her how we were trying to give it one more shot, and how little fish had previously been in the rolls, etc.  I also pointed out that I had gristle in my fish and that there was a chunk of it on my plate that she could even see.  She apologized and said, &#34;Well, I hope you come back again so we can make it up to you!&#34;  And, I said, &#34;That&#39;s what /this/ visit was.&#34;

No discount, no concern over the issues we had, just &#34;Oh, so sorry, come back again!&#34;

We won&#39;t be.  I didn&#39;t expect them to comp my check, or anything, but even just having the manager show some concern (I don&#39;t even think the waitress told him that we had complained)...

The prices are right and the atmosphere is nice, but I like some fish in my sushi rolls, and this place is straight stingy."

Traffic was bad, really bad, en route to the Vintage Theater.  So bad, in fact, we missed our dinner reservation elsewhere.  We arrived at the Vintage about 40 minutes ahead of curtain, and Lo, what do our eyes behold?  A gorgeous neon sign guiding us to La Morena.

Seizing upon a final opportunity to get something into our frazzled systems before the show started, we enter and found La Morena dead empty.  A group of servers jumped to attention and seated us- we explained we need to eat fast.

About 14 seconds later, everyone squealed with delight and relief when they presented the frazzled driver (yours truly) with a margarita.  The chips and salsa were also served immediately and wow!  Was that salsa good!

We enjoyed an order of the Quesadillas, big juicy things stuffed full of chicken and cheese and topped with all the trimmings.  They were delicious! We also enjoyed two orders of the barbacoa plate, tender cheek beef simmered forever in the most delicious sauce, served with rice and beans and guacamole.  Everything was served in GIANT platters!

In 35 minutes, we dined, had a couple margs, and made it to the play in time for curtain.  Thank you La Morena!  This was a save, and a truly delicious meal!"

I&#39;m new to the community, but I could tell that this restaurant is a vital part of it. I ordered a bean burrito and was pleased. The green chile was flavorful and guacamole, authentic.

My husband had their crispy relleno plate and loved it. Their lemonade is freshly made.

Their service is great. They were very attentive to us and were very friendly.

I order Carnitas plate with one side egg. It was a generous looking plate due to the famous trick by using large plates. 

My wife order very fresh Menudo, so fresh you can still smell the cow! Most people gag at the smell but not me. 

Fresh good homemade tortillas came with our order. They make them only on the weekends according to the menu.

My husband and I came on a Saturday night around 8:50 pm. We made an order through eat24.com for some late night eats and food to take with us tomorrow at the Botanic Garden for a nice picnic. Anyways, a minute or two right before we arrived, we got a phone call from Barricuda&#39;s letting us know that our food was ready for pick up (that is very nice of them to call us). This is what we ended up purchasing:

Quesadilla, $6.95 prior to tax- I like that the sour cream, guacamole and salsa was packed separately and individually. I really liked the guacamole, it tasted fresh and creamy. Although the quesadilla was consumed the next day, I thought it tasted pretty standard to other quesadillas but good. There was plenty of cheese filling between the tortilla and a large order for one person to eat or to share. 

6 Chicken Wings with Ranch Dressing, $6.95 prior to tax- My husband picked teriyaki chicken (you can choose sweet and spicy chili honey chipotle barbecue, Shiracha or buffalo). These wings were good and tender. The sauce was sweet and savory. 

Tofu Melt with a side of potato salad, $8.95 prior to tax- Fried tofu with a honey chipotle barbecue sauce with grilled mushrooms, onions, peppers, tomatoes and melted cheese on sourdough. I really enjoyed the seasonings of the barbecue sauce mixture of the added toppings. This tofu was a little on the soft/ soggy side and not as crunchy as I had hoped. But considering that I ate this the next day, it is understandable. I really enjoyed this sandwich. It was really good and flavorful, but a little on the spicy side because of the peppers. The serving size of the 2 halves was a really good portion. 

I also really enjoyed the potato salad. It was creamy and had good flavor. The size of the potato size was more than enough for one person. Overall, this meal with the side is an excellent value and really filling. 

Half Pounder with a side of potato salad, $8.95 prior to tax- My husband ordered this and also went with a side of potato salad (you can choose macaroni salad or fries instead of the potato salad). This sandwich was quite a mighty size that is more than enough for one person. The meat was tender and what you would want in a beefy sandwich. 
------------------------------------
(Total= $31.80 prior to tax) 

When we came into Barricuda&#39;s, pick up was easy and simple, especially since we had already paid in advance (I recommend you sign up for an account with eat24 so that you can get weekend coupon codes to save some money on your next purchase). 

Overall, we really enjoyed our meals the night of and the next day. Food was perfectly made with the right amount of seasonings and flavor (although not healthy and is greasy/ oily). I would come back here for a late night meal and maybe even consider staying for a drink ($7 for all day pitchers of beer and $3.50 well drink specials every day until 1 am)."

We ended up coming for dinner right around sunset and found parking right in front of the door. Our waitress was very down to earth and had a good vibe. The seating around the bar was completely full and seemed like it was all locals. We sat in a comfy booth and read all of the free magazines set out by the door. My bf and I shared potato skins minus the bacon for a vegetarian version. I had the biggest burrito of my life that took me 3 days to eat full of veggies and covered in veggie red sauce that had the perfect amount of spice.

Now you&#39;re not going to go to Barricuda&#39;s for fine dining... but the dining is more than fine! This is my go to Denver brunch with a big group (well, not huge, but usually about 6). There is rarely a wait, which is a huge factor (I like SAMs, but man, am I tired of crowded places. We always pick a table in the back corner, and we get served by either Jules or Scuba Steve. Both are complete sweethearts, do a great job with all of our wonky orders, do their job with a smile and are completely personable with their patrons. 

The place is pretty dimly lit (THANK GOD) for any rough Saturdays or Sundays. The have bottomless mimosas, full bar, and bloody mary&#39;s that aren&#39;t so thick that you feel stuffed from just one. 

It&#39;s GREAT diner-esque food, and with the lack of a wait, the food pricing, and the bada$$ staff, I will continue to go back. It&#39;s sorta becoming a tradition. OOOOOOH...Barricuda!"

And I was waiting for a brand new server, with whom I had been oh so very patient with all night, to cash us out. But you felt the need to roll your eyes at me when I said I was just waiting for my card. And then yelled at me for trying to literally just paying my tab. Do you want me to pay in the parking lot?

I got into it with one of the drivers and cussed him out. Then I parkedand went in and the punk bartender wouldnt serve me food . I told him I would never come back and he just laughed at me and said who needs you? I have been there when we were the only customers there. I guess you guys are busY ENOUGH NOT TO NEED CUSTOMERS.

The staff was nice but not over the top or anything. No worries, they&#39;re good. My girl got a salad instead of fries that came with the burger. The salad was a perfect size. I didn&#39;t like that the hamburgers were made with preformed patties. I did like how crisp and fresh all veggies were on our burgers and in our salad. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had but they were good and i will not hesitate coming back."

The drinks are fine, decent specials and on the cheaper side of things in general.  Hard to screw up drinks, even at a dive bar.

Staff is fine: decent, polite, prompt, and knowledgable.

The food though, is just awful.  They talk up &#34;home cooked&#34; and &#34;feel good&#34; food, but it is frozen crap.  Literally, all their food seems to be CostCo or Kroger frozen meals.  Nachos are .99 store bag of chips, microwaved cheese, and generic beef with a dollop of sour cream and store-bought guacamole.

Tacos are pre-made and then frozen, even confirmed by the staff when my friend tried to substitute something else inside them.

Come for a drink or two, people watch the regulars, but go elsewhere to eat."

My only real complain is the horrid pink lighting. It&#39;s not an issue in the front of the house because of all the natural light from the windows, but in the back, it casts a sickly glow onto everything. This morning, I had the huevos ranchero. Definitely good, but portions of rice and beans were supersized. I think there was a least a full cup of refried beans on my plate. Way too much. I saw they deliver now!

I am a night owl Woo Woo. I work in the service industry and sometimes get home and am starving. 
We have eaten here twice, and it is now my late night, FEED ME- go to! 
We had the chicken fingers the first time, they batter them in house. Our friend had a mammoth Mexican breakfast, with corn tortillas and poached eggs, with really good brisket and a spicy and seemed homemade salsa/sauce all over it. They were happy to accommodate her  gluten restrictive diet. 
The other night, I and had a rough day, and I needed some food in me once my adrenaline went down. After 12:00 AM they switch to breakfast, which is actually what I was craving. We both had a nice standard breakfast 6.95$ with eggs, hash browns, bacon, and pancakes all cooked just right.  Nothing could have made me happier. I also got to eat breakfast and drink beer with it past midnight! You can also get appetizers and a couple more dinner plate options. The waitress said to try the chicken fried chicken, I will soon.

Barricuda&#39;s

So this wasn&#39;t the end, went the first time, yesterday
I had to turn my plate away
Eggs like the sun, coffee for everyone
Green chili, it never fails

Your prices so low, yes indeed
I bet your gonna impress me 
Now you have me down, down, down with what I need
Now don&#39;t you, Barricuda&#39;s? Oh . . .
---------------

$6.95 for good eggs benedict?  Sign me up, please.  My eggs were well-poached.  The hollandaise could have been a bit thicker, but had a nice tang.  The english muffins and ham were solid.  The hash browns came out wonderfully crispy, just as I ordered them.  The portion size versus the price was a very good deal.  I sat here with a couple fellow Yelpers enjoying a very affordable &#34;brunch&#34; in what otherwise appeared to be a dive bar / restaurant combo.  

I also drank several cups of the regular old coffee that tasted just fine, and they kept them coming.  I quite enjoyed a cup of the pork green chili that someone else had on the side, and did not eat.  It was meaty, spicy, thick, and flavorful. I did not partake of the $10 bottomless mimosas, but they definitely kept up with the consumption of those who did.  So, although I am just reviewing this as a brunch spot, I was quite happy with what I received here, and would be willing to break my fast here again soon."

First, the overall atmosphere. Very unpretentious, with an &#34;everyone welcome&#34; kind of vibe. Like a good dive bar, this place is dark, dingy, and kind of gross. 

Karaoke on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Some nights are pretty dead, so you can make the bar into your very own concert hall. 

The people. A mixed bag of college students, middle aged alcoholics, local old-timers, artistic hipsters, punk rockers, etc. etc. Expect the occasional crazy person to enter the mix. Definitely a strange crowd, but the overall feel is super friendly.  

Cheap, strong drinks. 

Pool tables, jukebox, and erotic photo hunt in the side room. 

Next door to the one and only Sexy Pizza, so you can satisfy those late night munchies.

In conclusion, Barracudas is high up on my list of Denver dive bars (coming in just behind PS Lounge, Horseshoe Lounge, and the infamous Nob Hill Inn). Definitely a must-try."

I feel as though since they started doing delivery service they have completely let their customers who dine in fall to the waist side. It&#39;s apparent they do not have their system set up for success. Let&#39;s take yesterday for example. We were a party of eight who had the respect to call ahead and let them know we were coming, and although we had a table waiting when we arrived the waiter came right out and said &#34;we don&#39;t split checks!&#34; OK... He did fail to mention that we&#39;d be waiting over an hour to get our food. After we saw THREE tables come in AFTER us who ordered their food, get it and eat it and got their check, we still had nothing. That&#39;s when the patience wore thin. We called the hostess over to let her know how long we&#39;d been waiting, she automatically said, &#34;well it&#39;s because we have delivery orders going out, too.&#34; I was beside myself. She proceeded to go back to our waiter and let them know we want our food it came right out like it was magic. AND THEN, to add insult to injury, our food was cold!!!! It had been sitting there for a while yet no one bothered to bring it out. At that point I was done. I&#39;m sorry Barricudas but you need to get your act together. Gone are the days of Liberty and Marissa on tables and Christina behind the bar. I&#39;d like to say I&#39;ll miss you but...."

Today they nickle and dimed us and did not tell me until they were at our door. I was paying cash and had the exact total I was told plus tip. The driver gave me a different total and explained it to me, I did not want to short the driver so I went back in to get him a few more dollars. They charge 2.50 for a side of hollindaise and it is not that good of hollindaise. Snooze, Racines and even Jelly just charge you about a 1.00 or so and their hollindaise is 10 times better. I also paid for an upgrade from toast to french toast and I got 2 shriveled up pieces of bread with what looks to be egg on it? The &#34;chicken fried chicken&#34; is just chicken tenders with gravy on the side. I will not be back because I am feeling pretty ripped off right now.

I went here on New Year&#39;s Day (Thanks for the invite James and Ali) only to see an amazing spread of brunch delicacies before me: Fresh fruit, eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, gravy, biscuits, French toast, crepes (three kinds!), cheese, even lox and tamales.

My friends say this is a pretty occasional occurrence. Apparently major holidays only. But they do have a regular brunch menu each weekend. Went again for that and the prices were likewise pretty reasonable.

This isn&#39;t Jelly or Snooze. The hollandaise for the Benedict was de-emulsifying in a warmed tin container. But for the price and for the selection, Barricuda&#39;s can&#39;t be beat. And that is nearly just as true for their incredibly cheap drinks and regular weekend brunches too."

The food is  pretty decent for a semi dive.  I usually come here for a breakfast and a bloody instead of waiting an hour at some hipster flavor of the week joint.  They also serve food very late and if I get the late night munchies during the week I will pop in for a bowl of French onion soup and a grilled cheese. I like their French onion soup....  I have never had anything I don&#39;t like here but it is a pretty straight forward menu.

It&#39;s a little bit hipster and a little divey, but isn&#39;t that the best part of living in Capital Hill?  It&#39;s never too terribly crowded, and even when it is, I can dig it.

There are lots of events going on.  The karaoke on Tuesday and Friday nights is enough to knock your ear drums out.  Once they&#39;re out, you will want to stomp on them to keep yourself from listening to the singers because they are awful.  But also awfully fun to listen to and make fun of.

So you may wonder about the food. It was decent enough. The portions are fairly large and not overly priced. Though the BBQ sauce is a bit weird. I had a burger and fries, the two people I was with got the chicken fingers and the double decker blt. Like I said the portions are healthy so no one went home hungry or upset about their meal.

If you want to watch the Broncos game, this is a relatively quiet/relaxed environment compared to other bars/restaurants.

Food is a-ok: I had a combination Mexican plate, which came with a burrito, enchilada, choice of rice or beans, and choice of tostada or taco. Nothing to write home about, but the food is filling. Their menu is quite interesting with sandwiches, pizza, appetizers (lots of appetizers), Mexican dishes, and even a small section for &#34;Oriental&#34; dishes (&#39;ey, ICYMI, that term is outdated and offensive, Barricuda).

The prices per entree are reasonable, as others have already mentioned: most are under $10. If you want a NY Steak, that&#39;s going to cost $15; not sure of the quality.

Total dive atmosphere, even in the daylight, but that&#39;s all good in my book because I love dives.  Dark walls, carpet you probably don&#39;t want to run a black light over, and a myriad of circular high tables, perfect for setting down your tall boy can on while you crowd around because all the women are in the stools and we&#39;re all gentlemen right?

Anyway, for a breakfast time, my friends and I were seated promptly, and were attended to pretty quickly.  I ended up ordering a breakfast burrito, and since I wasn&#39;t driving, what the heck, the bloody mary as well.  Waters were served without asking, because that&#39;s either common courtesy in today&#39;s dining industry, or my friends and I really must have looked like we were out drinking the night prior.  Either way, it was welcomed.

The bloody mary took a precariously long time to arrive, and I have to say that I wasn&#39;t too pleased with it.  I tend to not like ice in my bloody marys, because they water them down, and something about the presence of ice interferes with the addition of extra pepper and tabasco.  And it was just generally weak.

Thankfully the burrito was fantastic.  It was a generous size, and was stuffed adequately.  I can&#39;t say the potatoes had nearly the presence as the egg, and the added bacon and sausage, but the flavors were still good, and the sauce they coated it in was flavorful, and not like the bland boiled flavor that plagues so many other breakfast burritos.

In the end, I was stuffed with burrito, and satisfied with breakfast.  The bloody mary was a little weak for my preference, but that&#39;s like a morning drink anyway.  This is the kind of place that I wish my friends took me to the night prior, and from what they describe, is a great place to keep the drinking going and get late night munchies and fries AND there&#39;s a 7-Eleven right next door."

Eager to introduce our friends to our local spot, we stopped by the other night. Despite it being almost empty, they put the four of us (not small people to start with, bundled in large amounts of winter clothes) in literally the smallest booth in the whole place. Fine.

Two of the four of us ordered Fat Tires. What arrived was one Fat Tires, and one beer that was significantly darker. I don&#39;t even drink beer, but was able to notice the difference, and when my partner tried it, they said they thought it was New Castle. TWO fat tires; wouldn&#39;t you notice if you were service two DIFFERENT beers? Apparently not.

After waiting 15 minutes to have our order taken, it took a full 40 minutes to get our food out...which is ridiculous given the emptiness of the place. The food was ok (hardly any blue cheese on my blue teriyaki veggie burger, but I ordered more to solve this issue)...and the teriyaki sauce was not nearly as good as it used to be. We ate, waited another 20 minutes for our check, and were stunned.

Not only did they charge me extra for the additional blue cheese that should have been on the burger in the first place, but they charge me TWO DOLLARS extra for my veggie burger. I think charging extra for a veggie burger is ridiculous in the first place (and discriminatory towards vegetarians), but two dollars? The difference between a veggie burger and a beef burger (both plain) is 45 cents. How the heck do they get off charging two bucks? My so-so burger at Barricuda&#39;s cost more than the delicious Bonzai burger with unlimited fries and free blue cheese AND free veggie burger at Red Robin. 

We&#39;d usually rather support local businesses, but this has turned us off Barricuda&#39;s for now, until they get their act together. We felt ashamed to have talked the place up so much to our friends, and then have such slow and lackluster service, and over priced food. Almost $50 for two beers, a cider, two sandwiches, and two apps at a local dive bar? No thanks."

Barricudas is a locals kinda place 100%. Regulars don&#39;t look thrilled to see new people walk through the door but you know they are all here a few times a week. So I don&#39;t really speak highly of the crowd which is why I tend to not go there. However, we had a very nice time Saturday so I felt like I may need to give it a fair chance. 

We ended up here because our group was too big to find space at Park Tavern during a Broncos game. Being closest we headed to Barricudas where the staff kindly went out of their way to rearrange several tables in front of the TV for us. He told us that they take reservations for big groups on game days which is awesome. Our waiter was great, OK a little forgetful we forgive because it was really busy and he was very friendly. The pitchers were $5 during the game with other drink specials on bottomless mimosas, screwdrivers, stolis, etc. We seemed to have different feelings about food: the fish and chips (Barricuda bites) and fried shrimp were fairly icky but our table ordered a bunch of grilled cheese sandwiches and they were well loved.

Well, you can go wrong when (like me) you walk in at 2am fishing for more drinks and then continually ask for vodka at least three or four more times :-) But, being the awesome place this is, they didn&#39;t give me the boot but rather offered lots of yummy juice and greasy food for my drunk as*!

Most recently, I bellied up at Barracuda&#39;s at 10am on a Saturday, and there weren&#39;t any bar stools to spare. This place is bad in all of the good ways, and good in none of the pretentious ways. And don&#39;t let me forget about the jukebox. They have one of the best jukeboxes in town.

I struggle to elaborate. Sometimes when something is so right, it&#39;s better to be brief."

My girlfriends and I were at a swanky bar in cherry hill area and decided we wanted something more low key and a place that had karaoke. Looking on yelp, we found Barricudas- called and confirmed they had karaoke on a Tuesday night! 
 First off, if you&#39;re looking for one of those swanky or trendy bars then this one isn&#39;t for you... But if you want friendly people, good drinks, and a place to let loose then this place is awesome. 
We pulled up and the outside seemed a little sketchy... The decor on the inside is dingy but we weren&#39;t there to look at upholstery. We ordered a couple appetizers and everything was sooo good! Best greasy yummy bar food I&#39;ve had in Denver- chicken nachos. That&#39;s all I have to say about that. 
The waitress was super nice, even with us 3 loud and indecisive girls and one lonely male soul. The bartender that we migrated to once our waitress was done for the night was super good, didn&#39;t give us crap about not knowing the certain name of a drink, and even opened up a sample bottle of honey whiskey for me! The tab at the end of the night wasn&#39;t bad either! No sticker shock. 
The crowd was a complete mix of people, old and young, hipster and laid back, probably a war vet or two in there somewhere but wonderful people to talk to! The karaoke was super fun and they had a ton of songs to choose from, even brand new stuff. Definitely a diamond in the rough that we will be going back to!"

I prefer this place over other places in the nearby area. This reason I like this place is because it&#39;s always chill and comfortable inside with great food and service. I will say I never sit at the bar because I feel it&#39;s a breeding ground for alcoholics but the rest of the place is just fine. I&#39;ve come here for breakfast, lunch, and late night and I&#39;ve never been disappointed. For brunch you can get bottomless mimosas - they bring you a bottle per 2 guests with little carafes of oj, cran, or grapefruit so you can make them exactly how you like. Their Benedict&#39;s are worth a try and are so yummy! Bloody marys are great too. For dinner I&#39;ve pretty much tried everything. Thumbs up on: wings, chicken nachos, French onion soup, chefs salad, burgers, and Mexican food! The only thing I didn&#39;t care for is the tofu melt - wasn&#39;t really my thing. Drinks are cheap @ $2.50 for wells! Can&#39;t beat that! The have 2 pool tables and a juke box for tunes. Great lil divey place!"

Unfortunately, we got there and we had a new waiter. I think it was his 5th day or something. I totally understand that being a new server is soooo stressful and we tried hard to accommodate but after awhile it just kind of got ridiculous. Someone should have been picking up the slack and no offense guy but after 5 days you should be able to figure out what ticket is ours...

We are definitely going to give this place a second chance because we really want to try the food."

The people are great here.  The staff is amazingly delightful and will meet any need or want you have - within reason to be sure.   I also met 4-6 very friendly (but not uncomfortable friendly) people while just out smoking.  Needless to say Barracuda&#39;s has a very sociable at home atmosphere.  

Everyone is respectful even after the alcoholic beverages begin to kick in.  A female wishing to go somewhere without being hassled, what&#39;s your numbered or drunkenly glommed on would be make a safe bet going here.  The staff being mostly female is all too attentive to these things.  

The place stays open until 4:ooam on Friday and Saturday nights, so you can plan to go there for &#34;after 2am&#34; eats.  It&#39;s a treat when everyone piles in having come from all their own nights out.

There isn&#39;t anything particular about anything at Barracuda&#39;s other than the owners being Korean and Filipino. Asian food flare is brilliantly disguised in the menu without scaring someone who has never heard of it.  It tastes good.  There&#39;s standard beer selection, standard menu fare for appetizers, breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Breakfast is served any time.  

The crowd is a mix that doesn&#39;t have a name per say.  There was a healthy combination of men, women, young, old, straight and gay.  The spectrum of the socioeconomic scale was represented. Most important to that fact - everyone got along smashingly.  Prada was represented almost as much as &#34;plain Jane.&#34;

I will absolute return to Barracuda&#39;s when I&#39;m looking for communal type evening and a true home town atmosphere, and deep fried artichokes of course. It would be an excellent place to start a night out too...or even to stop by on your way to another destination.

My four star rating is largely due to the superb service, dynamic representation of all communities in the crowd and the &#34;say what you wish&#34; somehow remaining respectful atmosphere. 

I&#39;m marking good for kids as &#34;unsure,&#34; but it&#39;s OK for them during the day for breakfast or lunch.



Ode to Barracuda&#39;s

The Cycle Sluts I do read
Whilst drinking my mead
Your pool tables times two
On my deep fried artichoke hearts I will chew 
I drink brew after brew...

Stella Artois was her name
In a fine glass she came
In the stall there she went
Not too much money was spent
A fine time had by all

Meeting folks as I had my smoke
Telling joke after joke
In the mean time still not broke
Barracuda&#39;s I must stroke

No need to travel far
After beer...in the taxi car
Stay for breakfast with a smile
Fat and sassy all the while

With and ode and four stars
You shine amongst dive bars

We stopped in when Park T was way too packed during the Broncos game and had a wonderful time. Stiff drinks, cheap delicious food, great service, Yes Please! We were sat right away and everything was perfect from there. I split the vegetarian burrito with corn tortillas on the side and it was delicious! The burrito had peppers, spinach, and even broccoli which is rare and hit the spot. Everyone elses food looked great too. The fries were bland but with vegetarian red chili we fixed that. Such a wonderful surprise overall not at all what I expected."

Servers are great and very personable... The food is ok  not the best but not horrible.  I recommend getting the breakfast burrito with chorizo smothered in green...that&#39;s one platter that&#39;ll  enjoy. I definitely recommend this spot if u want bottomless mimosas through out the week. Only thing that does suck you have to leave the restaurant to smoke there is no balcony or patio nothing. If that had a little patio spot would just make it so much better.

Barricuda&#39;s does not do a traditional happy hour.  Instead of designating drink specials for a set block of time during the afternoon/early evening, B&#39;s just has cheap drinks all the live long day.  $2.50 wells and cheap beers (stuff like Coors...) are what&#39;s available, along with daily specials later in the evening (starting at 10pm).

They have both breakfast and lunch/dinner items available - depending on what time of day you go.  I&#39;ve only been here for the dinner menu, of which they have an extensive selection.  Plenty of apps, salads, sandwiches (from the basic BLT to the tasty Tofu Melt with bbq sauce and sauteed onions/green peppers/mushrooms), burgers, Mexican dishes, plates, and even pizza.  Nothing fancy, but a heck of a lot to choose from and stuff that&#39;ll surely hit the spot when you&#39;re a few in.

Bathrooms are clean, but I suspect they might go downhill as the evening passes (as I&#39;ve heard very personal stories from friends involving the gastrointestinal perils of too much to drink).  Still, get there early enough and overall it can be a very pleasant experience.  It&#39;s dark and outdated, but there&#39;s no attitude or pretension.  Just cheap drinks, good bar food, and nice service.

FYI:
- single Stoli is $4.50 ($3 from 10pm-? on Friday nights)
- Long Island is $7
- tall is $3
- double tall is $5 (because 2.50 x 2 is 5, der...)"

+ I chose to nosh on the Pittsburgher Burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Super tasty! I haven&#39;t had sweet potato fries in a looong time. They def hit the spot! 
+ I decided to be a glutton and get a strawberry milkshake to top off my meal. It was just the right amount of sweet. Though I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#39;t more pink in color. But it had the flavor and that&#39;s what&#39;s important.
+ While I didn&#39;t imbibe on this visit, there are tons of great local brews on tap!
+ The view of the mountains from the upstairs patio is great! Plus there&#39;s a fire place outside to keep you toasty on those cool winter days.

- Service was unfortunately lacking during our visit. While everything was timely with our order when we chose our table on the upstairs patio it was dirty, as was the table of another patron who had arrived before us. It took the server a bit before he came to both greet us and clean off the tables.

I would have expected a full turn of the tables in the time we waited, but it took so long for food to arrive, it was no wonder we waited so long.

The manager offered us a free appetizer for the long wait, then it showed up as a charge on the bill.

The beer was cold and the burgers were good.  We sent the foes back, they were cold and soggy, replaced with hot and crisp.

Not sure if the kitchen was off, the waitstaff was having a bad night or there was simply no management of anybody.

Decent amount of seating, a full bar, and a rooftop patio that I am sure is gorgeous in the summer. We came in during a little bit of colder weather and waiting around 40 minutes for a table. This seems to be the scene on a Friday or Saturday night, but it was worth the wait! 

Food came out fast and our server was nice and a little comical. My mom and I split the ahi tuna burger with coleslaw and my other family members went for bacon burgers.

We started off smooth with a nice male server, which I didn&#39;t ask for his name because laziness. But I should&#39;ve because the service went downhill after that. No refills, no to go boxes, and I guess it&#39;s understandable because we went an hour before closing. Surely that&#39;s not the case because it was a full house when we came in. 

What we had: Truffle Parmesan Fries that were pretty creamy to start off with but the salt was overwhelming and not off to a good start. I chose the Bacon Burger on Steroids, (That&#39;s literally what it&#39;s called.) it was cooked medium well which was good judgement from our server and then we had the notice of our choice to build your own burger and salad. My guy had built his own burger, and you can choose different types of meats, cheeses, veggies and condiments. He created a simple burger with bacon included. Apparently every order comes with a side of French fries, potato tots, etc. he chose the regular fries. 

The fries at the end made my head burn of a migraine because of how salty they were. My bacon burger was out of this world. This burger was great, but the fact that our server had forgotten us made me disappointed. I wanted more strawberry lemonade but how can I when I&#39;m forgotten about? He was a sweet server and very adorable but the service sucks during the night. I loved the burger and his suggestion to have it cooked medium well was excellent put out. 

The dessert was pretty good we had the brownie covered in cream vanilla and it had a few strawberries and sugar powder with a green leaf. It isn&#39;t too busy on a Monday night, but you pay the price of getting lame service. The people are nice though. There&#39;s no bias here."

I like the concept and built myself a nice little burger on brioche with thousand island, american cheese, bacon and a fried egg. Eggs on burgers is my new thing and this was awesome. It can get a little pricey for a burger with all those delicious toppings, but it was cooked perfectly and arrived with piping hot tots - who can complain about that?

The burger was cooked to how we wanted with all our toppings including cheese, bacon, and peanut butter! 

After we ate, we still had to flag people down to get boxes for our food and to order my friend his birthday milkshake. We also had to flag people down for our checks.

Find a specialty one on the menu or build your own from a wide variety of options. For those wanting something lighter and healthier, choose the build your own salad option, which what I did. Lots of choices to ensure you can create the perfect salad for your taste!!

This restaurant is on the pricier side for a burger joint, but the food was good and fresh. When building your salad you can add up to 7 non-protein toppings which is a fair amount. I chose avocado, chickpeas, cucumber, blueberries, strawberries, tortilla strips, and feta cheese w/ balsamic vinaigrette on the side. My salad was delicious, though I would have loved a few more blueberries &amp; strawberries on it. The feta was the perfect amount. 

For sides, the coleslaw was kind of boring and lacking in flavor, so next time my husband would opt for the fries instead.  

Service was prompt and friendly.

Seriously, turkey burger, brie and baked apples. How do you NOT drool over that?

The beer selection was pretty good, with lots of local craft choices and the staff was very friendly, if not overly social between themselves. The rooftop area was really beautiful and the seating was pretty ample. 

The only barrier preventing me from coming back here soon is the fact that it&#39;s in Northglenn, which is a pretty far drive for me to make to get a good burger."

Lot&#39;s of good choices and their fries and sides are good. However when you only do burgers you should always be able to nail the cooking temperature that the customer ordered. I tend to be picky when it comes to the doneness of my burgers but when two people order medium well, and two people order medium and all four burgers com out well done with no pink in any burgers you have to question the cook manning the grill station. It wasn&#39;t enough for us to send anything back or cross this place off our list, but again if your going to ask people their preference on the burger temp you should try and get it right. There are plenty of great burger places in Denver we may try a few others before heading back."

They have good flavor and the meat tastes fresh and semi juicy.  T got the bacon cheeseburger on steroids.  The burger is huge with lots of bacon.  LOTS.  We also got wings, sliders and green chile tots.  I created my own salad.  The side salad was actually pretty big.  The sliders were a let down.  Very dry and bland.  Can&#39;t go wrong with green chile or tots.        

First time here was for my broham&#39;s birthday.  We reserved the rooftop for a small party.  It was crowded and things got hectic and the servers mixed up or forgot or messed up a few orders, but nothing major.  There were a lot of us and we kept moving around and hey - they say all asians look alike, right?  Haha.  Service at other times I&#39;ve been here have been decent. No complaints.   A got the bacon cheeseburger on steroids - but a double - and with buttermilk fried bacon.  It should be called the heart attack burger.  I built my own burger with bacon, cheese and a fried egg.  I remember it being a pretty regular tasting burger.           

4 stars is more for the venue and the atmosphere.  It&#39;s a cool spot with the bar vibe and I love the rooftop on a nice day.  Food would get 3 stars."

The appeal for me is the ability to build my own burger/sandwich or salad. There are a lot of choices, which I like. The turkey burger was not good. The texture was awful. It was more like turkey paste, not at all solid like a burger. I&#39;m not sure what kind of quality meat they use but I can make a much better turkey burger at home. I stick to the grilled chicken now. My husband usually gets beef but loves their fried chicken sandwich. 

There are several buns to choose from
including a gluten free version and a lettuce wrap. They have a very large variety of spreads including my favorites, bacon mayo and parmesan spread. Including some very interesting toppings that cost a little extra: bacon, jalapeño bacon, buttermilk deep fried bacon, pastrami, egg, fried onion strings, etc. I&#39;ve had the onion strings and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re as good as what you can get at Red Robin. They also don&#39;t give you very much avocado, considering it&#39;s 75 cents to add and I can buy a whole avocado for a dollar at the grocery store.

They also have a few different sides to choose from. The fries and tater tots are great. They&#39;re especially good with a side of Bad Daddy&#39;s sauce (homemade BBQ with a kick). Bad Daddy&#39;s also has a house beer for only $3 that my husband loves. He&#39;s also a fan of the apricot beer. We will continue to come here as long as the quality continues. It&#39;s a great place to go if you&#39;re picky and want to create your own meal."

I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. The sauce is fabulous and there&#39;s the added perk of they brew their own beer.

Then the bill. It took 25 min to pay that.She disappeared again for 15 min brought back a $20 bill as change guess you wanted no tip because your service was sure  not worth a $20 tip.

You can get what you want off their regular menu OR create your own burger (with multiple meat/non-meat choices) or create your own salad. I picked create your own salad! It was soooo good. I got spinach (you pick between romaine, spinach or mixed greens), black beans, corn (which was actually good corn!), red peppers, red onions, tortilla strips, avocado ranch for dressing, and added a black bean burger patty. Oh my gosh it was phenomenal!! 

I do not recommend getting their &#34;giant&#34; size though because their &#34;small&#34; was more than enough food especially with the addition of the black bean patty, SO filling! I got a side of sweet potato fries....DELICIOUS! I don&#39;t like my sweet potatoes with marshmallow sauce and brown sugar, these were just served salted...perfect! 

All their sauces are spot on! I tried chipotle ranch and &#34;bad daddy sauce&#34; which is bbq sauce, ranch, &amp; chipotle peppers...so tasty.

We came on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm and it was a PERFECT day for patio seating. It was packed of course because a nice sunny Sunday in February is practically unheard of around here. Luckily upstairs is open seating and we caught a couple leaving. 
Ordering went off without a hitch but I think my girlfriend and I had both noticed a good amount of time had gone by. I would say a good 45 minutes after ordering. We&#39;re both not really ones to cause a fuss but our waitress took initiative and came over saying we&#39;ve been waiting a while and she would check on our food. Turns out my burger had been given to the wrong table and was being remade. No worries. We&#39;re patient. The create my own burger finally came out and PERFECT might I add, I was also thankful my girlfriends food was either remade or still hot so she didn&#39;t have to lose out because of me.
-Burger with buffalo, ranch, avocado, and a fried egg
-Tater tots ALWAYS amazing
Girlfriend had the
-Pastrami reuben burger which she said was excellent
-and fries (should&#39;ve been truffle fries but we didn&#39;t know it was an option until after.. Darn)
The manager ended up comping my meal and gave me a card for a free burger for my next visit on top of it.

I am new to the area and I yelped good places to eat around here and this one won. I went in around lunch time on a Thursday and was seated right away in a booth (I asked for one). The waitress was awesome and nice and explained things to me on the menu. I was so hungry so everything actually looked good but I got the southern burger. I can&#39;t remember the name but it was basically their chilli burger. I had decent hopes because, like I said, I&#39;m not a big burger fan so it&#39;s rare that I like burgers. Five guys was pretty good, but I still don&#39;t really care about them. Have to be in the mood. 

My food came out and it looked pretty good. So, I got a tater tot (my side) and dipped in the chili and oh my god... I was in heaven. So I cut in to the  burger to make sure it was well done. I can&#39;t eat any red meat if it&#39;s red or pink. And it was well done, thank god cause I&#39;m hungry and so far this is dang good. I cut a piece of the burger off and oh my god it was SO GOOD!! I sometimes don&#39;t like burgers cause the meat is flavorless and any slight taste of meat grosses me out. Like if it just taste like raw meat or whatever. Every single friggin bite was amazing! I was full when I left but my goodness, did I want more! I almost wanna go back for dinner! I can&#39;t wait to try the other burgers now! So glad I just got a place near this joint!"

I had the Bad Ass signature burger and fries. Everything looked so good I wanted to steal bites from everyone. I might have actually done so but there arent pictures so it didnt happen.

We also got the last of the ba*con queso that night too. We almost didn&#39;t though. Our waitress almost ruined our night by telling us they were out of it.

Burgers here aren&#39;t cheap but I think you&#39;re getting what you&#39;re paying for. My Pastrami Reuben burger was served on thick sliced rye bread and the burger was tasty and moist. I had it with Tater Tots and it was a good sized stainless steel mixing bowl full of nicely crisped tots. The 16 local craft beers on tap looked like a pretty good mix of beers from several Colorado brewers. The atmosphere reminded me a little of what the Dark Horse in Boulder (kinda what the No-Frills-Grill setup if you only know Denver) was a lonnnng time ago.

My husband and I ordered the Emilio&#39;s chicken sandwich and the bacon cheeseburger on  steroids. We probably could have shared an entrée and ordered our own side. Both were great and worth the price. The Parmesan truffle fries were also wonderful. We did wait for a while to get our food which was disappointing. We mentioned to our waiter that we were on a time crunch and had a plane to catch and after bringing our food brought out our ticket to sped up the process which was wonderful. Would definitely recommend Bad Daddy&#39;s to anyone visiting the area!!

It is amazing! We have been here at least a dozen times now over the course of the last year and we have never been disappointed. I always use the pad on the table to create my own burger. My boyfriend always gets the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. We have taken multiple, multiple different people here though and everyone has ordered different items and everyone has loved their food. The tater tots are amazing! Sometimes they have too much salt on them, but we just brush some of it off and they are perfect. We have always had good service. Definitely our favorite regular place to go! It has made us not like burgers other places we go, because they never live up to Bad Daddy&#39;s!"

I had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with a side of tattor tots covered in cheese and green chili. Burger was cooked perfectly medium rare. The bacon pieces were huge, thick and crisp. It was pretty large. So much so that I had to punch down the top to take a bite. I have a big mouth but obviously not big enough for this burger We also ordered the house cut chips... Yum, make sure to ask for more French onion dip ahead of time for these. The pimento dip was blah and runny so skip that. We tried the Elvis Shake and the Cookie shake. They were nothing special. More like a DQ blizzard. We won&#39;t order those again. The house draft was also nothing great unless your a fat tire fan. We will be back for the burgers again though and to try the fried pickles."

Loved the fun atmosphere and the rooftop patio rocks!! They have a bar on the first floor and also on the rooftop. Great service and location. We have been waiting for this area to explode with new restaurants and it finally happened. 

We started off with their fried pickles and they were mouth watering. Then I chose the Surf&#39;s Up Tuna Burger and it was amazing! It&#39;s made with ground sushi-grade tuna marinated in ginger. It&#39;s served with lime and soy wasabi mayo and peanut soy Asian slaw on a multigrain bun. So delicious. I have not experienced anything like that in a form of a burger before. If you want a healthier burger you must try this yummy goodness.  My son chose the Sam I Am burger and it was great as well. I believe you cannot go wrong in your choice. They all looked amazing!

I look forward to returning soon and maybe even trying something different?:))"

The prices here were good too because you knew what you were getting and you could build your own burger. Deep fried buttermilk bacon made my burger a bit hard to get into my mouth but I&#39;ll be honest on the side it was totally worth it. Our waitress brought my husband a few beers to try because he couldn&#39;t pick one and he said they were all amazing! He got two of them and she was very prompt.

Fun, modern, good music. The staff was very friendly, but the magic ended there. I ordered a burger medium rare but it came out medium well. I normally don&#39;t complain, but I normally don&#39;t eat red meat. I had a specific craving for a burger and saw that they used hormone free, local beef, so I figured I&#39;d get my cheat in there. The bartender was super nice and understanding so he took it back and had them remake it. While I waited I asked for a Deep Eddy Cranberry vodka with soda and received a grapefruit vodka and soda. At least I like grapefruit so I said nothing and drank it. When my burger came back out, once again, it was medium well, no pink at all. So I asked for a box and took it home to my dog. He asked if it was better and I showed him it was not. They gave me a &#34;free entree&#34; coupon but I won&#39;t be back. I don&#39;t want to go back to a place where my $30 (including a 20% tip bc I have been in this industry and at least they were nice) doesn&#39;t get me what I ordered."

We&#39;ve only been in once, so I cannot say for certain I learned a whole lot about the customer service. We sat at the bar, and the bartender took great care of us. We were pleased by that.

The micro-brew beer was served in large 20oz. glasses (or shorter, if the patron so desires), and poured quite well. So, no complaints there.

We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer. They were served quickly and hot. The fried pickles weren&#39;t the usual pull-it-out-of-a-bag-and-microwave kind; rather, they were homemade. Having lived in the South for quite a few years, I thought these would fit in quite nicely in any Southern restaurant. To get that down-home flavour, however, chefs should consider using more vinegar. The taste just wasn&#39;t rich enough to compete with what I&#39;ve had in the Mississippi Delta.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I was impressed by a manager on duty 31 May 2015! Most of the waitresses and the bartenders are young women. Two patrons sitting near us at the bar were talking crudely about them; it was -- to say the least -- offensive to anyone who heard them, including the young women. The manager approached the two patrons and asked them to stop talking about women that way. (Note: the manager didn&#39;t just say to stop talking about his staff that way, which is a foregone conclusion, but to stop talking about ANY woman that way.) Of course, the two patrons had some smart-alicky comment to say, but the manager just insisted they stop or leave. The two patrons decided to leave after a few more sips of their beer -- good riddance!

I will return just because of that manager and the moral courage displayed that sunny afternoon in May. Way to go, manager! You have definitely earned my respect and admiration."

As we arrived we were told it would be a 40 minute wait, which we thought was fair considering it was a Friday night. Yet, as they were ready for us, we were simply told to walk up stairs and &#34;we should see an empty table&#34;. No one greeted us as we got there and we waited at the table for about 6 minutes before flagging down a waitress to ask for menus.
      My wife ordered A Bad Ass Burger and I had a chicken topped nachos. Her burger was fine but my nachos were simply gross. Not sure what went wrong but the description of them didn&#39;t properly explain it. None of the flavors meshed well. The Bbq sauce completely threw off the nacho cheese and the pineapple didn&#39;t work with anything.  It was just a bizarre mess. I told the waitress it was too weird and when she came back later I let her take it away.
      I only finished about a quarter of it and seriously couldn&#39;t stomach another bite. They never offered to bring me anything else nor did I ask. If I go back I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll just stick to burgers."

There was about a 20-30 minute wait. The hostess was very kind and knew i wasnt thrilled about the wait and told us it was open seating uostairs. When she heard there was a clean table she let us know. Making the wait less than 10, huge plus.

Despite that, it was still a great burger. My brother got the Badass burger and that thing was massive. It is definitely worth the money for something that enormous.

I knew the original owners sold it a couple months ago. 
I was afraid it may go downhill but I didn&#39;t figure on an avalanche !
I ordered the chicken noodle soup. It&#39;s always been my &#34; go to &#34; when I&#39;m not feeling good.
How HARD is it to totally ruin such a simple thing? There was maybe three pieces of chicken, three or four veggies, almost no broth and what there was had to be &#34; doctored up&#34; to even have a taste at all! 
I would have been better off with Ramen noodles &amp; I hate those! 
To top it off it was $1.50 more than the great soup of old &amp; the didn&#39;t even give me those crispy things ALL others give with soup.

Guess I will be looking for new Asian restaurant &amp; make CERTAIN the rest of my family knows that now it is as bad as used to be good!

Sounds too good to be true.   Turns out, it kind of was.

Let&#39;s talk about the good first.  The man who served our table was very nice and helpful.  So nice, in fact, that I considered not posting a review at all.  He single handedly bumped this review up from two stars to three.   He was kind enough not to charge us for our uneaten sushi, which was really cool and he even let us take the leftovers home.   The other positives for Dragon Boat are the price for the AYCE dinner (about half the price of other sushi joints around town) and a really good selection of sushi, rolls, and appetizers.

Unfortunately, there are some major downsides when it comes to the food.  While I very much enjoyed the eel and avocado tempura appetizer we shared, the sushi and rolls just weren&#39;t very good.  The spicy crab roll was bland and not very spicy.  The grand canyon roll had such a ridiculous amount of cilantro and jalepeno in it that it was not edible until I pulled what equated to a side salad out of the roll (to be fair, after that, it was actually quite good).  The dancing roll was also kind of meh.  As far as the sushi goes, the quality of the fish was fine... not great, but perfectly acceptable... but there was WAY too much rice.  Same with the rolls - rice overload.

I think it&#39;s worthwhile for the price you pay, but you have to be VERY CAREFUL not to over order here because the amount of rice in the sushi and rolls makes each serving gargantuan.  I would not recommend ordering more than one roll at a time.  And that&#39;s a big disappointment if you&#39;re looking to try a little of everything."

My boyfriend and i decided to do the all you can eat dinner sushi. We ordered a couple sushi and some appitizers and soup. We didn&#39;t get our appetizers first which all was good! Then the sushi started coming in one by one at the table and it was NOTHING like it used to be. They all looked the same, the celery inside the sushi was SLIMY. We tried looking for the waiter but she acted like she was busy. I never got my soup, anytime the waiter did come we felt like we were bothering her and she acted annoyed. Spicy tuna was the DISGUSTING part of the sushi, it smelt old and i had to spit it out. We payed and just left, never will i come back to place. Seriously, DO NOT eat the sushi!"

We go in and it&#39;s empty apart from an older couple.  We sit at the bar to see how the sushi was made. We wait for a while and finally a waitress comes and asks what we want to drink. We order our waters and tell her that I want to order from the all you can eat and my boyfriend from the menu. The all you can eat menu looks good. We can get soups, wontons, lo mein, and lots of choices of sushi. I end up ordering mango, crunchy California,and Philadelphia rolls with lo mein, and wontons.

 My boyfriend got a California rolls and Philadelphia roll from the menu. After waiting a while finally the sushi maker comes out and she does not say hi or smile or anything. She starts with the rolls and a misunderstanding leads me with my boyfriend&#39;s rolls and him with mine. She still had not made the mango roll. So we are eating them and yes they are pretty good. They are a big size which makes you look like a chipmunk while eating. I start taking pictures and I tag myself using yelp on to facebook. You can see the pictures I took. I did like the wontons. They were very, very,  very good. 

 She makes the mango sushi roll and I take it. What I did not like about the sushi is that they used the long sticks of imitation crab instead of the shredded crab meat. The mango roll looked like the California roll but with fried imitation crab.

So there I am eating my sushi despite the sushi maker that&#39;s what I call her,does not say a single word and I am watching her roll the sushi all clumpy and like if she just started learning the art of sushi; when I get a notification on my phone. There on my Facebook my sister commented and said, &#34;ewww why are you eating there? There are  cock roaches there.&#34; I look at my Facebook post and omg I cannot believe that right there where I so proudly said I was eating all you can eat sushi the report card of Dragon boat was showing from yelp. 

It said how dragon boat had failed inspection and how there were roaches near the water and how storage of food was not safe. One I felt immediately grossed out I could not finish my sushi. Second how embarrassing to be posting on facebook that I&#39;m eating at a place where roaches and improper storage of food is a common thing.  I gathered my stuff and paid and bolted out of there. 

The whole way to Costco I was trying to not throw up my food and forget that I was even there. So if you guys want to eat where they failed at an inspection go ahead. Until they get better grades and I see that then I will go back. The staff was friendly but were invisible most of the time."

The  place is decorated decent. Sitting in the center of the dinning room are the unsightly bus tubs.  Bus carts and tubs should never be in view of the dinning guests. That&#39;s gross. They take up several tables in the center of the room and use it as a work station to store and prep condiments and roll silver. Another thing that should not be in view.  It was cluttered and just plain tacky. The whole staff sat at a table in the dinning room eating. Every time a guest walked in they were greeted by a staff member with a full mouth and no hand washing. 

Ah the food..  my son got all you can eat sushi. He was happy. 
I tried the Vietnamese noodle bowl. I was surprised to learn that it came with soup. The egg drop soup was very good. The egg roll and wanton were fine. The noodle bowl was very plain and not the quality I&#39;ve had at other places. The veggies were basically lettuce and some cucumber slices. Not visually appealing in anyway. The sauce served on the side is always the best part. You expect the flavor to be in the sauce. It smelled like rotten feet. Not good at all. 

I wonder if they break as many rules behind the screan as they do in the front of the house? Sushi is very sensitive to preparation and tempatures ect..."

BUT I was in yesterday 5/20/2015 with my husband and my sister in law.. service again was terrible I asked the server for hot oil sauce and she made it seem like I was asking her for an arm and a leg.. the food was ok I have never fully liked their sushi I think the rice isn&#39;t fresh which is what makes the sushi taste not so fresh but what put the cherry on top for me NEVER WANTING TO COME BACK was when we go our bill. They are now INCLUDING TIP and I don&#39;t think this is right. I am a server myself so I know how hard the restaurant industry is but normally a tip is included if it is a party of 6 or more but when its just 3 people having dinner and getting shitty service its not ok to add tip.

Just because they were probably receiving no tips due to their horrible service doesn&#39;t mean that they can now include the tip."

I have eaten at Dragon Boat many times when I was living near there, and it is overall an okay-to-good restaurant. I never had a bad experience, but also never had a great experience either.

The all-you-can eat sushi is good, and stands up on it&#39;s own as being quality. My personal favorite, and I would recommend any sushi fan try, is the zombie brain dish, a mixture of avocado and tuna. I have nothing but good things to say about the sushi, especially the price that makes it very inexpensive for sushi. 

I have tried the orange chicken, and didn&#39;t not care much for it, it was very citrus heavy, without a lot of sweetness. 

The only issue I had with the staff was that frequently when eating there, the staff would have conversations just a few tables away, loudly talking and laughing with each other, to the point that it overwhelmed my own conversations.

That being overlooked, the sushi is good and at a fair price, but the rest of the menu and atmosphere can leave something wanting."

It was a clear night and they were less than 2 blocks away from me... 
The general tsos chicken was not spicy AT ALL and it was soggy (even though I ordered it EXTRA spicy and crispy) but, it did still have somewhat good flavor.

My son has a bad cold and I wanted to take him somewhere to get soup. We spotted this place on our drive and decided to give it a shot. We ordered combination Lo Mein, chicken noodle soup and a California roll with baked salmon and dynamite sauce. It&#39;s a common roll. The server kept asking me, almost cartoonishly, if I wanted Lo Mein. Our less than average dishes came after a lengthy wait. (And it should be noted that their version of chicken noodle soup is a very long way off from what the average person would call chicken noodle soup.) They were tossed on our table by another server, who promptly walked away. We had no plates or silverware. After several minutes of trying, we finally flagged down someone who brought plates. We began eating but I kept wondering when the roll would make it&#39;s appearance. Finally, another server brought our roll- the wrong one. After several minutes of trying to flag someone down, I gave up and moved it to the side of the table- where another server picked it up and apologized for leaving it at the wrong table. Amazingly, our original server walked by and I asked if our roll was coming and she turned and yelled across the restaurant in her native tongue to inquire. The roll came about 10 minutes later, when we were completely finished eating. It was served not as a roll, but as a block- absolutely drowning in dynamite sauce. I ate one piece and just couldn&#39;t do it. Very low quality, not even made with sushi rice! I sent it back. Yuck. We had to wait another 10 minutes to speak to our server AGAIN to request our check. The best part of our meal was getting the heck out of there!!!!!!!"

Bugs literally crawling everywhere when I went to the bathroom. Told the staff and they argued with me to the point that our entire table got up and left. 

I LOVE sushi but refused to eat it once I saw the amounts of bugs. Did I mention they did NOTHING about it either? No discount, no meals removed, not even an apology.

The Dragon Boat is my uncle&#39;s favorite restaurant and has begged me to go there with him for years! I would pass by it almost everyday and say &#34;I&#39;ll go there one day.&#34; 

That day finally happened and I must say I was extremely impressed. Now I see why my uncle eats there 2-3 time a week. We ordered a full spread, lo mien, sushi, soup, etc. and it was all excellent. The staff was fun, I am sure part of that is because how often my uncle comes in and how much money he spends there as a regular. 

I can&#39;t say that I would be a regular here because it is pretty far from where I live, however; I can definitely say, when I am craving Chinese cuisine, I will definitely have the Dragon Boat at the top of my list!"

It used to be good for Chinese and okay for Japanese food. After a prior negative experience, my fiance and I decided to try it again. Bad idea. The server that we had, gave a dirty look most of the time, whether intentional or not is unacceptable. 

We ordered from the all you can eat sushi menu. We both love sushi, but my fiance can only eat small portions. She ordered calamari tempura, edemame, hot and sour soup. I ordered a volcano roll, unagi roll, spicy salmon roll, one order mackerel and one order spicy scallops.

As expected, because her food is cooked she received it first. The calamari tempura was greasy and the sauce was heavy. The soup however was good and the edemame acceptable. I waited at least 30 to 40 minutes for my sushi, even though it wasn&#39;t very busy. When I finally got my order, it was incomplete. I didn&#39;t say anything, as I thought the rest might still be on the way. The volcano roll was good, almost as good as you&#39;d get at a good sushi restaurant. The unagi roll was lacking. The unagi was all inside the roll. The rice outside was somewhat dry. Not terrible, but far from great. The spicy salmon roll was never served. It was supposed to have spicy salmon, tuna and yellowtail. I think this was left out on purpose, as it was the most expensive of the three. The small mackerel order was good, although heavy on the rice. The small order of spicy scallop was also missing and replaced with cheaper tobiko rolls, which I didn&#39;t bother eating.

 Also throughout the meal, we had to ask repeatedly for drink refills, which also took forever. So we waited a long time on poor service, to not receive what I ordered. In between serving tables, the waitress would go to the corner of the restaurant and eat. At one point, all the staff mysteriously disappeared into the kitchen and didn&#39;t return for several minutes. The missing items and substituions seemed an easy way for the restaurant to be cheap, while testing the customers memory of what was ordered. The restroom smelled of raw sewage. In short, I will never return. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone. It seems another victim of negligence from staff. They don&#39;t care as long as they make money."

The vegetable tempura had a nice variety of veggies, the most I&#39;ve seen from places like this (broccoli, yams, zuccini, mushroom, green pepper and green bean).

I was hoping delivery would be as good as dine-in and take out, and I&#39;m very pleased.  

We ordered lunch delivery today and received 3 entrees (sesame chicken, pad thai with chicken, and cashew shrimp) along with 3 spring rolls, 3 containers of soup, and 3 crab wontons - all for UNDER $23 BUCKS!!  We have tons of leftovers, and received our order only minutes after hanging up the phone to place our order.  I noticed that they did not even charge the standard $1 delivery fee.

Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious.  The spring rolls were exceptionally good.  I discovered that the pad thai is not my style though.  I prefer the sweeter &#34;red&#34; sauced pad thai dishes.  This brown variety is probably considered more authentic, so if you prefer your pad thai less sweet be sure to give this a try.  No biggie...I&#39;ll order from here anytime I want Chinese or sushi and will save the Thai entrees for Thai restaurants.    

If you live within 3 miles of this restaurant, I&#39;d recommend trying the delivery option."

I had already hit up the gyro spot (which was great, by the way) so I decided to break my rule of not eating any seafood in a landlocked city and got some sushi.

I&#39;ve read some of the reviews about this place and I have a hard time understanding  some of them.  Some said the service was slow.  Slow? My sushi and beers (BOGO free) can in a blink of an eye and I never had any problem with the service.  I thought the quality of the sushi was fine.  Not the best, definitely not the worst, but fine.  Then again, I&#39;m not a sushi connoisseur, so I can only recognize the really bad.   

I came back with friends later that night.  This is where I had the biggest problem.  It was late and the restaurant closes at 10.  We were seated and served, but felt like we were being rushed out when the food was served.  If they wanted us to leave at a certain time, they should have told us that we either can&#39;t be seated or &#34;sorry for the inconvenience, but we start closing up at 945.  Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that I could only get 2 beer as opposed to my initial plan to get totally blasted."

My husband and I generally get 5-6 rolls when we do AYCE sushi, plus appetizers. At Dragon Boat we ordered a few appetizers (crab cheese wontons, potstickers, and a dish called zombie brain) and those were between average and above. Then we started with 3 rolls. Worst sushi I have ever had! It was tough for my husband and I to get through the rolls. One of them had so much mayo-type sauce that I gagged when putting it in my mouth, another had tempura shrimp with the grossest thick batter on it, and the last one was very mushy but dry at the same time. Needless to say we are not going back there for sushi. We would rather pay the $23+ per person AYCE sushi at other places we&#39;ve gone to in the past (Wasabi, Sushi Katsu, Samurai to name a few)."

It came out very quickly and we were very surprised by the size of our sushi rolls. They were very generous. I posted a few pictures. We noticed on the top of the menu you have to pay for whatever isn&#39;t eaten. So we were careful not to over order. But we weren&#39;t ready to leave yet and were wanting just half an order instead of a full order. So we asked our waitress if we could order that and with attitude said yes and when I asked if by chance we couldn&#39;t finish it could we take it home and she said &#34;NO it says you pay on the menu.&#34; I said &#34;I was just asking but I understand, thank you.&#34; So we ordered 2 more appetizers. Which this time took forever to come out. She did come over after a while and pour more water in my cup which went all over the table. She didn&#39;t say anything nor did she clean it and walked off.

I ordered some sushi for pickup yesterday night for four people with the hopes of tasting the same delicious sushi I used to constantly have when I lived close to their location. I was immediately disappointed by the soggy presentation of my sushi. I ordered some &#34;Crispy&#34; California rolls for my parents who aren&#39;t big fans of sushi and to my demise received regular badly rolled pieces of sushi with dry rice that were falling apart the second I put my fingers on one. The seaweed was so dry when I took a bite a could feel and hear the crunch as I chewed. As for the Sakura rolls, the avocado was somehow sloppily smeared on it sprinkled with a baby handful of masago on top. The spider roll unfortunately had to be thrown out because of the slimy and sour avocado that was rolled into it. Least to say we were pretty grossed out by our dinner. Definitely last time I stop by or order from Dragon Boat.

I ordered: unagi roll, avocado roll (for my 3-year-old who loves sushi), sake kawa (salmon skin) roll, a tempura shrimp roll (with spicy mayo), a salad with ginger dressing, and vegetable tempura (again, for my daughter). 

The unagi was undersauced and didn&#39;t really taste like much, same with the sake kawa (though I enjoyed the danmuji/pickled radish in it- reminded me of gimbap) and the skin could have stood to be a little bit crispier. I could barely tell the two apart flavor-wise apart from the radish. Those were mostly meh, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d order them again. No complaints with the avocado roll- I mean, it&#39;s an avocado roll.

The tempura shrimp roll was pretty outstanding. Massive shrimp, and I asked for them to put spicy mayonnaise on it- which they did. It was delicious. You get eight pieces per roll, and the pieces are large- I was definitely impressed with the portion sizes for the money. The vegetable tempura was a massive bargain for just over five dollars- there was an absolute ton of various veggies and sauce- enough for more than two people as an appetizer. Broccoli, Japanese eggplant, bell pepper, onion, carrot, and even snow peas were fried up and still very crisp upon arrival.

The salad was also a massive portion, with an adequate amount of dressing. The ginger dressing was really outstanding- maybe a little on the sweeter side than I&#39;m used to, but it was delicious. I found myself eating the salad and tempura and then barely touching the sushi (it&#39;s in the fridge for tomorrow&#39;s lunch). 

I spent just over $30 and got enough food to probably feed three people- too bad it&#39;s just me and my little daughter! I don&#39;t mind leftovers, but I think I will order less the next time. Their delivery fee is a mere $1 in their delivery zone (which includes my flat in the Broadstone Vesta complex), it arrived within thirty minutes, and the delivery guy was really nice. 

I&#39;d definitely order again, but maybe stick to the more flavorful items on the sushi menu."

We were seated by a man who I thought was our server. He wasn&#39;t. He brought us our drinks and I ordered green tea. I got a MUG of tea, in a semi-clean mug. We waited a good 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order. In the midst of our wait, a man burst into the dining room from outside, hollering &#34;CALL 911....CALL 911...someone is beating up my father !&#34; 
Apparently, there was a fender-bender out on Iliff that turned violent. 
Then our food arrived. I ordered the crab and avocado salad that was supposed to be on a bed of greens, and I ordered peanut dressing on the side. What I GOT, was shredded...maybe crab...with a good looking avocado, on a bed of iceberg lettuce hearts (you know, the bitter insides of the already flavorless iceberg head.)The dressing for my salad tasted like peanut butter. Not peanut sauce. Disgusting.  I could only eat a bit of it. Ugh. 
My son ordered sesame chicken. It was awful. The batter surrounding the chicken was mushy and porous, the sauce was way overly sweet, and the batter soaking up the mess made the dish pretty un-edible. The birthday girl ordered the all you can eat sushi for 13.95. She had one plate of the stuff. She said it was &#34;okay&#34;. My sons water glass was empty, and he saw the water pitcher on an empty table near us, so he helped himself. The server dashed over and fairly knocked him aside to fill his water glass for him. She wasn&#39;t smiling. No, I will never return here."

A group of my friends who loves eating sushi went to Dragon Boat Sushi and Asian Kitchen for our monthly sushi fix.

This was my second visit to this restaurant.  My first visit was way back sometime in September 2007.  

The decor is the same.  The staffs are also the same.  The place is clean as what I could recall.  The only different was the seating arrangement that were allocated for us.

The sushi is basic.  Nothing spectacular or fancy.  All my friends like it.  They rate it between 3 to 3.5 stars.  They allow reservations and allow separate checks.  The slight downside, only 1 person prepared our Sushi for our group so that took awhile for the whole group to have their Sushi dinner.

Price was reasonable.  All in all an OK experience.  Rate it between 2.5 to 3 stars for my personal experience.  Though I cant deny, my first visit to this restaurant, I experience better sushi.  Oh well."

Reasonably priced, good service, etc. I finally got a chance to try this place out. $15 all you eat sushi. I started with the crab cucumber salad, which was very tasty. Then moved on to the sashimi... The octopus, crab, and tuna was great. They were very generous with the portions, unlike other spots, that I feel try to cut back due to the whole &#34;all you can eat&#34; factor. The waitress was also very pleasant and suggested I try one of their specialty rolls once she found out that I was a fan of spicy tuna. I will definitely be back."

They delivered my food within 30 minutes as they estimated. I live right across the street from this restaurant, but had never ordered before. I ordered based on yelp reviews without a menu. When I looked over the receipt they charged me $1 for delivery. If I would have known this I wouldn&#39;t have left as much for a tip. I&#39;m walking distance from them. It does however say they charge $1 for delivery on the menu.

The Crabmeat Cheese Wontons were pretty good. Not horrible or spectacular, but decent. The Wonton Soup was about the same. I ordered Sesame Chicken, one of my all time favorites. It tasted like it was slightly burnt and the flavor did not resemble Sesame Chicken in the slightest. I can&#39;t say I will be ordering from here again.

**Very affordable--from Sushi to actual entrees, everything is very affordable and has good portions. 
**Octopus salad--I&#39;ve never tried this elsewhere, but I really like it here. The portion comes in a pre-dinner salad size, where its just enough to eat as an appetizer before your actual meal. You can request it mild or spicy and the ingredients are usually fresh.
**Fast and friendly service
**Buy one get one free beers

What I don&#39;t like about this place:
The sushi is just okay--nothing special about them and the rolls are pretty small. 
This goes for entrees too.

So I guess the best way to describe this place is that you pay for what you get. You may not be paying a lot, but you&#39;re not really getting a lot either. If you need an inexpensive meal that won&#39;t totally suck, here&#39;s your restaurant. If you&#39;re looking for an actual sushi fix, I&#39;d go elsewhere to be sure to not disappoint."

1. Miso soup is nasty.  Probably worst miso soup I&#39;ve ever had.  Too salty, and they used dried seaweed.  It&#39;s fine to use dried seaweed, but not like that, not a big square and letting it soak for hours.  And I know miso is supposed to be salty, but I&#39;m not supposed to pass out from my sodium consumption from one bowl of soup.
2. Sushi was not good.  Too much rice, and not good rice.  It&#39;s way too dense and mushy.  The kind of rice where you can&#39;t make out one grain from another, so it just looks like the fish was rowed in mashed rice ball.  
3. I don&#39;t think the fish is too fresh. Not asking for flown overnight fish, but just somewhat better.
4. Things that were cooked and came out hot is a little better, but not enough for me to come back for their sushi buffet again.

For same/similar price, do yourself a favor and just go to Sushi Katsu instead."

I ordered the Orange Chicken/friend rice/ hot and sour soup. My beau order General Tso&#39;s chicken and the same sides. Also an order of pepper calamari. 
My Orange chicken was really delicious! I guess I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be breaded and fried like sweet and sour chicken..but it was good none the less. Including the veggies. The HoT and Sour soup was really good. That stuff was super HOT from the stove for quite a good while too!

But wow am I impressed. I honestly haven&#39;t enjoyed a meal so much since I left Ohio, where my beloved Jasmine is, so I am glad I checked this out.

Cheap prices, very fresh, great portions, nice staff. When I say they take their time on the sushi it is not a complaint - sushi is not something that is supposed to be immediate. The girl who made mine painstakingly made it look perfect, in fact I was slightly sad to eat it, it looked pretty adorable.

Also, not sure if I happened to pop during a happy hour or something (right before 5) but amazing prices. I got 3 (THREE) pieces of sashimi for $2/3. I loved how they asked about 3 times if I was sure I wanted sashimi and not sushi (it has no rice!) but I don&#39;t need rice. If the fish is fresh, gimme it, leave the rice. And like I said, very fresh.

SO my vote is if you are in the area or want to make a small fieldtrip for fresh cheap sushi-def a stop.

As far as their entrees or Chinese menu goes - I have no idea. Sorry!"

I love that I can create the exact pizza I want... I can be a little picky when it comes to pies. They always have a pie of the month. My favorite by far has been the pumpkin with crumble and frosting drizzled over the top... OH. MY. GOODNESS. It was amazing. I usually get something cheesy with white sauce (I&#39;m not a fan of red sauce on pizza, but theirs is ok ish). They have a thin crust and a regular crust, though I can&#39;t tell a whole lot of difference between the two, maybe a little more crust on the edges. They also serve beer on tap! Can&#39;t go wrong with that! 

All in all this is pretty tasty. The only complaint is sometimes it&#39;s too loud to even think. Being that I&#39;m usually here between classes I would prefer to have a little more comfortable environment. 

*tip* if you ask for a to-go box, take your food out of the restaurant... I don&#39;t usually eat a whole pizza, so I take half with me, even then when I eat it there I feel like a terrible, earth hating person."

The pizza is okay. It&#39;s pretty doughy and most of the time the ingredients taste pretty low quality. But that&#39;s to be expected for a $7 personal pie I suppose. It&#39;s good for what it is and will fill you up in a hurry as long as you&#39;re not a pizza snob.

I can concentrate on reading or studying around noise, so the atmosphere doesn&#39;t bother me at all. I actually prefer working around the music and chattiness of this pizza/bar over in a quiet library. 
I love their &#34;bread for the fans&#34; bowl for when I&#39;m not hungry enough for a pizza, but a little snack does the trick. They just put little rolls in a bowl that are free for whoever would like some. I also enjoy their selections of beer. I work at a bar downtown with 50 taps and 500 bottles, so it is sometimes hard for me to find something I haven&#39;t tried as far as beer goes, but with their 4 taps (a couple of them rotate) and bottle/can selection, I have had a beer I&#39;ve never had before almost every time I go in there. 
To add to that, the student staff are always very helpful and often really funny. I am so glad this place is on campus where I go to school."

The only reason I give it three stars is because the service time is so unreliable. Sometimes you&#39;ll be in and out in like 10 minutes and others you&#39;ll be waiting for 25. 
That wouldn&#39;t necessarily be such a problem (certainly not one worth 2 stars) but this place serves a college campus. That means people are stopping by on breaks between classes or on their way to class. That means most people, myself included, are need to be somewhere at a certain time. If it consistently took 10 minutes or if it consistently took 25, that would be fine. But never knowing how long I will be waiting makes it impractical for a quick bite which is a shame because it&#39;s far far better than the crap they have downstairs in the food court. I waited for 25 minutes once and ended up being 15 minutes late to class. 

So overall I recommend it butjust know that you can&#39;t really budget for time because you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re gonna get."

They were out of 6&#34; white bread too and their POS system did not honor my Firehouse Club points. How can you be out of 6&#34; bread when you also serve footlongs.

A selection of a lot of hot subs, some cold and sides like chili.  They have the cute Firehouse themeing and lots of cool lingo (like the hook and ladder or getting your sandwich fully involved). You know, if you are into that sort of thing. 

This one popped up on the other side of E-470 on Smoky near Aurora Parkway. There is limited fast food in this area so it is a welcome sight!  I stopped in today (having been to another Firehouse before) and got a couple sandwiches.  It is one of those places where there are 10 people working and no line, but it still takes forever to get a couple sandwiches.  I suppose it means they make them with care? I don&#39;t know, but it is a little slow and a bit pricey (a couple sandwiches, chips and drinks where around $20). Maybe it is pricier because they have the fancy schmancy coke machine that has every flavor under the sun and kinda looks like some red glowing computer :) 

At any rate,  I do love the flavor of the deli meats they use.  The bread is always soft and fresh.  And they have a varied enough menu I can find a few things that please me.  All in all it is a good place to get a sub.  I&#39;ll be back! It is tasty and relatively quick in an area of town that doesn&#39;t have a lot of selection!"

I like the theme here and the &#34;Fully Involved&#34; option--mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side--clearly explained, although I missed the sign at first.

You have an ARMY of people behind the register/counter making sandwiches, no line, yet it still takes approximately 15-20 minutes for a sandwich?  I&#39;ve been to other firehouse subs and they are 10 times quicker, you shouldn&#39;t have to wait that long for a sandwich that is nearly the same every time someone orders it.  Also, the &#34;welcome to firehouse&#34; is beyond annoying, I get it, it&#39;s supposed to be all like a club and a firehouse but when it&#39;s robotic and no emotion behind it, it&#39;s annoying.

Now that&#39;s out of the way, the sandwiches really are good.  Fresh ingredients, crisp pickle, and good selection of drinks.  My favorite sub is the turkey bacon ranch.

2 things to note if you eat at this location; 1. order online, otherwise be prepared to wait and 2. the large sub is seriously large - like which wich large 14&#34;."

Went because my husband has been to other locations and loves it. I&#39;ve never been before but it seemed like a good idea. I only have 1 question...Are all of the sandwiches made out of grossness &amp; mayonnaise or was it just mine? Seriously, how much mayo can 1 sandwich hold? Apparently in my case it was a lot. Ugh. The soda was mediocre. I can&#39;t even imagine how you mess up soda. The chips were good. Thank goodness they were sealed.

I had to go back to the counter and wait to talk to someone to request ice.  The cherry limeaid sounded kind of good.  I got some and looked to put a nice slice of lime in the drink.  There was one nasty room-temperature slice of lime in the bin by the drink area.  Yuck.  Also, there was some unknown sticky substance on the button I had to push to get my drink.  Lastly, it took a full 15 minutes to get my sandwich.  There were 4 people working the counter and they didn&#39;t appear to have any sense of urgency.  I wasn&#39;t in a hurry but why does it take Firehouse 10 minutes longer to make a sandwich than the folks over at Quiznos or Subway?  I would only come back if I had lots of time.

They never skimp you on meat and have literally a whole bunch of diffrent hot sauces to use. it is a little expensive but its worth it. will I go again well duh of course I will"

They were under staffed with one waiter whom I believe also served as bartender.  He was a very polite and helpful waiter, but shouldn&#39;t have been alone.  We were left waiting at the door for a strangely long amount of time without seeing anyone.  

Most disappointing was the portions.  My wife and I both ordered Cabo bowls.  They were good, but for $11 they were seriously lacking.  They filled about 40% of the bowl they were served in.  Oh, and the salsa was just okay and quite runny. 

Otherwise the place was clean and is well decorated."

We had a couple of bad experiences back then so it took awhile to forget and to decide that neighborhood Mexican food was worth the risk. Boy were we ever wrong. We started with queso dip that looked like it had just been poured out of a can and microwaved. Our dinner arrived about 3 minutes after ordering, making us wonder how it could have possibly been prepared fresh. The waitress even commented on the speed. I ordered the chicken and steak combo fajitas and it looked a lot more like stir fry than Mexican. All vegetables, just a few tiny scraps of meat, and sauce right from the supermarket aisle. My wife ordered the rellenos which were tasteless and full of cream cheese. We also ordered a chicken burrito that was completely devoid of flavor. On the bright side, we now  remember why we drive to Los Dos for real Mexican food.  What a shame but lesson learned."

Service was very good, kept our drinks and chips and salsa full, and even the manager asked us if we were enjoying our meal. Great customer service!

I have my favorites and actually try to go there when they are there, so I&#39;m completely biased :)  The owners are very sweet and I&#39;ve watched their kids grow up.  The spicy green chili is great and they will add pureed habanero to it if you need more spice.  The combo plate is my fave, but I love, love, love the cabo bowl with shrimp and black beans if you want something light.  I add some lettuce and the spicy chili mentioned above."

No one ever showed up to seat us or even tells us one moment. We ended up going somewhere else. We tried again tonight and got sat right away. The chips were basically crumbs the salsa had little flavor. The food was ok but not the typical that made this place our favorite Mexican food. Sad to say but I think it has come time for the search for a new place to go.

We visited this location about 3.5 years ago and had a less than optimal experience. We returned this time because of a Groupon. We figured, it&#39;s a discount and maybe things are better - not so much. First error was with the drinks. I ordered an iced tea and they brought a Diet Coke. My friend ordered a margarita on the rocks with no salt. It arrived with a salted rim.  We ordered an appetizer but it never arrived. When we mentioned it to the sever who brought our entrees (not our order taker), she apologized, but at that moment we knew it was best to nix the app entirely. Our entrees (beef fajitas and cheese enchiladas) were average. The side of rice was crunchy - really? Crunchy rice is never a good thing. Even with the groupon we felt we overpaid. Not a good value at all.  They get 1 star for being courteous. Sorry, but I won&#39;t go back or recommend."

&#34;A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT TACOS&#34;

Food/Drink: 
While I was here I tried the Chicken Mole (because I LOVE Mole&#39;) and the Taco Buffet for around $7.99.  With the Chicken Mole I really liked the sauce they used but thought the chicken was a little &#34;dry&#34;.  They serve their tacos &#34;two at a time&#34; until you can no longer keep ordering more.  I have to say I was quite stuffed after I had my third taco and could not go a third round.

Service:
The servers here are always very friendly and professional.
Great Service...

Atmosphere: 
This place definitely has a Mexican feel and when you look around, you can see all kinds of Southwest pieces that add to the ambiance of the restaurant.  The one thing I found a LITTLE disappointing was the fact that the place did not offer any dishes that had cactus in it.  There are many great and authentic Mexican restaurants that offer cactus on their menu.  I just wished that a place that looked and felt so authentic would&#39;ve made it available to their customers (and I say this in a nice way!)

Price
Decent...You&#39;ll find a lot of items on the menu for less than $10.

Parking: 
Free parking in front of the building.

MY THOUGHTS?
I would come to Ajuua again since they do have great specials.  I also enjoyed the service and for the most part can appreciate the authenticity of this restaurant.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Try their Taco Buffet (but know that they only do it one day out of the week).

Here are some of their other specials:

If you want authentic Tex-Mex, this is the place.  As a transplanted Texan, I know my way around Tex-Mex.  No, you&#39;re not going to get cactus on this menu- this is not a southwest restuarant-it&#39;s Tex-Mex.  Warm fresh chips and the obviously in-house made salsa are always good.  Margaritas are great with good kick and the Tacos al Pastor are just the right size and used proper plating (just small corn tortillas with the cheese &amp; meat) with condiments (cilantro, onions etc) on the side.  Good job with the rice and beans too - the obvious side to most dishes. My family has been here several times and we always enjoy the food. The service can get a bit thin on busy nights but all-in-all, this place is a winner. We will be back."

First off the service is S...L...O...W!!! We were there for a total of a hour and a half. Our server kept walking by our table avoiding eye contact with us. I thought maybe it was just our server, but then realized the table by us that had been sitting there before we were seated had not been waited on yet either.
When our server brought out our drinks I noticed that my glass was not clean. I had to ask for another one, and when our appetizer came out the plates he sat down were also dirty. SERIOUSLY?!?!
The food was bland and nothing special. I have had better food from taco bell. Their prices are over priced for what you get. Definitely not worth the bill.
At the end I had to flag down our server for our bill and ended up having the hostess ring us out.

When it was mentioned to our waitress she said they were there first which was bull. Waited 10 more minutes then said to heck with it and left. The places was half empty and being busy was not the issue. When we were leaving we were ask if we wanted our food to go? Really, no we wanted to sit and eat at the table. I will never go here again and I wish people luck when you do."

If by certified &#34;Authentic Mexican&#34; they mean bland salsa and rice, then they&#39;ve hit the mark.

I will say that the Carnitas were decent as was the chicken and refried beans.

The service was ok, nothing spectacular; our server was nice.

We sent back our iced teas, because they had a decidedly &#34;fishy&#34; taste. The water we had was fine, so there must be something wrong with their iced tea maker.

The place is a little pricey considering the atmosphere and quality of the food.  I don&#39;t see my family and me going back there or to any of the other restaurants in this chain."

The chips and water guy was on top of his game.  Though our server took some time to get to us and hardly ever checked up on us.  Chips and salsa were pretty standard, though I liked the salsa quite a bit.  Girlfriend had taco salad.  She liked it though the shell looked like it sat in the fryer a little too long.  I had the carnita street tacos.  They were actually pretty tasty.  This place was pretty good overall.  I guess I should cut the server some slack b/c there was two homecoming parties there."

But at least now we know.  It&#39;s just..&#34;eh&#34;.  The prices are way, WAY more than we would normally pay for mexican food.  
We ordered a nacho platter and split it (family of four). I think we ended up spending around $13 bucks for it but it was like the only affordable solution other than just walking out.  That might sound like a reasonable price to some people for a plate of chips with toppings, but not to us. And apparently it is because they&#39;re still in business.  But this is my take on it (hence the personal REVIEW). 

The staff was nothing to write home about either. In fact they looked like they were there bodily but their minds were on their next text message which they promptly attended to whenever possible.  

All in all, prices are just too high for what you get - so-so service, so-so food and hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. If you&#39;re like me and love finding a gem of a &#34;Mom and Pop&#34; eatery, this is not it. 

We won&#39;t be back."

Since I have an allergy, I didn&#39;t trust them to omit them from the order, so I went with a shredded beef burrito. There was barely any chile smothering it and it was all bland and tasteless.

We used to love it, but tonight the food was meh, and the service was horrendous. They were reasonably busy when we first came in, so I was willing to cut the server some slack, but she waited promptly on the table next to us. I guess it helps to be related to one of the employees. Besides not taking our order when she brought drinks, even though our menus were closed and we were ready to order, she never voluntarily refilled our drinks. I also had to ask for more tortillas for the fajitas (which turned out to be a bad choice, cause yes, mushrooms, and I&#39;m pretty sure I ran into a piece of pineapple, which might have been OK without the mushrooms). My drink glass was empty when she brought the tortillas (by which time I was by far the last one still eating) and she still ignored it. I asked for a box, and even at that point, she wouldn&#39;t just leave the check. It&#39;s like she went out of her way to provide poor service, like she was punishing us for something we did to her in a past life. As a few other people have said, the food isn&#39;t so amazing here that you need to go out of your way to come back. I&#39;m not sure if my standards are higher now, or if theirs are lower."

The wait staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  I love the Tacos Del Carbon - they are my faves.  The 4 corn tortillas with steak, cilantro, onions and a green chile salsa is a simple dish with some heat! It is sort of their version of street tacos.  Even my husband, who tends to get the same thing everywhere he goes (ground beef burrito with green chile), is a fan!  Big portions and yummy food make it a place we keep going back too!"

This is a local chain, which I always appreciate, and they have a HUGE menu, which they regularly update. There really is something for everyone here. Their regular size margarita is 18 oz. - plenty for me. While this location is much smaller than others in the Denver area, it&#39;s usually not too hard to get a seat. Service in generally good, however, sometimes speed and communication are a little lacking. The chips and salsa are consistently good (always a good gauge of a Mexican restaurant), and the rice is yummy. For something a little closer to authentic, give this one a try."

Menu items may not come out as described.  Some of you may have seen this restaurants coupon ad that comes in the coupon mailer and said to your self hey not bad deal... especially this one entree free with purchase of another entree $8.95 or less GOOD LUCK finding something on the menu that meets that requirement.  I decided on the all you can eat enchiladas on Wednesday deal.  The selection was great I thought it was just going to be cheese enchiladas only.  But here is where I have a problem.... the menu clearly says the Chile Colorado is made of ROAST BEEF, I double check to make sure there&#39;s no Pork in the chile and the waitress says no.... my question should have been was there Pork anywhere on the dish?  For religious and personal reasons I do not eat pork, I think many of you can understand that.  So when I get my meal... careful the  plates are freakin hot!!!  I start eating away and when my server comes back to check on the meal, my vegetarian friend asked if there was meat in the Chile Colorado (not knowing that&#39;s what I was eating) and the waitress confidently replies yes it contains PORK!  WTF!!!  I just ate half of my meal.  I really don&#39;t want to get into the conversation I had with the manager, who was not really the manager just the guy put in charge that night per his response when I asked him if he was the manager.  But evidently management has been aware for months that the menu states roast beef but it&#39;s really pork.   Thank God i&#39;m not allergic to pork, but I can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s really no big deal between the difference in what they&#39;re selling from what they&#39;re serving."

It&#39;s not our favorite Mexican joint but it is good. Like many have said it is a bit overpriced for Mexican but they do seem to give a fair amount of food. Both times I have had the Ajuua burrito and I really like it; it&#39;s filled with grilled steak, rice and your choice of beans, it is topped with pork green chile, sour cream, and guac. There margs are good but are WAY over priced though unless you go during happy hour when they are half off. My wife has had the rellenos, tamales, and enchiladas and liked all of them. In all I think that it is has good, authentic Mexican and will definitely go back but not as often as I would like because of the prices."

To say this place is OUTSTANDING would be not strong enough words. I brought my date to Angel&#39;s Share (she lives only five minutes away and had never been!)....and had a truly great experience. The menu is outstanding and very reasonable. The service is remarkable - because our server, and apologies because I cannot recall her name - was fun and friendly, and knew exactly when ask if we needed anything. Thank you - this was my 4th date with my companion, I&#39;m trying to impress, and she had such a nice time. 

AND - HERE IS THE OTHER REASON I AM A LIFETIME CUSTOMER......my car battery died. I went back to Angel&#39;s Share to see if they knew anyone to call. I live in Boulder County, so Roxborough is a long ways away. The chef - Theo - dropped what he was doing, and pulled his truck around to jump start me. What a lifesaver. Theo - I owe you big time.

We had our kids with us and the waiter was attentive to them which was nice. He told us about items that they could prepare for the kids that weren&#39;t on the menu. Additionally, he brought out papers and pens for them to entertain themselves while we waited for our food. My wife and I had the sausage, spinach, and peppers for an appetizer. The blend of these three were perfect and the sausage had the right amount of kick and flavoring. We tried the Ridge Burger with the Duck Fat Fries and the Marherita Pizza. Both items were exceptionally good. We substituted the bleu cheese on the burger for gouda and the pretzel bun was the perfect way to hold it all together.

It was very flavorful.  I enjoyed an Octoberfest beer and it was good.  I didn&#39;t see the bill but it turned out to be an $80.00 lunch, which seemed pricey.   I was nervous of the duck fishes but may venture in and try it.  I wondered why our server &#34;ran out&#34; to get something to eat, when they have a full kitchen.

After seeing our bill for $80 with 3 drinks, I understood why he left for lunch.  I would have done the same."

Every detail of our dinner was superbly handled from the moment we walked in until the end.  I&#39;m not comfortable describing food, I can tell you, everything was 5 star+ blissfully good.  My favorite was &#34;the quacker&#34; duck sloppy joe. We also had salmon with risotto, bass, and pork tacos.  Everything was beyond our expectations.  The chef stopped by and made sure one in our party was happy with the menu choices,  telling her he could alter, change, add, delete anything to a dish to make her happy. He succeeded.  One of us was in a wheelchair and wanted to also watch the Rangers game.  So without a moments hesitation, tables were moved out into the bar area so our wheeled friend could watch the game. I will go back anytime I&#39;m in the Denver area."

Both dishes were amazing and we&#39;re excited to go back.

Overall, the food was great, the service was exceptional, and the wine, beer and cocktail selections were good and reasonably priced.  Not a combination that&#39;s easy to find.

I know it&#39;s just right around the corner from my home, so I decided to take baby with me. I figured it&#39;s in a neighborhood shopping area, so it should be kid friendly, right?  Um, NOT a good idea. They didn&#39;t have any highchairs and the single clientele did NOT appreciate the baby jabber!  

On to the food:  Eh, it&#39;s really nothing to get excited over.  I was more excited reading the menu then actually eating the food.  I had the Formaggio de Capra (which was ok, but really needed more seasoning), the Margarita Flatbread (not enough cheese to make it worthwhile) and the Devil&#39;s flourless cake (It&#39;s more like a light brownie than a rice flourless cake).

We were surprised and delighted with the beef medallions with the little potato cakes and the lamb lollipops, which are so delicious that we came back a week later for them again.

We came on a Saturday night and were surprised they still had the buffet running. Our server had informed us that we could still order from the buffet, but that our food would be taken straight from the buffet. Real appealing, right?

The buffet was... Well, a buffet. Quality was noticeably lower than when we&#39;ve ordered off the menu. Naan was delivered to the table but was dry, cold, and a bit hard. 

They came and refilled the chicken tikka masala because it&#39;s so popular, which was a plus. But that quickly ran out as well.

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the dinner buffet. Might try again at another Yak and Yeti location, though."

I know that sounds very negative, but it is the truth. 

I requested a booster seat for my daughter as soon as we were being seated. They never brought it to us even though we asked twice. It&#39;s a bit difficult  to try to contain a 2 year old that doesn&#39;t have a seat to sit in. 

A server other than our original server asked us if we were doing okay. We then asked for a water for our child. They then proceed to bring us a coke. After telling our server that we didn&#39;t order a coke she then goes to get the guy that asked us if we wanted anything. What the hell! Why not just take the drink we didn&#39;t order and bring us the kids water. I felt as if she didn&#39;t believe what we were saying. 

The food just wasn&#39;t that great either. I was truly expecting to taste &#34;my new favorite restaurant&#34; type of food, based on the reviews that I was reading. 

On the plus side, they did have many vegetarian options! Overall, I would not recommend this place."

The garlic naan was really tasty. The naan was on the sweeter side, but oh-so soft and warm! The Alu Gobi (medium spice) was pretty flavorful, had a bit more oil than I expected, but the potatoes and cauliflowers were cooked to perfection. I tried a bit of the Sweet Potato Masala (medium spice), and found it to be really yummy! The dish was sweeter overall, but had a small bit of luck to it.

The lunch buffet had a great variety of curry like chicken curry, tikka masala curry (can&#39;t go wrong with this one), sweet potato masala and more. They also have white rice, yellow rice, and naan for you to eat with they curry. The naan here is absolutely to die for! It comes made fresh and isn&#39;t super oily like some of the naans I&#39;ve had elsewhere. I also really like their desserts, especially the banana pakora and mango custard.

They do have a wicked good chicken tika masala, and I liked seeing the yellow rice as an option. I had some veggie korma and samosas. I tried some of the coconut soup,but I wasn&#39;t really impressed with it. They did have a lot of options: tandori, chicken chili, and fish korma lots of the normal you would expect to see. However, I just feel that in general the flavor is lacking. Especially when I tried the dessert rice, I always expect a bang from cardamom or cinnamon. This was just lacking. They do have good options but nothing compares to my favorite Indian place.. I did consider that it was a weekend and they might not be at the top of their game.

We do some frequent take out from the Westminster location but three weeks ago I had an alarming issue. After picking up my takeout bag and driving half way home I got a call from the restaurant that they had forgot my tiki masala. I looked and they had added a saag dish instead (as it was green)   Now I was thinking- this is great I will get a extra dish for my drive back. When I walked in to take my masala they told me they wanted the saag container back.  What???  They then placed it with another take out order to the side that apparently ordered that dish.  This violates all health laws and I told the desk people &#34;you can&#39;t do that&#34; and I got some confused looks back at me but they very clearly placed it with the outgoing takeout order.  I have been known to nibble on my takeout while I drive home ( especially when I order those delicious fried paneer cheese things)  I hope you didn&#39;t have the paneer takeout on Friday 8/19 around 7pm.

I was completely disgusted and was told it was &#34;spinach&#34; after I showed them that if you pull on it, it doesn&#39;t give. And I pulled hard until my hands shook. Then after the guy went to the back he asks me where it came from and I told him and he removed the entire tray of that food item.

3-4 entrees and two types of rice.

My girlfriend and I are regulars here and we have never had a bad experience. Entrees are usually $8-$13 and the lunch buffet fantastic as well (ranges from $10-$15) depending on the day you visit. A few of our favorite dishes are the honey ginger chicken, chicken chili, lamb curry, sweet potato masala, samosas, rice pudding, and; the best desert ever: banana pakora. The drinks here are expensive, but also worthy of your hard earned money, as you can&#39;t find drinks like this anywhere else in the Denver area. They brew most of their own drinks, and cook with fiery passion. I love this place!"

I travel quite a bit both internationally and domestically which means I get to try a lot of food. Indian is one of my favorites and I just LOVE that there is a great indian place near home.

Live in Broomfield so I usually go here because its the most convenient. But with that said, I do think the atmosphere of the Arvada location is better. This one seems like it used to be a Dennys or a Perkins and was converted. Doesn&#39;t affect the food mind you, but if you want a more intimate experience, make the drive down to Arvada. 

The buffet is usually well stocked when i do that, but does not seem to ever have Naann.

You really should order the Naan, they have a variety of tasty flavors. 
They also have a great selection of craft beers."

For $11 for the lunch buffet I would expect that plates would be cleared or at least one check in to see how we are doing.

The food is delicious and at a good price.  There is plenty of flavor  and i love the way they have so much selection compared to the other lunch buffet options at other restauraunts. One side of the buffet is completely vegan and although im a big meat lover their vegan food tastes as good as if it has meat in it. The naan bead they being out is always fresh and soft and delicious and tastes delicious by itself, swooping all your food ir dipping in the chutney. I tey not to eat too much of it though because it is very filling. Also they have alot more dessert offerings than any other Indian buffet i been to."

I went solo on a Friday night, was seated right away and drink order taken. The reason I give 4 vs 5 stars is because I had scoped out the menu before visiting and had my eye on a mixed drink listed on their website. When I asked for the drink menu at the restaurant, none of these mixed drinks were listed (just beers and wines). I asked for the whiskey w/their ginger soda and received a plain soda, no alcohol. I was charged for a plain soda (the soda was good!) but still, I was ready for a drink...

So many options at the buffet! Everything I had was delicious and definitely fresh as the waitstaff was constantly replacing and replenishing items. Both the chicken and sweet potato masala were awesome, loved the chickpea dish. Broccoli was so good. Naan was perfect.

Visit this place! I&#39;ll be back the next time I&#39;m in Denver. Definitely would bring my husband to try their beers!"

The faces that greet you are smiling as to say Hey YOU found us, we are so happy to see you. Maybe that was because it was a Monday night. The spot was busy but not to busy, The buffet was at appropriate temperatures, so we decided to grab a table and then hop over to the buffet. What can I say, with three options of rice were yellow, white, and Brown.   Then to follow 5-6 Indian specialties that are finger licking good. I could put that Vindaloo Sauce on EVERYTHING. 

Now yall that follow me know I am never a proponent of buffets. I can however vouch for this one. It is tasty and well kept. Now if you are looking for a server to come to your table and charm your pants off....,thats not this type of establishment. The water glasses are HUGE so if you wish to have tons of drink be sure to ask for low ice. 

Final Verdict: Must Stop in Denver Burbs, Take plenty of friends, have plenty of laughs and try a funky beer, but don&#39;t expect any of the servers to bend over backwards.....You are there for the food."

First of all, this is hands down the best Indian buffet I have been to in Colorado. They have a huge variety of selections, including multiple soups, a variety of salad options, meat main meals, veggie main meals, three types of rice and desserts for days. Also, both their buffet and regular menu are well labeled with what is vegetarian, vegan and gluten free, with plenty of food for folks with all types of dietary needs.

Ok, so yes, there are options...but how are they? Ah.May.Zing. Really. I mean, first of all, who makes Sweet Potato Marsala? Um, Yak and Yeti, that is who. That is fabulous. Their appetizers are fabulous. Paneer Masala is amazing. Mali Kofta dumpling action is phenomena. I haven&#39;t had anything bad here, and neither have my friends who actually eat things of the meat variety. Whether you rock the buffet (including lunch prices on the weekend, which is awesome!), order off the menu, or take it out for a yummy night at home, Yak and Yeti is tasty, affordable, and offers a selection that is sure to please all palates and needs.

You can get as much delicious Indian food as you&#39;d like at their lunch AND dinner buffet (dinner buffet, how great is that?!). It is a little pricey for two people to go for dinner - but if you don&#39;t order any drinks, you can walk out (for two people) under $35. Their food is not the best Indian food I&#39;ve had, but it is very good and satisfying. Absolutely worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area!"

Lunch buffet is $10.95; dinner I believe is $4.00 more.  They have free wi-fi, you simply have to ask for the password.  I went with the buffet (very late lunch).  Below is my review of the items I sampled.  

The lamb vindaloo was disappointingly mild and referring to it as mild would be a stretch.  I know that many people don&#39;t enjoy food classified as &#34;spicy&#34;, but a dish that is known for its heat should at least be a &#34;medium&#34; in a buffet setting.  The raita was very good and had a nice balance of flavor.  Aloo matar had a nice consistency to it and a pleasing .  Mix pakora was overly fried and seemed to be heavily battered.  The large variety of desserts was a nice change of pace--it seems many places usually limit it to one or two options, but I counted at least five.  They bring fresh naan to the table and while it was the crispier, flakier variety, I felt like it spent too much time on the oven as it tasted burnt.  The vegetable korma had a very good, creamy taste to it.  If I&#39;m in the area, I&#39;ll probably stop in again, but I won&#39;t drive 15 miles on a regular basis.  If they had another location closer to my house, I&#39;d probably eat there regularly."

The Yak will entice you with its siren song of delicious tandoori chicken, but the Yeti will soothe your soul with the flavorful offerings of chicken tikka masala.  No but seriously, everything here is good and they brew their own beers and this place is the best.  Do yourself a favor and hit up the buffet.  I highly recommend at least 3 bowls of the shikarni.  Staff is friendly and they have like Himalayan hats you can buy on your way out in case it&#39;s cold I guess.  Also, this place is called the Yak and Yeti.  I DARE you to find a better restaurant name.  Lastly, if they got the jalapeño beer, skip it, it seems like a better idea in theory than in practice..."

On the one hand, I was kind of disappointed to find out that the only option was the dinner buffet, since I&#39;d hoped to order off the menu.  On the other hand, I had the chance to try a couple different dishes, and everything was set up pretty nice.

We tried:
--chicken tikka masala: my husband mostly had this, and I had a taste-- it was great.
--lamb vindaloo: actually very spicy, which isn&#39;t surprising for vindaloo but is surprising for a buffet.  Very good dish.
--sweet potato masala: the main reason I&#39;m glad we ended up with the buffet.  I never would have ordered this, but it was delicious.
--vegetable samosa: not the best I&#39;ve had, but quite tasty.
--saag paneer: very good dish
--kheer rice pudding: not my cup of tea, but my husband enjoyed it.
--some sort of fried banana dessert: I don&#39;t remember the name, but it was fantastic.
--naan: this was pretty good, but they don&#39;t keep it at the buffet, and we didn&#39;t get any brought to our table until we were almost done eating.  Not the end of the world, but it would have been nice to have it earlier to soak up some of the delicious masala and vindaloo sauces.

We also tried both the chai milk stout and the IPA, and were impressed with both.  Service seemed a little abrupt, but nothing dramatic to complain about.

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d make the trek across Denver for Yaki &amp; Yeti, but I&#39;d definitely give it a try again if I&#39;m in the area."

There was no shortage of meats drenched in spicy, colorful sauciness, varieties of rice, and even some sweeter dessert-like fare. Waiters bring a plate piled with fresh naan to your table as well--perfect for mopping up the remainder of those glorious sauces on your plate. I was incredibly happy with the food.

Service = 0 stars. Holy...... I get the feeling this might be a sort of family business, as the waiter acted like he had no interest in being there, as if his parents or someone guilted him into working at the family restaurant instead of pursuing his own interests and now he&#39;s incredibly resentful. He absentmindedly brought us double the waters needed and didn&#39;t bother to correct himself (the place wasn&#39;t even busy!)

Yak and Yetti&#39;s buffet is filled with the staples (lamb vindaloo, saag paneer, chili chicken) and it&#39;s all delicious. They bring naan bread to your table and feature four Yak and Yetti Brewery beers. I had the himalaya IPA -- it was ok but a little light on flavor and hoppy bite. One thing I will critique that is probably more the result of a communal buffet setting rather than a knock on Y&amp;Y is the vindaloo had almost zero heat. I, of course, went for seconds (#likeafatty) and added hot sauce to my second plate because I like my Indian food to be melt-your-face-off spicy and this was not so much."

Atmosphere: 3
Service: 2
We had the buffet, and most of the dishes I sampled were very good.  If you get the buffet, they bring you naans at the table, which is a nice touch, but unfortunately, the naans were not good, quite dry and brittle, I don&#39;t know if this was just bad luck, but  still, it&#39;s a shame if an Indian restaurant can&#39;t get the naans right.  
My problem really was with the attitude of the staff at the restaurant.  We went last night, which was a Saturday, knowing that the place closes at 9:30 pm.  We arrived at 8:45, wanted the buffet, but were told the buffet closes at 9:00 pm.  We still went with the buffet, even if the 15 minutes left were far from ideal.  A big group that came after us was told the same thing and they were hurrying to get their food on time.  I thought that rule was quite strict, especially since there was another big group, but, fair enough, we had been warned.  Then at around 9:20 pm, someone started vacuuming, we were actually joking about it, until at 9:25 they basically started vacuuming right next to us, almost under our table. It was so loud, we could not talk anymore, and when I asked the person to go vacuum a little farther, he answered &#34;we are closing&#34;.  Well, that was too much, it was not even 9:30 pm yet, which I told him.  But since he kept saying we are closed, we just left.  I noticed the other group left right afterwards.  Wow!!!
So, yes, the food is good, but not good enough for me to go back.  There are enough other Indian restaurants in the area that also offer good food and where they seem to care about their customers.  Next time, I&#39;ll go to the Taj in Louisville, great atmosphere, nice service and good food.  And it&#39;s right next to where I live..."

I usually go for the lunch buffet as it is a bit cheaper than the dinner but I ALWAY chose the buffet as there is a variety of food. I get stuffed very easily so it should say something that I pay for the buffet even though I get full on one plate. The chicken tiki masala is my favorite meat dish and the saag paneer is my favorite vegetarian dish. Both of these go great with white basmati rice. I love to soak up the sauce from each of these when the rest of the dish is already in my belly! I love both locations.

HUGE selection--well over a dozen entrees, most of which were vegetarian. Lots of old favorites (chana masala, vegetable korma, saag paneer, etc), along with a few plates that I had never seen before. I got to try egg curry, coconut soup, sweet potato masala, and carrot pudding for the first time. I didn&#39;t care much for the egg curry (I&#39;m just not a big fan of hard-boiled egg), but I definitely found some new favorites with the coconut soup and carrot pudding! All of the vegetarian entrees were expertly spiced with full-bodied flavor. SO GOOD. The chicken tikka masala was also very good--the most tender that I&#39;ve ever had. 

The dessert selection was also by far the most varied I&#39;ve ever seen at an Indian buffet. Mango pudding, banana pakora, kheer, and shira (think, cream of wheat with sliced banana). I might have also had an extra helping of the carrot pudding...

The naan was just okay. Mine was lukewarm and a little undercooked. The carrot pudding was very good. It&#39;s like a pudding with minced carrots in condensed milk. I had their home-brewed Chai Milk Stout as well. It was refreshing, and served in a nice fat goblet. One of their other three homebrews was a Himilayan IPA. The server was cool to let me try a sample of the two. The restaurant itself is nice as well. Would I return to Yak and Yeti? Maybe."

When I was in India, there were good things and bad things, but the majority of foods I enjoyed seemed to be confined to a tiny portion of every menu, so I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be going back any time soon.

But I needed some kebaba, naan, paneer, and hoped against all hope for a little gulab jamun to cap it all off (but they didn&#39;t have any) so I went up! I had some house-made craft beer, and inhaled some phenomenal medium spiced kebab. Remember, this is an Indian place. And they have real Indians working there. When you want spicy, then ask for it and they will proceed to murder the life out of your face with heavy spice. Note: It&#39;s wonderful! You will feel like someone on bath salts trying to escape your own skin with how spicy it is, only in the BEST POSSIBLE WAY. It&#39;s truly great.

The funniest part to me was that we had an Indian server (as you might expect) and his service style was in no way at all colored by what most American diners expect. He was serving just like he was in the middle of a touristy restaurant in Mumbai, Delhi or Kolkata. Despite a little awkwardness, I thought it was fantastic. 

All in all it&#39;s a wonderful stop with excellent beer, and authentic Indian food, and a fun semi-kitschy decor that complements the meal well! 

Protip: If you&#39;re going for the Yak or the Yeti, I saw none on property. You will be disappointed."

Horrible. They should be banned. 65 dollars down the drain. Don&#39;t ever go there. I do not know how they have such good reviews on yelp. I have lost my trust on yelp reviews. 

Food: horrible. It was super stale food. Naan was not cooked at all. Food was tasteless and stale. I felt like throwing up on eating it. Paneer was like stone. Sabji seemed to have a lot of food color added to it. Kofta seemed like it was just removed from the freezer and gravy was thrown on top. 

Buffet: a friend got buffet instead of ala carte. Stale. Super stale. Undercooked and stale. He was scared he will fall sick on eating the buffet. He just picked some fruits from the Buffett hoping fruits would be fresh. But canned fruit would taste more fresh than this. 

Service: I think the server was stoned. Definitely stoned. He couldn&#39;t understand us well. Gave weird or non comprehensible answers when we asked him questions. Had this smile stuck on his face throughout even when we tried to ask him a serious question. I am very sure he was super high and in a different world. He even missed items from our order. 

Also overall staff was super rude. We had just started eating when the come ask my friend who had taken the buffet to pick what he wants as they want to wrap up. They should have mentioned this when he was choosing the buffet saying he will get 5 minutes only to pick all he wants to eat!! And when he requested for 10 more minutes as he didn&#39;t want to waste food by taking more, the staff became very rude and sarcastic. They taunted us saying &#34;we can surely go 10 minutes late for you&#34;!!

We were very dissatisfied with the food and angry about how we were treated. We couldn&#39;t wait to get away from the rude and stoned staff who didn&#39;t care.  We wasted so much food and left the place hungry. 

Please do not eat here. Even if there is no food on the whole earth and only they have food, please choose to die of hunger rather than off the food from them.

We walked in and were greeted with a warm welcome by a few staff members which is always nice! They didn&#39;t have a large drink menu, but it was decent enough for my husband who normally orders beer and I ended up getting mango lassi. We both were happy with our choices! We started getting food from the buffet and immediately realized that all the pans were almost gone. There were still enough amount left for us to try most of them. They had good, but not great, flavors which is still fine for a buffet. After our first round, we got up for another and the staff had started pulling the pans to take it to the back right at 9! We were also told that whatever we want to eat, we better grab it now because they were closing. I understand that this establishment isn&#39;t a large chain that will wait for the last customer to leave at their leisure, but I wish they would&#39;ve let the patrons who were already inside to enjoy it a bit more.

Overall Rating: 10

I am a bit of an Italian food snob, which anyone who has read my reviews will know and as a result am quite picky. Odyssey is rave-worthy. Combine the ambiance, the food, and the service, and you have a rare Italian dining experience that surprised me and left me yearning, or longing, or craving, or....lusting for more!

Odyssey is a Sicilian style Italian restaurant, and they pride themselves on making everything fresh in-house. The menu is broad with many options, and I had trouble deciding what to order since there really wasn&#39;t anything that didn&#39;t sound good. We started with the house special cocktail, infused limoncello, of which they had both lemon and orange, mixed with either Prosecco (drier) or Moscato (sweeter). I preferred sweeter, and through the course of the meal tried both lemon and orange. Both were delicious, with lemon having a more subtle taste and orange much stronger and bolder (and ultimately my favorite).

Since we had a large group, we decided to order 4 appetizers to share. The Arancini (Sicilian Rice Balls) came with 4 lightly fried risotta balls and a side of homemade marina sauce. They were stuffed with peas and 3 cheeses--mozzarella, parmesan, and gorgonzola. They were some of the best I have ever had, bursting with flavor and even better with a bit of marinara. 

The Crab Stuffed Mushrooms came with 6 and were served over a bed of spinach and tomatoes with a lemon wedge. The mushroom bells were quite large and jammed full of a stunning crab concoction and then drenched with lemon butter white wine garlic sauce. The mushrooms were to die for, and they were fabulous with a bite of raw spinach.

The Fried Cheese Ravioli was a bit different, as I am used to many places doing more of a heavy batter deep fry. These ravioli were very lightly fried and still very much resembled ravioli, just with a crispier texture. They had a very attractive mezzaluna shape and a wonderful flavor, and they were stuffed with divinely fresh ricotta cheese. Either naked or with a bit of marinara sauce, this was quite a delicious app!

The final appetizer was Clams and Mussels, a very nice serving of fresh clams and mussels that had been steamed in a garlic white wine seafood broth. The shellfish was extremely fresh, tasty, and tender, and the broth made it more-ish. The broth also served as a great dipping sauce for the bread. 

I had a bear of a time deciding on food and ultimately went with both a pasta dish and a meat dish. I started with the Penne Rustica, which I have had at a few other places, but past experience was nothing like this. It consisted of roasted red peppers, garlic, onion, chicken, and sausage, all mixed in a sauce combining both rosa and marinara with a splash of cream, then topped with a large lump of fresh ricotta cheese. It was beautiful to look at in person, but rather than staring I stirred the ricotta in throughout the dish, making it creamier throughout. And oh, the flavor! The freshness of the ingredients, the melding of flavors, the incredible smooth creamy finish....I could have dreams about this dish.

At this point I was already about to pop (I had also eaten a Caesar salad), but next on the docket was what I had been most looking forward to: Colorado Rack of Lamb, a half rack of local lamb that had been marinated in lemon and olive oil and then smothered in a delicious reduction of red wine mushroom and rosemary. It came with sauteed garlic spinach and roasted potatoes, but I subbed a side of the bowtie pasta with gorgonzola cream sauce for the potatoes. I was in Heaven. The lamb melted in my mouth and was so insanely tender, moist, and juicy, causing a mosh pit in my mouth! The spinach was delicious and garlicy, and the gorgonzola cream sauce was stunning--sharp, creamy, smooth, and simply wonderful.

At this point a wheelbarrow was in order, but I wasn&#39;t leaving without trying the table side bananas foster dessert. Someone else ordered tiramisu, and I got a couple of bites of it. It was smooth and fabulous, and the only thing preventing me from eating more was the impending pyrotechnics show. Our waiter did a fabulous job making the dessert, filling the air with deliciousness and putting on a pretty cool show, too. He poured the final syrupy sweet bananas over ice cream and topped it with whip, and a frenzy of deliciousness ensued. What a way to end a meal!

The restaurant itself is like a big old house, with a super cool ambiance. We were able to sit in a private room on the third floor, and it was quite cozy and homey. The service was impeccable, and we even got to converse with Chef Ignazio during our appetizers! The food is a bit pricey, but for both the quality and the portion size, it is well worth it. I simply cannot say enough good things about Odyssey, so I will summarize with this: I would fly to Denver again just to eat at Odyssey."

The place is cute, dine on the top floor if you are inclined to eat there, it is small and private. Being Italian, I like to think that I have had my fair share of bad, good, and great Italian cuisine. The Odyssey is fair at best. Recently, we had a guest visiting and we brought him here as we were in the neighborhood and it was a Sat. evening; Meaning, it was unlikely we could get in one of the better restaurants in town.  

The meal was a total disaster. Overcooked calamari which were as tough as rubber-bands, overly-spiced seafood dish, (one needed a fire hose to dampen the heat), and they even shorted my guest on his shrimp dish, which was completely tasteless. Like, shrimp with a warm water sauce. Blech!

The server was new and we suffered as a consequence. The owner was not there that night and for some odd reason, we were told that there is no manager. I left my name and number with the front desk but heard from no one. Same when I emailed the restaurant.

So, we have crossed Odyssey off our dining list."

They sat us by the fireplace.  It&#39;s right next to the kitchen and the stairs to the upstairs dining, so that&#39;s a heavy traffic area.  It is what it is.

While we are awaiting our appetizer, they start blaring, and I mean blaring, that noted Sicilian singer Louis Armstrong over the speakers.  This *is* an Italian place, right?  They did reduce the volume of course.

OK food.

*Oven fried cheese ravioli was good
*Linguine and Clams - fair amount of the clams were unopened. 
*Lobster Ravioli - good, but not great
*Fettuccine Alfredo - no complaints from that diner
*Veal Saltinbocca - the creamy dijon mustard overpowered the veal.  Not a good combo IMO.

Prices for entrees are generally $3 higher than listed on their website.  So yes you too can pay nearly $30 for Veal Parmesan should you choose to do so.

Wine pours were good, although the wine by the glass - or at least our choices - mostly meh.

No problem with the service.

If this is considered one of the best Italian restaurants in Denver, then it&#39;s time to get new Italian restaurants in Denver.  Or hope others have picked up their game (looking at you Locanda Del Borgo...)"

I want to start out by saying be mindful of parking here. It is only street parking and it is not easy to find parking. So, if you go leave quite a bit before your reservation as parking is rough.

Otherwise we LOVED this place! So quaint. A very romantic atmosphere. Staff was fantastic! Very understanding that parking is hard to come by so they took my drink order and brought water and bread while I waited for my husband to park.

The bread is delicious, very soft. For appetizers we had the tomato, mozzarella, and basil salad and the fried ravioli...don&#39;t miss these! They are delicious! For salads we had Caesar Salads, they were rest-served with lots of parm! For the main course we had fettuccini chicken Alfredo and fettuccini bolognese I loved the bolognese, hubby said the Alfredo could have used to be spiced up a little as it was a bit bland but overall pretty good.

We will definitely be back, but may uber there after parking downtown first! Ha!"

Salads are appropriately dressed, the olive oil and balsamic for the bread should be done at every italian spot, delicious. The entrées have never blown us away. The lobster  ravioli is good but not amazing, steak is almost always over-cooked for us. The mussels are pretty good and wine selection is nice. You won&#39;t be disappointed when you eat here, but don&#39;t expect the best meal of your life and weigh that against the price."

Odyssey offers that lower Manhattan, small Italian restaurant dining experience - without the pretentious attitude and exorbitant pricing. Like a fine wine, this place only gets better the more often you go."

The service, for example, was incredible. One couldn&#39;t have an empty water glass without it being refilled and our server was very attentive. 

The atmosphere was also very special. If you&#39;re looking for a romantic date night spot, this is the place for you! Think candlelight, rose petals and traditional romance.

The tiramisu was maybe the best I&#39;ve ever had as well. It was light, fluffy and sweet with a hint of savory dark chocolate powder. Mmmmm.

My penne bolognese was decent. The menu listed cinnamon as an ingredient and you could really taste it, which provided a sweet and somewhat unusual take on the dish. The capers were also a little sweet (more like peas), which was okay, but not my favorite.

I did like Odyssey, but not enough to visit again without checking out a few other new places first."

I booked a month before Valentine&#39;s day and many other restaurants were already fully booked. Odyssey had a lot of openings so I was able to book through open table easily. When we arrived, the place was packed and even though we were 15 minutes late, no questions were asked and we were immediately seated on the top floor that had a window view. The seating was quite crowded but it is Valentine&#39;s day after all. 

I loved how the table was decorated with red roses and the lighting was a soft lighting that really set the romantic mood. The waiter was super accommodating and explained the wine menu to us. We decided to go with the Borgo Scopeto Chianti Classico which was a light and refreshing red that wasn&#39;t too bitter. They give you bread with a olive oil and balsamic vinigrette dip. It was seriously the BEST free bread I have ever had at any Italian restaurant. The dip was especially delicious because the vinigrette reduction was very sweet and it came with freshly chopped garlic. I loved it and when they asked if we wanted a second serving of the bread, it took a lot of self control to say no. We also ordered the riceball as a starter. It comes with 4 rice balls which is perfect for sharing. It&#39;s a ball made of risotto and lots of different cheeses deep fried so that the outside is crispy. With the marinara, this is absolutely phenomenal. Just when I was reaady for my entree, the waiter told us we also get a free cesar salad. What?! What restaurant gives two free appetizers? This is crazy. 

For my entree, I ordered one of the pastas under the specialty list. It was the chicken with mustard sauce with a side of sauteed vegetables. My boyfriend ordered the veal with a white sauce, capers. Both our dishes was a HUGE portion and we only ate through about half of it. THis as left overs the next day was pretty delicious as well. They hand make all their pastas so the noodles are just perfect. I really liked my entree as the chicken was very moist and it had proscuitto and the vegetables were delicious as well. My boyfriend was a bit sour because of the capers and also it was a bit salty for my liking. The waiter also told us they have $8 pasta mondays which we will definitely come back to try. This place gave us the perfect 1st Valentine&#39;s Day Dinner together. Thank you Odyssey!"

We started off with the toasted raviolis.. Drizzled with balsamic and served with the yummiest marinara I have ever eaten. I missed the memo where we also got salad and bread with a balsamic and oil mixture.. Both out of this world.
For entrees I had the seafood fresco... As you may know finding good seafood in quality and preparation is hard to come by but holy cow.. It was mind blowing.. Scallop, shrimp, and artichoke hearts with sautéed spinach with creamy fettuccini. Huge portions too.
My man got the butternut squash ravioli. He loved it as well. We also ordered cannolis to go. They have a mean wine list and both had a few drinks and the check came out to around 125. Worth every penny. We will definitely be back."

I planned a company dinner here and I searched for places to go and came across Odyssey. I read the reviews and figured we could go check it out before the actual event. They went as far as doing a tasting for us and created our very own printed menu with the items we had selected. Every single detail was incredible. We walked up and they had placed tables and a fire pit outside to set the mood, they always have rose petals lining the red carpet leading up to the restaurant and inside they had gone all out with decorations, our own wine table, appetizers set up on the bar - everything was so immaculate and beautifully done; I was speechless! 

The staff is incredible. From the hostess&#39; (Megan is so great to work with) to the wait staff (Andrew) to the owners and managers; I was seriously blown away. Not one person was rude or unhappy. You can tell that it&#39;s a family restaurant and all they want to do is provide the best customer service for their customers and they definitely show that during your time spent there; you don&#39;t feel like a customer - you feel like you&#39;re part of the family. Michele and John are both incredible and they just makes you want to be around them all the time. I love them! 

And the food...holy buckets, the food! It&#39;s authentic Sicilian style food and it was amazing! The Bruschetta and Italian Fried Calamari was the best I&#39;ve ever had and (the calamari was so lightly breaded and so tender). We had Fettucine Alfredo, Spaghetti with Meatballs, Butternut Squash Ravioli and Veal Marsala for our entrees and all of them were incredible. I do have a sweet tooth, so that Bananas Foster...oh I dream about that all the time! They do a tableside flambe and make the experience so much fun! If you want good food and a fun show to top off your evening - go! 

I could go on and on about this place and will definitely be going back regularly and am actually about to plan my birthday dinner there because I know that I will be well taken care of and treated better than any other place could treat me! Thank you to every person who made our first experience there just out of this world amazing!"

Everything about this place is amazing but the customer service is what really won me over! My boyfriend and I came once before on Valentine&#39;s Day and he decided to take me here again for our anniversary. I ordered some steak and he had seafood the food was delicious and it was a really big portion so we even had leftovers for the next day! Now this is the part where this place completely won me over; While we were finishing our meal a man came up to us and complimented me several times and gave me a rose telling me I was absolutely beautiful it was one of the sweetest things I&#39;ve ever experienced because this man was so sincere and genuine. He then found out it was our anniversary and he asked if he could treat us to a glass of moscato and of course we said yes! He poured us two glasses and gave us the rest of the little bottle for us to keep! we talked with him for a couple more minutes and we eventually found out he was the owner! He told us he doesn&#39;t come to work to work he comes to have fun and make friends and that&#39;s all that matters to him! I&#39;ve never in my entire life seen an owner of any restaurant or any other company treat his guests so well and go as far as conversing with them and giving them free wine just because it was a special occasion. I don&#39;t even know if I can consider that good customer service that is above and beyond anything I&#39;ve ever seen I think this man is just a wonderful human being who just happens to own a restaurant and his restaurant reflects what an amazing person he is! We&#39;ve decided to make this place our traditional anniversary/special occasions restaurant!

While the outside of the building suggests nothing spectacular, the inside is just that. There was a romantically lit bar with roses in wine bottle vases, a woman playing violin in the main dining area, and an overall cozy atmosphere. We were told we would be dining upstairs and (in order to get there) passed through the quaint kitchen to the staircase. On the second level we found bedrooms that had been converted to small dining areas, complete with linen table cloths, candles, and more fresh flowers.

We were given an excellently seasoned and buttered loaf of Italian bread to start with as we looked over the menu. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the pasta primavera. They were even nice enough to accommodate my request for specific vegetables, some of which weren&#39;t even listed for this dish. Our food arrived hot and made-to-order and was absolutely delicious. 

Our server, Adrian, was exceptional as well. He was very knowledgable of the menu and wines and was perfectly attentive. 

The best part of the evening was when we ordered the bananas foster and the owner himself arrived to flambé our naners! He jested with us and honestly made us feel like we were welcomed family members attending a dinner at his home. 

We will definitely be back!!"

It is built out of a lovely old house with tons of history, and every table/room is cozy and comfortable, and usually has a story behind it.  There isn&#39;t anything on their menu that isn&#39;t amazing.  Order the rice balls, lamb chops, and bananas foster and you won&#39;t be disappointed!!  They also have two private rooms upstairs for large parties/private parties etc, and I have thrown many a great business dinner here.  They will cater to your every need, always have perfect service, and never disappoint with new specials to keep it fresh!  Their wine selection is top notch as well, and mostly imported from Sicily or Italy.  This is pretty much the only place to take someone on a date, roses on every table with rose pedal table decoration too!!! And some nights they even have a violinist!!  Best spot to eat in town hands down!

Our error was not making a reservation. When we arrived, we were told it would be a 10 minute wait, and it ended up being about 30 minutes. We were told that the hostess is new. Regardless, the food must be fantastic, as this place is legitimately standing room only. When we finally were brought to a table (a 2 top for the 3 of us which we suggested), we were told there was only 1 chair! My wife sat down with our son on her lap. A few minutes later I was given a recently vacated chair.

In all honesty, none of this is upsetting. The wait staff is doing their best and the food smells delicious. Can&#39;t wait to eat...."

 The restaurant looks like it&#39;s in an old home so the place is very cozy, warm &amp; inviting. It&#39;s a multi-level restaurant with ambient soft lighting, candles, fresh roses on the table, rose petals @ the entrance-way &amp; oldies music like Sinatra. I was excited to hear a song about SF come on during the first 5 minutes I was seated. Wine menu is fairly priced (around $9-12 per glass) &amp; the waitress was very informative &amp; helpful about the menu selection. I was eyeing the veal with potatoes &amp; spinach special + the diablo spicy lobster spaghetti special. I tend to order whatever is on the specials menu if they offer one. I was excited when the waitress came to my table &amp; suggested the exact 2 things I was eyeing. So naturally, those were the two dishes I tried. Prior to the entree, I had the delicious, freshly baked bread with parmesan cheese with a side of garlic, balsamic vinegar + olive oil dip. The bread was delicious &amp; I couldn&#39;t help but have two servings of it. The entree came with a nice caesar salad that tasted like it had homemade dressing. It also came with olives which is a nice twist to the traditional caesar. The veal came with prosciutto and some spinach that was cooked in white wine. The lobster pasta dish had tons of whole pieces of lobster meat &amp; it had slices of pepper in it. It definitely packed some good heat. With the ambient lighting &amp; roses everywhere, it is hard to imagine this place as anything else but a date-night romantic-type restaurant. 

Servers were great &amp; friendly. I didn&#39;t get to try dessert but I&#39;d love to come back to try their banana flambe dessert that they flambe table side."

The moment you step into restaurant you are immediately taken into another world. A small original Colorado home that has been converted into a little piece of Italy itself. This place is amazing!

I had the opportunity to try several dishes however the sword fish as well as Lobster Diablo were something that was truly special. Offering a unique taste that I have yet to find at any other restaurant.

For dessert the table side banana foster is something from heaven. There are simply no words to describe it and is something you must try for yourself. I can promise you won&#39;t be sorry!

Watched this family style, romantic, authentic Italian/Sicilian restaurant grow from the ground up  to become the thriving hub of activity that it is today. Roses, wine bottles, white linen table clothes and subtle mood lighting are only surpassed by the magic of the old school European service and the love attended to the ingredients by head chef Ignacio and his front of house son Mikele (Mike) and their talented staff !
I could pick out singular dishes (pasta rustica) but why...all plates are fresh, plentiful and there will not be any chance of disappointment ! Take a chance...roll the dice ... and tell your server &#34;whatever the chef would like to prepare &#39;...you won&#39;t be disappointed !

We were warmly greeted when we walked in and spoke with Mike, one of the owners, and sat down outside. The patio was nice and would be great for a romantic date. We ordered a bottle of Chianti from Tuscany (I believe), which was tasty. I forgot our server&#39;s name, but he was attentive and brought us many plates of bread and the olive oil/balsamic/rosemary mix to dip the bread in. We also ordered calamari to start, which was lightly breaded, delicious, and had subtle hints of lemon in the breading (prior to squeezing the lemon over the dish).

With each pasta dish, you get a small Caesar salad to start. It&#39;s the perfect amount to have prior to your next course. For my main, I had the pesto tortellini with chicken. YUM!! The pesto is creamy and filling, while not leaving you feeling couch-borne after eating it. The tortellini was stuffed with ricotta and was soooooo goood. 

At the end of our meal, Mike surprised us with some gifts to take home. We also met Ignacio before we left and checked out the upstairs. The entire time I was at the Odyssey I felt like family. This is true and great customer service. When you leave a restaurant beaming with a grin from ear to ear, you know you have been to not just a good restaurant, but a place where you are truly valued as a customer and new friend. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who likes good Italian food and being treated warmly by such gracious hosts ;) I will hopefully be returning in a week or two for pasta Mondays.

As per my Italian and East Coast friends (who know good Italian), the Odyssey is the most authentic they have had in Denver AND you get warm Italian service, too."

We enjoyed the fried calamari (some of the best I&#39;ve had) and the chief&#39;s tasting board with lots of meats, peppers, cheese, tomatoes and even grapes.

The evening started out a little rocky when my parents received their manhattans from the bar which were NOT a manhattan.  My 80 year old father approached the bartender and inquired how it was made and he assured my dad it was done correctly.  My dad came back to the table with his drink still in hand and left speechless.  However, approximately 5 minutes later, 2 new drinks were delivered to the table and made correctly.  An apology wasn&#39;t offered, nor an admit to the first mistake.   Dinner went smoothly and everything tasted great, however, the cook dumped at least a half of cup of capers on the chicken and the veal piccata plates.  The taste overpowered the entire plate.  

The kicker came when on the drive home my husband mentioned he was surprised he was charged $1.00 for each drink that was ordered &#34;on the rocks&#34;!   My parents were shocked and had never heard of such a thing!  As I looked at the bill I realized we were over charged $3.00 on three of the four meals ordered!  As well as noting the $8.00 glass of wine I ordered was billed as $12.00!  I am one who looks at menu prices and I guarantee I knew I was correct which I later confirmed with their on line menu pricing!  

After several calls to the restaurant I finally spoke to the hostess who assured me my card would be reimbursed for the $15.00 mistake.  She put me on hold to inquire the ice charge and said the bartender charges a service fee for having to &#34;scoop the ice&#34;!  Unbelievable!
Approximately 10 minutes later, the owner called and over talked me the entire time as I tried to explain his menu prices do not reflect the bill.  I finally said we must have had an old menu and he basically called me a liar and said the prices changed 10 months ago... However the on line menu does not reflect the &#34;new&#34; prices.  His reasoning for the ice charge was because they used a bigger glass.?!  

I will say, he credited my card $25.00 to &#34;make me happy&#34;.   And said he looks forward to visiting with me next time!  But my parents are highly disappointed and do not plan on visiting again.   

Bottom line, check your bill before you pay!"

Partly to avoid traffic on our drive back to the hotel and because it looked very promising from Yelp reviews. We are very glad we stopped in. 

They do not have parking but we found a space on the street about a block away. 

At the entrance we were greeted warmly by the owner Ignacio. Our server Jessie was very enthusiastic in her wine recommendation and it was spot on.

The bread they give you is served with a plate that has olive oil, balsamic, herbs and fresh garlic on it. Quite tasty with the bread. The bread is New Orleans style with a light, dry and airy consistency so perfect for the olive oil mixture. 

My husband and brother both had the spaghetti and meatballs and Jessie suggested the children&#39;s portion (no salad). It was a large portion with 2 very large meatballs. They both enjoyed it. 

Sometimes you just want comfort food and that is why I ordered bowtie pasta gorgonzola and added shrimp. Nice sauce and the sundried tomatoes added a little pop. The small salad that accompanied my dinner had lettuce, olives and shaved parmesan with a light caesar dressing. Just enough.

Because of a mixup over our appetizer Jessie offered free dessert and we tried the tiramisu. It was quite good and the plate was dusted with a hint of cinnamon (?).

We will definitely return the next time we are in Denver.

They have a nice fireplace that adds ambiance."

The staff is the most personable and friendly I have ever seen. They greet you, seat you and make you feel at home. They try to accommodate your every need, so if you want something, just ask! They are incredible at going that extra mile!

As if all that wasn&#39;t enough, there&#39;s the food! Every I&#39;ve had has been incredible, and if you see something you may want, ask for a taste! Especially their meatballs or Bolognese! They want you to be happy and full, so they make sure you leave well satisfied! I can&#39;t accurately put into words the experience, you just have to go!"

We had the penne rustica w/chicken and sausage and the Penne Bolognese w/ricotta and a glass of the banfi chianti classico.  The food was good but I have to admit it was more Americana Italian than true Italian.  The prices were steep with each dish being $18.00.  Still we thought it was cute and romantic.

It&#39;s so rare these days that the owner of a restaurant is so concerned with each customer. We were comped a dessert simply because we drove up from the Springs. If more restaurants these days put the love that this place clearly puts into their food, I&#39;d be broke. I&#39;ve never had better Marinara. I can&#39;t talk this place up enough. We are always treated like family. It&#39;s honestly so refreshing. Every negative review on here either has no taste, or didn&#39;t even give the place a chance. Bar none, best Italian in Colorado."

The salad has a balsamic reduction which is very good and I also requested some pesto on the side to drizzle on the salad.

We have had several large family dinners here and each and every time it has been great!!! My wife&#39;s family is Sicilian and so they have always loved the &#34;connection&#34; to the owner and his son. The first thing that we love is how they have always made us feel like we are long lost family. I will say that reading through a few of the negative reviews, some have not always fully understood that attention and have considered it &#34;over the top&#34;, but for a large Italian family it is like a wonderful family dinner. They truly do treat their guest like family...and if you don&#39;t want to be treated like family...well, you are probably out of luck. Second the food. Sicily is not my favorite region for Italian food. But, this place does Sicilian food wonderfully. It is authentic (according to my Sicilian family) and wonderful. The atmosphere is wonderful as well. We have eaten in almost every room in the house and they all of their pluses. It is a converted house so they couldn&#39;t avoid some of the layout difficulties...but they have done a great job of minimizing the impact of them. Lastly, service has ALWAYS been friendly and wonderful. I really do believe that this is one of the best places in town to take a family for a special meal....at least based upon our experiences."

It really makes a difference when the owner is involved in his business. My 4 star rating was due to the negative taste of my food however, I would recommend this restaurant based on the level of service that they provide. I&#39;m thinking that my food fluke was a random thing. 

Our waitress had put in my order incorrectly and she noticed it immediately, even before I realized it. Accidents happen right? As soon as she told me that they will put a rush on my corrected order, I knew that this may or may not work out for me. When my linguine dish finally came out, the noodles were perfectly el dante however the sauce was super thick so all the noodles were stuck together into a large mass. The sauce wasn&#39;t impressive nor was it salted very well. I had also ordered a side of meatballs as well, they were tough with a &#34;microwaved&#34; texture. Maybe my reaction to my food was  a mental thing due to the mixed up order??? Not sure, but I was hungry and in the mood for one of my favorite comfort food so I doubt it. Regardless, my husband and his friends loved their dishes though. Also, without me mentioning anything, the restaurant also took care of the bill for my order because of the mix up. I thought that was a very classy move!"

Our waiter was incredible and he brought out a rather large slice of chocolate cake with ice cream for the birthday boy at no extra cost which was a very thoughtful thing to do on their part.

It was my birthday, so this was the restaurant if my choosing. This a a beautiful Victorian home that was transformed into a Sicilian gem. We had a reservation and was put in the third floor room, which was very small and intimate to say the least. Very Romantic. We had a bottle of Pinot noir with our entrees. He had the penne Rustica and I the Veal Braciole. The sauce on with veal was magnificent. And the portion was more than generous. The bread served dinner was accompanied with an olive oil and balsamic reduction with roasted garlic and herbs. This was amazing. I would give five stars, however, you must your the kitchen to get onto the 3rd floor and the kitchen was not as clean as I believed it should have been.

Even though I was with a girlfriend, the table we got was very cozy, next to a window on the second floor. This is a good date stop...although its a bit too dark in the restaurant. 
Without a doubt...their fresh bread is so AMAZE! I could just have that alone! We ordered a couple appetizers along with a pasta, which we shared. Everything was great- except the pasta. Im ok with pasta being al-dente, however this one was hard to chew and undercooked. I think the atmosphere and experience of the place made up for the average Italian food. If I happen to go back, I will update my review. I really want to give it 4-stars...I just cannot justify it at the moment."

My favorite part was the atmosphere - it is very cute, dimly lit, and set in an old house. The close quarters makes it a bit difficult to hear though. They had some trouble with the sound system, I think, because in the middle of dinner the same song came on a couple of times at full blast, before being shut off a few seconds later. We thought about starting with an appetizer, but since the entrees come with bread and a salad, we skipped it. I would have been interested in the arancini di riso since that is one of my favorite Italian dishes, but I did think it was curious why they didn&#39;t call it by it&#39;s Italian name on the menu - it&#39;s listed as Sicilian Rice Balls. 

I had the ricotta tortellini and my husband had the gorgonzola bowtie pasta. Both were decent but nothing to write home about. It&#39;s a lot to spend on pasta, too, with both dishes in the $17 range. The pasta was cooked until pretty soft, and I typically like mine a little more on the al dente side. My husband had a glass of chianti that he didn&#39;t love, but I liked the white wine that I ordered. If I came back, it would be just to have a glass of wine in the cute setting."

We had a small part of two, a reservation, and arrived early. Once we got there we waited about 10 minutes with a short line of people before someone acknowledged us. At this point multiple servers had rushed by without looking at anyone waiting, or told us that someone would be there to help any time soon. 15 minutes after our reservation time, the man at the front told us it&#39;d be another 15 or so, which was understandable since it was busy. But then he kept repeating &#34;Sorry I&#39;m trying to kick people out as fast as possible but they&#39;re not leaving&#34; a bit loudly, which threw me off a bit. We ended up leaving after waiting a bit longer, and he was grateful for to have less people to deal with.

Atmosphere, super friendly staff, really intimate and rustic interior, great service, great drinks (martini and Manhattan both perfectly mixed). The food was delicious and plentiful. The chef came out and visited and gave my wife a rose. Nice touch.

Odyssey is a great restaurant for a romantic evening. Soft lighting, lovely music, and delicious wines and foods. 

When we first arrived there was a bit of an awkwardness during our wait. There is no space available to wait or sit so we were stuck in the way of various servers trying to get past us. But that first impression quickly faded once we were seated. Our uber friendly server came by quickly to take our wine order. We tried two varieties of Chianti and both were great. Our server informed us that we arrived on the right day for pasta because they were only $8.50 on Mondays. Winning! And they came with a small caesar salad too. Just what I was craving. 

Before our pastas arrived we were treated to a small loaf of soft and yummy bread and olive oil mixed with balsamic and spices. They even offered a second loaf once they saw how quickly we devoured it. Our pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the sauces were made well. I kept eating that large bowl of noodles until I was stuffed. Each bowl could easily feed two people but I tried to take it down myself. :-) 

My guest and I really enjoyed our experience at Odyssey. It does well as a semi-casual Italian restaurant with great service, food, and atmosphere at reasonable prices."

I could not be more happy to have my plans changed! The staff was unreal in how accommodating they were, I truly felt like a celebrity or something! We walked out of there happy, laughing, full on delicious food and so very pleased with our dining experience. We met the father and son that run the establishment and you can really tell they love what they do and take pride in it.

We came here August 2014 during a summer vacation back in our home city. Looking to venture out of the typical box we were accustomed to growing up in Denver, we reached out to Yelp (which wasn&#39;t an option growing up) and stumbled upon this place. There wasn&#39;t nearly as many yelp reviews back in August as there are presently, so we really came here with no expectations at all, just curiosity and in desperate need for a rare date night. 

Once we arrived to the front entrance we received a welcome from the hostess and passing by was the owner, Ignacio. As I informed the hostess that we did not have reservations (not that it&#39;s mandatory anyway), Ignacio must have overheard and immediately said &#34;no reservation, don&#39;t worry about it, this restaurant is your home&#34; while putting his arm around my trapezius. Honestly, I thought this was a bit of a stale routine. A smart businessman, I can appreciate him going out of his way to welcome us to his restaurant, I thought. What I later learned that evening is that this type of greeting and the treatment thereafter in this place were actually genuine, even if routine. And that blew me away.

In short, they (hostess, waitress, Ignacio) made my wife feel like the queen she is. There were flowers, Ignacio had a violinist play for her (can&#39;t remember her name but she is amazing!) some complimentary wine, dessert and service from our waitress that wasn&#39;t too overbearing but gave us enough room to enjoy our evening while routinely accommodating our needs expeditiously. We enjoyed our food from appetizer to dessert, hands down the best pasta we have had so far. Why in the world were we eating at Olive Garden in the past?

The food was delicious. The wine was fantastic. The atmosphere was comforting. This place actually made us miss home. Props to this establishment for making ordinary people feel appreciated while being genuine at the same time. Ignacio was right, this place is like visiting family at home. Good people here and great food, this place will be a staple of ours every time we come back home. Tip generously, they actually merit it."

It&#39;s like a cheesy Olive Garden with &#34;special&#34; service. The roses on every table, super cheesy service that is nauseating, it&#39;s like it was made for teenagers who are going on their first big date.

The food was nearly abysmal. The Caesar salad was runny and flavorless, and my pasta had so much thin cream sauce that it was practically soup. 

I left so embarrassed that I had chosen this restaurant."

He provided insight and guided us on what each dish entailed and how it was prepared. Not once did he seem annoyed or agitated at all our questions. On the contrary, he seemed thrilled and over joyed to provide us with all the knowledge we needed to make a selection. I would give them an A+ for service. 

As far as the food goes, it was just prefect. The flavors are just as delicious as the aroma the food lets off. The pasta is just great and the tomato sauce is to die for. We received a complimentary bowl of sauce and just spooned it into our mouths! The chicken was so juicy and moist. But really, the dessert is what has my heart captured.

The restaurant has a romantic atmosphere, dark with candlelight and dried roses for decor. In the summer the patio under the twinkle light tree creates the perfect date spot.

Parking is impossible as they don&#39;t offer any, so you have to park blocks away on side streets, but that is hardly their issue.

For the apps, we had their calamari. It wasn&#39;t good at all. It was frozen section of your local grocery store quality. That gave us pause and had us hoping that we didn&#39;t make the wrong choice for date night.

But that was it. That was the only thing the entire evening that wasn&#39;t amazing.

Caesar salad? Off the chain! Amazingly delicious.
Their Focaccia bread with parm cheese on it? Divine! 

We ordered off their nightly specialty menu. Both of our meals were amazing. 
Their Veil Tuscany was delicious. The Sea Bass was fantastic. I don&#39;t even like mushrooms but their mushroom risoto was amazing!

Their tiramisu was fantastic for desert, and their specialty cocktails were out of this world.

Overall, we loved their food minus the calamari. We will absolutely be back and just order the meat and cheese instead of calamari. 

One thing to note: The wait staff is incredibly friendly. Heck, they have a very limited beer selection and even offered to run literally across the street to buy us anything we may want. Who does that? Only they do. So nice!

10/10 we will be back. Again, the only thing that we would recommend to stay clear of is the calamari."

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted warmly by happy employees. The decor and atmosphere of this restaurant is gorgeous. We had a seat right by the window and I felt like it was a scene out of a movie. Fresh flowers on every table. 

Service was exceptional, everyone was accommodating and happy to recommend their favorite dishes. 

I opted for a chicken Parmesan with Alfredo sauce as opposed to marinara. To die for! The best Italian dish I have ever eaten. Not to mention, the vegetables on the dish were the best veggies I have ever had, and I am not a vegetable fan. 

I can&#39;t wait to visit Denver again so that we can return to this establishment. Thank you for the hospitality! You made our trip wonderful!"

It was a perfect place for a lovely date! I enjoyed it a lot! It was not an ordinary restaurant and food. I love Italian food. I used to have italian food all the time ! I&#39;ve had the best Italian food ever back home! And let me tell you that their food has high quality, but I&#39;ve had better and more delicious italian food without a very expensive bill! You are just paying for the decoration and eating in a classy place not for the taste! I even couldn&#39;t go further than half of the salmon, whixh the waiter told me is very popular here! But I just didn&#39;t like the taste of those noodles on top of it and all the spices! But I had a wonderful time with my boyfriend!"

The ambiance is very nice and creates nice atmosphere.  
The meal was fresh and perfectly prepared with customary table bread loaf with olive oil dipping sauce. 
My only complaint is that some of the artwork was a bit out of taste for a restaurant of this scale. We sat next to a dirty framed picture or Frank Sinatra. Very out of place. 

I would recommend for the food. Be prepared to pay a lot!  this is an expensive restaurant."

The environment is swanky and classy and warm. The service is fit for a noble king. Mario, our server, was just great. He gave many great suggestions and ultimately made our meal awesome. 

We WILL tell others about this great restaurant and we will be back with them.

Stop thinking about it and go. You will be pleased start to finish.

I suggest the Mellon prosciutto appetizer... Amazing."

I&#39;ve never been treated so well in my life.  My business allows me to travel and I&#39;ve been to some of the top restaurants in New York City and LA this is hands down the most authentic Italian feeling even compared to the best restaurants in Boston. Besides everything the house is amazing. it&#39;s the setting of an old Victorian in 1908 nestled on 6th Avenue dimly lit and very intimate dining just what I love!! Do not waste any time anywhere else go directly to Odyssey you will not be disappointed!!! this is easily a 10 star restaurant.

First and foremost the food is heavenly. The bread is piping hot and served with olive oil and balsamic jelly - such a great combo. We ordered the rice balls to start and they were amazing. They&#39;re stuffed with risotto and cheese and then fried - can&#39;t go wrong! My hubby ordered chicken parm and I had shrimp scampi - both were delish! Stay away from the scampi if you don&#39;t like garlic though - it&#39;s covered in it! 

Secondly, the service was great. Our water was constantly full - always a plus. Our server was great at checking in and also giving recommendations (the rice balls were his choice for apps). 

We will definitely be back - keep up the great job!!"

Even before we arrived it exceeded every expectation! One of our hosts Michele&#39; or &#34;Mike&#34; called a day ot two in advance to welcome us and ensure we knew they provided valet service for our car. He is a really friendly and great guy whose father is both chef and owner of the restaurant. 

Attending to our cozy corner table was Jessica. She was also delightful and entertaining throughout our meal. She was very familiar with the menu and made a number of great meal and wine suggestions and provided superior service all night. 

As we enjoyed cocktails, then our wine, we were served delicious fresh bread to dip in a dish covered with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and loaded with fresh garlic. Mmmmmm.

Our entrees were swordfish, and  lobster tail over a spicy pasta. Both prepared nicely. Each came with a dinner ceasar salad Again, the food was cooked to perfection, served at just the right time and always with Jessica ensuring we were happy with every portion of meal. 

We shared a nicely proportioned tiramisu dessert, again, delicious!  Other diners enjoyed banana foster flamed tables idea that I have to try next time. 

To cap off the night,  we were treated to a tour of the historic building which was filled with fun dining nooks on several levels..and we met Ignazio Mulei, the chef and deservedly proud owner of the Cucina Siciliana Odyssey. 

Well done!!!  ... We shall return and to anyone looking for an authentic Sicilian dining experience, you will not be disappointed here!"

We were placed in the &#34;carriage house&#34; in a little corner booth and told it was the most romantic table in the house. It took the server about 5 minutes to get to our table for drink orders. We ordered two appetizers, the one called Sicilian Rice Balls was good, the fried tracking ravioli was mediocre at best. Our salads were great. My husband enjoyed his penne rustica, but I found the eggplant rollitini bland. We had bananas foster made tableside, and it was neat to watch. It was pretty good as far as flavor. Unfortunately the pan and burner were left next to our table and did not smell good after our server was done. At the end of the meal we were given the wrong check. The server caught it and charged the correct amount to our card. Overall, not the best Italian I&#39;ve ever had, we will not likely return."

The food is legit authentic Italiano/Sicilian cuisine from recipes that the family has held on to for many years. All the dishes and the wines I&#39;ve had here really embody a very deep wonderful flavor. The service is really spot on, they keep you fed and keep your glass full of delicious vino. There&#39;s really something to be said about how much better food is when you can taste the passion of culinary and ingredients.

It&#39;s easy to see how much they love their jobs and how dedicated they are to making sure your visit is a memorable one! Michele and his dad are most highly amazing!

There were four of us and between us, we ordered 2 different types of salads, 4 different main dishes and three different desserts. Everything was absolutely delicious. Service was excellent as well. The main chef even came out and asked us how everything was. They are also excellent in dealing with food allergies. I can&#39;t eat dairy, it was not an issue as I was told, all sauces are made to order when they are ordered.

I am a big fan not only the restaurant but the geniuses behind the master piece that Odyssey is! Mike and Nat are no strangers to growing and developing some of the best restaurants Denver has ever had. I won&#39;t mention names because I would be advertising for others, however I will say if anyone here has a problem waiting in line to get into a great restaurant then go to Mc Donalds. No wait there. Or, become friends with Nat and Mike so next time they can tell you when you call, if it is a busy day to come in or if they can sit you promptly. To me, the fact that there is a wait sometimes just tells me this is a superb place to come to. It&#39;s a good sign. If I ever go to a place where you hear crickets, well...
     This also goes to the person that complains about the noise. I have been on dates to Odyssey many times and it&#39;s always been quiet and a great atmosphere but any restaurant that is busy at one point will be loud and noisy. If they want to pay George Clooney style and reserve a restaurant for themselves for 30K for the night I am sure Mike and Nat would not oppose.
      Finally, for anyone out there that understands how much effort it takes to run a successful restaurant you will have a bit more respect to Nat and Mike. No one can say anything about the food, the food is fabulous, the staff and service is incredible and these guys truly care about serving great food and the people that come to see them. Italians look at food as part of a larger, more essential and pleasurable part of daily life. Not as an experience to be collected or bragged about. Great food is made with pride and love, love for what you do and pride to share it. 
      Nat and Mike...I am coming over tonight!"

After a trip to Italy several years ago, we were on the search for a Denver spot that could satisfy our real Italian pasta cravings.  Odyssey has been our winner!  We have come back several times, and visited again this week while staying at a nearby B&amp;B for a mini staycation.  We, again, had a wonderful meal.
Monday nights are pasta night and you can order any of the pasta dishes for $8.95.  That is an incredible value and we love to visit on Mondays!  I would highly recommend a reservation to avoid a wait.  
The restaurant is charming and cozy, with exposed brick, dim lighting, white tablecloths and a red rose in a wine bottle on each table.  It&#39;s a great date night or double date spot.  The patio is also nice in warmer weather!  We made a reservation for the main floor on our most recent visit and were seated right away to a table beside the fireplace.  Service is attentive and the food comes out a good pace.  The staff is always warm and welcoming, and you will feel like an appreciated guest.
We gravitate to pasta when we dine here because the pasta dishes are so fresh and delicious!  Each comes with a salad and bread.  The mini loaves of bread are delivered to your table fresh and hot, topped with grated parmesan and herbs.  They are served with oil and vinegar to dip in, but the best part is the fresh garlic and herbs that are mixed into the dipping oil!  The Gnocchi with Pesto Cream Sauce is a favorite dish of ours, and I also really enjoy the Fettuccine Carbonara.  We&#39;ve never had a dish we didn&#39;t enjoy!"

I called ahead tonight to check on their hours, knowing that they close between 7 and 9 depending on the time of year. The girl who answered informed me that they closed at 8. I arrived at 7 pm with my boyfriend and another couple only to be told that the kitchen was closed. I said that I thought they were open until 8 and the girl repeated that the kitchen was closed.

Listen, all we wanted was two cheese plates and some wine--it doesn&#39;t require a lot of cooking (actually none, just slicing some cheese and throwing some nuts on a plate) and we arrived with plenty of time for her to close up shop before 8. Because of her refusal to assist us, I will no longer patronize this local shop and instead will head over to Postino (which is what we did) and get my choice of bottle of wine and a sizable board of bruschetta for $5 less than Eat Drink offers."

The artichoke, lemon ricotta and roasted tomato sandwich was my pick of the day. I love that I was given a choice of salad or chips with no extra charge for salad. The sandwich was rock solid and a unique spin on a vegetarian option. The bread was crispy with creamy, rich ricotta. The hint of lemon was a perfect foil for the artichokes. The side salad was great too and went well with the sandwich."

Eat + Drink is definitely at the top of my list. Have y&#39;all been here!? I&#39;m mildly concerned because I&#39;ve been here 3 times now and I&#39;ve been the only customer in there each time... granted I&#39;ve gone at not-extremely-popular hours.. typically late lunches after 1 PM. Anyway, I hope this place gets plenty of business because they&#39;re pretty awesome. They close at 8 PM.... what&#39;s that about? Sometimes I want cheese for dinner after 8. Sometimes meaning all the time. 

Eat + Drink has a very simple but lovely menu. Soup, salads, cheese plates, charcuterie boards, and sandwiches. Everything I&#39;ve ordered (or have seen friends + family order) is fresh and beautiful and delicious. I prefer the 3 cheese plate, and I let the staff choose a variety for me. On my last visit I had a bleu, a triple cream brie, and a Colorado made goat cheese. Soooo good, all of them, and the portions aren&#39;t skimpy. It&#39;s a fair amount of cheese, so find a friend to share. The cheese plates comes with fruit (pears or apples), nuts, dried cranberries and pumpkin seeds, crostini or gluten-free crackers, dried apricots, and almonds. The charcuterie board comes with 4 meats, spicy whole grain mustard, and pickled caper berries + onions + pickles. Yeeaaahhhhh.

They have a great wine menu here; you&#39;re looking at $7-$12 per glass and $5 glasses at Happy Hour from 4-6 PM. Not bad at all! This is a tiny restaurant but they have a really cute patio as well. Plenty of space and really sweet service."

They have lots of tasty cheese to choose from and if you are unsure of what you&#39;ll like, they will put together a plate for you based on your taste profile. They have a happy hour with $5 glasses of wine and $10 cheese plates, plus they have Tuesday Date Night specials - $25 for 1 bottle of wine and a 3 artisan cheese plate. 

It&#39;s a small location with a quite atmosphere. Our table of 8 basically took up 1/2 of the dining area, but it&#39;s a great place for a small group and some conversation. I highly recommend you give them a try!"

Wine? Cheese? Just let me slap myself so that I know I&#39;m not dreaming! What a quaint little place to stop in for lunch. 

They don&#39;t make everything in-house, but they DO choose very well-made, very good ingredients. Have a taste of the wine or the cheese (or both) and you&#39;ll know I&#39;m not lying. They carry one of my FAVORITE cheese brands of all time- Cypress Grove. It&#39;s so good I&#39;d bathe myself in it. 

We had little tastes of everything- paninis, cheeses, and the gazpacho. I can&#39;t even get into detail about how well everything is made because it would take me pages and pages to tell you about it. They do an excellent job of flavor combinations with a simple menu. For example, I had the California panini which did an excellent job of pairing creamy with sweet, a bit salty, and little bit of funk from the brie. The gazpacho was completely unexpected. I suppose I haven&#39;t had too many gazpachos in my lifetime- in my experience they are bordering a bowl of plain old salsa. The one we had was tasty- sweet from the watermelon, zingy, and a little spicy and minty, perfect for a hot Denver day when you&#39;re not exactly hungry. 

Eat + drink pretty much sums it up."

Also, this place is in one of my favorite areas of town! However, my experience at Eat+Drink left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. 

We sat down and after a longer than usual wait we were asked if we were ready to order, I said &#34;yes, we are ready to order drinks, but still haven&#39;t looked at food&#34;...we ordered our drinks and were again asked what we wanted to eat...a bit awkward but passable. But now I felt rushed/awkward. Still A-OK. Next, I was told that they were almost out of the wine I ordered, so they&#39;d take a dollar off my wine since the pour was light...this was thoughtful and much appreciated...although the wine was great so I was a little sad (but come on, its spring, they should be prepared with lots of Rosé). 

Our appetizer, the burrata, was okay although the bread was hard (like cut your mouth hard) and a little overly chewy in places, as in hard to bite without flinging part of it across the room. The burrata itself, I would rank in the lower half of all burratas I&#39;ve tried (and that&#39;s a lot - I have a problem), but the texture was nice. My friend ordered the California Panini with chips and loved it. I ordered the Arti Panini (artichoke hearts, lemon ricotta, roasted tomatoes, chevre, arugula) and had to fight myself not to spit out the small first bite I took. The only thing you could taste was the very strong goat cheese...basically like taking a block of goat cheese and eating it straight. The particular goat cheese on this sandwich was very barnyardy - like standing downwind from a wet goat. I never took another bite. I had sat in disgust for about 20 minutes picking at the potato chips on my plate watching my friend eat his food before our server returned. Without ever asking how everything was or noticing I had taken only one tiny bite out of my sandwich, I asked for a box but told her never mind because the sandwich was awful . She asked if I wanted something else, but at this point I was grossed out and not super hungry anymore...although in retrospect I should have asked for something else because we still had to pay for the sandwich I didn&#39;t eat."

The breakdown: Around $8 for a class of wine &amp; $12 for a flight of three wines (flight options: red or white).  I tried the red flight which surprisingly came out to be three full glasses of wine . I thought I&#39;d get a wine teaser but the quantity of wine in the flight was definitely doing more than teasing me. 

The red flight:
1. tempranillo: muse by pollyanna | rioja, spain | supple.earthy.silky 
2. malbec 
3. something that starts w/ a c that is not chardonnay nor cabernet sauvignon 

Also tried a pinot noir. 

The waitress was polite &amp; seemed genuinely sweet. I came during an afternoon lull &amp; had the place to myself so the atmosphere definitely felt relaxing. It&#39;s not the most inviting or cozy of shops because of the tall ceiling, bright windows &amp; proximity of the front door to the counter then to the seats but I thought the brick walls &amp; worn wood floor were homey. 

Review to come for when I try the cheese &amp; small plates."

I&#39;ve frequented the California panini sans turkey and it&#39;s too good to be true. You can get a salad on the side which is a beautiful, simply dressed arugula mix. Also, if you ever need to procure your own cheese plate at home, this is a one stop shop for everything you need!"

What&#39;s not to love friends? And even though I didn&#39;t drink any wine the day I went most recently (because it was for a lunch meeting) I still have a mad crush on Eat + Drink. 

It&#39;s small and friendly and casual. I think it would be a really fun spot for a date and I know it&#39;s a really great spot for lunch, either solo or on a meeting.

My only wish is that they would be open later than 8 pm. Because then I could have more date nights there with Sir Nicholas."

The food is very good, service is nice.  Fun loft atmosphere.  Mix of sandwiches, soup, and salad to pick from for lunch. Also have a few chocolates and gourmet cheese to pick from.

However it is expensive!  I paid $17 for a sandwich, side of salad and chips the other day.
Not sure if I want to stomach that again.  It&#39;s good, but not $17 good.  Value is not there."

The Arti was missing vinigar or salt in it.  The charcuterie wasn&#39;t good at all.  The two pates were really fatty, the prosutto was cut too thin and was dry, and the capocollo tasted like star anise.   If I come back i&#39;ll stick to the wine and cheese."

I would consider it a cheese shop and a lovely dining stop for lunch or dinner.  They offer a good variety of reasonably priced wine by the glass or bottle.  Take your pick, they have red, white, rose, and sparkling.  The menu is simple and offers, charcuterie boards, small plates, salads, paninis, and sandwiches.  They also have a cute shop with a variety of cheeses, chocolates, fresh bread, sausage and other little items.  If you&#39;re looking for a gourmet cheese basket, this place sure would make a great one for any of your friends (they offer a variety of sizes).    

I had the pleasure of trying The Emilia, a panini with prosciutto, mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes, and truffle oil.  This panini had wonderful flavor and was the perfect lunch destination for my Mom and I on a sunny afternoon.  Each ingredient had a purpose and added much needed texture and deliciousness to each bite.    

The women working here are very sweet and will answer any of your questions and will also allow you to sample some of their cheeses to make an educated decision.  

On a sunny day I could see myself making use of their wonderful patio, enjoying a glass of wine and some of their decadent cheese."

At least that was what it was like when I was a wee little girl in Denver.  But as the City grew and expanded it did so into this area now known as Confluence Park and Riverfront.   The beauty of this area is a show of what can happen with planning and growth in a community to help to make it prosper.   

Located on Platte just near the bridge that walks you over to the Highlands and walking distance from REI is this fabulous wine &amp; cheese emporium, so subtle in its appearance from the street you would hardly know it is there.   It is the sister restaurant of Eat!Drink! in Edwards and offers wine, beer, small salads, sandwiches and soup.   But mostly an ambience of a new found favorite deli..Denver Style.   Meats so fresh and cheeses so remarkable that you aren&#39;t overwhelmed with the petite presentation of your order when dining there.   I was there for a small intimate group dinner - well not dinner as much as an evening of 15 friends with wine and conversation and bites.  It seats not more then 20 at most, and if you bring a group be sure to call ahead. 

In the winter come sit inside and watch the snow fall or in the summer sit outside on the patio and watch all the locals walking around.   There are lots of other great places near by so you can begin or end your day here.  One of the conversation we had at dinner was in regards to the area as I sated in the beginningthis area has grown and it is beautiful and neighborly.   Much is happening in Denver and this is just one of those areas worth your time to check out.

Cheers to the idea of sharing and good wine and cheese plates.  Hint a nice intimate place for Valentine&#39;s and they sell cheese and wine as well.  All you will need to get else where are the flowers...

I feel like Denver needs more restaurants that are serving this type of food at these prices. 

My only request is that they change up their menu from time to time. I would love to see some new salads/soups for winter!"

We went for the tail end of happy hour (4-6 PM), and were the only ones there for about a half an hour. During happy hour, a glass of select wines is only $5. 

The waitress was really nice, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. My friend and I are cheese fanatics and each got paninis and LOVED THEM. 

The ambience is quaint, and the restaurant situated on the adorable Platte Street. I would come back here often."

We got some wine and I think we had burratta, which is hand pulled mozzarella. I may have spelled it wrong, but it was super delicious! I&#39;d like to try their cheap date night! I definitely recommend this place!"
