The food is reasonably priced and you get a good amount for what you pay for. So far I&#39;ve had a breakfast burrito and asada fries from there. No complaints so far. Their salsa&#39;s are absolutely delicious and everything is cooked fresh. This is my new go to spot when I&#39;m hungry and too lazy to go very far from my home.

We just got takeout from here for lunch and we ordered a little bit of everything so we could have leftovers..and lemme tell y&#39;all- this place is SOO YUMMY!!!!!!
First of all, we got nachos supreme and I asked the nice lady what meat goes best on it and she recommended the pastor. WOW it was so yummy we devoured it all and we&#39;re fighting over the toppings. Plus they&#39;re very simple and not over done- nacho cheese, tomatoes, meat, sour cream. The pastor was smokey and very flavorful.
Then we eat got red and green chicken enchiladas. The green ones were our faves because it had just the right amount of spice. 1 combo entree comes with 3-4 enchiladas which is a great deal for $8.99. They had some creamy crumbles of cotija cheese on top.
Highly recommended!!!!!"

$8.11 was my bill for my six dbl tortilla average serving tacos. I recommend being over cautious if you want awesome tacos. They have many menu items you can try, it is a good restaurant. Many local paisas and gringos workers from the area have lunch here."

I also ordered a side of rice which seemed homemade and had a lime flavor to it. They brought me chips and homemade salsa while I was waiting, one was spicy hot, and one was cooler to balance it out. No napkins to speak of and the service stopped after I got my food.  They never came back to check on me and I had to get up and ask to pay and if there was a restroom, or if I could get napkins or a refill.

Well, we finally found a restaurant that provides fantastic food and it doesn&#39;t require an airline ticket.
 
The owner/staff are beyond friendly and their main focus is on the guests and the food...what more can you ask for?
 
We tried various HOME MADE items and they were all great! Two salsas they provide with the perfectly made chips were fantastic. The pastor, asada and birria sopes were very flavorful and the sopes were made perfectly.
 
To finish off the fantastic meal we had the special dessert they make...Capirotada. Let me tell you...it was beyond words! We purposely ate it slow, to prolong the tantalizing experience. 
 
For those complaining about the slow service, it&#39;s HOMEMADE AND MADE TO ORDER! If you want your food fast, go to Chipolte were they keep everything hot in a steam table!

Homemade food - check!
Fantastic flavor and quality - check!

We tried the vegetarian orange chicken &amp; the vegetarian kung po chicken, as well as 2 vegetarian egg rolls. All were awesome!! The veg orange chicken was more of a breaded ball, &amp; the kung po chicken was more of a thai gluten-type consistency, each flavorful in their own way. Both came with white rice &amp; a hefty amount of veggies - carrots, bell peppers, bamboo &amp; water chestnuts... If you&#39;re allergic to peanuts, though, skip the kung po, as it had a good amount of peanut halves mixed in.

To begin, our order took 2.5 hours to deliver. I&#39;m usually pretty easygoing when it comes to delivery food- I used to work at a pizza restaurant and I understand that a) stuff happens b) orders on snowy days can take significantly longer that expected and c) sometimes orders get lost! So, I&#39;m honestly not too upset that the delivery took so long, we weren&#39;t in a hurry.

Two hours after we placed the order, I called in and was hung up on by staff 3 times. On the 4th time I called, somebody was finally able to help me. She looked up the order online and discovered that our order had gone overlooked by mistake, but they would have food to us within 30 minutes. 

...30 minutes later and food was here! However, our meat was very low quality, fatty, stringy and chewy. My roommate ordered sesame chicken and it was significantly over-fried. By this, I mean there was little meat and a thick, crunchy, greasy breading. The spring rolls we ordered had meat in them, which was unexpected; I wish this information had been disclosed to us on the menu. 

I&#39;d have to say the fried won tons we ordered were the best part. We could see and taste crab meat in the filling, which seemed homemade. (Unfortunately, I don&#39;t like fish, so these were also inedible)"

They&#39;re truly our go-to spot when we&#39;re seeking some filling, tasty, and above all affordable Chinese food. So with that in mind, why don&#39;t I tell y&#39;all a few things about them?

The vast majority of Fortune Kitchen&#39;s business revolves around takeout and delivery - which is just as well since the space itself is shoebox-like. But as &#34;they&#34; are so fond of stating, good things do indeed come in small packages at this Aurora establishment. Case in point - the General Tso&#39;s chicken which achieves a (sadly not-often-found) harmony of sweet, tangy and spicy tastes on the same plate. Another standout idea is the soul-stirring and very fragrant basil beef. Are you leaning more towards seafood, and seeking an extra &#34;oomph&#34; to your lunch? Then why not try the Kung Pao shrimp? Yes, it packs a powerful chili punch - but not so much that its shrimpy nuttiness (feel free to use that expression in your review!) is hopelessly drowned out. I could just go on and on discussing the possible options here - and actually, I plan on doing just that, so pour yourself a refreshing beverage while I continue.

While most of this review has been devoted to more, uh, fleshy pursuits, I don&#39;t want to give the impression that Fortune Kitchen skips over meatless items entirely. No sir! They in fact have quite a few ideas for you if you&#39;re eschewing meat  - do a stirfry of mixed veggies in garlic sauce or even a heap of sesame tofu sound good? Yep, I just had a feeling you might answer in the affirmative on that one. That tofu is also available drenched in a sweet/savory peanut sauce - which handily brings me to the fact that Fortune Kitchen now also boasts a few Thai creations for your delectation. And quite nice they are too, whether you&#39;re hankering for some coconutty/peanutty Panang curry, or revitalizing Drunken Noodles (with plenty of crunchy bean sprouts), or even the meat-and-egg noodle free-for-all usually going by the moniker Pad Thai. One taste of any of these, and I think you&#39;ll agree with my coworkers!"

I did get the order sooner than the estimated hour wait for delivery. It was well packaged and the soup hadn&#39;t spilled, but after biting into one of the wontons from the soup, what looked like a dead roach floated to the top of the container. 

I called Fortune Kitchen and the man that answere the phone listened to me about finding the bug in the soup. He said he&#39;d call the online service and request that the soup charge be removed from my order, but about 5 minutes later, the guy called back to say that he thought maybe I&#39;d mistaken a &#34;fried onion&#34; for a bug. I assured it him that the bug had legs and a head, and I took a photo of it in the soup. He told me again that he&#39;d call to have the charge removed.

I did bravely eat the shrimp combination I ordered; though I had specified white sauce instead of brown, it had been cooked with brown sauce. It didn&#39;t taste bad, but after the bug issue, I can&#39;t say I would have ever found it to be the best shrimp with veggies I&#39;d had.

I didn&#39;t eat the chicken and snow peas, but did eat a middle of the road egg roll.

I ended up chatting online with an Eat24 rep who asked for me to send the photo to him, and after seeing the bug in the soup, Eat24 promptly removed the soup charge from my order. So, while I won&#39;t likely order from Fortune Kitchen again, I am happy with the Eat24 group--they were really responsive and helpful."

They do quite a bit of delivery from this location as it&#39;s not suited for big eat in business.  I prefer to pick up my orders, mainly because now I don&#39;t live in their delivery area like I used too.  I have not tried their ordering online because I find it easier to make a short call.  There are also a few tables that you could eat in if you wanted too.  

I really love their fried dumplings.  They are plump and flavorful.  Fried or steamed to perfection and served with a very yummy sauce.  As I mentioned before they make really great bbq pork fried rice.  I like the fact that their food is not overly salty as some places can be.   They also serve both Coke and Pepsi products which is rare."

I first tried to order using the Yelp app and when I got to check out it would only let me pay by cash. Maybe not Fortunes fault but the experience only gets worse. I was staying in a very nearby hotel, lees than a mile and when I called in my order at 9:50, they closed at 10:30, they acted like they had never heard of it. Placed my order for egg roll (best thing I ate), hot &amp; sour soup, hot chicken wings and General Tso chicken. Also added a Dr Pepper after they ran my card and I only had a $20 cash to pay for the pop. She added a delivery fee since it was close to their closing which would not have been charged if i could have check out with the app. It was past 11:30 before the driver showed up after 2 other phone calls to find out where I was. Driver didn&#39;t have change for a $20 so I had to change the tip from cc and take it out of cash. Now after all this I get to finally sit down and eat. Egg roll 3 out of 5. Crispy, smaller but tasted like an egg roll. Next hot &amp; sour soup. Maybe this all was because I ordered at the end of the day and I got the end of the day flavor. H&amp;S soup had a very off taste. I have had a lot of H&amp;S soup and this tasted nothing like anything I had tasted. Ok, set it aside and try the wings. Oh and by the way, no forks or spoons. Ok remember this is not BW3, I&#39;m not sure the recipe but again, off tasting, starting to get worried that I might get sick and being on a business trip this is not part of my plan. Sauce or paste might describe it better was coating all the wings and while indeed hot like I like them it was ill flavored. I struggled thru them because at this point I still needed something to eat. I was not in the mood at this point to break open the rice and add the General Tso to the top, I just open the Tso and began eating. This was the closest tasting item other than the egg roll to anything I had experience in my 5 decades. Still at this point I ate maybe 5-6 bites and gave up. How bad could a fortune cookie be...orange flavored. Now while I have had orange flavored FC it not the norm. Eater beware. Not saying this is the norm for this place, however, I had enough after egg roll."

The most unprofessional service I&#39;ve ever encountered and the most disgusting food with HAIRS . We had a long day &amp; to be honest we do our cheat meal Saturday or Sunday. We decided to call for Chinese when I called the lady is asking for my address and at the same time tells me hold on to get two other calls and goes to get their address even tho I called first mind you they&#39;re closing in 40 mins she&#39;s trying to get as many costumers are possible all by herself which was very rude to Leave me for last when I was the first caller. She comes back and I ordered CHICKEN fried rice , Sesame Chicken &amp; mousse cake . The total is $26 no problem she said 30 mins wait . The food finally arrived ( took over 30 mins I was already super sleepy laying down ) I opened the door and first thing the driver did was got the receipt why? Doesn&#39;t the costumer keeps it ?i gave him $40 and told him give me 5 back he looks at me and tells me he doesn&#39;t have change ? I said ok can we call it in I&#39;ll use a card . He said he can&#39;t do that because they&#39;re closed .WHAT type of delivery driver doesn&#39;t have change? Ok whatever all I wanted was to eat my long waited food. I opened the bag prepared the plates and EW disgusting fake chicken how is it that my chicken rice looks so old ( left overs) and it was a gluey white pieces chewy type that is not CHICKEN and my hubby noticed hair sticking out Black hair the most disgusting thing EVER - look at the photos you&#39;ll be so disgusted . I was so upset Because we love Chinese and it was nothing like Chinese we couldn&#39;t eat it.the sesame chicken it wouldn&#39;t even move it was so old and sticky :(. I did take a bite of the mousse cake and it was decent but after seeing the hairs and food it couldn&#39;t take another bite of the mouse cake . We ended not eating . I called back and again called and again No answer . I finally got an answer at 3Pm &amp; I asked to please not hung up I needed to speak to the manager or I
Will go to the store . The manager came on the phone and I explained to him and he&#39;s telling me &#34;ok while speaking in Chinese with a lady&#34; he said no problem I&#39;ll give u $12 credit I said how is it I get $12 store when I wasted double of that and you don&#39;t seem to care about the hair I mean how professional are you ? He kept switching around saying different things basically trying to tell me he didn&#39;t care and wouldn&#39;t let me speak . He will try to confuse me when all I wanted was to let him know my experience And how I didn&#39;t eat it. Very frustrating to know he didn&#39;t care and kept cutting me off till I told him I&#39;ll call the FDA he started screaming at me and won&#39;t give me my money back or anything he Hanged up on me .Seriously how disappointing I lost my money , horrible food ( disgusting please be careful) the worse service ever !

Not as bad as the dollar a scoop spots but not really all that special. The food lacked flavor and the rice was a little stale. The egg drop soup could have been yellow water. I also thought it awkward for the cashier to take my receipt and immediately look at how much tip I left. I&#39;m not very picky but for 14 bucks I&#39;d like to enjoy my food.

Fortune Kitchen was my usual go to place from time to time. They are close to where I live so it&#39;s convenient. I usually order online for pickup, and when I arrive it&#39;s ready for me. The food never amazed me, as I don&#39;t expect it to be authentic Chinese food.

Let&#39;s talk about the food though...I nearly threw up. The only thing keeping me from giving them One star is the food was usually okay prior to this. I ordered pepper steak with onions and fried rice. The Rice showed no signs of being fried rice, it just felt like a bland yellow rice. The meat in the pepper steak tasted like a jelly. It was chewy and inedible. It resembled pork fat and disgusted me. I was unable to eat it. I won&#39;t be ordering from this place again."

I ordered 2 egg rolls, grilled chicken, and chicken lettuce wraps.  My total was $22 (not bad I thought)   I got the order an hour later.the driver kept my receipt...no egg rolls, I called the restaurant and the worman said you didn&#39;t order any egg rolls and you did get chicken because our pork is red.

I know what pork and chicken look and taste like but she continued to argue with me.  I also checked the prices on the menu that was attached to the bag.  I was over charged, so I called the restaurant again. and asked about increased charges she said that she had to charge me a $5 delivery fee.  I complained that I was not told about the fee, she  said sorry I didn&#39;t take your order.  I had also tipped the delivery person.

Usually I get nervous about ordering a dish like that from a delivery chinese place because they will almost always overcook the dishes, but I am here to report that it was perfect. I ate the whole thing and loved every bit of it.

Also, it was not pricey, we got a coupon from the delivery menu. Up to $18, we also got 2-free egg rolls.Plus, I ordered online and they said 50 minutes but it only took 30.  This will be my go-to delivery asian fusion."

We ordered on-line and were quoted 45-60 minutes.  The food arrived around the 30 minute mark.  This may have been partially due to my giving a 15% tip when I placed the order.  The food arrived hot and fresh.

The reason I am only giving 2 stars is that the quality of food was very poor.  My man ordered the seasame chicken combo with egg roll &amp; fried rice and I ordered chicken chow mein combo with the same sides.  

The fried rice was dried out and showed no signs of eggs or veggies that typically are found in fried rice.  The seasame chicken did not come with any veggies.  We oreded the mild and it was bland, possibly ordering it a bit more spicy may have helped.  My chow mein had fried wonton strips rather than chow mein noodles.  There was a very runny liquid in with mine as well.  The chicken had a very odd flavor, almost sea-food like.  I am wondering if it wasn&#39;t their &#34;vegetarian chicken&#34; that is made from mushrooms and other things as I say on the menu.  It was difficult to stomach even a few bites.  I tried crushing thier &#34;chow-mein noodles&#34; on top and adding a packet of soy to see if that improved the palatability, not the case.  I was able to force down a few more bites and threw the rest away.  Sad because the amount of food wasted would have been enough for at least two other meals.

I did give them a second star for &#34;presentation&#34;.  We did recieve 4 egg rolls with the order when I was only expecting 2.  These did have a nice flakey wrap, but cabbage seemed to be the only ingredient filling them. The crab-cheese wontons were full of crab, but slightly under fried.  The shell was a bit chewy.

For the $30 price tag that came with dinner, I feel like I got taken.  The amount of food that was stomachable was not enough to fill me, and I am a light eater.  I would not eat here ever again and I would not recommend it."

 The chicken low mein is very good but the best is the sesame chicken. I highly recommend it and it is not too spicy.  
The stir fried rice is not very good.  Mine seemed to be brown rice with one shriveled pea in it.
The egg rolls and fried cheese wonton are good too.  Four of each.
 Includes adequate hot mustard and soy sauce plus the little fortune cookies.  Almond cookies are a thing of the past I guess.

I tend to judge Chinese food based on my favorite dish: Beef and Broccoli.  And I wasn&#39;t disappointed!  It was tasty and flavorful.  It wasn&#39;t the best B&amp;B I&#39;ve ever had, but it was certainly a nice dish.  My sister ordered Sesame Chicken, which was very lovely.  I would recommend it!  We also ordered crab cheese wantons and wanton soup.  The wantons were crispy and had a a good balance of crab and cream cheese.  The soup was savory, but I&#39;ve had better.

Unfortunately that ended up being the only good part of he experience.

We put a specific time for the order to be delivered and I went outside and waited...and waited...and waited. I finally called and the woman on the phone sounded surprised and unaware of any such order. She played it off and said it was on the way. I tried to find out specifically if it was en route, but she was evasive.

It finally arrived 15 minutes later (40 minutes after the requested time). The delivery driver was much more honest and said that if you place an online order you need to call in to let them know. What? Doesn&#39;t that sort of defeat the purpose, especially considering there is an extra convenience fee for ordering online.

He admitted that they had totally missed our order and began making it when I called in. He suggested we not order online anymore.

My boss is cool, so he let me take a longer lunch, but the food was disappointing. The portions were fine for the price, but the dishes were mediocre. We both threw our menus in the recycling bin. Too bad."

Okay no biggie, its Friday night not a big deal.  So we waited and waited and waited.  After waiting 45 minutes after our quoted delivery time we called to just cancel the order.  The women on the phone tried to make it better by offering us 5 dollars off.  It didn&#39;t take long for us quickly decline the ridiculous offer of five dollars off.  Seeing as at that time it had been close to 2 hours after the time that I originally placed the order.

But the real problem wasn&#39;t ordering food that never came (which was of course annoying).  But the problem was that the next morning I check my bank account and there is a charge from Fortune Kitchen for $45 dollars.  I called Fortune Kitchen yet again to complain about this change and she so rudely dismissed me saying that it takes business days for the charge to fall off.  Okay, I get that, but I had a feeling that was never going to happen.  Sure enough I log into my bank account Tuesday and there is STILL that charge from this restaurant.  Making it MY problem to call and deal with this with my bank.

The manager offered me a $5.00 credit on my next order. The food finally showed up at 9:05. I was very displeased by this. The big issue that I had other than it being late was that I had given them nearly 2 hours of notice, I tipped the driver in advance, and I was charged a $7.00 delivery fee.

I ordered the crab cheese wontons, Vietnamese egg rolls and the Kung Pao Chicken combo.  Everything arrived hot and fresh.  The wontons were excellent.  I&#39;m used to the Vietnamese egg rolls at Pho 95 so the size of these surprised me, and they were stuffed with beef.  Not what I expected but still good and could easily be a meal on their own!  The Kung Pao Chicken with fried rice was a little sub par but sometimes when you&#39;re ready to eat your arm off, you just don&#39;t care that much.

It&#39;s affordable, has a large and diverse menu, offers great specials, and serves good tasting food. For what it is and with the options available you really can&#39;t go wrong. I have been here for lunch twice now and ordered chicken dishes both times (kung pao and cashew). My preference was the kung pao, but the cashew chicken was very good too.The only issue I have is that for the cashew chicken my request to have it spicy was missed. But hey, it was nothing a little sriracha couldn&#39;t fix.

The portions are nicely sized (actually had enough left over from each for two nice snacks, as well), and with lunch specials you also get your choice of a fried wonton or eggroll, as well as a soft drink. All for an amazingly low price. The main drawback of Fortune Kitchen is that the interior dining area is small and one of the two booths may be cluttered with toys and/or extra supplies, so it&#39;s not the ideal place for those who like to dine-in. If you&#39;re put off by such scenery just have your order delivered and you won&#39;t have to worry about it because it really is all about the food."

The chicken for sweet and sour chicken was hard as a rock... completely inedible. The crab meat cheese wontons were hard and dry and had nothing in most of them. The kung pow chicken was okay, but the chow mein was squishy and runny and just not good.  It may have just been an off day for them but I won&#39;t be pressing my luck to determine that... total wase of money... but the dog ate great!"

After looking for awhile, Fortune Kitchen definitely is the closest I&#39;ve found to proper Chinese delivery in Aurora, with really good soup and egg rolls.

I&#39;m talking about the kind where you can order a combination meal with an egg roll and fried rice.  I haven&#39;t had anything I&#39;ve found acceptable out here in the Denver area since moving here almost two years ago.  

I spent a large part of my early afternoon trying to find something and had almost given up all hope when my neighbor knocked on my door.  I told her my problem and that&#39;s when she left and came right back with a menu for Fortune Kitchen, which can also be found at www.ufeedme.com/fortunekitchen.

I ordered the sweet and sour chicken combination and wonton soup and had it deliverd.  They said about 35 minutes and they were spot on.  I got a lot of food for a great price and it all exceeded my expectations.  

I will be ordering from here again.  And again.  And probably again and again and again.

I called at an hour and half, was put on hold for 5 minutes while I listened to the lady trying her best to not give the other caller any kind of discount.  She finally got to me, told me my good left a while ago and should be there any minute.  Not flying with me.  She called driver and I was told 5 minutes.  15 minutes later he arrives.  I ask one question.  How long has the food been in your car?  He actually told me 10 mins... I know better.  I check the food, the hot stiff was cold, but yet the driver still tried to get me to take the food.  I told him to take it back and he still tried to sell it to me.  If only he would have been honest with me and understood my side as a customer I had cash in my pocket to top him, because I understand his side.  But lying to me and insisting on me buying the cold food was just plain rude.  When I called the store the same lady to answer the first time was so kind to hang up me after she took my address and I told her I sent my food back.

Then we tasted  the beef or sauce, couldn&#39;t tell which one the horrible after taste came from...spit it out in the sink!!!!!!!!!! Packed up what was on the plate and took back to Fortune Kitchen(still warm),The owner, cook offered to give us more of the same mess but not the beef dish because it wasn&#39;t full to the top???? What ?? Sorry, we didn&#39;t think we should spit it back in the container! We even returned the rice but he argued and argued that he would not refund our money and YELLING that we were horrible customers! Though he stole our money, I decided he must  need $16.00 + 3.00 tip I just gave him more than I did. Absolutely unacceptable way of doing business and truly classless.

But when I took my first bite of the mole chicken, I knew the accolades were well deserved. 

Let&#39;s back up first to the chips and salsa and starter. The chips and salsa are a hallmark of a good Mexican restaurant for me. These seemed to be made in house and were crunchy and fresh. I am not a fan of chunky salsa and this salsa was the smooth, spicy blend I love. 

We ordered the grilled cactus for an appetizer. My husband wasn&#39;t so much a fan but then he also doesn&#39;t care for okra which I think has a similar texture to the inside of a cactus. It worked out well for me as I got all the cactus. 

And then the main dish arrived. A big plate (I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day) of chicken mole appeared before me. I took my first bite and was overwhelmed with amazing flavors having a party in my mouth. It was all I could do to not overeat and when I lovingly scraped my leftovers into the to-go box, I swiped my finger at least once around the plate to get more of that insanely good mole sauce."

Our server was attentive and friendly and helped with questions on the menu. 

We picked this place because they had a separate vegetarian (with vegan options) menu, which was great! 

Our table wound up with two Bean &amp; Rice Burritos, both okay and one Chicken/Cheese Quesadilla that was good! I was bummed I couldn&#39;t try the Grilled Cactus as the server informed us they were out. Ordered the flan To-Go and we were a bit disappointed how over-the-top syrupy/sweet it was (and this is coming from someone with a major sweet tooth).

Best part of the whole place is the small, authentic feel; great menu with TONS of options, and.... The Guacamole is to die for. Super fresh &amp; great flavor! I&#39;d go here again if I&#39;m in town and would just order and entire bowl of Guac"

I had to try the the mole for sure.  So I ordered the enmoladas with chicken, crispy rellenos, tradicional steak burrito, grilled cactus, and tamal de elote.  

The mole was delicious.  Flavor was complex with a smokey and delicately sweet note.  Not in total disagreement with other reviews, the chicken was moist but bland; however, together with the mole it was delicious.  

The crispy rellenos had great flavor but were not remotely crispy.  It tasted more like a battered rellenos.  I assume the steak burritos were delicious as my boys devoured them.

The tamal was not a standout for me.  The cactus, however, was awesome.  We enjoyed them with just a squeeze of lime.  If you have never had cactus, don&#39;t miss out.  Texture is a lot like okra.

Service was friendly but food was a tad slow coming out.  With only two other customers, the order took about 35 minutes.  Overall, enjoyed our order and will be back."

That was rectified recently when I came in to try the talked about Mole. 

It met my expectations, which were pretty high, and  the portion size tested my stomach stretching ability that day, which I was more than willing to put to the test. 

I opted for the carnitas and they were moist and the mole was so rich and deep with smokey pepper notes. 

They also have a very large Vegetarian and Vegan selections if you&#39;re so inclined.  

I will return and try a few other options to see if they stack up to the amazing Mole."

I ordered a burrito thing with beans and some other stuff, or so I thought. But, when I got it, it was literally beans wrapped in a flour tortilla.

It was very bland and tasted like baby food (mushy). The flour tortilla, though, was pretty good. 

It looks like they have a lot of fresh fruit smoothies here, but I didn&#39;t try any of them.

The interior is small, and doesn&#39;t look super clean, but that&#39;s okay because remember, it&#39;s a &#34;hole in the wall&#34;.

We also grabbed some guacamole and cactus salad. Guac was some of the best I&#39;ve had, but then again most people don&#39;t do guac justice. If you&#39;ve never had cactus (nopales) they have the taste of roasted green peppers and the texture of okra. Try some.

There are only about 8 tables in the whole place and I&#39;ve only every seen one server on, which is more than adequate.  I wouldn&#39;t call the service the most attentive but getting the server&#39;s attention has always been easy.  The checks come in hollowed out books with aphorisms inside and out that obviously have been hand-assembled.  The inside of this place looks loved and the food tasted that way too!

My body is very sensitive to food quality and I often leave Mexican restaurants feeling heavy and a bit less alive than when I entered.  Not so with this place.  There is a freshness to the sauces and a heartiness to the rice and beans that suggest that the chefs/cooks are purchasing based on taste or quality and not just cost.

The cactus appetizer is tasty and interesting.  The Mole and the Enchiladas con Morisqueta are my favorites that I&#39;ve tried.  The Enchiladas con Rojas(???) is also very good.  The Jalapenos stuffed with peanut butter and topped with cheese are uncooked and didn&#39;t quite suit my palate.  I&#39;ve also had one of the juice drinks and that was very good.

The portion sizes are slightly larger than the average Mexican place.  I&#39;m a big eater and I&#39;ve often not finished my plate here.  The price is a few dollars more too but paying the extra feels like a bargain for the quality and flavor.  Highly recommended!"

It&#39;s worth the wait. It&#39;s usually only two guys working whenever I&#39;m here, and it&#39;s the same two guys. One takes orders and makes juices and assists in the kitchen, and the other guy cooks magnificent food, one dish at a time. 

I always, always go for the ensalada de nopales. Cactus pad salad with tomatoes and onions... OOH! So amazing. The mole never fails to impress, and I have friends who swear by their carnitas. The juices are fresh, tasty, and a real surprise in this set-back strip mall. Oh man, I&#39;m starting to get cravings right about now for the chicken mole huarache and the salad and a killer juice.

These guys do it right. If you&#39;re in a hurry, forget it. If you&#39;re in the market for tasty-ass food, go here now."

I can say I&#39;ve had my share of all kinds of Mole but of course, still wanted to try it here.  The waiter who helped us had no charisma-we&#39;ll leave that there because I could say one or two more things here.  

Lets go straight to the mole, the sauce was ok, but the chicken--it was bland and like someone else mentioned, rubbery.  Man was I dissapointed!  This was a long drive for us :("

We decided to try this place out on a whim.  When I found out where the owner was from, near my moms home town, we decided to try a little bit of everything. 

Camarones a la diabla where OK. Nothing special as well as the rice and beans that came with them. 

The oxacan tamale (mole) was really good. Very very similar to what oxacan mole should taste like.

Corn tamale (uchepo) was delicious. The best part was it came prepared like I remember eating them as a child.  Some cream queso fresco and some salsa Verde.  I wish I would have just order a dozen of these and skipped the shrimp.

The Morisqueta.  While good it had nothing on my families. 

My wife had the captain america juice. I believe it was apple, carrot, and beets. She liked it, I thought it tasted like dirt...

All and all 3 of the 4 things I had were good and the service was excellent so it gets a 4 out of 5"

That is very rare to see at a Mexican restaurant! It&#39;s a little place tucked away in a strip mall on the side of Federal so it&#39;s easy to miss but make sure to stop there. I was blown away by how fresh everything was! The cantaloupe (melon) agua fresca was made on the spot and had actual chunks of melon in it. The enmoladas were lovely with the mole amarillo. The portions were large but not overwhelming like most Mexican restaurants. Now about the nopales. Try it before you knock it. It&#39;s amazing! It&#39;s grilled to perfection and the presentation is lovely. You get two large pieces of nopales for $5 which is plenty for two people. Just squeeze some lime on them and it&#39;s perfect!

I think I will have to keep looking.

The salsa was good but the chips were stale.  They don&#39;t offer you water,  you have to buy it. Ding, ding.

I ordered a huarache with beans, chicken, onion, tomato and their &#34;7 chile mole&#34;.  It was pretty bland.  Like, Central American bland.  the chicken was rubbery and had no flavor, the corn base (shaped like a shoe, hense the name) was dense,  the beans were more like the whisper of an idea that has something to do with beans over the surface of the corn,  and they were stingy with the mole.  Ding.

Still craving my fix,  I picked through the huarache and then ordered what should have been my first choice,  the cheese enchiladas with the 7 chile mole,  to go.  By the time I got it home it had produced a pretty good oil slick on top of it. Not their fault,  that it was slightly cold,  but they just put too much oil in it to start with. It was really really greasy.   

That being said,  it&#39;s pretty tasty.  You&#39;re just going to have a belly ache afterward.  

The place was cute and clean and I wanted to love it,  but there were just too many &#34;meh&#34; factors for me.

Stale chips are gross and water is practically free."

It&#39;s tucked behind a pho restaurant and it looks indistinguishable from the store next door whose purpose I was unable to figure out. Either way, everything here is delicious! The restaurant decor is very cute. There are little inspirational-type sayings everywhere, art, Spanish-language magazine clipping extolling the virtues of juices. Just a lot of stuff to look at while you wait for your food. I think our server may also have been the owner, and he was quiet but also friendly. 

The entire back page is nothing but smoothies and other drinks. I tried the fantastic four, which was pineapple, peaches, strawberry and another fruit I can&#39;t remember. It was great, but a little too sweet for me so I shared it with my husband. He got the salty lemonade, which was good as well. I ordered the 7 chile mole with chicken for my entree, and I&#39;m very glad I did. The chicken was very tender and fell apart, and the mole was perfect. It was a dark mole and on the sweet side and not spicy at all, but very unique. Definitely a must try. My husband ordered the enmoladas with mole amarillo and... I think I&#39;ll be ordering that next time. I only got a little bite, but it had a very interesting flavor. I will probably be directing anyone here who is looking for a good place for Mexican food in Denver from now on, because I think it&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve tried so far."

While I might disagree with Westword as to whether this is &#39;the best&#39;, I have no qualms with saying that it is pretty darn good. 

Given the numerous accolades I decided to try the mole. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but it was complex, full, and tasty. Others at the table had the chilaquiles, which I tried, and which were dynamite. I will definitely have that next time I&#39;m there. 

Tarasco&#39;s is a small restaurant. It&#39;s hidden away like the proverbial diamond in the rough. We had no trouble getting a table (on a Tuesday around 6:30), but I can&#39;t speak to other times of the day or days of the week. Even if there were a wait, it would be totally worth it.

They continue to get pretty good reviews on Yelp and also recently in Westword as Mark Antonation ate his way up Federal.  Promised my friend Bev that we&#39;d go for lunch so we hit them up today.

Place hasn&#39;t changed much - it&#39;s still just a little hole in the wall next to a pot shop but at least it&#39;s clean.  No booze, if that matters to you, but an extensive menu of fruit drinks/smoothies.  Prices are no bargain either.  They&#39;re not gouging you but you&#39;ll pay similar prices to those charged in much nicer surroundings.

I think the best word for their food is &#34;aburrido&#34; in Spanish - translates to &#34;boring&#34;.  There is nothing really wrong with it - you won&#39;t get sick or need to send something back but I think there is so much better out there.  The chips are commercial and I&#39;ve had tomato juice straight from the can with more spice than their watery salsa.  The only really memorable thing of the day was some freshly made guac ($6).

For lunch she had the chicken mole enchiladas (mole is their claim to fame) and didn&#39;t care for it ($9).  She found it too spicy but I didn&#39;t find it spicy at all but it was very dark and I thought it a bit bitter.  I confess to spooning some on to my carne asada ($10) to give it a little flavor because otherwise it was completely tasteless (not even enough salt and pepper).  Beans were OKish - nothing special - the rice was particularly dry and flavorless.

Service by the owner was pleasant enough but it was very quiet so he had plenty of time to chat but didn&#39;t really.  Kept waters refilled though which was appreciated.  I&#39;d say for a few bucks more you&#39;re better off getting your mole fix at Chili Verde or Paxia.  Just my dos centavos."

went for the mole.
nothing special...
rice and beans were very bland.
chicken in my meal was not good quality.

not the worst place, but not close to worth it for what you pay for. 
good guac though!

just got to denver about a month ago, and still on the hunt for some goooooood mole negro."

If you want good Mexican/Southwest food, try this. Although a little tricky to find, the hunt down Federal is worth it, for the mole alone. You definitely get a different variety of food than you would at a typical Mexican restaurant, though there are still many staples for those looking for burritos, tortas, etc. The mole here is very good, and has yet to be topped by mole I have had elsewhere. The fruit/veggie drinks are also very nice, and a great alternative to beer and margaritas. The place is small, casual, and friendly."

Growing up in the Southwest gave me the need for authentic, hot, spicy Mexican food. It&#39;s been a challenge for the man and I to find a place here in Denver that has any kind of spice. Apparently people here don&#39;t like spicy food? Anyhow... We found the love of our life and it is called Tarasco&#39;s. The mole is super spicy, probably the best mole I&#39;ve had in a VERY long time. Enchiladas are kick ass and who can pass up a smoothie bar? Their vegetarian menu is HUGE for those non animal eaters.

Keep an eye out for Vietnam Bay right next door, Tarasco&#39;s is small and hidden, looking for Vietnam Bay is the only way I can ever find it. 

But anywho... highly recommend this place for authentic, hot, spicy Mexican food. Yum yum yum yum"

I was already planning to write my first yelp review on this place. At first it bothered me that we stood at the door before being acknowledged. But damn was that far in the past once I took my first bite. This place puts love in the food. I judge a Mexican place a lot based on their salsa. Only the great places have great salsa.

I asked him if he can give some jalapenos and he rudely mentioned that there will be extra charge not included in tacos.

The menu is quite huge with a wide variety of choices, many of which are of the vegetarian persuasion or at least incorporate more fruits and vegetables than the average cuisine in this area might.

Still, I was quite surprised to see the joint relatively deserted on a midweek lunch hour. With that said, I was even more surprised by the quiet, inattentive waitress we had, despite having only one other table in the entire restaurant. 

The food did make up for the poor service, with a very tasty chile as the major highlight. The salsa here is good, and was served with the requisite chips and salsa offering. The meal (a burrito) was filling and the portion size is about average to similar restaurants. 

There are plenty of reasons to like Tarasco&#39;s, but certainly they still have room for improvement."

AUGUST 13th 2011 Saturday, was here with 11 other frens who are foodies just like me for a Michoacan Dinner Feast Galore.  Our seats are all set for us, though I cant deny I was running late for at least 5 minutes and my frens were all there already.

Noe, and his crew were pleased to have us and there was 2 other couple patrons there too during that evening.

From what I could recall these were what my frens ordered that evening :

*  Mole 7 Chiles
*  Pozole
*  Birria De Borrego
*  Tamales
*  Guacamole
*  Jalapeppers
*  Nopales Asados ~ Grilled Cactus
*  Ensalada De Nopales
*  Chimichanga
*  Chille Relleno Plate
*  Huaraches
*  Chilaquiles Verdes o Rojos
*  Flan
*  Churros

As for me I opt for the Steak Tacos.  If I am not mistaken, our waitstaff also offer us the Charred Jalapenos with Soy sauce.

I think that evening, I enjoyed my share of Jugo Terapia, aka Fruit Juices more than anything else.  First because it was so HOT outside, and I am just SO thirsty more than being hungry.  I orded the Fridas and Fantastic 4.  Each Jugo Terapia is $4.50.

All in all, the dinner was a success.  Though the kitchen need to &#34;hassle&#34; to cook our order in time for our big group, everyone is happy with their order.  From my fren&#39;s feedback, they dont mind returning and perhaps order what they did not order for their future visits.  Another ADDED bonus, we are issued separate checks for our big group.  For this, I cant thank Noe enough.

Thank you Noe, and Tarasco&#39;s New Latino Cuisine&#39;s crew for having us and to this I also want to take this opportunity to give my thanks to our fellow yelper, Thomas S. who I have exchanged emails with, many moons ago with regards to Michoacan cuisine.

I hope and pray Tarasco&#39;s New Latino Cuisine, will prosper and be in the Denver Food Scene many more YEARS to come...

We got the verde chicken enchiladas and the mole chicken enchiladas and the Iron man juice.  Everything was delicious -- the enchiladas were full in flavor and the best way I&#39;d describe is just a very pure, clean flavor. The food there is made fresh, simple/pure, and you can taste it.

Only negative was our waiter wasn&#39;t the friendliest -- but I will put it past him, maybe he was having a bad day.

We ordered the green curry, pad Thai and drunken noodles - fairly standard Thai staples. Everything was incredibly well executed and very well presented (loved the spice accoutrement dish including chili fish sauce).  My favorite is that lunch made me - really (really) - want to come back for dinner!  Like a little sneak peak!  It&#39;s been over 9 hours since lunch and I specifically remember walking away craving the massaman rack of lamb (holy massaman Batman!!!) and Tom Kha soup!

Here&#39;s the bottom line: The server did a phenomenal job telling us about items we should come back for and why.  He told the restaurant&#39;s story in a way that would make the owners and chefs proud. 

I&#39;ll be back.  Thanks..."

However, this place is delicious!

Drunken Noodle: The drunken noodles with kobe beef was delicious. Very good flavor on the noodles and the beef was very tender.

Red curry: really good flavor.

Calamari: batter too thick

Thai Iced Tea: delicious.

The food was fresh, and had great flavor. The prices were not cheap though."

As we were feeling peckish, and craving thai food, we decided to take a chance on this restaurant and were very pleased with our choice.

The decor is a charming mix of modern and industrial and I loved the addition of the reclaimed wood sprinkled about as well. We came at a pretty awkward time before the dinner rush started, so we had most of the restaurant to ourself. There seemed to be only one server on duty, and while he was friendly and happy to answer any questions we had, we did spend a lot of time waiting around for him.

The food was wonderful and beautifully presented. My mom loved the carrot butterflies adorning the plates, and we were fascinated by the green peppercorns they included in some of their dishes. We started with an order of the golden calamari, potstickers, and the alligator to share. The calamari was tempura battered and some of the best I&#39;ve ever had--I&#39;m drooling just thinking about it. The potstickers were alright and the alligator was delicious and spicy. I had the black pepper wok fry for my main dish with the kobe beef and it was really delicious. The portion might have been a little small if we hadn&#39;t had appetizers, but it ended up being a very satisfying meal.

It was a lot pricier than what I&#39;d expect to pay for lunch fare or happy hour, but it&#39;s still a tasty little spot to try out if you&#39;re in the neighborhood."

While I felt like we knew we&#39;d be walking into overpriced Asian-fushion, I don&#39;t think my experience swayed too far from the expectation.

I will say- it&#39;s great the restaurant incorporates local, organic ingredients in their cooking as much as possible. Plating was nicer than typical Thai restaurants. Serving size was a bit less than the average Thai food serving though. Prices were a bit steeper- but for the presentation and location in LoDo, I guess that can be understandable.

As for our passport coupons- we got a bogo draft beer (good beer selection! Several local brews on tap and some international beers too) and a house Mai Thai. Both were good!"

The Pad Thai extra hot was great, not as hot as I&#39;d like, so might try thai hot. Always risky, but will see. 

NIce atmosphere, nice staff. It was weird that the hostess put us and the next guests right on top of each other even though no other guests were in the place, but not a big deal.

Definitely will be back. Price wise it&#39;s not likely to be our go to thai place, but when we&#39;re feeling like a fancier meal or want to just walk down the road, this is on the list."

My favorite is probably the Panang Curry - it was the perfect harmony of sweet and spicy. Yes, it is probably a fusion restaurant as judged by their appetizers, but their main dishes are truly authentic.  A little on the pricey side, my Panang curry was $17, but worth a treat once in a while :)

Also, great marketing from them, have you seen the sign outside their shop that says &#34;Poke-balls found in thai food here!&#34; Genius!"

I called just to be safe that the order was successful - the business hung up on me twice.

I came to pick up my food 25 mins later as I was told that it would be ready between 15-30 mins to learn that the Eat24 app that processed my order was down. Bar manager - Jason said he would put order in asap and it will be ready in another 20 mins.  So I would have waited a total of 45 mins for some fried rice? Seriously?

Hmm no thanks. I&#39;m on my lunch break and don&#39;t have that kind of time.

I get it- technology is only good when it works - but customer service and how management was willing to accommodate the situation was poor

I&#39;m a firm believer in giving businesses some slack in their opening weeks since they are working out kinks but I can definitely say I&#39;m a fan of Aloy. Aloy is a new addition to the east end of Larimer Street, occupying the old space that Trillium once lived in. 

The vibe is modern and hip, not your average Thai restaurant that you would find in a strip mall near a liquor store. We got to try a myriad of appetizers from the menu including fried tofu, pork belly lettuce wraps and mussels. I&#39;m a huge pork belly fan so the lettuce wraps were my favorite but everything else was on point as well.

We then started off with the Tom Kha soup which was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had followed by the Kobe beef Pad Thai which was delicious but a smaller portion than what I was used to and not too saucy. Then we got to indulge in dessert, the sticky rice with fresh mango and coconut sorbet was a perfect after note to all the flavors we experienced.

The part about Aloy that wins me over is that it&#39;s all locally sourced ingredients....from the basil to the meat to the vegetables thrown in their entrees. They support a number of charities in town which is always fabulous to see local businesses giving back along with being sustainable. 

This place is pretty chic so prices are higher and portions are smaller but it&#39;s due to doing local business which is definitely worth the trade off."

The overall atmosphere is very nice for a Thai restaurant, much better for a date night then most hole in the wall options. They have an array of menu items including some interesting treats such as alligator and the seared kobe which you cook on a rock table side. My biggest complaint for 3 stars was the service. It took foreverrrrrrrrr to get served and we were of 4 tables there. The staff seemed to be having their own communal time rather then serving the guest.

Drunken Noodles w/ Kobe @ $15 was tasty, but by no means was it more amazing than my Pad Kee Mao I would get in NYC for about $8. Add a delivery fee and tip on top of that, and there goes a twenty.

On to the food: The Drunken Noodles themselves were pretty decent, although not very spicy, even though I requested that it be made hot. Drunken Noodles should melt your face, damn it!

In the end I was disappointed with the value. Perhaps the dining-in experience is better and justifies the expense, but sorry, it was just not worth the Andrew Jackson (I mean, Harriet Tubman) to me."

I ordered the Tom Kha soup with shrimp to start - big bowl, lots of large shrimp, totally yum.  For dinner I ordered the red curry with kobe beef - very good, though I wanted more beef.  By no means dissatisfied though; great flavors.  My daughter-in-law had the same, with chicken.  Loved it.  My son ordered mussuman rack of lamb (which he had been craving to sample since previously seeing it on the menu) - creatively presented with sweet potato, flaky pastry squares, and lots of sauce for the rice.

I was intrigued by the menu, and all of the unpredictable, creative twists they put on traditional Thai dishes. 

The interior of the restaurant is nicely appointed. I was concerned about getting a table with a small group, but it&#39;s actually a very large restaurant, and although they were busy, they were nowhere near being filled to capacity. Parking wasn&#39;t too bad even though there was some sort of sporting event going on. Our waiter was very attentive and we were not left wanting for a single thing throughout the meal. I was very happy with the service. 

The food. I tried my friend&#39;s pork belly buns. They were tasty for pork belly (not my favorite thing in the world). I ended up ordering the curry lamb because it had beets and sweet potatoes in it, and those are two of my favorite veggies. I also wanted something with the black rice, mainly because it sounded cool. It was beautifully presented, as I expected. The lamb was delicious, as was the curry sauce. I felt the sweet potatoes could have been cooked longer, as they were kind of hard, but overall, I enjoyed it very much and left stuffed. I would definitely come back."

The menu, although descent in options didn&#39;t jump out to us. Some appetizers looked interesting, there is a large section of salads and a few soups, mains and currys. With most appetizers at $8-10 and mains starting mostly at $20, we decided to just go for 2 mains to share. We ordered the shrimp pad Thai and the chicken green curry.

The pad Thai came with 4 prawns, nice in size though. The presentation was nice but it tasted too sweet. The green curry was spicy which was nice and good flavour, but the squash seemed out of place and the chicken had a grainy texture.

The service was attentive and the drinks menu varied.

Delivery: The food came faster than the quoted time. The driver was very polite. I was pleased with the delivery itself. Unfortunately, there was no straw for my drink, no silverware for the food, and the drink had spilled inside of the cup. They did have the foresight to wrap the cup in plastic wrap so the mess factor was fine. 

Order Accuracy: Fail. I asked for no onions on my drunken noodles. Noodles to onion ratio was probably 2/3 noodles 1/3 onions. Since onions and wide rice noodles look fairly similar, this made eating not so fun. 

Taste: 
-Thai iced tea: it was good. Nothing exciting
-Drunken noodles: outside of the onion issue, it was fine. Veggies tasted fresh. Chicken wasn&#39;t over cooked and there was a lot of it. Noodles were good. The sauce wasn&#39;t that exciting but I&#39;d say it was on par with average drunken noodles everywhere. Nothing to write home about 
-Pork Belly Buns: um yes. Order these. Order two orders of these and skip everything else. These were delicious. Both of the buns had a spot that was a little hard, but I think that was from transit/being wet? Idk. They were amazing. The sauce was perfect. The cucumbers were fresh. Eat these now. 

Price: Not worth it. The delivery was $4. The noodles were easily $2-5 more than anywhere else. The tea was more expensive than usual. There wasn&#39;t anything special about this Thai food so I&#39;m not sure why I would pay 30% more than usual when they messed up my order and didn&#39;t even send a fork. 

All that said, I might order again since the pork belly was so good...we&#39;ll see"

It started with a waiter with a pretty downer attitude, but fine! I can deal with that! When he forgot to bring my drink and brought everyone else&#39;s, I let it go. (Although it would have been nice to offer it for free) When it took another 10 minutes to bring the drink that he originally forgot, I got a little annoyed. Here&#39;s the worst part: my drink was terrible. My friend ordered the same drink 15 minutes later and IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DRINK. I am nearly positive that I got the watery ass dregs of a shaker.

The food is pretty good in SOME cases and pretty awful in others. The people at my table said &#34;flavorless&#34; a lot about their meat. The pad Thai is apparently extremely boring. The drunken noodles were good but nothing special and I will say the seafood soup was very good.
This place was almost empty and dinner took over 2 hours! Not because we were lingering but because we had a completely incompetent waiter. I know that sounds harsh but I&#39;ll leave you with this final anecdote:
We got the bill and my friend noticed her Thai iced tea was very expensive. She ordered a regular by the way, because she is training for a marathon and currently not drinking. The waiter told her it was expensive because of the alcohol in it. She told him she ordered the non alcoholic, was there alcohol in this? And he said...yes. You&#39;re SERVING PEOPLE ALCOHOL WITHOUT THEM KNOWING?! That&#39;s a lawsuit waiting to happen. We should&#39;ve asked for the manager to be honest, but we were too busy laughing so hard we were crying. It felt like we were being punked the service was so bad.
This place is destined to fail unless they hire some new waiters.
And a little tip, if you&#39;re pregnant or a recovering alcoholic, order a drink at you own risk. You never know what will be in there."

I was so excited to see that farm to table concept directed towards a different style of cuisine. I had high hopes because of the location but it was average. It wasn&#39;t great but it wasn&#39;t bad. 

The atmosphere is different. Very modern. It&#39;s a very pretty place equipped with a full bar and local beers on tap. They also have a cocktail, and wine list. But it did not feel like a Thai restaurant. 

We liked the service. He was friendly, and attentive. Here&#39;s why we didn&#39;t love this place like we hoped. 

The food was average at best. They portions are small, and expensive for how small they are. The food tastes good, but it wasn&#39;t amazing for how high the prices were. We tried the Kobe beef and it was tender but also smothered in too much sauce, and they went overboard with the peppercorns. I don&#39;t mind paying higher prices for really delightful food. But this wasn&#39;t as good as I expected. 

It&#39;s a cool place to try once or twice. Or as a last minute resort. But I wouldn&#39;t keep coming back here. I&#39;ve had amazing Thai food in Denver with more flavor, and more of a kick with half the prices."

Started with the calamari which came in a paper cone, had about 10 pieces in it. The breading was cooked but the slightly thicker pieces were way under cooked. The kho soi (sp?) was over cooked so the noodles were mushy. Had one piece of chicken in it. The massaman curry was okay. The kobe beef cashew dish had about 5 pieces of meat and overall not that flavorful. Had high hopes for this place with all the great reviews but hard to compare to Thai in LA."

The portions are definitely smaller than your usual Thai restaurant. I ordered shrimp Pad Thai which was $13 + $2 extra for 4 shrimp. (Which in the restaurant food cost world is normal) but for a consumer it seems high. The noodles were adequately sauced and the wasn&#39;t overcooked. The peanuts come on the side (so smart nowadays). Usually I order pad Thai, eat half and save the rest for a couple meals, but this time I got about 2 meals out of it. Still worth it. My only complaint was that I ordered medium spice and it was extremely mild- like no spice at all! So next time I&#39;ll order spicy and see if they kick it up!"

However, as someone else mentioned - the portions are small here, and the food is pretty unremarkable. 

I got the drunken noodles, a Thai staple/favorite of mine, and the food was weirdly slopped on the plate so that it was bunched up on one side, and the only bonus was the fresh thai basil leaves on top. Other than that, certainly not worth $15. I&#39;ve had the same quality food for $8 lunch specials that come with an appetizer.

The service was perfectly nice, but I never understood why hip asian fusion restaurants insist n blasting weird club music. Why is good thai food so hard to find in Denver?"

We only eat non GMO foods, which makes eating out difficult.

{Even &#34;The Kitchen,&#34;(which has a great reputation for local and sustainable foods, serves GMO potatoes.}  When my dish came out, with larger chunks of potatoes in it than I expected, I asked our waitress if the potatoes were Russets. (Russets are GMOed potatoes.)  Our waitress brought out a beautiful red potato from the kitchen and explained that since they weren&#39;t able to get fingerlings right now, they had switched to red potatoes.  AWESOME!  There was no irritation from any of the staff at all of our questions about the quality and source of their foods.  Each person- from the person who greeted us at the door, to the manager, to the waitress- was helpful and interested in answering our questions accurately.  
  
As we learned from our waitress, who was perfectly attentive, Aloy means delicious.  Everything we ordered was aloy!!  We used to eat and enjoy Thai food, before we learned about food quality and GMOs.  This is by far the tastiest Thai food we have ever eaten and no GMOs!

My girlfriend and I sat at the bar, where Jordan took great care of us.

This place had some awesome food (we were there during Denver Restaurant Week so we both got their $30 three-course meal). Our appetizers were a pork belly lettuce wrap type of thing and a duck bun. Both were good. For the entree, we split their pineapple fried rice (which was AWESOME and had a beautiful presentation) and the Kobe something or other. (I wouldn&#39;t recommend the Kobe - I wanted something a little more seared on the outside and rare on the middle, this was almost korean style the way it was in broth. It was good though). We had a sticky rice dessert and this brownie dessert of some sort to finish off the night. The brownie dessert was great.

That said, our experience with Jordan was even better than the food. He made some really fantastic drinks and was more than happy to give recommendations. He made a great whiskey drink with 291 Whiskey and infused it with smoke using a smoke gun. It tasted great.

Go check out Aloy Modern Thai and sit at the bar with Jordan. Tell him I sent ya."

Now Adam did mess up on this ginger soda recommendation but he was all about natural, holistic eating which clearly I&#39;m not. I didn&#39;t hold it against him. Only issue is that there&#39;s a great lack of diversity there. It&#39;s just one woman who&#39;s the hostess.

The brownie was below average, but the ice cream was awesome! This is a great place for those who are looking for a more approachable yet high grade Thai cuisine."

Once they got busy, nothing could go right. I&#39;m not sure if there was only 1 waiter for the whole place, but there was only 1 bartender. It took over 20 minutes to get a glass of wine, and when mentioned to the manager he was very lippy, suggesting it didn&#39;t have to take me 20 minutes to drink it. 50 minutes later our food finally came and it was just ok.

Aloy modern Thai was incredible! They have only been open a week however their staff and presentation were high class. Our waiter James was very friendly and helpful. This was my first experience with Thai food and after today will definitely be back. No words can express how awesome the presentation of the food was. It was obvious that the passion for preparing the meal was present. The soup was a perfect mixture of broth and vegetables and had a creamy flavor that had us get a cup to go for tomorrow. The duck was cooked perfectly with a perfect presentation. Lastly our egg custard and sticky rice was just the right consistency and full of flavor in every bite. This is a must to check out if you are downtown.

I was very excited to have a high quality Thai restaurant in the neighborhood . And it does seems to be high quality, maybe too high quality frankly. I know that seems strange to state, but let me elaborate. I ordered the green curry with chicken. I asked if I could get it with tofu and my waitress went to ask but came back with a negative. Okay, so I ordered the dish anyways. Green curry is my default dish when I eat Thai and it&#39;s how I gauge the quality in general. I asked if the dish had vegetables as the menu didn&#39;t state it did. The waitress said yes it did. Well, it had 2 prices of roasted beets and one piece of charred eggplant. Those pieces of vegetables were tasty and well presented. And the Chicken was VERY well prepared and juicy. The green curry sauce itself was nice, thick and well seasoned, though slightly altered from what would normally be expected from a green curry. I didn&#39;t taste any Magrood Thai lime leaves and there wasn&#39;t any basil in the dish. Additionally, the sauce was not Spicy. There was also a small scoop of rice on the plate. 
   The instant my dish arrived I knew I&#39;d leave there hungry having spent $16 for the dish. The waitress was accommodating and got the kitchen to give me some more sauce and another scoop of rice. Still I left hungry. 
   So, I get that they are trying to go for a fine dining experience and I&#39;m no stranger to fine dining in Denver. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work for them.  
   If you go, treat it like you are going to Cho Lon or Linger, and you&#39;ll probably leave full and content with the quality and service. You&#39;ll definitely need a small plate and an entree. And if you get a drink you&#39;ll be looking at around $40 per head or more for a nice non traditional Thai fine dining experience. 
      As for me, when I want Thai, I&#39;ll go to Chada Thai. I can get very good quality there and pay far less and get the choices I want at a Thai restaurant. 
     I suggest that they move towards a more typical Thai restaurant but very high quality. There isn&#39;t an exceptional Thai restaurant in Denver so I suspect they will head in that direction in the future. In doing so, they will capture a much larger audience and acquire busy take out service."

Teriyaki places offered a half clamshell to go container filled about a 1/3 full with rice, vegetables, and about 8-10 ounces of Teriyaki, moist, char-grilled and delicious.  Priced about $6.00.

Chicken Teriyaki is the closest I have found in CO reminiscent of the hole in the wall Teriyaki joints all over Seattle suburbs. 

Chicken Teriyaki is no frills....nicely charbroiled chicken teriyaki with vegetables and rice.  Teriyaki sauce was not overly sweet.  My wife enjoyed the vegetable tempura plate, lightly battered, fresh and hot.

Friendly and prompt service, great value....solid quick Japanese food."

Food: My husband and I always order the Spicy Chicken teriyaki. One of our favorite things about this place was that they had teriyaki sauce bottles at each table. They now charge extra for spicy sauce and teriyaki. The meat is always grilled perfectly and moist. The veggies always taste fresh and the sauce is very flavorful. I would say the spicy sauce is equivalent to Chinese chili paste. The spicy chicken runs around $7.95 and the extra sauce charge is .25-.50. 

Staff: The staff is friendly. Outside of ordering your food from them at the counter you don&#39;t have much interaction with them. 

If you are looking for a nice light meal and like teriyaki chicken I recommend this place. If you go during the school year during lunch time you can expect a longer than usual wait."

The noodles were cooked to perfection, the sauce was not too saucy (that&#39;s good), and the veggies? Well, the veggies were pretty incredible. I will say, however, that the shrimp was pretty skimpy. I think there were around three little pieces of shrimp (with the tail), so I&#39;ll go for the tofu yakisoba. But, still, the food was good overall! I think I&#39;ll try the Salmon Teriyaki and Veggie something rather next time. My sister got the spicy chicken, which came with rice and stir-fry veggies. She seemed to really enjoy that, so if you like spicy and you like chicken, get the spicy chicken.

The service was good. The guy at the front seemed tired and seemed as if he was ready to check out. But, I would be too, if I were him. The man cooking the food, on the other hand, was extremely nice! It didn&#39;t seem as if he spoke much English, but he was very friendly!

It definitely had more of a takeout restaurant feel with some seat yourself tables, but that was exactly what I wanted. They had a broad range of options including both white and dark meat chicken as well as brown rice for extra. I opted for the spicy teriyaki chicken standard with white rice. I was expecting this mass of gooey teriyaki chicken but was happy to discover that they prepared it in the more traditional style with grilling and a light sauce. It wasn&#39;t exactly what I was looking for, but it was fairly good. The chicken was well-cooked and flavorful. The vegetables were fresh. I enjoyed the presentation with the football-shaped rice and a drizzle of teriyaki sauce. The portion size was a bit smaller than what I had expected but more than filling. I could have used some more vegetables, but I had forgotten to ask. It was fairly tasty over all, and I will definitely be coming back in the future."

Do you like dark chicken meat? You&#39;re in good, b/c that&#39;s mostly what they serve here at a super low price. Would you rather eat anything else in this world than dark chicken meat? Then you&#39;re going to have some issues. I got their 1 white chicken meat dish and it was okay, nothing too special and I thought the veggies were weird - well mostly cabbage. Nothing about this place blew me away but nothing was too awful either. I just wouldn&#39;t come back."

It&#39;s cheap, filling, tasty, and pretty healthy for the price. Is it the most stellar cuisine? No, but it doesn&#39;t have to be. It is simple food prepared pretty simply. The standard meat on the menu is dark meat chicken, which I happen to prefer over breast meat, but white meat chicken is available on request for any dish. I really like how they do teriyaki-not too sweet and not swimming in sauce."

The food-  Real Gyoza, with pretty good flavor.  Served piping hot.  The Chicken teriyaki plate was very good.  Fresh vegetables, well cooked rice, and great flavored chicken.  Would come back on tuesday&#39;s for the chicken terriyaki and gyoza lunch special.  On that note, check out the daily lunch specials for your favorite dish.  

The service-  Not overly friendly, but still received a hello and welcome.  Which sometimes you don&#39;t always get these days.  The food was cooked to order in a timely fashion.  So overall, no complaints on my first trip.  

If your looking for some fresh good tasting Japanese style food, this place is for you."

Thankfully we weren&#39;t put off by the small dining area, ancient furniture, and bizarre decorations.

Be prepared to order simply, as the women who takes orders barely speaks English.  We asked about what was in a couple of the dishes and received thoroughly incoherent answers!

At any rate, the simple dishes here are prepared quickly and with just the right amount of seasoning so as not to overpower.

If you need a quick, tasty lunch or even cheap dinner-night spot, give Chicken Teriyaki a try."

My sisters used to go to high school across the street and we would have dinner or late lunch here all the time.  Their prices are really AMAZING!  You can get a hardy portion of food for 6 bucks!  

They have daily specials and are open seven days a week.  This spot is awesome because it is a little hole in the wall, with a cute couple that works there.  I love that you can get a california roll for 2.50, a plate of awesomely cooked and well seasoned food for under 6 bucks, and it comes out in ten minutes. 

I can&#39;t imagine what my life would be like without this place.  This place has been part of me for half of my life... Don&#39;t ever leave chicken terriyaki.. you are part of my SOUL!

Stir fried veggies, the california roll is pretty good, the gyoza is usually awesome, and the service is always friendly and the environment is not stuffy and stank.  A bajillion points from me."

The place is old and dated; However, it was very clean and spotless.  I got the beef bowl.  For $4.50 it was a great price, but the bowl was kind of small.  It had great flavor but was just a little skimpy.  So next time, I might have to get some kind of side or appetizer.  Also, it did not come with any vegetables other than onions.  It really tasted great just wish it was bigger and had vegetables.

I will check it out again. Almost gave this place 3 stars, but for the price I decided to promote my rating to 4 stars."

It was delicious, more food than I could eat and just the way I like it, not drenched in teriyaki.  The rice was perfect!

Came here yesterday on a whim with a friend.  
Beef Teriyaki Plate &amp; Chicken Gyoza Plate = $12.53
Portions were generous.  We both left stuffed.  Sauce was delicious not too salty.  And the rice was perfect.  Would have been satisfied with just a big bowl of that.   The gyoza were packed!  We got them fried, but the filling was so yummy, I will try them steamed next time. 

Bonuses  
*the to ladies running the place were so friendly, bows and all. 
*They have gossip mags, and the daily newspaper available while you wait for your food.  Its a helpful distraction because it smells so Good!
*They have a different lunch special daily for about $5.50.

They also don&#39;t take cards so be prepared to pull cash. Their pricing doesn&#39;t disappoint either, at $2.55 a pupusa you get a bang for your buck.

We should have known better but we only had $13 in cash. That limited us to two Papusas each which sounds fine when you don&#39;t want to order the whole menu.  But we wanted to order the whole menu. Kinda. 

We both ordered the cheese and bean papusa, the hubs got a chichirron and I got a cheese. The cabbage had just the right amount of tang to it and was cool and crisp in comparison to the hot papusa. The salsa had just the perfect heat. 

From the kitchen you can hear her slapping the Papusas together. The masa dough was light and flavorful and like no other papusa I&#39;ve had. Delicious. We will be back with more cash this time!!"

It took awhile to get our order...  Not because the owner and cooker was so busy - but because she was making it fresh from scratch.  I would recommend calling ahead to order for takeout.  We will be back!

When looking at it from the outside it doesn&#39;t pull you inside.  It doesn&#39;t look like much.  Please don&#39;t let that discourage you.

The lady (the only person there I&#39;m guessing family owned) who took our order didn&#39;t speak English very well, and the menu is all in Spanish, which is also a sign it will be good.  We got bean/cheese, pork/cheese Papusas, and the plantains w/ eggs beans and cream it came with corn tortillas. Wow I say! The papusas were so very good and the slaw and salsa it came with is the best I ever had.  Fresh delicious authentic papusas. Oh and the Plaintains I wrapped with the bean and cream in the tortilla and it was a wonderful flavor explosion.  So savory and yet so sweet.  This place is nearly 30 min from our home but we will be back quite often.  We got 4 papusas, the Plaintains dish and 2 cokes for $20.  The service was excellent.

Little Brazil is one of those hole in the wall restaurants with AMAZING food. Minimal seating, no wait staff so you gotta order at the counter and outdated decor that fits the profile of a hole in the wall restaurant. They also have a Brazilian mini-mart attached in the back so you can pick up sweets and packaged items you can prepare at home.

Great service from the moment we walked in. I have never eaten Brazilian food so what i tried was new to me but delicious.

This is a small restaurant with very limited seating, you can either wait for a table to open up or take your food to go. I found the food to have a rather interesting taste. The chicken dish I had was in a yellowish sauce, cant quite put my finger on was it was exactly, but it was good. The rice was good and the dish had some sort of crunchy fried noodle that added a unique layer to the overall look and taste. We also had a deep fried pastry that was filled with ground beef and cheese. The pastry was light and crispy and the insides were perfect. It also was interesting that you could buy a few grocery items here as well as soccer jerseys and bikinis."

We returned yesterday for a second visit, and for the second time both thought the food was delicious, a bit exotic / unusual, and fairly priced. 

My workmate had Brazilian coffee with cream and a guava, banana and cinnamon appetizer pastry, and said it was good.

I had the meat lover&#39;s starter pastry sampler - three small meat pies, one with beef, one with chicken, and one with beef and cheese. I found them delicious - not much like the English-style meat pies I grew up on and still enjoy. 

I also had a half plate of mushroom stroganoff, with shoestring fries and a small helping of white rice. The sauce on the stroganoff was intriguing, with spices I was unfamiliar with and a tangy sweetness that I assume came from a bit of guava or perhaps papaya. 

The shelves are lined with imported Brazilian groceries, coffee and sweets that you don&#39;t see at your local grocery store. I found it entertaining to try to read what the products were with my out-of-practice Spanish and my long-forgotten, never expert Portuguese.

If you&#39;re looking for a quick, different, not too expensive place for a unique and flavorful lunch, give Little Brazil a try."

I haven&#39;t had Brazilian food since, well, since I was in Brazil many years ago. The owner very nicely and patiently explained the different offerings. 

Today we settled on the shredded chicken croquettes, cheese and heart of Palm &#34;empanada,&#34; mixed meat empanadas, fried plantains, chocolate truffle, passion fruit mousse and guava juice. 

We all agreed the chicken empanada was the star of the day. Followed by the meat and cheese empanadas then passion fruit mousse. The empanadas had thin yet crispy dough. None of the fried items were greasy. 

My mom really enjoyed the passion fruit mousse which I had to agree was perfectly tart. It was a huge portion and enough for three of us to share and a little to take home for my dad."

Well, guess what? A while back they moved into a larger and even better spot in Wheat Ridge, renaming themselves Little Brazil in the process.

As you enter, you&#39;ll notice that their selection of grocery items is much the same as you remember, if not a bit wider than before. Frozen cheese buns (Pão de Queijo)? Check. Redcurrant (Groselha) syrup? Mm-hm. Cassava flour (Farofa)? Well, of course. Cashew-apple (Caju) juice - you didn&#39;t know the nut had a fruit on the end of it, did you? Yes indeed. And there are even quite a few types of everyone&#39;s favorite herbal soda, Guaraná. But as was the case at the old location, the best part of the shop is still the (now thankfully a bit bigger) cafe where you can dive deep into many of the wonderful dishes that emanate from South America&#39;s largest country. Doesn&#39;t that sound like fun? 

There are over a dozen types of turnovers (Pasteis), with fillings both savory (like chicken and unctuous Catupiry cheese) and sweet (the guava/cream cheese combo sometimes dubbed &#34;Romeo &amp; Juliet&#34;). Another great starter, the beef croquette with a bulghur crust (Kibe) does indeed reflect Brazil&#39;s Middle Eastern influence. Speaking of cross-country fusion, why not proceed by trying Little Brazil&#39;s version of Stroganoff (either chicken or mushroom) with hints of ketchup and mustard, and topped with shoestring potatoes? Of course, the black bean and pork stew (Feijoada)&#39;s a popular fave too.  Cap things with a tropical juice (Açai? Cupuaçu? Acerola?) and the flan-like Pudim de Leite, and you&#39;ve got a winning meal."

3 star food, 5 star service.

The food: We had a Groupon so we ended up tasting the beef and cheese pastry, chicken stroganoff, and both the coconut truffle and the chocolate truffle. I really felt like the pastry was pretty gross. I only ate half and I am someone who generally wipes my plates clean. I was pretty happy with the chicken stroganoff and thought the sauce made the whole dish... But overall nothing to write home about. The truffles were outstanding!

The service: super nice young gentleman at the front. He was very patient and answered all of our questions. He was super friendly and charming and I was very impressed with him. 

Overall it was a very good experience here but I don&#39;t know whether it is worth the drive... Maybe I&#39;ll give something else on the menu a shot."

A lot of the savory items we had were similar pastries that were very well done. It was kind of like having dim sum, a little bit of this and a little bit of that. We also had a half order of Stroganofe De Frango: chicken cutlets in a creamy sauce over rice and string potato chips.

I am unfamiliar with Brazilian food, so we had the person at the cash register order for us. So many unique flavors. The black bean stew was my favorite, although I did need instructions on how to eat it (you put a little of the stew on the rice and place a couple spices on top.)

I have to note this is really a place for yoy if you are a soccer fan. Brazilian soccer flags, jerseys, etc., throughout the store. Soccer on TV.  And the owner knows the sport.

My $20 voucher went a long way -- in fact, I was a little worried when I saw how inexpensive their pricing was but the owner offered to let me include a bag of frozen pao de queijo (cheese bread) along with my prepared foods so I was set.

The staff (and in fact, other customers) were really friendly and helpful when I walked-in and told them that I knew nothing about Brazilian food.  They took time to explain each of the entrees and asked me questions about the sorts of things I liked to make suggestions for things I should try.

I decided to get half-orders of a couple of things for variety -- the feijoada (black bean stew) and stroganofe de champion (mushroom stroganoff).  Both are served with rice.  The feijoada also comes with collard greens, a toasted root (yucca? cassava?  the owner told me but I forget) flour, and orange slices; the stroganoff was topped with crunchy potato strings.  The owner explained that Brazilians really like textural contrasts, and I have to say that the potato strings did improve my opinion of stroganoff  greatly.  Both dishes were delicious, and the two half-orders were plenty for a meal and left-overs for the next day.

They also have a slew of &#34;snacks&#34; -- pastries, hand pies, croquettes -- with both savory and sweet fillings.  I tried a heart of palm empadinha, which was boldly-flavored goodness in a flaky crust.  I was recently lamenting that I didn&#39;t know where to find savory pastries like this, so I am looking forward to working my way through this snack menu."

The service was incredible and the food was out of this world! I got the top sirloin and the flavor was rich and delicious. The empanadas were perfect and they accommodated us really well (we showed up with a birthday party of 10). The staff was really nice and on top of it. I have been to South America many times and this is the best cuisine I&#39;ve had from there in this area. A must eat if you want the full experience and taste.

Superb food, exceptional service, and extraordinarily friendly folks! It is obvious everyone there is passionate about what they do, and it shows.

We walked in yesterday with a Groupon for a three course lunch, completely unfamiliar with the restaurant/cuisine. They educated us in a way that made us regret we couldn&#39;t order the entire menu.

My husband ordered a half Feijoada and I had a half Strogonofe de Frango. Both were very good, although we loved the Feijoada best. Both superb dishes and very filling.

We also had a Ground Beef and Cheese, and Chicken Catupiry empanadas. Delish!

The lunch was finished with complementary espresso and our choice of truffles. We had the Brigadeiros and Beijinho de Coco. Heavenly.

When an employee leaves, the owner(?) bakes a cake of their choice. That day, the owner&#39;s sister was preparing to leave to return to Brazil. We were very generously offered a complementary piece of the cake. Very delicious!

We will be back, and we will be bringing friends."

They&#39;ve also got a few shelves stocked with little Brazilian goodies, biscuits, cookies, candies, and dry mixes and canned goods, too.  A little overpriced, but since Denver is pretty far from Brazil, you&#39;d expect a premium on some of these hard-to-find items.

The staff is quite friendly, and alerted us to an upcoming living social or amazon local deal.  So... Cool!

One of the big hits were the Bem Casados made by Little Brazil.  These were beautifully done and looked great in the gold wrapping with red ribbon.

When we walked in, he clearly saw us but he completely ignored us and  he just continued chatting with one of the employees like we weren&#39;t even there. After a little while he looked at us like we were disrupting him but  oh well, he was going to do us  a favor by taking our order.  I spent a few years in Brazil so I am pretty familiarized with the food but my friends, who I brought to try this place, weren&#39;t... so naturally they inquired about a few of the dishes. The kid was  beyond unfriendly, arrogant and sarcastic when answering.  We were the only ones at the restaurant and yet he seemed so impatient and rude that everybody in my group felt really uncomfortable.  I just don&#39;t get this kind of attitude...we were not there asking for free food, we paid for it. If somebody is so miserable running a place what about leaving it to somebody that actually understands that  businesses remain  open because of its customers? It always baffles me.

So I know good feijoada. This place has some pretty darn good feijoada. It comes with all the traditional trimmings. Greens, farofa and orange slices. I think there could be a Brazilian vinaigrette. It&#39;s kind of like pico de gallo. That term is a little more recognizable around these parts. It could be a little meatier too. I still love it. I tried the chicken stroganoff. Another Brazilian staple. I always wondered why a Russian dish is always on the menu at Brazilian restaurants., but I digress. It was great. It was creamy and full of flavor. The fried potatoes with it are good as well. I had to add a bit of salt to each. I like the feijoada with meleguta chiles. The empanadas are a real treat. The beef one was good. The banana and nutella was out of this world. This place also has Brazilian grocery items. A nice bonus. Try the Guarana soda. It&#39;s a nice change of pace. Great place.

The people working there are a mix of Brazilian and American and have been friendly and helpful when I&#39;ve been there.  Also, there is an interesting selection of groceries from Brazil available there as well.

My family and I dined here this evening. My husband has come here ever since they opened and I&#39;ve been dining here for over six years. 

My two children, ages four and two, and both of whom have special needs, ate passionately (the food is yummy!). They left quite the mess, which I cleaned up from the table, seats, and floor. I didn&#39;t get all of it, but most of it. 

We were the last family to leave. As we made our way to the door, one employee stood at our table and screamed, &#34;Jasmine, what is this? No seriously, what is this? F*cking retards.&#34;

I promptly called the manager on duty, who was on a cell phone and initially tried to avoid my call, and I told him the situation and said I would not be back. His response?&#34; Oh, well, yeah, I apologize.&#34; And he hung up. 

Maybe I&#39;m sensitive to the use of &#34;retard,&#34; but in this day in age, I find it as offensive as the &#34;N word&#34; or something equally derogatory. This is completely unacceptable. There is no excuse, ever, for complaining about a customer in front of the customer, using foul language, and/or using slurs. There is also no excuse for the lack of professionalism from the manager and a lack of empathy so thick it could sauce one of their noodle bowls. 

The food? It&#39;s great, but only if you like it served with a side of shame and douchebaggery.

**UPDATE**

Apparently, the owner/manager on duty didn&#39;t hang up on me. The pause in his speech and the disconnect led me to believe such. He was under the impression that I hung up on him, which isn&#39;t the case. Obviously, since he was on the business phone, it was an issue with my cell phone provider. 

I am in communication with the owners and and I am working with them to rectify this situation. I am a strong believer in forgiveness and working through tough issues. I am thrilled the owners are in touch and willing to be transparent and genuine. It&#39;s not just for show, it&#39;s not just for business. They genuinely care and understand based upon their personal experience. This is the greatest teaching opportunity I could ask for for my children. When we make a mistake, we own it, apologize, and we do better. It&#39;s not the mistake that&#39;s important, but how we address it and the action we take after. And Fire Bowl Cafe is walking the walk here, and that&#39;s exceptionally rare these days. 

In the current state of our country (Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, the numerous shootings, etc.), we keep saying that we need to slow down, talk through it, and make change. If we don&#39;t start at home, and with local businesses, we will never fix these societal issues. Did Fire Bowl staff screw up? Yeah, they did. But it&#39;s what John and BrandyJo have done and said since, especially with John sharing his own torment of being called the &#34;R Word,&#34; that makes this story one worth telling. I ask that all of you to update your shares and to soften your hearts and do the right thing by helping make positive change in our community by supporting this family and this business."

The Deal

Setup sort of like a Noodles and things.  You get to select proteins and a veggie mix and some kind of item.  On the most recent visit I did something spicy (maybe the namesake, fire bowl?)  What did I get? eh blandness.

My wife got a pad thai, and it was decent enough pad thai.  

We both, for a couple bucks, added on a side. I got a soup, she got spring rolls. The spring rolls were fried.    The spring rolls were the tasty thing we got, but everything tastes good fried.

The hot and sour soup seemed to represent the entire experience. It tasted over salted. . as if it came right from a bag of soup  - manufactured somewhere in Mexico.

The location - 

The location is nice, with mountain views overlooking wal-mart and mountains. That does sound horrible I suppose - but its not bad.

Well worth the trip."

This might be described as a slightly less fancy version of Pei-Wei.  For my starter, I went with the SPICY COCONUT soup (Chicken, rice, shiitake mushrooms, lemongrass, cilantro, snap peas, coconut milk, lime).  This soup was not good at all.  It was watery and lacking in any any real flavor.  The absence of any sour component really was noticeable.  I am not sure if this is how they normally serve it, or it was just a bad batch.  Had it been my only food item, I would have sent it back, but seeing as how I had also ordered noodles, I let it slide.

I tried the FIRE NOODLES (Flat rice chow fun, green onions, bell peppers, shiitake mushroom, snap peas, Thai basil, cilantro, jalapenos, tomato).  I thought they were rather good.  They had decent flavor and heat, and the portion was large enough for a second meal.  Sadly, after boxing up my leftovers, I proceeded to leave them on the table, only remembering them after I was miles down the road.  I really hate it when I do this.  The noodles were good enough that they redeemed the meal which the coconut soup had threatened to ruin.

One final note, I found the reconstituted shitake mushrooms in both dishes to be quite chewy, almost rubbery."

It claims to be an &#34;Asian&#34; cafe but everything tastes about as &#34;Asian&#34; as Panda. The setup is more like Pei Wei: a small and supposedly diverse menu where you pick a generic flavor and protein but the actual food tastes more like what you would get from Panda. The hot and sour soup has all the right ingredients but the predominant flavor is soy sauce. The &#34;spicy basil fried rice&#34; came out wet (yes, the rice was wet), with only a couple strands of basil (mostly cilantro), and most of the heat came from red pepper flakes. I suppose there were some &#34;Asian&#34; ingredients (like bean sprouts) but throwing cilantro and peanuts into a bowl of rice doesn&#39;t make it taste Thai (which is presumably what they were going for) and the dish was neither spicy, basil, nor fried.

The outside patio is nice and turned out to be the best place to sit because the moment I walked in I was greeted with the smell of sewage. One hopes this place doesn&#39;t always smell like this but my first thought was &#34;I hope that&#39;s not the food&#34; and I had to get past that smell to go to the counter. If there hadn&#39;t been a patio I wouldn&#39;t have stayed. Now that I did, I&#39;m not entirely happy that I did.

I couldn&#39;t quite finish my meal, although I can&#39;t tell if it was because of the portion size (which was pretty generous) or because I just didn&#39;t want to since the food was pretty uninteresting."

This kind of reminds me of a Tokyo Joe type place.  They offer Chinese and Thai and also offer a create your own option where you can mix and match starches, proteins, and sauces.  I had some sot of Chicken and Peanut concoction with noodles, Sam had the Sesame Chicken and we shared the Crab cheese wontons.

Their pad thai is so unique and delicious.  I change it up, though.  It normally comes with eggs, bean sprouts, green onions, yellow onions, peanuts, lime, meat of your choice and flat noodles.  I almost always take out the bean sprouts and yellow onions. What&#39;s great is that I can substitute with other veggies.  TRY IT WITH THE ZUCCHINI! Oh I love zucchini, and it tastes great in this.  Their sauce is mouth-watering, deliciously aromatic, and very tasty.  

I always add two crab cheese wontons with it as a side, and they&#39;re always a nice golden-brown, delicious, and packed with filling.  Their sweet and sour sauce is a bit thick for me, but it TASTES great.  And so I just put less on it and go with the flow.  

The best part about this place is the service.  There is this young (maybe early 20&#39;s?) african-american girl who almost always is the one to take my order.  She is sweet, upbeat (and not in an annoying way), and has a great service-oriented personality.  She is respectful and attentive, and overall a great person to be my first contact in the restuarant.  They take your food to your table, and always with a smile.

I like the Vietnamese vermicelli noodles - quite tasty, if slightly under-flavored, but the selection of sauces they have out are very complimentary. I&#39;ve sampled a few of the other noodle and rice bowls and they&#39;re pretty consistently good, though they all need a smidge more seasoning.

beef something with rice, taste really really really salty with 5 slice of the beef ( we all tried) and yes it&#39;s salty , she return it to the mean manager on duty, he is so ANGRY and said &#34;if its not good don&#39;t eat it&#34;

well she give us try the beef marinated in salt, (because she thinks maybe her mouth and taste is off) but we all tried and yes it is VERY salty. it&#39;s only 2 more piece left but it&#39;s not because she enjoys it.
and then they make a new one with sauce on the side ??????? and delivered to our table with attitude thanks dud makes your food more appealing. for $ 11 beef marinated in salt not worth it maybe we can give you $10 tips if you just don&#39;t say anything and at maybe you can try a fake smile is even better then angry face.

Well, what with my capsaicin addiction, my order was placed.  Flat rice noodles, bean sprouts, onions, green onions, carrots, chicken, and some pineapple.  And pretty spicy.  Lots of pepper flakes in a light tomato sauce, which was enough to coat the dish with some heat and allow the taste of the food to blend in.  Fresh veggies, and I was impressed with the tenderness of the chicken. 

Not much else to say about it, it is a nice change from Tokyo Joe&#39;s, I think it&#39;s worth trying out.  I generally don&#39;t have fast-type food unless it&#39;s a work freebie, but I will look forward to it next time it&#39;s provided!

I ordered General Tsos dish, and all it was was broccoli, dry chicken and noodles. For $10. Just was a little letdown. The last reason I&#39;m not happy today is the service. I always feel that if I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing or ordering or what I like to eat, I&#39;m wrong and don&#39;t belong. When I ask an opinion of something at the register, I get, &#34;it depends on what you like.&#34; I know it does, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking someone else&#39;s opinion because I don&#39;t know what I will like. Missed a great opportunity to convey trust and make me feel happy with my meal. Kind of bummed today. At least I got the view!"

First time in, I was envisioning a chef in the middle of the room with Benihana style grills all around waiting for my bowl of special-made deliciousness. But alas, I gave my order to the girl at the register and could only look back at the steam and frying going on in the back kitchen. 

I had the coconut curry with chow fun noodles. There wasn&#39;t a ton of taste to it, but that was easily rectified with all the hot sauce options available (e.g. Chinese-style hot mustard, Thai sweet-chili sauce, etc.). I would probably try the Korean style Bulogi next time around as one of my friends had this dish and really liked it. 

Altogether, not bad for a quick place to get your Asian food fix on a lunch break in the DTC-ish area."

I live in Westminster so let&#39;s just say I wouldn&#39;t come all the way out here if I didn&#39;t enjoy this place. This visit was very unpleasant. So unpleasant that I made a Yelp account just to write about it. My friend and I ordered a couple of things to try them out but when the manager brought out the food he announced how he couldn&#39;t believe how much food we ordered. Shouldn&#39;t you be happy that two people spent $28 instead of embarrassing us for getting a lot. The food was sub par. Pretty greasy which has never happened here before. Maybe I just lost my appetite because I had front row seats to the manager behind the line using his bare hands to stuff his face. Cleanliness is a must for me and it&#39;s suppose to be a plus that I can see what you&#39;re doing behind the line not a hindrance. Sorry we will not be back.

It&#39;s about a mile uphill from Wal-Mart and I was standing in front of Wal-Mart looking up at the colored faraway blur of a sign. I thought it was a red-and-green Baja Fresh sign. I decided to go there to see if I could really make out a Baja Fresh sign from that distance. But I digress. This place is located waay up a hill in a strip mall whose major tenant is a pet-supply supermart; in other words, unless you&#39;re looking for toys for Fido, you drive up the hill by accident, or you search on Yelp, you&#39;ll never find it.  

It&#39;s an Asian-fusion semi-fast food semi-Mongolian grill type of place.  They have two menus, first is the grill menu, you pick a) protein, b) stir-fry veggie selection, and c) sauce selection. For me this was chicken, &#34;subgum&#34; vegetables, spicy peanut sauce, hot/sour soup. Wife ordered her comfort food -- pad thai with shrimp -- and spicy coconut soup.  We paid, were given a little number placard to put on the table, we went to the drinks dispenser. Within moments all our food came. Soup &#34;cups&#34; were huge and flavorful. I typically order hot/sour soup at almost every Asian restaurant I encounter; this was among the best. Likewise my grilled chicken and her pad thai were first rate, did I mention all the dishes are under $10? There are many decent restaurants in the South Denver area but you won&#39;t beat Fire Bowl for value.

It&#39;s next door to Kinko&#39;s, so be sure and glom on to the free wifi."

A quick bite for lunch
Sesame Chicken for Me
WTF Pineapple?

A-OK is a good description of this place. Everything is right in line with the American staple that is mediocre work day lunch. I have eaten here a few times. The biggest reason is because its 2 blocks from work. Not because its good. It says a lot when convenience outranks quality. 

Fire Bowl gets rather busy during the lunch hour. The restaurant is cramped and gets quiet loud. You basically mosey up to the counter, they give you a # and you sit and wait. Its like the Chipotle of the orient. 

To put it into context if Fire Bowl was sitting next to a Pei Wei and a Panda Express, it would be my third choice for lunch. 

Do yourself a favor, save 10 bucks, bring your lunch and than go to a nice dinner on the weekend."

I&#39;d go the create your own stir-fry route. You pick your choice of protein, veggies, sauce and noodle or rice. 

For the vegetarians and vegans: There are a couple of vegetarian sauces like the teryaki, kung pao and peanut. Plus there&#39;s tofu(fried or sauteed) and most of the noodles do not have egg in them.

I had the Kung Pao chicken. I should&#39;ve paid attention that it was stir fry, but I was all flustered over the line and people waiting behind me.

I was expecting something a little bit different. The garden veggies were great, the &#34;medium&#34; sauce has my mouth on fire 15 minutes after I finished eating, and I dig spicy but not like that. Fried rice didn&#39;t taste or look like fried rice, kinda mushy... With that said the hubby cleaned his bowl and loved the Pad Thai.

Mr.social frequents this place for their pineapple fried rice. He says it has a level of simplicity and flavor compared to peiwei. I think its just because there&#39;s not as much crowd here during weekday lunch times compared to other nearby eateries. But for me, peiwei is still waay better."

I thought I would give Fire Bowl Cafe a try.  Ordered the sweet and sour chicken and two egg rolls to share with my 10 year old.  We are used to getting an order of S/S chicken that has a serving size that is more than enough for the two of us to share.  What we received from Fire Bowl Cafe was a good size for one person, but a bit less than we are used to for the price.  Also, while the chicken was good, the pieces were very small and therefore more crisp than moist.  The service was fast and friendly, with the slight exception of the manager that was working the register and seemed a bit annoyed that it was our first time there and we were unfamiliar with the &#34;correct/quick way to order&#34;.

I on the other had LOVE hot food and every time I have been it&#39;s never hot enough so I requested 4xs spicy on top of the already 2xs the item I ordered was.  We took the food to go and when we got home everything looked great.  My food was good, though still not as spicy as I expected, however the BF&#39;s food was so spicy he couldn&#39;t even eat more than several bites of it.

It&#39;s absolutely delicious every time, consistent, fast, flavorful and affordable. The atmosphere is comfy casual, with lots of seating (that&#39;s always close to full at lunch time - that tells you something!).  As a vegetarian, I love all of the delicious vegetarian options - which are all clearly marked with a little leaf on their menu board. They&#39;ll even make a few of the non-veggie items, like sesame chicken, which have vegetarian sauces, with tofu for more veg varieties. Everything I have ever had there is absolutely delish - and that&#39;s quite an informed opinion as my husband, friends and I have been there probably 40+ times. Their soft thai summer rolls are filling and addictive - that spicy peanut sauce is amazing. They have incredible veggie egg rolls - better than most restaurants I&#39;ve been to. Their edamame comes in a huge portion for a low price, and it&#39;s fresh, hot and so tasty. I&#39;ve had every veggie item on the menu and they are all incredible; from the Stirfry with tofu and either teriyaki, spicy peanut sauces, to the pineapple fried rice, huge salads, sesame tofu, veggie fried rice, wok toss lomein, fire noodles and soup. My non-veg hubbies loves everything he&#39;s ever had too, from the pad thai to the coconut soup and incredible pot stickers. The portions are huge and an amazing value. The food is served up fast, and fresh - all cooked to order, and is consistently delectable. The drink selection is great - gold peak teas are delicious.

If you go out frequently you&#39;ll notice certain trends that every new restaurant seems obliged to have on the menu. They&#39;re trying to be so different, so cutting edge that they are the same as the other new farm-to-table restaurant that opened the same month. One consistent aspect is they are all expensive, and trying very hard. That said, we don&#39;t often visit any given restaurant twice in a 6-month period. Too much to try, so little time. But when you need a change, a visit back home (wherever that may be), Interstate is that home base. First, their menu seems to have something for everyone. Nothing chichi. There&#39;s comfort food like mac-n-cheese and deviled eggs. But they always put their spin on the dish, which never disappoints. And the prices are...reasonable! Well-crafted cocktails are $7-9---all the time. I love them for that, because they don&#39;t have to do that. The staff seems to enjoy working there. The hostess was friendly and efficient, the bartender knowledgeable and helpful, the server was spot on all night. Six of us had the cobb salad, the cubano sandwich, seared ribeye, the chicken fried and the street tacos (pork). Raves all around. For dessert, the peanut butter, fudge brownie, orange zucchini cake and the caramel pots de creme. We left nothing on these plates. Did I mention that finding parking on this stretch of Santa Fe is easier than parking in RiNo, LoHi and Cherry Creek?

The boyfriend was craving it last night and got the cubano with the beans and rice on the side. His one friend got the same thing and the other got the cubano with fries instead. The two who had the beans and rice have been violently ill today. My boyfriend can&#39;t stop throwing up and other food borne illness nastiness. 

I called to let the restaurant know and the guy who picked up the phone didn&#39;t seem to care and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re probably not going to do anything about it. 

So if you eat here, beware of the beans and rice."

The food...hmm...it&#39;s made to look impressive for one&#39;s social media photos.  If the food were people then I would call them &#34;posers&#34;.  It looks awesome but the taste was just eh.  

Did taste better than McDonald&#39;s, yes.  Did the food look more appealing than McDonald&#39;s, yes.  But, I will give McDonald&#39;s credit for getting the right balance of bread to meat ratio.  I bring this up because Interstate Kitchen and Bar has made the huge mistake of jacking up the simple grilled cheese.  Mistake being the use of a bread that is sliced too thick, with a crust that is too hard, and then barely any cheese.  My friend described it perfectly...it was a brick with a hint of cheese.  Trying to eat a brick is not  in the category of comfortable let alone being a comfort food.

I would suggest that a decision maker at Interstate Kitchen and Bar take a little field trip over to Stueben&#39;s.  Get the grilled cheese.  And allow her or his tastebuds the sensation of tasting the characters of a yummy cheese with a hint of butter.  And just enough bread to know its a grilled sandwich.  Bread that strong enough to hold some cheese, onions, tomatoes (sometimes avocado if I am feeling a lil saucy that day).  Perfect Landing also has a tasty grilled cheese.

Interstate...don&#39;t feel like your alone in this grilled cheese blunder.  Fado&#39;s Irish pub jacks up their grilled cheeses too.  At least Interstate&#39;s grilled cheese is closer to being a fair price.

And I do apologize for only giving 2 stars.  I&#39;ve been at Interstate 3 other times and have felt the same way each time as far as the food."

The happy hour is pretty bad, and that sets a poor tone. It includes only a few limited drink and snack specials, although beer prices otherwise are not bad. (I think Avery IPA is $4).

Dinner is okay, but the menu is pretty small and there&#39;s not a lot of veggie options, which is also true for brunch. It&#39;s an okay place to visit once, but I live close by and am almost never inspired to come here.

Ordered the rib eye steak ($20), braised pork tacos ($15), burger with grilled onions and shrooms ($12) and mac &amp; cheese ($7). 

A lot of gristle on the steak, house made steak sauce was okay. The pork tacos were flavorful, but nothing spectacular. The side of rice was no bueno-took one bite and did not finish. Burger was on the dry side and lacked flavor. Mac and cheese was the star of the meal, as it was buttery and delicious. Extra toppings were, however, an additional cost and was not worth it considering the minuscule amount present in the dish. 

Waitress was friendly and helpful with recommendations. Food was mediocre, too expensive for what it was. Probably would not come back."

I got basically a breakfast cobb salad. Whoa. Most delicious roasted chicken thighs of my life. I wish I knew their secret. None of that weird chicken flavor that can show up! Only yummy smoky roasty flavor.
Also the pulled pork corn cake? To die for!

Bloody Mary&#39;s were fairly reasonably priced and the patio was dog friendly as long as she stayed outside the little fence!"

I remember Halloween and NYE thats it. I was introduced to Interstate by a Yelper who&#39;s now a dear friend. So this is a sorta special place.

I most recently snacked here while waiting to usher 2016 in. Their fries are brown, crunchy and salty. They have chicken liver here! OMG! I was told their Mac n Cheese is one of the best. Next time! 

Now the drinks! I&#39;ve done my fair share here. Cheap! The cheaper the drinks the merrier is the atmosphere. That&#39;s my boozy opinion. &#34;Hic&#34; :)

So there&#39;s the restaurant section and the bar area to your left as you walk in. I gotta try the restaurant side one day.

I work nearby, so some coworkers and I decided to stop in last night for an after-work drink(s) and I was really impressed. The layout is great, sort of divided in half so that the bar side can get a bit rowdy without disrupting the dinner crowd. It also opens up into a small patio outside, which makes this a perfect spot now that the weather is getting good again.

The service is what really made this place stand out. We started at the bar, and ended up moving to a picnic table outside, but the bartender continued to serve us and check on us regularly. Usually out of sight, out of mind to busy bartenders, but he went the extra mile and seemed to know just when to check on us and when our drinks would be low.

We will definitely be back, this was a fantastic after work treat. Plus, the deviled eggs!"

I really enjoy a different salad and the Chilled Broccoli, Green Bean and Cucumber Salad with Candied Almonds was unique and pleasing with just a little criticism.  The green beans would have been better if they were blanched as the cauliflower was.  Also the arugula was not dressed, it was treated almost as a garnish.  Really enjoyed the currents but the broccolini was too tough to cut easily and too big to chew.  I&#39;m a huge fan of red onion!  Unfortunately, though cucumber is listed on the menu, it did not make an appearance today.  I&#39;m not positive about the dressing, it may have been an avocado green goddess.

While the dumplings were divine, the Vegetable &amp; Dumplings soup was pretty disappointing.  It was spicy, but did not have enough salt.  There was a lot of pepper and the shredded greens were hard to eat with a soup spoon.  I love the idea of fresh radish slices, they sure did look pretty, but they had little flavor and barely added a crunch.  I like me some spicy radishes!

We really liked the decor, with matching holiday accents in turquoise and red!"

Interstate Kitchen is definitely a diner type place - so don&#39;t expect anything fancy. The night we came (which was around Halloween) one of the waitresses was on roller skates - props to her! It has a very 50s diner feel and makes you feel like you&#39;ve stepped back in time.

The food was great - everything is deep fried and delicious! This is not the place to go if you&#39;re looking for something healthy. We ordered a few appetizers and shared some main dishes and the boys had some drinks. Everything tasted great!

I had the BLT! Gi-FREAKIN&#39;-Normous! I only had a few bites at the restaurant. Then later I had the rest of the 1st half sandwich. I never even got to the 2nd piece. Ended up using all that delicious bacon in some homemade Sloppy Joe! Yes, I always re-purpose leftover restaurant food, LOL! 

I also had a hard lemonade. I think it was Huckleberry Lemonade??? Anyway, it was good. Small but tasty and I got a teeny buzz before my food got there so liquor portion was good.

My daughter had the Cobb Salad. Very different looking. She enjoyed every bite, except the fried, yokey egg (the taste of eggs nauseates her) so I took it home for the doggies...yes, more re-purposing!

We started by sharing their Mac and cheese and wow!  Their Mac and cheese made me think for a moment or two that perhaps I had never experienced the essence of Mac and cheese before.  It was amazing!

In an attempt to be reasonably healthy I had the Cobb Salad.  It was a fully meal unto itself.  And not a small meal!  

I also had the 1/2 grilled cheese because well I was having a salad for dinner.  It was not a bad grilled cheese, but due to how wonderful their collared greens, Mac and cheese, and Cobb Salad were, it just did not shine.  

As everyone ordered a different meal and everything looked great (I don&#39;t care to share food, it is a nasty habit that robs me of the food I wanted and exposes me to potential germs I would prefer not to be exposed to) and the portions were generous, I plan on returning and working my way through their menu, one glorious meal at a time."

We ordered wine and were given each others, nothing several taste testings didn&#39;t sort out. 
I ordered the deviled eggs which were super delicious. My girlfriends ordered dinner salads and said they were good.
I ordered the salmon which was good. The sort of stuffing side came out frozen in the middle and super hot on the outside, much like a convenience store burrito. It was reheated and really did have great flavor.
One of my girlfriends got the mac and cheese which I tried and would definitely recommend, it  was so good!
We got the peanut butter fudge brownie and the zucchini cake. Both were delicious and actually nice to have pitted against each other as the zucchini cake was simple and light tasting, while predictably the brownie was very rich.

To management: Please have your employees put on a happy face and properly greet the paying customer instead of a double look and scowl.

If the restaurant is well run and their systems are in place, they will be able to execute.  If the management is weak, Sunday evenings are when you are going to see things fall apart.

Interstate Kitchen aspires to offer a higher quality experience and prices its entrees accordingly. ( $15 to $20 for an entree.).  We visited this restaurant because Yelp recommended their fried chicken.  After a longish wait, I ordered the fried chicken and asked for mashed potatoes instead of green beans.  The inexperienced waitress came back ten minutes later and informed me that they could substitute the mashed potatoes for potato salad.  When the entree was finally served, the potato salad consisted of lettuce topped by French fries and a country gravy.  It was absolutely gross and had to be a fail by an inexperienced cook.  No real chef would make something so bad.

To add insult to injury, the overburdened waitress brought me breaded flank steak instead of chicken.  When I pointed out her mistake, she went on to argue that I had ordered the flank steak.  Skilled waiters know better than to argue with a customer.  Skilled waiters do not need to be right.  They understand the importance of keeping an unhappy customer happy.  A skilled waiter must at times be a diplomat.

The Insterstate Kitchen may be better managed on other days of the week but this Sunday, the inexperience of its second tier cooks and wait staff was on exhibition.  Dinner tonight did not feel like a good value proposition."

So given my familiarity with Interstate I decided to bring some friends from out of town. I ordered a burger with no bun under explicit instruction that I was gluten-free and was advise it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Needless to say a mistake was made, the restaurant was busy and my burger emerged from the kitchen with a bun. I informed the runner, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t eat that. I&#39;m gluten-free.&#34; He returned to the kitchen, coming back to the table a minute later with the same burger. Again I told him, &#34;I don&#39;t think you understand. I&#39;m going to have to have that made again. I can&#39;t eat that.&#34; The waitress then came back, the same one I ordered from, saying, &#34;I&#39;m really sorry that I put the order in wrong, but I want to let you know... we have FLOUR ALL OVER OUR KITCHEN.&#34; I was a little floored, and admittedly I&#39;m not exactly patient in these types of situations particularly when expectations are magically changed after a mistake is made. If it were true that they did have FLOUR ALL OVER THE KITCHEN, then this should have been mentioned when I ordered. Like, hey.. I recommend our salads because stuff from the grill can have contamination. Regardless, she eventually did the right thing and took the item off the bill and fixed the burger. I appreciated the gesture but likely will not be back for food, only drinks.

Tl;dr: I&#39;m gluten-free. I mentioned this when I ordered and the waitress acted like it wasn&#39;t a big deal. My food came out wrong, I sent it back, they reserved it to me without actually remaking it. Then the waitress tells me, &#34;we have flour all over our kitchen&#34; as if it were problematic to serve me. She then takes it off the bill but not after my impression of their attitude toward wanting my business is completely and irreparably damaged. I will not return, gluten-free folks be wary."

If thought that you&#39;d be wrong. But when you step inside the restaurant, it does feel like you&#39;re taking a road trip down the interstate. I like all the vintage pieces they have decorated around the restaurant. 

Everything on their menu looks mouth-watering good. I ordered the salmon pot pie, and am still quite bitter about forgetting my box of leftovers at the restaurant. It was delicious, and I really wanted to finish eating every last bite. :( Alas, such is life. I&#39;m excited for my next visit here though!"

The avocado Benedict was average. Service was bad. We had a lady serve us. Granted we came in 30 minutes before they closed brunch but we were hurried out and really not taken care of. We weren&#39;t asked how our food turned out, she came and placed the check in front of us without us saying we were done, they didn&#39;t put mushrooms on the dish and when we told them about it, they gave us mushrooms that tasted like they were from a can.

The place was fairly empty and I think it is because the food may have  taken a big step back.  I have always had great food here last night was not the case.  One of our dishes was pretty much inedible. The french onion soup tasted like it was made last week and gave the person that ate it gut rot. The grilled cheese add on should not be on the menu if you are going to put less effort into it than a hippy in a Grateful Dead concert parking lot.  It literally had a half slice of what looked like american cheese between a really think slice of dried out bread.    The 10 salad was lackluster at best.  The positive was the Cubano sandwich it was pretty tasty and the service was decent too.  I hate writing bad reviews of places I have liked a lot in the past but feel they need to be aware of whats coming out of there kitchen.  Disappointing.

Each time, the food has been fantastic and the service has been great. I&#39;m a big fan of comfort food and this place has it down pat.  In my opinion, the best food in the world is simple and done with excellence. The interesting menu has enough interesting things to try but where it really thrives is in simple comfort food. I love the ambience of Interstate as well. Its retro, funky, and fun. It&#39;s serves as a great date spot or as a fun place to bring your kids.  One of the big things that keeps me coming back is the cheesesteak!! It. Is. Amazing. The bread has a nice chewy crumb and crunchy crust. This Incredible sandwich is also served with au jus and a mountian of fries.  Some other great items we&#39;ve tried are the grilled cheese and tomato soup, burgers, and the Interstate Cobb salad. This is becoming a go to place for date nights with my kids because not only do the kids like it but I do too. Keep up he good work guys!!!!"

They have really awesome happy hour specials and have happy hour twice a day. I only had a few precious moments to go, so I ordered a can o&#39;suds (Old Style for that night), the Lap Dog, and the pulled pork slider. The Lap Dog was my favorite out of those two. I really enjoyed the fresh, juiciness of the bratwurst and the tangy bite of the giardinieira with just the right amount of good brown deli mustard. It did come on a sort of odd crustless, toasted bread that was a bit structural unstable but that just helped motivate me further to not breathe between bites. The pulled pork slider had good pickles and a tasty bun. The pulled pork itself was a bit bland and dry. I didn&#39;t really have a good sense of the seasonings or remember clearly if there was a sauce. Still, more than excellent for $2. My total bill was just a bit over $6, and I was quite satisfied. I had a good experience overall and look forward to coming back for happy hour again."

My boyfriend and I were out on date night and had just grabbed light food at the Truffle Table. Drinks were next! We found a tall table in the back of the bar area perfect for talking and imbibing. 

We both ordered whiskey/vermouth cocktails, the Greenpoint and Vieux Carre, even though the man usually avoids this combo. However, he was pleasantly surprised when he thoroughly enjoyed each drink. The bartender tried to help us solve this mystery and we determined it must be the type of rye whisky (bullet in this case) and proportions. 

Additionally, I ordered a Sazarac. All drinks were boozy but not overwhelming. Very well-balanced and drinkable. Also cheap! You could easily pay $12-$13 elsewhere, but ours were between $8-$9. What can I say? Sometimes I&#39;m a cheap date. This was even cheap enough that I grabbed the bill."

We have spent probably $1000+ here but over the last two years have gone exactly 3 times. Tried it again recently and I have a feeling it will be our last. 
The food is not what it once was; pickles were greasy and too vinegary, and they got rid of the one truly amazing thing on the menu- the fried chicken. There have been a couple true pitfalls with the food; once my chile relleno took over twenty minutes and came out cold with congealed cheese (it was clearly very old) and when asked to have it heated they served the same congealed cheese, warm and weeping grease across the plate. Another time we were there for an event and had the banana pudding, which I almost spit out and contained nothing a traditional banana pudding contains (it had graham cracker crumbs, wtf?). 
The biggest downfall is the service. Service at Interstate was already shaky so we only sat at the bar for most of our visits, and received good service for several years. Most recently, it took 4 minutes to be greeted (by a manager no less), 5 additional minutes to have our order taken (the owner passed us three times and asked another group he knew for their order instead), and 15 minutes to be offered a water refill despite the manager staring directly at my empty glass three separate times (we were not asked if we needed anything in this time). Not so shockingly, it took 1 minute for the manager to grab my credit card when I put it on the bar. 

There was no welcome- we were greeted after 4 minutes with &#34;do you want something right now?&#34;- and no &#34;thanks guys&#34; let alone a goodbye upon leaving. We have been genuine supporters of Joey and Aaron&#39;s efforts both here and at the now defunct Crimson Canary. I genuinely wish them well and hope they can make the small but incredibly necessary changes to reignite their business. Unfortunately until then we will no longer be supporters."

We went Saturday hoping for the dinner menu, but we were locked in to a fairly limited brunch selection. Still, the menu sounded delicious and we started off with a pretty spectacular homemade coffee cake. I was excited to order the pulled pork, fried egg, and corn cake, but no flavors really popped for me and the corn cake was hard and flavorless. My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy, and while the sausage was tasty, the biscuits and gravy were both unremarkable at best. Another friend was really pleased with the avocado Benedict. While we were eating coffee cake, we were already making plans to try again for their dinner, but following the meal I don&#39;t see a compelling reason to try again."

What did I find? There was a rubber band in my burger. I&#39;m not even joking.

Even after that, I wasn&#39;t an asshole about it to my waitress - in fact, I was really nice. You&#39;d think that for a place that prides themselves on their burgers, the staff be horrified. Not so much.

&#34;Oh, sorry. We don&#39;t make our burgers in-house, so.....&#34;

So what? So, fucking, what? So you don&#39;t take responsibility for serving me rubber?

To make up for it, the waitress didn&#39;t charge me for my burger. (They did charge me for my $50+ worth of drinks an apps - if I were the manager I&#39;d have comped the meal.)

Ugh, how wrong my fellow yelpers are on this one. This was a piss-poor experience from beginning to end--service, food, atmosphere, all inexcusably lacking.  I should have known from the moment we walked in (with a reservation!) and the place was virtually empty on a weekend night.  Even with the reservation, they didn&#39;t really know where to seat our larger group, so we stood around for a few minutes while they put a table together.   And then each stage thereafter to the meal, we waited, and waited, and waited.  It was inexplicable, especially given how empty the place was. I won&#39;t go into gory detail about how bad the food is, but suffice to say our table ordered 7 or 8 entrees from the menu (fish, ribs, burgers, macaroni &amp; cheese, sandwiches etc.), and not a single one was passably good.  You&#39;ve never seen so much food left uneaten on so many plates, and yet the server just piled it up and cleared it away without saying a word.

Chicken was done to perfection. The waffle was cold but still fresh. The spicy maple syrup was divine. Perfect combo. The hamburger was typical with nothing standing out but was still an awesome burger. The BLAT was insane! They really know how to carry great plate presentation.

The space has a hip atmosphere, but it didn&#39;t feel pretentious or unwelcoming to an old soul like me. In fact, it was very comfortable for chilling out with a drink talking to friends, even on a Saturday night. Very much liked the couch area for this.

Interstate has a nice list of house drinks that were hit or miss in my experience and with talking to others. The Vieux Carré was absolutely delicious, tasking almost like a Brandy Old Fashion + Manhattan. The Sassafras I found to essentially be bland and bitter soda water, so I would avoid that one. They also have an extensive bourbon listing with some of my favorites, including many Colorado whiskeys. No draft beer and limited can selection, but that&#39;s ok, it&#39;s definitely more of a spirits kind of place.

My gf and I didn&#39;t eat dinner, but we did split a side of onion rings. They were spot on - tasty, crispy, and tore all the way through when you bite into them (the sign of a good onion ring).

Service at the bar was pretty attentive and responsive, including bringing out our onion rings to where we were sitting (there was no waitress service in the couch area). All in all an enjoyable experience. I&#39;d go back simply for the Vieux Carré and onion rings."

Eventually when we did order, we got the deviled eggs, mac and cheese, and I enjoyed the huckleberry lemonade! Now I&#39;m fairly particular when it comes to my deviled eggs and I loved them! My friend thought that they were a little too salty and I don&#39;t think a dash of sugar and paprika would hurt. However....the mac and cheese was a zesty cheesy delight!

The staff is always pretty friendly.

The menu options are interesting but to me not too varied!

I went with the blt salad - omg - what a great take on this! Fried egg on a salad with dark meat chicken and a dressing that was mmm mmmm good!

My co-diners were not too impressed with their veggie burger, nor their forgetting the bacon - yup, he likes bacon on his veggie burger - don&#39;t judge. EVen after the waitress indicated that that was a great way to eat it and she had done the same!

The bar area is about the same size as the dining area, with an outdoor partio.

For us it is definitely an on the way or from something place to dine, not a destination. But it fits the bill and my tummy was full!"

Your visit to our table was very embarrassing. Telling me (an obvious well seasoned dinner in my 50&#39;s) that you prepare your fish medium rare and it will not be hot and to get it hot you would have to cook it all the way through. Which as obviously an incorrect way to eat the fish. I tested my carrots,sauce and other side dishes and they were barely warm. The second meal was delusions, prepared medium rare and hot. We were a group of 5 and my plate had sat waiting for the other food long enough to get cold. Rather than apologizing you corrected me in front of my family and made me feel bad for even suggesting you had made a mistake. You need a hug and some training in customer service. I would come back because the food was good, but you sir were the worst part of our evening. Cold happens - say your sorry and bring them a new meal! Hopefully this will help future customers."

Went with a big group on a Saturday night after biking. They were able to seat us quickly and gracefully did separate checks (so much better for patrons and the staff). I shared a monte cristo and cubano along with chips and fries. 

Oh the taste explosion! I have never had a monte cristo but it is really great. Lots of ham and their mixed berry jam to dip it in was delish - throw in some hot sauce and you have yourself a sandwich. Same for the cubano, lots of meat, a great melding of flavors and the berry jam was so good on that too!

Excellent food, with a friendly corner bar vibe. Thanks to an amazing array of whiskey choices, we started with excellent old fashions, and a wonder choice of a whiskey shot for dessert. But, first, appetizers: deviled eggs and seared pork belly with cauliflower. I wasn&#39;t really sure about the combo of pork belly and cauliflower, but it was simply incredible! The serving was generous, but not overwhelming, just enough to enjoy with our cocktails. The deviled eggs were good, homemade, nothing fancy, but really good. Dinner was a cheesesteak, tasty and tender,  on a fresh toasted roll. The kale and red onion salad was perfect. The lemony dressing and red onions complimented the fresh kale. We had a salted caramel pot de creme for desert. Add to all of this, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and you&#39;ve got a great night out. Can&#39;t wait to go back again!"

i wasn&#39;t very impressed with the food, though. i&#39;m from the south and so that may have been the first issue. the kitchen completely balked on one of my friends&#39; orders and it wasn&#39;t even that busy, so he had to wait while they made his order and we all ate. i had the pork tenderloin and it was ok. the best part about the plate was that the lean loin was accompanied by a slice of fatback. yes, i eat the fat and it was the highlight of the plate by far.

we also ordered the game hen, which was a bit dry (as you would expect from game hen). another ordered the salmon pot pie and she enjoyed it, but nothing spectacular. the fish got a mediocre review as well.

the deviled eggs were something i was excited about and what i had heard was sort of their draw, but was unimpressed because there was very little flavor. the pork belly bacon app was actually the highlight of the meal i would have to say.

on a positive note, get the banana pudding dessert if it stays on the menu. it was spectacular and i would probably go back just for that and a few whiskey drinks.

i think that the kitchen must have had an off night or something, but in all honesty i will probably be trying out some other new places before i would return here. i will say we were a rowdy crowd, but at the same time, that shouldn&#39;t have had any effect on what was coming out of the kitchen."

I didn&#39;t know they were doing Game Show night, and that wound up being a lot of fun. I got to play two rounds of Wheel of Fortune with our host, Dick Guy, who was very entertaining to watch and listen to. 

Because it was Cinco de Mayo, they had tequila and margarita specials. I ordered a margarita with salt. Maybe it was the margarita mix, but I found it to be way too sweet, and the salt was some kind of citrus salt, which I didn&#39;t really like. 

I ordered a bowl of their macaroni and cheese, which was very tasty and a great deal at $6. 

Overall, I like Interstate, and will most likely return, but I was a bit disappointed by the service. There was only one bartender, maybe they were short staffed that night, but there seemed to be a lag between getting to the bar, ordering something, getting it, and finally paying. That aside, it&#39;s definitely worth checking out, especially on a night when they have something fun going on."

Apparently our friends are regulars here and know the staff.  I can see why they&#39;re regulars.  The great drink selections and eclectic menu would make me a regular too if I lived in the area.  

My partner in crime and I decided to try something different so we ordered the spoon bread.  I&#39;d only heard of it once before, but didn&#39;t know anything about it.  To me it seemed like a savory bread pudding.  So of course it was delicious!  I wish we could have tried another item on the menu, but we just weren&#39;t that hungry.  Next time though!

Bonus points for vegetarian options being clearly labeled on the menu. The food was so good.

Plus a huge whiskey and bourbon list and great whiskey cocktails? Swoon.

I was surprised to see complaints about service in other reviews. Our service was unobtrusively perfect. I remember thinking to myself...why can&#39;t every restaurant in Denver get it right like this? Everything was timed perfectly, no waiting around for the check, new cocktails were offered just as we were finishing the first round.

And it was a pretty cheap dinner. He ordered a veggie burger and fries, I ordered the soup and a side of brussels, plus two rounds of drinks, just over $40, $50 with tip.

I went with my hubby and another Yelper and had the cobb salad and pulled pork sandwich, deviled eggs, sassafras, bloddy mary and an old style. Here&#39;s the break down...

Cobb: Not traditional in a good way. Butter lettuce, a beautifully cooked medium egg (no runny white), chicken, crispy, meaty bacon pieces, tomatoes, and a warm bacon dressing. I asked for no blue cheese and the dressing on the side. The dressing was tangy and wonderful, not too heavy as I had feared when I asked them to side it. Absolutely craveworthy.

The pulled pork sammy with O-rings: My lord, if calories didn&#39;t count this is what I might have ordered. The pork was delicious and tender; the bun, squishy and able to sop up the grease and sauce. The onion rings were heavily battered, but not in the way that scrapes the roof of your mouth and pisses you off. Just enough to give it great crunch and flavor. 

Bloody Mary: Bloodies are one of my faves and I take them seriously. This one is fantastic and has a delicious salad. No shrimp, which is my fave, but they do onion, peperoncini, pickled green beans and probably olives.

Sassafras: It&#39;s a yummy root beer concoction that has alcohol. Keep your clothes on. 

Our service was fantastic, but there were only 3 tables. I hope to come back as expeditiously as possibly to try out dinner. This seems like a pretty chill spot!"

We all partook in some exceptional mixed drinks.  They know how to mix their booze.  Always a bonus.  

Menu varies and make sure you listen to the specials since they all sounded divine.  This particular day I decided on the Turkey sandwich, not exciting I know but when the mood strikes you get what your craving.  We also shared an order of Deviled Eggs which were egg-ellent (I could help myself).  I very classic interpretation.

I don&#39;t normally say this but the Turkey Sandwich could have used less turkey.  I swear to you there may have been two pounds of fresh cut turkey on this sandwich, way more than you can fit in your mouth or eat in one sitting.  Here&#39;s a hit Interstate - you could save on food costs if you gave me half the turkey.  Once I removed the excess turkey and sandwich was delicious and fries were on point.  

Another great place for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  They have all the makings of a great local hot spot."

Interstate recently changed their menu and we are sad to say that it&#39;s missing some of our favorites: the Miles Standish sandwich and that big ass salad, which was literally a plate of veggies with pepitas. Both SO GOOD!!

One request for Interstate: consider adding some gluten-free options! Desserts and hamburger buns would be awesome to have as an option for those of us who need it.

I love hotwings and any place wiling to put a meaty wing in my mouth, and won&#39;t shy from bringing the heat, without sacrificing the flavor.  That is why I am not fond of some chains.  Tiny wings and hot sauces that taste like meh.  So enter this place.  I had driving by it a couple times, and truth be told, the place looked a lil sketchy because it really is this little hut.  It&#39;s just there, with the name highly visible for all to see.  Because I&#39;m immature and easily amused, I snickered to myself, as I read the name.  This place&#39;s potential escaped me, due to me judging a book by it&#39;s cover and being Beavis and/or Butt-head.  

  So one night, the craving hit me.  Hard.  I needed wings. Being of sound mind, I jumped on here and took a look around.  Much to my surprise, this place showed up and seemed favorable.  I decided to eat crow, and see what this was all about.  I could have called ahead but I was already out the door.  I just wanted to see the place for myself.  A quick drive later, I was there, pulling into their tiny parking lot.  This place is very bare bones.  I would agree that this place is more of a carry out place, than a dine-in place.  While that option is available, the space is very minimal and not their to cater huge numbers.  Decor is non-existant, aside from a couple pictures and signs that are mostly paper and markers.  Not saying this place could use a couple Bob Ross paintings, because this place really doesn&#39;t need it.  The simple aesthetic works for this place.  All it really needs is the giant menu, behind the counter.  It has that. Good job.

  So on the first visit, I really looked like a complete noob.  I had no idea what sizes they had, or sauces.  I was directed to that info and decided on a 15 piece, with regular hot, and a side of bleu cheese.  I opted for regular hot as a starting point, to get a baseline.  They had X-hot and nuclear but I first wanted to see how they held up, on just the basic flavor.  The pricing was good, and I took seat.  15 to 20 minutes was how long my patience needed to suffer.  That&#39;s not bad.  I&#39;d be kinda leery if they came out in 5 minutes.  Wings don&#39;t cook that fast.  So I sat watched some terrible MTV 2 show on one of the TVs they have, and soon enough, wings were brought to me!  I took my bag of goodies and headed out.  

  Now call me weird, but a good sign of good wings is if your truck smells like wings, the next day.  Yea, the drive home was arduous because they did have quite a bouquet to them.  Mouth watering good. I got them home and tore into them and it was very much yes.  Juicy wings, with meat that came right of the bone.  The flavor hit the mark and coupled with the bleu cheese, I concluded that I found a legit wing.  It was now time to take the next necessary step, and push to the next level.  A week later, I did so.  I, once again, just made the drive and pulled into a much busier parking lot.  A terrible parking job later, I ordered a 15 piece of X-hot, with bleu cheese, and fries.  Under $20 and 20 minutes later, I had my order and was filling my truck with the sweet aroma of heat.  And heat it did bring.  I tore into them and the flavor wasn&#39;t sacrificed for the intense heat I was giving.  Wing bliss.  The sauce even had pepper seeds in it so I was sure to roll my wings in more of it, then dip it in the bleu cheese.  Pro winger.  The fries were fries.  A good compliment.  No complaints, they were good fries with great wings. 

  So yea, this place has something going for it.  Something I may have missed, had I stuck by my old assumptions and dumb laughs.  Sure it looks a lil...off, but it&#39;s ok.  It&#39;s not supposed to look high end or flashy.  It&#39;s there to serve good wings, which it succeeds in, so it doesn&#39;t need to do more, or look less like closed down Taco Bell, to get that point across.  It stands on it&#39;s own merits and I tasted them, loud and clear.  This place is wing approved! Enjoy!"

I returned and politely told them this and even said it wasn&#39;t a big deal and that they can just make my original order. The cook/manager (I&#39;m assuming) didn&#39;t apologize for their mistake, and gave me an attitude the entire time, as if I was the one that did something wrong.

It&#39;s a very small little wing hut with minimal seating and probably designed more with takeout in mind.  They have a pretty large selection of sauces, we went with the honey sriracha and honey hot.  The former cost a bit more, both were pretty good but a little watery.  I&#39;m willing to bet the blue cheese dressing is a ordered from a restaurant supply place and not made in house, which is too bad.  Also, I&#39;d like it better if they offered some veggie sticks as is standard.

Overall it wasn&#39;t bad, but I&#39;ll probably stick to a few of my other wing haunts in the future."

After the first but it tasted okay but there was an awful lot Earth crust but when you take it apart it&#39;s like  where&#39;s the fish? That I expected to be Frozen face yes I guess I did but at the same time I didn&#39;t expect it to taste  really really Frozen either. 
So basically what I thought I was getting a great deal turns out to be quite disappointed I might go back just to try the Wings everyone seems to Rave about them"

We ordered fried zucchini, fried mushrooms, fries and 30 wings, half regular buffalo, half spicy garlic. The fried veggies were limp and heavy with oil. I realize it&#39;s fried, but there is a good way and a bad way. The wings were tough and over cooked. The buffalo flavor was so-so this time and the spicy garlic was red oil. I guess cayenne and butter? Either way it was grody! 
Additionally upon pickup the cashier was so rude to my 70 year old dad. He&#39;s harmless and far from rude.
I&#39;m not sure what the heck is going on there but forget about me going back. Being busy is no excuse for poor service and bad food. Wing Stop is equally close and fresh cut fries make the win. 
Buckley location is no better, but I&#39;ll save that gem for that page."

After moving here from Syracuse NY a few months ago I needed real wings so why not?  If you have ever had wings where wings come from, Western NY, then these are a sad attempt at the real thing.  They are supposed to be crispy and covered in sauce which these are not even close.  We ordered Medium and Parm/Garlic, and neither had any real flavor, just soggy disappointment.  My mouth didn&#39;t even get warm from the mild sauce residue.  I will be breaking out my deep fryer in the future and not listening to the locals who might come from buffalo country but know nothing about Buffalo wings."

I think they could&#39;ve spun them again before they gave them to me instead of letting them dry up. The price was unacceptable though. I knew that it was a bit more on the expensive side for wings when I went into it but it was not worth the price I paid for it.
On another note, I have no idea what was with the adorable girl taking my order but she looked terrified if me. I&#39;m sure that she gets a lot of men of large stature during the lunch hours. But she seemed so timid to speak in anything higher than a whisper.

The wings are large not tiny little baby things. The sauces are good and they have some good variety. They don&#39;t have a bunch of flavors but what they do have allows for a good selection. The ranches they give are a great size as well. The fries were great....just needed salt. They have several tv&#39;s to keep patrons entertained. The staff was friendly. The prices were cheap. We got a 34 piece with two fries and two drinks for 32 bucks and the have other deals as well.

Oh, everyone already knew that? Well, crap. Way to take the air out of my sails, people. Actually, you know what? I&#39;m still going to talk about them anyway, so THPT!

Please be advised that this review will specifically refer to the branch at Parker/Yale, as that&#39;s the one I find myself spending the most time in (seeing as it&#39;s right up the street from my workplace and all). For some reason, it always looks so tiny to me from the outside, and thus I find myself doing a &#34;zOMGWOW&#34; more often than not when I step through the door and marvel at how spacious the interior actually is. The staff I&#39;ve interacted with there have always been very pleasant and obliging, and are more than willing to go the extra mile to ensure that patrons have everything they need to enjoy their meals. And their menu (which I&#39;m just about to discuss a bit below) has a heckuva lot of choices. In toto (arf!), Smashburger is definitely one of the better fast-casual options (I visit these types of places so infrequently overall that I&#39;m not sure I can call them &#34;the best&#34;, but you know what I mean).

Now let&#39;s talk some more about that menu, shall we? The first thing I have to explain is that they are not shy about using spicy peppers on their burgers. Good Lord! (And yes, I know you can get a lot hotter in town but for a fast-casual place it&#39;s worth making a note of, OK?). If I&#39;m not doing one of their pre-set burgers or chicken sandwiches, some of the toppings I&#39;ve especially enjoyed are crimini mushrooms, spinach, goat cheese, guacamole and the house &#34;smash sauce&#34; which always reminds me a bit of egg-salad-without-the-eggs). Ooh! Before I forget - I know you&#39;re familiar with their &#34;Smashfries&#34; slathered in olive oil, rosemary and garlic, but did you know that you can also have this same, um, dressing on sweet potato fries? And the combo isn&#39;t nearly as nauseating as you might imagine - try it! Oh, and finish up with a salted caramel shake, no matter how bloated you may be."

Glad I stopped by here after going to FedEx.  I ordered the Colorado burger (green chili burger), sweet potato fries,  and a butterfinger shake.  Hey.. I&#39;ve built quite the appetite after unpacking from a move.  Anyway it was all delicious.  Perfect balance of flavor and spice of the chili,  thinly cut sweet potato fries that weren&#39;t too salty,  and I really liked the not too creamy shake.  My only complaint would be I didn&#39;t get the ranch I asked for.  I should have double checked. I&#39;ve had better,  I&#39;ve had worst.. Id say it hit the spot for a burger craving."

There&#39;s a guy there, I won&#39;t say his name but it rhymes with meth, and he&#39;s a rude idiot. We watched him run around like a chicken with his head cut off for 10 minutes at least before he ever addressed the line of 10 people waiting to just place an order. The place was empty aside from a table
Outside and one inside. No one was happy - every was was eyes wide open staring at this idiot in disbelief as to his incredibly poor judgement. He held the door or guest entering and exiting the patio instead of taking orders of the 10 people in line. Once in line, he insulted my wife by interrupting and ignoring her immediately after asking her to say what she&#39;d like. I had to restrain myself. All this while you can picture, a sweaty, out-of-breathe, shining example of someone you wouldn&#39;t want anywhere near your food. 

Their green chile is not green chile, let&#39;s just get that straight. Don&#39;t come here for a green chile burger. 

I certainly wish there was a Freddy&#39;s as close as this Smashburger. I can&#39;t imagine we&#39;ll ever come back. Making the drive to Freddy&#39;s just seems like the only option. 

I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, if you want a burger just slightly better than McDonald&#39;s, but with worse service, this is your place. 


I hope this guy is your last employee before you file chapter 11."

This was my first and probably last time in a smashburger.
I ordered my food which was repeated to me then went to use the bathroom while they made it.
There was no toilet paper and had to do squat wall to paper towels by the sink. 
In a day and age of being green this place misses the mark. Each item was individually packed in bag 5 times bigger than it needed to be then the collection of bags were loaded into a ridiculously large bag. 
I got home to find my order incomplete.
What was there wasn&#39;t even average. My daughter&#39;s grilled cheese was burnt. The Colorado burger had only trace amount of chilis. Both burgers were smashed into nothing so there was no juiciness you crave in a burger. The fried pickles were just a blob of batter from being over crowded in fryer. Only about a quarter of them were edible.
Highly disappointed and won&#39;t be back"

This location keeps the great food that Smashburger has almost every location.  Do me one favor as you take a look at this review.  The one extra special thing that this franchise does is cook the burger to the doneness that you ask for: from rare to well done(not sure why you want that.) Try it...and they will cook it correctly.  The garlic fries complement the meal very well.

Play around with the build your burger concept with my toppings, sauces, etc.  The shakes also are tasty as well as the craft brew, or soda.  

Pay a couple of extra bucks over a McDonald&#39;s...and grab a burger here. My favorite: Colorado Burger."

I don&#39;t eat burgers, but this is my husband&#39;s current favorite burger spot so I can sort of review those too based on his comments.  He is pretty picky so that&#39;s a high compliment!

I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m just getting around to reviewing Smashburger.  I&#39;ve been to several locations, but this is the one I visit most frequently.

When this one opened up, I gave it another shot and FELL IN LOVE.  MY GO TO FAST CASUAL BURGER PLACE, which replaced Five Guys as my top choice.  I always get the sweet potato fries.  The oil they toss the fries with can make them soggy, so go lite or  none at all.  The regular burger is filling enough, but if you&#39;re super hungry go with the big smash.

I&#39;ve only got the chicken burger once, and it was the buffalo chicken burger.  It was nothing to write home about.  Stick with the beef burgers.

It&#39;s awesome they have New Belgium brews here with a pairing menu, which I&#39;ve used with great success.

You much try their milkshakes at least once in your lifetime.  It really hit the spot!  Not too thick that you can&#39;t suck through a straw, and not so thin that you&#39;re drinking milk.

My favorites are the BBQ burger and the Baja burger. I don&#39;t recommend the swiss truffle mayo burger though."

The Parker Road store has turned me off totally.  For starters, the fries (all varieties) are always drenched in oil.  I realize that the smashfries include olive oil to get the rosemary and garlic to &#34;stick;&#34; however, they&#39;ve been soaked every time I&#39;ve ordered them.  The plain and sweet potato fries haven&#39;t been much better.  My burger is also sloppily made at this location - yes, every time.  It&#39;s such a disappointment because it&#39;s not as if you get the food quickly.  There is always a wait regardless of how many people are in the restaurant.

This leads me to my next bone to pick, the counter service has been extremely inconsistent.  I&#39;ve experienced a friendly, albeit somewhat inept, cashier as well as one that was extremely rude.  As a matter of fact, on my last visit, the person at the register proceeded to engage the persons ahead of me in a long drawn-out conversation that had absolutley nothing to do with their order, knowing that I&#39;d been standing there waiting for awhile.  When I finally made it to the counter to order she didn&#39;t acknowledge the fact that I&#39;d been waiting at all.  Instead, she acted put off by having to take my order.

Every 2-3 months there is a new cashier who don&#39;t seem to know how to take orders well. My last experience was August 26th, 1:30PM. I asked the cashier to type &#34;well-done&#34; for my chicken sandwich. She refused and said it was well-done already, and started to argue with me. I told her that I had bad experiences here before, and I wanted her to type &#34;well done&#34; on the ticket so the kitchen would know. I decided to walk out and go to Burger King, was about half a block away. 

Seems Burger King can get the order right the first time, and it was faster and cheaper than the Smash burger here. In the past we have asked cashiers at this  Smash burger not to put bacon on the salad and they keep making the same mistake 3 times . Me and my staff have decided to take our lunch  business elsewhere. 

I wish I could give this location a negative rating, but you have to give them at least one star. 

I am not sure why the cashiers&#39; there have such a hard time working with the customers and giving them what they need. This is  not hard. 

Thank you for reading my long review."

I ordered a classic smash regular size, small smash fries and a small drink and the total came to 9.58. They should really have a combo or something because for this considered being fast food and not being waited on is pretty pricy. When I came in there were 2 people before me and I heard then order two classic chicken and fries. I ended up waiting 17 minutes for my order which I think is pretty long. I&#39;m not sure if all places are like this and this is normal timing, but I felt it was too long for a burger and small fries.  The food wasn&#39;t anything extraordinary either. Actually my burger was quite salty.  Next time I want a burger I can go to an actual restaurant, get waited on, and still pay the same price and wait the same."

She didn&#39;t even eat more than half. Every time we have gone to 5 guys she finishes her burger.

I see no reason to visit Smashburger over 5 guys.

The guy taking our order was nice and had a great attitude. However, when he repeated my order back he said 2 22&#39;s. I asked what that was and he said &#34;your fountain drink cup&#34; He could have simply just left it at that or pointed at it. But instead he tapped the lip of my cup 4 times with his fingers and then grabbed the lip with his fingers. Keep in mind this guy touches himself, the register, things around the restaurant and money all day. He was nice and I didn&#39;t want to hurt his feelings by explaining why I needed another cup so I just threw it away. I&#39;m not a germ-a-phobe but that was unacceptable."

You&#39;re right.  It is impossible!  I&#39;ll agree with you, dear reader.

I s&#39;pose it doesn&#39;t help that they cleverly bombard me with delicious updates on their Facebook often enough to keep the craving gently rumbling.

Weird name, but great place to grab a burger . . . a really great burger. This is my second visit to a Smashburger and it was as good or better than the first time. (Some things are just better the second time around.) First time was at the Broadway location for a special event. I was hooked that very night.

This Smashburger location is next to the Kinko&#39;s/ Fedex that I patronize on a fairly regular basis. When I first realized there was a Smashburger in this location I was coming out of Kinko&#39;s and they were replacing the front door &amp; window. Apparently someone wanted a Smashburger so badly they drove right through the front of the store!  

I love their burgers, but I am leaving my car in the parking lot, thank you."

I wanted to really like this place b/c I&#39;m always in search for a burger joint, but unfortunately it was just average. 

On my visit I tried:
1) Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger ($5.99)
        -delicious, but rather pricey for the size of the burger
2) Spicy Baja Burger ($6.99)
        -the bf got the &#34;big&#34; sized burger and it was literally a bite and a half or so bigger     
         than my regular sized burger. 
        -this burger I thought lacked flavor. I would have rather gotten a truffle burger at 
         larkburger-it would have been worth the price! 
3) Smash Fries (~$2?)
        -not very memorable. It was regular fries with olive oil, rosemary, garlic. Not that 
         tasty. I prefer the Cajun fries at Five Guys (waaaay better) or the truffle fries at 
         Larkburger! Damn, now I want some truffle fries. 

So with that said, it was good to try, but I probably won&#39;t be back b/c it was rather pricey. Just add $2 or so and you can get a burger twice the size with bottomless fries at Red Robin or you can head to Larkburger and get their truffle fries and truffle burger!!!"

Because apparently they gave my food to the wrong people, and then getting ONE hamburger and two orders of fries made again takes another 45 minutes, which I wasnt willing to wait. I had to ask for a refund, which shockingly the girl behind the counter was able to accomplish. When I asked for a manager they said there wasnt one, that the normal GM was on maternity leave and the temporary GM has other stores, and yada yada, IE no one is in charge, not surprisingly this location is the worst.

First of all, we came in here on 4th of July, 30 minutes before close and were told that our order would have to be taken to go since they closed in 30 minutes. As a person who works in the food service industry and will one day own my own place, you don&#39;t do that 30 minutes before closing, you do that 5 minutes before closing. Period. That left a bad taste, so we went next door to hooters and ate like kings!

Fast forward to this week (mid September) where we have a couple shiny new groupons burning holes in our pockets. this location is closer and easier to get into, than the Stapleton location. I wish we hadn&#39;t come here. The guy up front was friendly, but lacking knowledge about the products and also very scatterbrained. I asked if they had a GF bun option and he said the multi-grain bun. I asked if he was sure and his reply was &#34;yes, its whole wheat!&#34; 
If I could have facepalmed myself, I would have. How do you know so little about the product your selling that you don&#39;t know gluten ONLY comes from wheat? I chuckled it off, and said that anything wheat had gluten, but it was fine and I would just use that day as a cheat day. Then we ordered our food with ice cream products and i asked him to hold shakes until after the meal when we were ready for them. He said ok, but brought me mine anyways, yet still didn&#39;t bring my husband&#39;s which made zero sense. My husband didn&#39;t order his food to go, yet his cam out in a bag 3 orders AFTER mine. Meaning, 3 other people who oreder after us got their food before my husband. Lastly, they didn&#39;t even have the needed ingredients to make my husbands shake, so he Had to substitute. I will probably never return to this location."

Its not only a good chain, its a great chain. The ingredients here are fresh, the burger is meaty and juicy, and there are plenty of different types of burgers.

My wife and I came here on a lark, really. We had to drop off some things at FedEx next door and, well, I was kind of hungry. I went in thinking I&#39;d only get a &#34;snack,&#34; but ended up coming out with a whole meal. 

But seriously, this burger place tops just but any other chain I&#39;ve tried. In-n-Out? Smashburger is better. Five Guys? Smashburger is better? Fast food? Not even a chance. I&#39;ll level with you, though, the sweet potato fries are king here. They&#39;re drizzled in oil and covered in rosemary (or is it sage). It&#39;s excellent.

I tried Goodtimes a couple of times, and if you must read about my experience about their sharp foil (see review), read away.

So onto Smashburger. I want to say that Smashburger&#39;s &#34;catch phrase&#34; if you will- is contradictory and I&#39;ll explain that in a minute- but first onto ordering. I just order a classic Smashburger, with fries, and a drink. My order was over 9 bucks....liiiiiiiitle more than I wanted to spend on lunch.

Anyway, I wait and get my burger and fries - and both are delicious, so don&#39;t get me wrong. Their fries tossed with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil are soooooo good. I was wondering what this mysterious sauce was on my burger and checked their menu- and apparently its called &#34;smash sauce&#34; (go frickin&#39; figure), which, surprisingly, was the only thing I DIDN&#39;T like about my burger. The meat was good and fresh veggies and such.

So onto the contradiction, I was reading their cup and their &#34;catch phrase&#34; is &#34;smash. sizzle. savor&#34;....or something to that effect. So the Smash is apparently they &#34;smash&#34; the burger while cooking....doesn&#39;t everyone and their mom know that smashing a burger will dry it out while cooking? Well, they must not smash very well cause the burger was delicious and moist. Sizzle is something about their service I think??? And savor is something regarding being able to get a burger for a reasonable price. 

Well, let me tell you, just the burger alone was 5 bucks. Not cheap. So I might go back to smash burger ....but they need to rethink their burger prices."

It is rather a favorite in CO among many, but to tell you the truth, I saw nothing special about it. The menu is rather limited and the prices are quite high for what it actually is... fast food. My friend ordered a Classic burger with fries, side of chili and a small drink and that came out to be $12? I had a classic Chicken burger and that was $6? I mean... not to say that they don&#39;t use quality ingredients, because they do, but at that price I&#39;d rather go to an actual restaurant (i.e. Red Robins) and get my money&#39;s worth. 

Alright, the interior decor looks nicer than your typical McDonalds and they bring the food to your table. Call me cheap or whatever, but that STILL doesn&#39;t justify $12 for a meal at a fast food joint when you can&#39;t even call it the best gosh-darned burger you&#39;ve ever had.

She came back and said there had been a mix up which quite frankly seemed like she had forgotten to put in the order. 

When the food finally arrived it was quite tasty but we were so annoyed and hungry it didn&#39;t make the impact it probably should have. I also understand human error, we&#39;ve all done it, but it would have been a nice gesture for the cornbread or something small to have been comped as a customer service gesture.  All four of us walked out with a meh, we won&#39;t be back conclusion."

We were a party of 6 with a 12 noon reservation on a hopping Saturday. We were ushered inside from the host/hostess stand within 2 minutes. We were seated at a table in front of the bar overlooking the stage below dead center. 

First note; unless all six in your party are really cozy with each other, this is actually a booth for 4, but it worked since we were all family.

The atmosphere leans towards 1900&#39;s revival, or as they like to promote, &#34;a gastrobrothel&#34;. The walls are adorned with poster art and artifacts of what one might have seen in a whorehouse back in the day. Historically that is indeed what this building housed at one time. I found an exceptionally cool display of vintage glass pinball head panels mounted in front of the kick panel of the bar waitress stand. The noise level was loud, mostly due to the 3 piece playing 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s chill standards on stage. The tap-a-tap-a-tap-tap dancer was a refreshing change to see in a brunch world filled with jazz and blues combos. Unfortunately, it was too loud to have conversation - so loud in fact I had to yell to talk to the persons sitting next to and across from me. I could not talk to anyone else at the table. Too bad since most of us had not seen each other for years in some cases.

Our waitress took our drink orders, then our food orders since we were all ready to go by the time she arrived at our table ... which was about a 15 minute wait from the time we were seated. 

Since we were sitting so close to the bar, we were able to watch our drinks being made... and then sit there on the counter for yet another 13 minutes as manager and waitstaff passed by over and over again, until we pulled aside a gentleman whom we assumed was the manager.

We told him our order was sitting at the bar now for quite a while. He apologized, disappeared for 2 minutes, then walked back to the bar to bring our drinks the 8 feet from the bar service stand to our table. Drinks are pretty bullet proof when holding, but my iced tea had become watered down to the point there was only a few residual ice cubes floating the the glass.

10 minutes after the manager &#34;fetched&#34; our drink order, our food orders arrived. We ordered a nice cross section of their offerings, but I&#39;ll focus on what I actually tasted.

The Bison Pastrami Ruben sandwich with Brussels Sprout Slaw was good - pretty hard to screw up actually. The spouts slaw was the best ting about the plate however since the sandwich was cold too. I&#39;m not a fan of cold sauerkraut and hardened, previously melted Swiss cheese... on cold marbled rye.

The Arapas Benedict was cold. So cold that it was sent back to be replaced with one that was REALLY hot... perhaps too much so.

The Creme Brulee French Toast was slightly warmed, but the butter ordered with the item would not melt when spread across the &#39;toast&#34;.

The Breakfast Quesadilla was a bit better since most everything on the plate was well heated through with one exception; the potatoes were stone cold and also needed to be sent back. When they came back, that&#39;s right, they were soo hot they needed to site for 10 minutes before being able to eat.

Now I am not going to bash Ophillia&#39;s because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely one person or process that gave us so much grief that afternoon. I think I can point out two specific things that need to be addressed for consistency;

Whoever expedites the orders to the table needs to have a higher sense of QC before even letting the server or runner know the order is up. That would have prevented the cold food issue.

The FOH manager and waitstaff need to be in tune with each other and in regards to when drink/bar orders are placed and when they should be delivered. I can accept a waitperson becoming so overwhelmed that they might miss a table delivery, but for a manager to cruise by a drink station with ordered waiting more than a few times, then clumsily try to make resolution in full view of the customer is should be somewhat be embarrassing for the overall business.

Im not giving up on this place because I think it&#39;s unique enough to warrant another try in the future, but probably for dinner next time. Let&#39;s see if the experience was a fluke or the result of a lack of on the spot management oversight."

Who doesn&#39;t want to have happy hour in a former brothel?! Well, it was... just okay. The atmosphere is just dark with some banquette seating in the front area and a little balcony-type upper area above the stage. I don&#39;t really know what I was expecting, but it just wasn&#39;t that cool. The specials were great; nothing over $7 including cocktails, beer, wine, and several delicious-sounding small plates.

I had made a reservation online to ensure my boyfriend and I could get a table. We were visiting from out of town and I wasn&#39;t sure how busy it would be. We were seated right away overlooking the lower level where the stage is. (They are also a music venue.)

We had to ask for the happy hour menu, but then we ordered some drinks and waited... and waited... and waited some more. Our server came back and told us she thought our drink order got lost. Our drinks arrived shortly after that and we ordered some food - the green chile goat cheese cornbread and the spiced ribs. The food was up quickly and it was pretty tasty! The spice rub on the ribs was really good; not super spicy but great flavors. The cornbread was amazing! The flavors worked really well together and I believe goat cheese makes everything better. The portion of ribs was super tiny, I wasn&#39;t worried about it since it was so cheap, but if you want something bigger I would recommend ordering a few plates to share. The cornbread was an adequate amount to split between two people.

The drink I had (untitled project) was pretty bitter and I would not order it again, as I felt it was a bit unbalanced. My boyfriend had the lust tycoon which was great!

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t visit again and I actually cancelled my reservations at Linger because of our visit to Ophelia&#39;s. Nothing was really bad, I just think I had some unrealistic expectations of what the place itself would be like."

As a restaurant, the food has never wowed me. The jalapeño/cheese poppers are pretty good, but it&#39;s fried food, and nothing extraordinary. The service is pretty good, I&#39;ve always had reasonably fast service. I enjoy their specialty cocktails, but I would suggest going at happy hour for the deals otherwise you will end up spending a lot. If you can catch the lip-sync night, it&#39;s a fun show to watch! I would suggest reservations, especially for a large group."

They actually had me at the front door; it&#39;s gigantic and heavy. Such a cool, historic building and space.

This is a multi level restaurant, bar and concert venue. Extremely unique with a very chill, good vibe. Unfortunately, one of the folks in our party started not feeling well (having nothing to do with Ophelia&#39;s), so we had to cut our dinner a bit short to get her home. (She&#39;s likely having trouble with the altitude adjustment and some dehydration...).

But....before we left, we ordered some appetizers and beverages:

-Plantains - OMG. SO. GOOD. I&#39;m a plantain freak and these were cooked perfectly - sweet and savory with Cotija Cheese, Lime Yogurt &amp; Cilantro Pesto. I could come back here every day this week and just eat this. ($6)
-French fries - with Vindaloo Ketchup - delicious. ($6)
-SHISHITO POPPERS &amp; CHEESE CURDS - Spiced Cream Cheese, Horseradish Mustard &amp; Blood Orange Marmalade - I&#39;m not a huge fried cheese fan, but these were quite delicious and the peppers had a really nice kick to them. ($11)

We also ordered WAGYU BEEF SLIDERS: Spicy BBQ Tomato Jam, Merkts Cheddar, Butter Lettuce, Bacon &amp; Crispy Onions - we had to take these to go. I tried one when we got home and it was very good. There are only 2 of them but they are served with a pile of french fries. ($15)

Tons of gluten free options on this menu - which is tremendous since 2 of our group don&#39;t do the gluten scene.

Service was terrific - super friendly staff from the moment we walked in.

My only issue was that I didn&#39;t love the ginger ale that I ordered....it didn&#39;t have any fizz nor much flavor. (I was done drinking adult bevvies by this point since we hit another place earlier in the evening). Other than that, I really, REALLY liked this place and would totally go back here in a heartbeat."

Everything was incredible and the servers were attentive, easy going and made sure that we were comfortable the entire time. 

Extra big shout out to Molly!

Aside from the food and staff, its a very nice venue with a stage large enough for bands/ djs. There was a dj playing some good stuff while we were there and based on conversations with locals, they host some pretty cool events on certain nights of the week."

This review is not based on a dining experience at Ophelia&#39;s. While the location and inside of Ophelia&#39;s are awesome, the staff and cocktail prices are not. 

On the night I went to Ophelia&#39;s, I had purchased two drinks total by myself. A friend had purchased one drink for me when we arrived (total = 3 drinks). Mind you the drinks are pricey.. Have fun paying $9-10 for a freakin&#39; well vodka and soda water. Want one of their crafty cocktails? Then you&#39;re looking at $11-12. Whatever. 

I go to close my tab at the end of the evening and the bartender had charged me for an extra drink... I tried to have a conversation stating I had only purchased two drinks, and he instead deciding to battle me about it. I reminded him that a friend had purchased my first drink and paid for it. Finally, after roughly 10 minutes of us going back and forth and him treating me like a child, he removed one drink off my tab... The best part is-- I look at my bank statement the next day and he charged me DOUBLE. Instead of just charging me $25 and some change, I was charged $50. 

I tried calling Ophelia&#39;s and emailed to receive my overcharge back... And no answer any time I have tried! I will never be coming back to this place. I felt I was treated quite rudely by the snotty bartenders and no one had a care to try and return the money they clearly stole from me. Do not go here unless you like being overcharged, treated like a child, and ignored when trying to get money back that the BARTENDER falsely charged you for."

The menu is gluten-free and vegan friendly, plus they will make any adjustments as needed, like put the cheese on the side. Our waitress was very accommodating and even asked whether we had any allergies besides dairy and wheat. I really appreciate that sort of thing. 

The arepas were absolutely to die for, just wish they&#39;d been bigger. The roasted beet salad was perfection. The mushroom and truffle flat bread was extremely filling. The gluten-free version was $2 extra. 

Whatever you do, save room for dessert! The salted caramel is so delicious, you&#39;re going to want two of them. The vegan and G-free Butterscotch pudding is on my top 5 ever desserts list. Wow! It is airy, creamy, fluffy, soft, sweet, salty and crunchy all at the same time. Awesome-sauce in a jar. I&#39;d come back just for that. 

Valet parking is available for $5. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars are the big city prices."

My first time here was for a concert (Floetry) and we were all pretty impressed by the interior of Ophelia&#39;s. Beautiful lounge area, sexy bar and comfy, padded booths. Additionally, some beautiful secluded tables for two above and below in a interior &#34;rim&#34; above the stage. Downstairs is a standing area/dance floor when there is live music. 

We sat as a party of four at a booth. We were supposed to be a party of six, but at the last minute, one set of friends had to cancel. Which worked in our favor, as the booths were not that big for 6 people.

We had wonderful service with Stacy. She suggested their version of a Moscow Mule (which was made with gin) and it was divine. But think I switched to the Lustful Turk and that was even better!
We ordered the gigante bean hummus and the spring cheese incident as appetizers. Later for dinner, we ordered the mussels, an order of fries and the man ordered the roasted beet salad and a beet/super seed veggie burger. We loved every morsel of our dinner. 

The butterscotch pudding was only ok. It tasted more like bananas and less like butterscotch, but it wasn&#39;t too bad.

Now fast forward to the next week. A friend was here from out of town and we decided to go to Ophelia&#39;s.
A party of four, we were taken to the patio, which was just delightful! We ordered so much food off the happy hour menu and basically hung out and chatted for another 2 hours past happy hour. We ordered the shishito poppers &amp; curds, the green chile cornbread, wagyu beef sliders, dry rubbed ribs, mussels, and hummus, plus an order of the Monte Cristo sandwich. Everything was delicious and the service from Harrison, was on point. My friends were also impressed by the beautiful décor of Ophelia&#39;s. 

As a musical venue, it is intimate, which I prefer, with upstairs seating and standing room for downstairs. I appreciate the options for various seating options (large booth, small tables, bar tables and couches in the lounge area, as well as bar seating). 

We are already huge fans and I can&#39;t wait till my next meal there."

There were a ton of awesome sounding Brunch Items on the menu and I went with the Nacho Flatbread. This came with a Sunny-Side up Egg, Chorizo, Black Beans, Queso Fresco, Pico de Gallo and Poblano Cream and was outstanding.

Our waitress didn&#39;t bring me my drink, they delivered our food to the wrong table, and our waitress never came to check on us, refill our water or even give us our check (All of which we had to ask the bus boy)

Food was great and bottomless mimosas would have been fun had our server ever returned back to our table to refill our drinks or actually serve us our drinks/food.  Pretty unfortunate for this place as the 4 of us were pretty turned off by the experience.

Ophelia&#39;s is a true GEM in downtown Denver.  It is a loner in its comp set.  There is absolutely nothing else like it in LoDo or CBD. 

In essence, picture this:  A multi-level, boho-chic music bistro serving up soul euro fusion bites!

Paradox? I&#39;m okay with it.

Its decor was very fitting to its vibe and menu design,  as well. BUT, when we went, the music was slow bluegrass-ish tunes.  So that sucked.  I&#39;m surprised they do not entertain the idea of having a contemporary ballot come in or at least indie musicians?  

Either way, food was great. Service was too!  Do note its entrance is on the side of its bar windows (closest to Lawrence) NOT the door splitting the two sets of windows (this will make sense once you go)."

We sat at the downstairs bar and had a couple drinks before our reservation. Nice selection of beer on tap. The wife had a seasonal. I went with the sex machine a spicy tequila mixed drink. If you like spicy cocktails this is an excellent selection. 

There was some type of fund raiser going on that night and there was a special menu for a little more than the restaurant week menu. We went with one fund raiser menu and one restaurant week menu. I had scallops, steak and butterscotch pudding. My wife had green chili cornbread, salmon, and some kind of ice cream cookie. All the food we had was very delicious!

There was a great band playing that night. The brothel atmosphere, and food were all excellent. My only criticism was the the service was not on par with everything else. Downstairs at the bar we would try and ask staff a question and were straight up ignored. At the dining table our server seemed not very interested in serving us.

Really hard to find somewhere to sit but we managed to get a spot on the couches and had a great time. 

We started out with the String Cheese Incident which was unreal. It was a really great dip and the pita that came with it was pretty good too, just a bit crisp and warmed up which is nice for dipping.

Then we got the sliders which had bacon on both sides and a really great sauce on it, it was kind of like 1000 island but a bit hotter than normal. Fries were good but who are we kidding it&#39;s pretty tough to mess up fries.

This Is Why I&#39;m Fat

I&#39;m not fat, I&#39;m just fluffy.  Good food is the culprit of my fluffiness.  My motto is &#34;when in doubt, order more&#34;, therefore at new restaurants I order practically the whole menu just in case I don&#39;t ever come back.  If I get a stroke before my 40&#39;s I&#39;m blaming Yelp.  Good thing about Ophelia&#39;s is that every dish was a homerun.  You have no idea how happy that makes me.

If you didn&#39;t tell me this was a bison burger I would have thought that this simple burger was some sort of Kobe beef made to a perfect medium rare which after it was grilled was the most juicy burger I&#39;ve ever had.  Only thing that saddens me is that the lightening was so dark I couldn&#39;t take an amazing photo of it."

We ate there late on a Thursday, so the bar area was hopping and the place had a pretty high noise level and low-light ambience, but we were still able to converse easily. 

On weekend nights (thu-sat) there are performances (sometimes burlesque??) and we were lucky enough to catch a trio of decent DJs while we ate and chatted.

Food/drink were very good. They had a raspberry beer that was the best fruit beer I&#39;ve ever had - not too sweet and very refreshing. The shishito pepper/cheese curd appetizer was great. The the bison burger I got was cooked well, not too dry.

Only real downside was space - took a few mins to get a table for two and ended up getting seated at a side-by-side table bumping elbows with the table next to us. But got a good view of the stage!

Overall, was a fun place for dinner with lots of energy and good food. Would go back."

Came here for a birthday dinner after researching &#34;cool, fun, restaurants&#34; on Yelp! I was pleased with the trendy decor mixed with interesting cabaret art and even some old comic book themes snuck in there! 

Food was outstanding. Literally everything we ordered was flavorful, interesting, and fun to eat. Started with the oysters and the spring cheese incident. Both had very different flavor combinations that I&#39;ve never tried before. Could easily have ordered 2 or 3 more plates of the oysters! (but watch out for the hot sauce!). For entrees my family ordered the bison burger, arepas (the hit of the night!), the sliders, which were cooked PERFECTLY, and the belgian mussels. For dessert they brought me a special birthday treat; salted chocolate mousse! It was creamy and decadent. 

Will be back for more dinner and brunch!"

I wouldn&#39;t mind so much except it makes having a conversation and having functioning eardrums impossible.  That&#39;s one thing when you&#39;re out late on a weekend night but for brunch?

Linger and Root Down blow this place out of the water food wise. We got four different dishes and just weren&#39;t very impressed on any of them. They weren&#39;t bad, just not that great. A couple were a little to far out there for our liking but were still creative and different. The room itself is gorgeous. Super neat seating and stage area. The bench four tops are a little awkward and uncomfortable. 

I won&#39;t return again for the food (I&#39;d rather spend a tiny bit more and hit Linger) but may return for a couple expensive cocktails and a show."

After looking at the menu, I found it to be super farmy, much like so many new restaurants in Atlanta that I haven&#39;t wanted to try.  While on their site, I saw they are advertising their new sister restaurant, Ophelia&#39;s.  I loved how eclectic this place sounded from their website, and I could pick out several food options both of us would eat.  I made our reservation for 6:30 on a Thursday night.  

For one, I should have noted in my reservation that my husband and I were celebrating our ten year anniversary (that was my bad).  We&#39;re not big on fancy or attention, so we don&#39;t want a free dessert or white tablecloth; however, it would have been nice to be seated somewhere other than the stage-facing tables on the balcony.  Husband and I were seated next to each other, and in front of us was the stage on the level below.  A huge (huge) big screen was broadcasting a football game, so it wasn&#39;t really the 10th anni vibe I&#39;d hoped for.  Again, this was my mistake since I didn&#39;t specify or ask for a different table upon being seated.  

I ordered the sauv blanc and my husband had a local beer.  The sauv blanc wasn&#39;t my favorite.  I was able to sip just one glass for the entirety of my meal, so it wasn&#39;t going down easily.  We ordered the green chili goat cheese cornbread to start.  You say spicy or goat cheese, and I&#39;m there.  Husband loved it; I just thought it was so/so.  The goat cheese is apparently mixed in with the bread batter, so you can&#39;t taste it.  For dinner, husband ordered the chicken and waffles, and I had the wagyu beef sliders.  The food was beautifully presented and pretty tasty.  The waffles are actually made of potatoes, so it&#39;s kind of supposed to take on a fried chicken and mashed potatoes vibe.  The sliders were good - nothing spectacular.  

Overall, I think this place would be VERY fun for a girls night out or fun date night to take in the scheduled entertainment.  Husband and I were tired and ready to go back to hotel before the DJ came on that evening, so we missed that.  The atmosphere was great, and the service was good too.  We just weren&#39;t blown away by the food."

Ophelia&#39;s has a really cool vibe and is a fun spot to go with your girlfriends.  It used to be a brothel, so the decorations are eclectic to say the least.  Still had an old-timey, sexual feel throughout the restaurant.

Get the bottomless mimosas- if you don&#39;t, you miss out on the whole brunch experience here.  They&#39;re served in a large glass and they really know how to pour it.

I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu here.  We got a bunch of dishes to share: salmon plate, breakfast quesadilla, pecan cinnabun, nacho flatbread, cheese and egg situation (forgot the exact name...but it was the best situation I&#39;ve ever been in), jalapeño cornbread, and another two or three.  We were all smitten and devoured each plate. I&#39;d say my favorite was the breakfast quesadilla and the &#34;situation&#34;.  Probably could have gotten another one just for myself.

Only weird thing about the restaurant is that they were playing some really creepy, gory movie on the screen for kung-fu happy hour.  Probably could have gone without slit throats and spewing blood during brunch!

Really enjoyed ourselves here and I have no doubt that I&#39;ll be back for another round or ten of mimosas and many more situations."

When&#39;s the last time you got to say something like that in public and not be shamed for lewd behavior?

Ophelia&#39;s is all about bringing sexy back. Which is good since this location was home to some pretty back door proclivities. This venue was once home to ladies of the night and then a XXX adult store. Now they have loud music and American (new) cuisine, which is about as bad as it gets these days.

Let&#39;s face it, there&#39;s lots of douchey hangouts in LoDo. It&#39;s near the ballpark and it attracts drunk tourists and guys named Chad wearing backwards hats. It&#39;s OK, there&#39;s a version of LoDo in almost every U.S. City.

Ophelia&#39;s is a refuge from the douchebaggery. It&#39;s no surprise that they have a creative cocktail menu or tasty treats, they&#39;re owned by the same people as Root Down and Linger. It&#39;s dark, it&#39;s sexy, and I&#39;m pretty sure there aren&#39;t too many flip flop wearing bro&#39;s trampling in pre or post Rockies game.

I&#39;ve not yet been here for a show, just an early dinner. But you bet your sweet ass I&#39;ll be back for more drinks and food after dark."

Ok, not really, but I can now check it off my list! The exterior of Ophelia&#39;s gives it a nostalgic look, which I love. I love great architecture and appreciate it all. I just want to live above this place! This spot is now a gastro-brothel with live music and amazing food. Here is a link to give you details on this historic spot:

Upon entering, you have amazing colored/stained glass panels lining the ceiling and a modern chandelier over head. Restrooms are located downstairs where there is more intimate indoor seating and live music. The second level is more bar scene with tables and booths with a large screen that is projecting the live music performers from the level below. We were escorted to their outdoor patio. String lights hung above and metal tables all around. So, yeah when it gets hot outside and you have the sun beating down on you its not a fun way to enjoy eating. We asked to have them turn on the fans outside which helped for a bit. Once we saw a table clear up on the opposite side in a more shaded area we grabbed it! That&#39;s when we finally places our order and annoyed the continuous bottomless mimosas.  This menu is another hit! As mentioned before, Linger and Root Down are sister restaurants. They have dishes that are from different parts of the US as well as Venezuela and Greece. Another hit spot that I absolutely adore! Can I just say,  I&#39;m in love? I ordered up the chicken and waffles for my brunch and I was not disappointed! Instead of serving it up full size and with white breast meat, the plate was perfect with chicken thighs, love that dark moist meat and then a couple waffle pieces. You don&#39;t need to go big on a brunch like that. They&#39;ve nailed it with this perfect portion and it&#39;s truly a tantalizing sweet and savory meal. Drizzle that maple syrup and cut into the chicken. Fried up to perfection. Golden, crispy, that juicy meat within and with a dab of maple syrup it&#39;s an orgasm waiting to happen. I enjoyed this meal slowly so I could savor every single bite. Those mimosas were flowing, great conversation between friends and amazing food served up. I can&#39;t praise them enough! A must go to spot !"

Had dinner here before a show and everyone enjoyed what they had, ordered the scallops, pork belly, and kale salad to start. 

The portions are what you expect from root down or linger, tapas sharing style plates with some standard entrees as well. 

Thy have an excellent cocktail menu, and make some pretty good drinks, but during showtime the bar can get pretty overrun and overheat as well. Place felt like they had no circulation downstairs and you find yourself getting moist pretty quick. Hopefully the A/C works during the summer months. 

There are a few kinks to work out, but it&#39;s a nice upscale option for dinner and music without getting puked on by a wookie, although I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll catch on sooner or later. 

If they keep booking the acts I&#39;ve started to see on their calendar, Kimock anyone?!?, then I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back soon

------------------

Update 

Went back to see Steve Kimock the other week and the A/C was alive and working, even though they&#39;re were more people at this show it was considerably cooler and much more enjoyable. 

The only gripe is the cost of mixed drinks. 

I understand a premium price on house drinks, they make some good ones and I expect a higher price point, but when you order an absolute and Tonic, a single at that, it shouldn&#39;t cost $9.75, especially if the bartender is using a jigger to measure the pour. 

That is easily fixed by pre-drinking at a personal fav, El Chapultepec down the street."

We started with the sticky bun to share and it was out of this world. We of course went for the bottomless mimosas which I recall being about $12. Live folk music was playing, the atmosphere is amazing here. I ordered the nacho flatbread and was pretty happy with it but somewhat wished I got a benedict instead.

I came during happy hour 4-6. 

I sat at the bar and I believe they only have a happy hour menu between their happy hour times . But I could be wrong , I never asked . 

If you wanna get a feel for this place I suggest coming during this time . They have items that are on their normal menu - they are just smaller and cheaper ! Cocktails were all $5 and menu items were mostly $5-$10. 

I tried two cocktails and both were excellent . They make the cocktails with the ever so modern one giant ice cube ( which is actually better , it doesn&#39;t melt as fast and dilute your drink ). 

I got the muscles and duck wings to go. I recommend both . They put the wing sauce in a cup so it didn&#39;t leave my wings soggy before I was ready to eat them . The ranch dipping sauce had dill in it and wasn&#39;t generic tasting . 

The ambiance of the place was very romantic and upscale , without being snobby . Very friendly staff . I noticed the bartenders take pride in each drink and check them for quality before they are sent out ."

I tried to make a reservation with OpenTable but if you have more than 4 people in your party, you have to make the reservation on their online site or give them a call.

I called and was able to make brunch reservations for Sunday for 9 people on the patio. The hostess was very friendly and efficient.

We were seated right away and the patio was very comfortable, but just a little hot--they could put another sun shade or patio umbrellas because the sun was filtering thru to our table.

The servers were very friendly and efficient. We started off with the Bottomless Mimosas and they offered regular and blood orange. The mimosas were good but had to ask for more orange juice and that made it better. They are served with regular glasses but would have preferred them in flutes because they would get warm too quickly.

We ordered the following:

- AREPAS BENEDICT ( 5 stars *****)
Plantains, Black Beans, Heirloom Tomato Salsa, Pepitas, Poached Eggs &amp; Green Chili Hollandaise
- BREAKFAST QUESADILLA (4 starts ****)
Scrambled Eggs, Pepper Jack Cheese, Mushrooms, Spinach, Artichoke, Home Fries &amp; Diablo Salsa
- TOAD IN THE HOLE BREAKFAST SANDWICH (5 stars *****)
Soft Baked Egg, Country Ham, Dill Havarti Cheese, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil Pesto &amp; House Made English Muffin
- YOU CALL IT (5 stars *****)
Choice of Bacon or Chicken Apple Sausage, Eggs, Home Fries, Greens &amp; Toast
- YOU CALL IT (5 stars *****)
Choice of Bacon or Chicken Apple Sausage, Eggs, Home Fries, Greens &amp; Toast

Everything was Yummy, Yummy, Yummy (of course we had to try all our dishes). The price was very reasonable. 

You have to go to the bathrooms! Great decor and located downstairs. The restaurant had a great vibe and they have free WiFi (just ask the server for the password).

Only bad thing is the parking. Street parking was packed so we had to park at a lot ($5).

The bar staff (I was sat at the bar) were so helpful and went into the kitchen and asked the chef to just do me one pancake, with all the other additions.

Housed in a multi-level historic brothel with ownership by the brains behind Root Down and Linger, Ophelia&#39;s Electric Soapbox was targeted for brunch on arrival to Denver and amidst a setting quite unlike any other it was no surprise that the restaurant itself is as much about the experience as it is the food, the severely slow coffee refills a small smudge on an otherwise shining meal.

At times a concert venue, otherwise showing everything from kitsch Kung-Fu films to The Superbowl on an enormous screen hanging high above the ground floor, it was at a narrow countertop that I was seated shortly after arrival and finding comfort in the highbacked leather barstools it was not long before a young lady greeted me, menu presented along with a cocktail list provided by Viewmaster.

Following a trend typical to restaurants of its ilk, clever cocktails, mimosas and bloody Marys served alongside improvised takes on classic diner fare, any midday meal at the Electric Soapbox should undoubtedly begin with Coffee from nearby Coda ad although refills may be hard to come by as the place gets busy, have no doubt the rich roast is worth the wait, a gentle fruity basenote pairing particularly well with sweeter fare.

Recently updating the seasonal menu, some dinner carryover to lunch but mostly novel with a small-plates sharing focus, brunch was divided into three courses consisting of seven options, the first a trio of lightly spiced cornbread with a creamy goat cheese core alongside a panini-pressed Monte Cristo plus a showstopping Cinnamon Sticky Bun with Bourbon Caramel still bubbling in cast iron as Crème Anglaise was added to mellow the sweetness and cool the pastry enough to eat.

Chatting with the General Manager about the space, the team involved and the Denver dining scene as a whole, it was hot-on-the-heels of round one that part two of the meal would arrive and already impressed by the crispness of hand-cut frites served with the deep-fried sandwich the crunchy coating overlying a pair of juicy chicken thighs was equally appealing, the potato based waffle a forgivingly light when topped with inspired accoutrements while the cast-iron French Toast ate much like a souffle&#39;d bread pudding, the mascarpone and boozy berries absolutely indulgent.

Actually unaware that dessert was available at lunch when originally formulating the order I&#39;d half-debated forgoing a look at the menu for fear of overdoing it so early in the trip, but unable to resist temptation it was perhaps fortuitous that only one of the three offerings seemed to be calling and accompanied by a single smoky caramel, other flavors available at Root Down and Linger, the &#34;Butterscotch Pudding&#34; was served in a jar as an elegant upgrade on the Banana-based Southern Classic, the Candied Walnuts and housemade Nilla Wafer adding texture to the sweet, creamy layers."

Ophelia&#39;s is a sister restaurant to Root Down and Linger and just like those two spaces it has a unique interior with a cool history and an excellent menu to go with! Think brothel turned speak easy!

I took my friend for brunch on a recent Sunday late morning and we were promptly seated side by side in front of the stage, which is lower than the rest of the restaurant. Server noted there is music Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. No music but on the big projector was one of the nfl games playing for viewers enjoyment.  I think it was easy to get into as I didn&#39;t think they had a patio (side note: they do) and it is a fairly dark interior to make it more of a jazz club feel. 

I enjoyed the fried egg and spring cheese incident. It came served in a cast iron mini casserole dish...holy cheese it was amazing and gluttonous and everything it should be. Served with warm flatbread I scooped up every last bite. It&#39;s listed on the skillets section but is more than enough to fill you up. My vegan friend enjoyed the tempeh espanola and judging by his empty plate I think it is safe to say he liked it. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back and enjoy this dark interior on a fall night with some jazz tunes coming up from the stage while I eat some more excellent food!"

It&#39;s really all about ambiance here. Dark, clubby, retro chic. It&#39;s made to look like a cabaret show might start at any moment. 

I recommend the corn bread, the flank steak, and the hard eight cocktail. Really everything we had was good but those are the ones that stood out.

Although we walked down to The Inventing Room for dessert, our neighbors brownie marshmallow sundae looked extremely appealing. We will be back to try it out!"

Great ambiance and decor, and the food is bomb! Tried the duck wings, chicken and waffles, and spring cheese incident! All delish! Drinks are a little pricey...Beware. But it&#39;s a posh spot.

The reason for only 4 stars is because the spring cheese incident clearly does not come with enough pita for all the dip! We had about half our dip left and asked for more pita. They gave us 4 little pitas and charged us an extra $1! I think the dish just needs to be served with enough pita to support the amount of dip, right!?! Chef if ur reading this, please make that change!!!"

It was a new experience for mostly everyone but not one that I would say I would do again. This review will be for both dinner and show.

Dinner: Each waitress only has a couple of tables in their section. The bigger the party the more you will get ignored. So if you don&#39;t like your meal or have an issue with it you will probably have to wait until the check gets there to speak up. Or at least that was our case. 

 Food: If you are into not everyday meat then you will like it here. Lots of options from elk to duck to made in house ketchup. If you like normal food with out the odd ingredients then eat before you come or just get deserts. 

Drinks: Expensive 


The manager who we had the pleasure of talking to was extremely apologetic for the meal not being to our expectations. He took it off our bill and gave myself and my boyfriend free tickets to the show. 

The show: 
If you are planing on sitting in the lower section come early or reserve your spots!!! The stools that they have are extremely uncomfortable and your butt will be falling off of it. 

The actual show was good entertainment and was fun to watch. Would have been even better if they had better drink prices."

Must have been confusion among the waitstaff, but they apologized profusely and even brought the whole table a delicious amuse buche AND shots for everyone, free of charge and without us even complaining or asking.  And - I was impressed by this - the waitress noticed I was drinking a club soda, so the shot she brought me was actually non-alcoholic juice!

I had heard a ton about Ophelia&#39;s, but for some reason imagined it being really, really far away from Coors Field (where we live), but nope, it&#39;s seriously right there. Where the old sex shop used to be! I finally got the chance to check this spot out when my girlfriends took me here last Sunday, as we were celebrating my birthday, for the cabaret show. From start to finish I was so entertained, that is just a fantastic, amazing, sexy show. The performers were having so much fun, were so comfortable in their bodies, and really looked just phenomenal. It was an empowering experience, and really made my birthday. 

The service was great, the venue was great, the food was great, the experience was great. Five stars all the way. Please support these amazing women and this great venue if you get the chance!"

This place is seriously cool. I went with my friends on a sunday for dinner and I had a reservation, but it wasn&#39;t busy at all. I ordered the fried chicken, which was impressive, but not my favorite. Wish it had been a bit crispier. My friends, who both ordered the bison burger, loved their dishes. I stole a bite, and if I went back, it would definitely be for that dish. Plus the French fries were crispy and perfect. I ordered a drink as well (can&#39;t remember which one, but it had gin) and really enjoyed that. I can think of other places in Denver I&#39;d rather go for dinner, but I hands down would come back for drinks and a show, or just the vibe alone. Such a cool concept and a great place."

Cool venue with live music in the basement. Excellent brunch and no matter when you go, you should order their cornbread.

I will say that it can get a little too crowded. If you&#39;re over 6 feet and/or 200 lbs, you may get a bit claustrophobic. For instance, we had a party of 6 and were crammed into a standard 4-top booth. My enjoyment decreases a little bit when I have to rotate and sit on one (side) cheek for the evening."

The theme is so cheeky! We stopped by on a jazz night, which was an unexpected but pleasant surprise- live music! Cover which was about $10 - a little shocking when we walked up to the door, but once we got in, we saw why. The place looks amazing- tons of comfortable seating all focusing on the bottom floor stage. It was cool! We only had drinks, which are a little pricey when you make the jump from Great Divide&#39;s $1 tasters/makeshift flights so keep that in kind if you&#39;re looking for cheap beers. It&#39;s about $6-$8 for a craft beer (not too too bad, but again...some of us had $1 tasters all night). 

I&#39;ve heard the food is good so I&#39;ll  be back sooner rather than later.

This is a gem amongst the downtown hustle and bustle.  I literally have been wanting to try it out since day 1 of my move January 2016. But when there are so many places to try...well it took me 6 months to get here...but believe me it won&#39;t be 2 weeks before I return. What a cool venue!  So well done. Kudos to the owners, designers, and architects that came up with the concept here. It&#39;s a performance space with the best balance of visual interest and out-of-your-mind delicious food without being over the top too loud to have an interesting conversation with whomever is lucky enough to be next to you. Highly recommend the blood orange bottomless mimosa and the shrimp and grits was so surprisingly spicy, texturally interesting and flavorful I will be dreaming about it for days to come.  Service was excellent and friendly... with someone to top off your pint sized mimosa every few minutes to keep it cold. The music was great...a French loungy group. Easy to listen to but kept our interest! Come on Sunday morning and you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

Looking online for the hot new restaurants in Denver and Ophelia&#39;s popped up! I usually always base my decision in trying new restaurants based on their menu. After looking up Ophelia&#39;s menu, I was instantly intrigued! The variety and not-so-ordinary menu items was refreshing to see. And so it was a must-go for us!

As we arrived, it looked small...until we were taken to be seated past the doorway where we stepped into an amazing overlook of the stage. Yes, a stage for live performers! Our seat was right at the edge of the overlook onto the stage itself. I didn&#39;t know anything of the layout of the restaurant, so I was not expecting that! It had to be one of the best seats in the house! The dim atmosphere helped the mood for the night as well, since our romantic celebration was underway! I have to say this was one of the best looking atmospheres for a restaurant that I have ever been in!

Everyone from the check-in guy to the girl seating us, to the few waiter/waitresses on us were very helpful and polite. Great service here! For our appetizer, we decided to order the bourbon bbq oysters. These were very smooth and went down so fast, nice taste with the bbq as well. The next appetizer for us, was the stout-teriyaki duck wings. These were so delicious! I love crispy wings and these were so crispy and the sauce worked so well with the larger duck wings. The taste was unique and satisfying. For our entrees, we both ordered the brothel burger. Very fitting since this restaurant used to be a brothel back in the day. History is so interesting! ;P The brother burger was superb! It was made with ostrich, Korean bbq, miso candied bacon, ponzu onions, and pickled vegetables all on a pretzel bun. The combination of ingredients here worked wonders! It all was mouth-watering, every single bite was savored! This also came with a side of fries to compliment the burger itself.

The experience we had at this new restaurant was memorable and super exciting! Nothing like I&#39;ve been in before, but in a positive way! The food was wonderful as well! Highly recommend Ophelia&#39;s the next time you are in the area! :)"

Let me say, you are something to stare at. Seriously, I stared at your walls, your ceiling, your downstairs, your lights, the bar, my wife - yes, keep looking at your wife. 

The food was a total smoke show. To my eyes, to my palate, to my slightly overweight belly from last years holidays.  You have won me. 

Who pays $15 for a burger? I do. I do now every time. I have tasted what a bison burger was meant to taste like. You have ruined all my other favorite burger places. I hate you and love you. Oh how I love you.

First: The plantains doused with cotija cheese and a cilantro pesto. What?! 

Next: Scandinavian duck meatballs. By the time you move on to this plate you will find yourself at a loss for words. I&#39;m afraid if I open my mouth the sound of a symphony will erupt and the entire restaurant will break out into dance. 
 
Encore: the bison burger. It&#39;s been 24 hours and I&#39;m still thinking about you. The perfectly salted and peppered patty of what once used to be an innocent animal waiting for its home on my plate. You lived your life well and I take a moment of silence to remember you. 

(Silence) 

Nice little draft selection. Cocktails represented well.  Wines to suit. 

If I could give a restaurant a hug I would. Consider this it Ophelia.  Open those arms wide. I&#39;m holding on forever."

And while yes they have mimosas, and yes, they have a bottomless version, they also have a very delicious cocktail called Diamond Lil&#39;s that I ordered both times. Made with Contratto Bianco, Prosecco, lemon, and bitters it&#39;s refreshing and doesn&#39;t have the cloying sweetness too many mimosas can bring about.  

As for the food, I&#39;ve yet to meet a dish there I didn&#39;t like and I&#39;ve eaten my fair share. From the plantains to the green chili goat cheese cornbread, from the creme brulee French toast to the fried egg and spring cheese incident, and everything else in between I&#39;ve eaten I have enjoyed every mouthful.

Our servers have been nothing but wonderful and it is a goal of mine to make it to Ophelia&#39;s for dinner some time soon. And probs another brunch. That Diamond Lil, guys. So good."

We sat on in a booth for two on the upper floor circling and looking down at the stage.  The best part?  We didn&#39;t even see a show - they were still setting up (and I still immediately said to myself, &#39;damn, this is a great setup&#39;).  Instead we watched some old samurai movie projecting above it while we drank delicious cocktails and ate an epic savory brunch with a pan of corn bread, killer french toast, and some other savory item that made my mouth water but I forget at the moment.

First off, SEX MACHINE- It&#39;s a drink, and that&#39;s the first part of what you should know:  MIXOLOGY.  There are some humdingers of cocktails at this joint, as I should know- I am nursing a major hangover at press time.  My cocktail?  The DIAMOND LIL- A light blend of Prosecco, italian Vermouth, Lemon, and soda over ice.  Excellent,  Because it was a hot day and hotter than HADES inside Sexy Ophelia&#39;s.  A few friends tried the  Sex Machine, a potent concoction with Mezcal and cayenne- a real engine starter.  After getting significantly loose in the lounge, we were herded to our table.

Our server was John and he regaled our table with stories of his tattoos, even showing us some of the hidden ones (!).  Our table ordered just about everything.  The big hits were...everything.  There was the massive plate of Steak &amp; Frites served with a cool fried smashed potato (yum),  the Yak burger, The flash fried Brussels Sprouts and Kale salad, the Belgian Moules were a giant hit- everyone dipped into the sauce, and the Flat Bread did not disappoint.  I had the Arepas - a delicious spiced flavorful take on the the original, served with fries and ketchup spiced with curry,  YUM.

At the end of the meal, John brought our table a platter of the SMOKED SALTED CARAMELS.  Just say &#34;OH MY GOD&#34; three times, it was totally food porn.

Ophelias has been conceived inside the dark and seedy past of  the historic Airedale building (i.e.: this was a VICTORIAN BROTHEL!); the structure first opened in 1889 as Kopper&#39;s Hotel and Saloon. This place is SEXY: chokey jam full of erotic art..... Plus, it&#39;s a product of Linger and Root Down visionary owner-chef Justin Cucci  JUST OPENED OPHELIA&#39;s - APRIL 2015, and of course, we got reservations right away!!!

The downside; HOT HOT HOT- no AC, no ventilation, way past the uncomfortable level.  Reservations were hard as heck to get and to confirm, and the place is a combo night club, which is just so young and sleazy.......However, the food and service does not disappoint, but I likely will not try to go back until a cold winter&#39;s night!"

Reservations at 9pm we get seated at 940. While we are waiting for seats the lovely yet short tempered (no pun intended) bartender snaps are my boyfriend and informs him that he is standing in the &#34;well&#34; and that he needed to move over. To where? Between the 17 people eating and having a conversation. Ok kid.... Turk was his name I later found out. Yeah, take notes man. Whatever you want to call him. Absolutely terrible attitude. If you can&#39;t be nice or even act like you enjoy your job then don&#39;t work directly with the public. I didn&#39;t drive 6 hours for you to treat me like shit. Then the gentleman next to us (whom was seated at the bar) simply waves his hand for attention and the bartender SNAPPED at him yelling that he needed to wait.... Power trip. We were seated and our server was very nice. 
We ordered the kale salad which got a 3 rating from me. Dry and had no flavor. 
Ribs were good. I give them an 8.
The bbq oysters were really good. I give them a 8.
The drink were far from impressive. Too sour or accidentally skipped the vodka. My PG13 was terrible. 

My boyfriend had to get up and ask for vodka to be added since is had none. The bartender looked like a kid running to his parents after that happened. After my already shitty night in this place between the hostess and her distant attitude then from the accidental text of &#34;your table is ready&#34; to being shoved in a booth with no room for you let alone 3 other people. Then the food that I did decide to order couldn&#39;t be made because it was past 10pm. Nice. Reservation at 9 the getting sat at 940 and the regular menu ends at 10. I will never be back. This place is crap compared to my favorite restaurant Root Down. It is a complete shame that they are related.

I am absolutely a fan of this up and coming new restaurant.  However, the food is not as amazing as Root Down.  In case you don&#39;t know, this place is also owned by the same owner of Root Down and Linger.  I love them all, but Root Down is my absolute fave.

I came to Ophelia&#39;s during their happy hour and chose to sit outside.  Before being seated outside I got a quick peek of their dining area.  The place is huge and offers various seatings:  bars, booth, table and a lounging area.  The whole ambiance of the place is lively, upbeat and chic.  I can definitely tell this place is going to get busy quick.

As for the food, it was pretty good and beautifully presented.  My party ordered half a dozen oysters, Belgian mussels, stout-teriyaki duck wings, gigante bean hummus, and the waygu beef slider.  All were 5 bucks a piece except oysters were $2 each.  They all had really great flavors and their ingredients are fresh.

Staff were extremely nice and attentive.  We were visited by one of the manager and asked if we enjoy the place; WE DID."

I want to go back and try it again so I can up the star level. I&#39;m a Jazz singer and many of my musical friends play at venues all around town. My good friends were playing the Jazz brunch last Sunday and a friend and I decided to stop by. 

As I walked by on the sidewalk, I noticed the side walls/windows were open. It&#39;s nice since they don&#39;t have a patio to sit outside because it still gives you that open feel. Many people have said to make reservations but my friend and I didn&#39;t and we were seated quickly and with a table to oversee the stage where my friends were playing. The further deep you go into the place, the darker it gets, but I like that. It&#39;s a great setting for live music, even in the bright of day. We walk in on the second level. There&#39;s a pretty exciting bar and then tables and the kitchen up there. Downstairs was close but we could see there was a dance floor and tables. The restrooms are also located downstairs and they are so cool. The doors are made out of rulers of different lengths and colors. I loved that.

I ordered the sausage and eggs off the brunch menu. It was not what I was expecting as the sausage came on a bed of arugula. I loved the sauce that came with it and I also added some of their house-made hot sauce. I normally order eggs over medium but since there was no bread with this dish I decided to order scrambled eggs. They were ok but definitely nothing special. The menu looked fantastic though. It was hard to make a choice and I&#39;m excited to go back and try something new. 

I also ordered the blood orange mimosa. I love that they have bottomless mimosas for brunch. Next time I&#39;ll stick to the traditional mimosa because the blood orange was ok. 

The sound system is amazing though. And the layout of the upper level seems quite even so everyone has a great view of the stage below. I can&#39;t wait to see more events here and try more of the menu. I also love the story behind the building. I love that there&#39;s so much history in Denver and they don&#39;t knock down old buildings but improve them. It&#39;s so awesome.

went on another evening with girls. The upstairs was crowded, so we went down stairs, got a bottle of wine and some other beverages.

The place has a fun vibe, tasty food, good happy hour. All in all it&#39;s a fun place, but pricey."

I made a reservation weeks ago and when we showed up we still ended up waiting for a table (not long, but still!).  Then they seated us at a table behind the bar that was so close to the ones next to it, I might as well have been at a community table.  Not only could we barely hear each other but they had the door to the street open and I was freezing.  After 10 yells of &#34;WHAT!&#34; in 2 minutes, I asked our waitress if we could move somewhere quieter and I even told her we didn&#39;t mind waiting for another table.  She said we could sit on the patio (yeah right) or stay where we were.  So we spent our anniversary night yelling across the table to each other.  I mean I&#39;m totally cool with loud restaurants, but if I have to speak up, I&#39;d rather not have to do it with other people so close by.  The tables around the balcony overlooking the stage would&#39;ve been more private, I think.

The saving grace was the food, which was all very very good!  The two of us split two starters (peppadew poppers w/ cheese curds and the Spring Cheese Incident) and two entrees (beef sliders and Bolognese flatbread) and it was all phenomenal.  The Spring Cheese Incident was far and away my favorite thing of the night and better than anything I&#39;ve had at Linger or Root Down.  Gah, so good!  We each ordered a drink and those were on point as well.  I&#39;m not a huge cocktail person (yet!) so I stayed safe with the Electric City and it was delicious.  Ended the meal with two salted caramels, which were the perfect dessert bite.

There was a table of five next to us so our waitress kind of checked out halfway through our meal to take good care of the bigger bill and that was so disappointing.  We sat staring at our plates, waiting for her to come over for at least 10 minutes before a manager (I&#39;m guessing) noticed and offered to box our leftovers.  I&#39;m so bummed because I&#39;d been looking forward to going to Ophelia&#39;s since I first heard about it last year, following its progress until it finally opened and it was not what I expected service-wise.  It&#39;s an awesome space (that I can tell a lot of detail went into), with an awesome menu but I&#39;m not all that anxious to go back."

He went reluctantly, but obliged mainly because he knew I had my heart set on trying the Brothel Burger. I had been craving burgers, and he knew I had been wanting to visit Ophelia&#39;s for a long time. 

First things first: it was the most expensive burger I&#39;ve ever eaten. I think this place is expensive just for the sake of being expensive because the bison burger my boyfriend ordered was nothing exceptional. More/better food for the money if you head over to My Brother&#39;s Bar and order their bison burger. 

My burger? It was good. I really enjoyed the first half of it, and I liked the curry ketchup a lot at first. About halfway through, the intense saltiness hit me. I don&#39;t say this lightly either - I salt my food more than the average person. I was wishing I had more water, but the waitress never came back. Then I was wishing the ketchup was sweeter to cut the saltiness a bit, but I could not find relief. We went to a concert afterwards, and I was dying of thirst the entire time. I got home and drank 3 glasses of water. Seriously. It killed the experience for me. 

The service was okay. I hate to nitpick, and if you read my other reviews, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m pretty easy to please. I guess I just expect more attentiveness from such a pricey place. For two burgers and one drink, our tab was $50. That&#39;s insane. 

The vibe was cool. I liked the lighting a lot. Still undecided as to whether I&#39;ll go back."

Ordered the lamb gyro which was amazing. Greasy delicious food. Came with French fries very well seasoned with a tasty curry ketchup. 

This place is killer. Cover at $15 was a little steep but I dig the vibe of this place and their cocktails are tasty if also a little pricey. 

Recommend for a cool night out.

P.S. I want to specifically commend the audio engineers. The mix was phenomenal. Absolutely impressed with how good the sound was without being way too loud. These peeps were seriously as talented as the bands on stage."

Inside - 5 stars! You can&#39;t stop looking around. The restaurant/bar looks like cabaret meets Tokyo. There&#39;s old, vintage Playboy-like decor of women (this place used to be an old brothel...so it makes sense, and I love that they kept that part of history in the restaurant). The bar top looks like a bunch of pinball machines linked together, and they are all lit up, with comic book themed visuals. The lighting throughout is trendy and fun. Plenty of seating and very spacious. There is also a stage that every table can see for when they are playing live music. Most of the furniture is lounge furniture or booths which I love because it&#39;s so comfortable.

Food - I couldn&#39;t stop eating! They have the best hummus plate I&#39;ve ever had! It was not only served with pita bread, with with cooked carrots, cucumbers, watermelon radishes, dates, and a couple other foods for dipping. We also had their duck wings which were so flavorful (and I don&#39;t even like duck that much) and it was served with a sesame ranch dressing. I had the beer cheese &amp; broccoli soup which was very hearty and filling. And the chicken &amp; waffles for dinner! The waffles were mashed potato waffles which was different but good. It also came with syrup underneath which gave it a sweet touch. The chicken was perfectly crispy and served without the bones, which made it easier to eat. 

Drinks - They were good! Nothing really unique or out of the ordinary. They were simple and good and had a nice beer selection as well.

Service - 5 stars as well! Very attentive and our food came out fast. Our server was Stacy and she was HILARIOUS which made our night even more enjoyable. She kept us laughing the entire time and you could tell she genuinely cared to make sure we were happy. Request her when you go in! She&#39;s awesome!"

So the &#34;theme&#34; is kitschy sex lounge.  It feels like a San Francisco bar, or some uber New York bar or something.  There are those movies, where the setting is so unique, you think: where&#39;s that? I want to go there!! There is this awesome pit, with a stage, and tables surrounding the stage.  Then on the lower level, there is the stage with swaggy lounge seating surrounding and tables or seats in front. It reminds me of the Ricky Ricardo lounge restaurants, or the restaurant Uma kicked everyone&#39;s ass in Kill Bill- seriously.  It&#39;s THAT cool.

Every detail deserves recognition. The wallpaper with the super cool guitar designs, the perfect velvety gold couches, the fabulous totally original repurposed bar, the separate but equal lounge areas and the real mid-mod lighting with new style lighting that has its own genre that I don&#39;t know about yet.  It&#39;s cool that the sexuality represented that is cheeky and post modern. The posters are awesome, the bar, the pulp fiction in the window, its like a museum of sexy kitsch. 

Happy hour.The drinks were lovely, and the snacks delish . I had 2 house cocktails and cheese curds which were lovely.  My only complaint is that I wish they had more gin/vodka based drinks, for selfish reasons, I don&#39;t do bourbon.   It seems these hipster spots always have such wild foodie choices that I want them to have some more regular or assured choices that I can imagine how they will taste because I know what it looks like.  I don&#39;t prefer the liquors like campari or herbal liquors or anise liquors, The flavors are too much.  It seemed most of their house cocktails had these in them.  Which goes with the vibe.  I love natural flavors, but am willing to try it all. 

I am going back for dinner, and will update.  Oh yes, I am."

More on that later...
This place came highly recommended by the bartender at Jagged Mountain Brewery (across the road). We walked in without a reservation and were seated IMMEDIATELY in the porch area. I guess everyone else was at Coors Field that night.
The location used to be a place of ummmm... ill repute... back in the day and some of the &#34;art&#34; from that era still adorns the walls.
There is a stage on the lower level with a pit like feel to people watching the stage from the upper/main level. We were told that we could get discounted tickets since we were having dinner, but we declined (didn&#39;t want to spend 3 of our 7 hours in Denver staring at a stage). We did walk around and soaked as much of the pre-concert experience as we could.
Dinner was flavorful. We started with mussels and clams for appetizers.
I got the elk burger (a.k.a. Brothel Burger). It was on the saltier side, but was still good. My GF got the hangar steak and that was really good!
The drinks - we tried a couple - are very innovative yet wonderful
The rest rooms are cool too, with the stalls made from rulers.
PS: The table behind us had a group of VERY SERIOUS older people. Next to us, however, were 5 people of diverse ethnicities having a heated discussion about Star Wars v/s Guardians of the Galaxy. Somehow we joined the conversation, and it turned to politics, to Denver&#39;s social strata to pot to blood diamonds and then back to Star Wars. Even our hostess came and told us that we were adding flair and life to the porch!
Overall, we were very pleased with the vibe of the place, the no-rush, &#34;let me interact more with you than I&#39;m required to by my job&#34; attitude of our hostess, and the location.
Definitely recommend!"

Didn&#39;t bring it up to the manager since the place was so busy and the line was out the door! We were at a soccer tournament and its was a 30 min break and didn&#39;t have enough time plus didn&#39;t want to interrupt their busy lunch, the sandwich went to the trash unfortunately, but I&#39;m sure if I talked to them they will make it right.

Viola, Firehouse sub it is.  It was my 2nd time trying it and was glad that I by-passed others and drove that extra mile to get here.

Today&#39;s pick was Hero sandwich on wheat and with the slice of pickles and assorted sauces to complement my sub, I was very happy to have this as my cheat meal.  As usual,  I enjoyed the mayo and mustard that came with the sandwich and finished up with the sweet and hot bbq sauce.   I had to mop up this great tasting sauces using the bread I want gonna eat.  Hey.... I know it is a cheat meal but don&#39;t have to eat all the bread.  Thanks to marvelously delicious sauces, didn&#39;t have much bread throw away.  It I was at the subway, I would had no problem throwing away the bottom piece of bread.

By the way,  staff always greet you with &#34;welcome to firehouse&#34; and...  they will bring you the meal to your table.  I forget the guys name bit he was very polite and courteous. 

Taste,  quality,  service, character. ..  i wouldn&#39;t mine paying bit more for great subs.

I though Subway had questionable employees and lax hygiene standards but today I found a new low. I repeatedly questioned the employee about the ingredients, as I am a strict vegan. After satisfying my questions (asked respectfully by the way) I ordered a fully loaded veggie sub, sans cheese and mayo. Should have been simple, except the sandwich took the girl about 15 minutes to prepare and then she complained that it was an &#34;intense sub&#34; and that is was difficult to prepare. Okay... I don&#39;t understand how an assemblage of veggies on bread is any more of an undertaking than putting socks on feet.

I returned home to find the bread buttered and melted cheese throughout. The veggies were greasy and smelled disgusting. I had to keep my car windows down to get the smell out.

I called and they hung up on me first when I asked for the manager. When I called back they said he was busy and hung up again.

To add to my losing money on a disgusting, inedible sub, I noticed no one was wearing headgear and the manager was never wearing gloves as he handled the food.

Altogether this seems like a corner-cutting franchise with poor business and hygiene practices. If you want food, go elsewhere in the shopping center and leave Firehouse out of your stomach."

Namely they always put pickles on the side of my sandwich despite requests in multiple spots not to.

Now I really hate pickles and even though they put them in a bag I can still taste pickle juice that has made its way onto the bread. At least the second time they didn&#39;t include mustard. 

I would try a different location if you have the choice. I enjoy Firehouse Subs but the staff at this location can&#39;t seem to read a ticket."

Its really a great place for a lot of reasons. The ambiance is excellent, and the service is ALWAYS prompt, knowledgeable and attentive.

The food- exciting, flavorful and inventive. There is nothing ordinary on this menu, but it has the idea of something solid i.e the fried rice has delicious pork belly and a soft boiled egg to mix it all together. Recommend you order a bunch of plates and share it all, great opportunity to try. If you have a picky eater in your group, don&#39;t come here.

Cocktails- One of my favorite cocktails in Denver is here, New Saigon. You have to try this if you have any tastebuds! Its peppery, fresh and refreshing, you&#39;ll be shocked how much you enjoy these even if you are not a gin drinker ( i am not).

Happy hour/Rooftop- If you can get here for HH, do so. There is an awesome rooftop patio, with drink and limited food service. Pending weather you could stay all night here.

Tips- Make a reservation for the weekends, parking can be tough in this area so either valet or uber."

I&#39;m a bit of a weird person, so the opportunity to eat at a restaurant that was once a mortuary was a must! Originally named O&#39;Linger Mortuary, now Linger Eatuary... I fell in love with the concept, atmosphere and layout of Linger immediately upon entering. 

The food was fantastic and I loved all of the different options. For my drink, I ordered the Texas poinsettia, which was a drink I was introduced to in Oklahoma and have decided to start introducing it to various places I go. Well, Linger didn&#39;t disappoint. A strong pour that used actual cranberry juice, not cranberry cocktail. Delish! Linger also has a fantastic rooftop bar that provided a pretty swell view of Denver. I&#39;d definitely returning on my next visit to Denver. A must visit!"

Menu is very eclectic, incorporating lots of items from the current &#34;Hot List&#34;.  (So glad that every dish didn&#39;t incorporate kale.)   However, if you are a &#34;trendy&#34; eater, they have at least 3-4 types of Bao on the menu, and Asian-Mexican inspired tacos, etc.   

The menu spans the globe with items from all continents.  Linger puts it own spin on all these selections using some local ingredients and ingredients from other cultures .

We went for brunch on Sunday.  I ordered the Adobo Pork Benedict.  My faves of anything &#34;Benedict&#34; are the sauce and the runny poached egg.  Unfortunately, both of my poached eggs were on the verge of hard-cooked.  While I was slightly disappointed, the braised pork was tasty, as were the refried lentils, fried plantains, and chipotle hollandaise.  The &#34;dosas&#34; coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled awesome.  Menu says they have them on the dinner menu.    I&#39;d give the place another try."

Linger was a 2 hour wait for brunch after church which made us all the more grateful for the reservations we had. We did get to the restaurant early so we headed to the rooftop bar for mimosas and some sunshine. A relaxing space, I can only imagine at night it is a gorgeous view with the city lights. 

Once our reservations came up, we were seated in the dining room. The server offered both still and sparkling water. He also asked if we had any allergies or preferences. We had one gluten free and one dairy free. The menu had both. 

For a starter, my friend said I had to try devil horseback. It is bacon wrapped dates stuffed with herbed goats cheese. It came drizzled with a sticky sweet sauce. These were oh so good. Smokey sweet is a bedeck combination. I would highly recommend getting these. 

For my main meal, I tried the dragon bao bun: tempura fried avocado with radishes, asparagus and rice puffs. It had some sort of mayo and sweet sauce as well. The avocado was a bit bland and I would have preferred a little bit of salt or spicy. The sauce was also not prevalent. I have to say that the bao buns were delicious and not the styrofoam texture that you typically get. They definitely tasted fresh and were the highlight of the bao. 

A hip option with something for everyone, Linger provides a fresh taste. I wouldn&#39;t get the dragon bao again but there is many other options that would entice me back."

Since we were in Denver only a few days, the only time we could fit this place into our schedule was for lunch. Kind of disappointed, but their rooftop was not open During their lunch hours. Anyways, our waiter was really friendly and knowledgeable. We split their pork belly as well as chicken boas. We also had the sesame beef tacos.  Great Asian inspired flavors! Also had the Italian donuts, which kinda didn&#39;t match the rest of the menu but the hazelnut mousse was super rich. The food was excellent and my boyfriend would probably even say it was his favorite thing he ate in Denver."

We came in just a few minutes before 2:30, which is when they close until dinner. We were seated promptly at a table in the shade with a great view. The restaurant itself has a retro vibe with a VW bus serving drinks on the rooftop. I ordered the fried chicken bao bun ($5) and the crab cake Benedict ($16.50). I thought the bao was amazing--I especially loved the special ranch sauce and kimchi! The Benedict came with a small side kale salad and potatoes. The crab cakes were pretty good but not great... couldn&#39;t help but compare them to the crab cakes I&#39;ve had at D Bar, which I really enjoyed. 

While nice, our server was not very prompt nor attentive. Both of my dining companions agreed that the service was seriously lacking. I would like to come back and try some other dishes, but would be hesitant because of the less than stellar service we received."

Linger used to be a mortuary which is a good thing because the drinks are stiff. Tons of great food creations to explore but if you come between 4 and 6 during happy hour they are only $5!

I got The Dragon Bun with tempura avocado, The Sesame Tacos with wagyu short rib, The Sriracha Honey Duck Wings and The Devil on Horseback which is a delicious combination of bacon, dates and goat cheese!

Beers are $4 during happy hour I got a couple of those too!

Prepare to wait for a LONG time, it gets busy. The upside is you can wait on the rooftop with a drink and take in the Denver skyline. It had a beautiful view of the city, plenty of places to sit, a bar, and some food.  If you want, you could spend the entire evening up there, especially if you&#39;re in the mood to mingle. 

Downstairs, we were tucked into one of the intimate tables in the back. Its got a funky, hip atmosphere with low lighting and nice window views of the neighborhood below. Lots of drink choices, and plenty of local stuff. 

Food was an interesting mishmash of Tapas style dishes that fuse together different cuisines for some tasty little creations. I think I loved everything I tried, and it&#39;s extra fun to go with some friends and share. Our waiter was great, very attentive and helpful. Also, that popcorn they give you to snack on before your meal? Genius. I never thought to put cumin on popcorn before, but now I&#39;ll probably do it at home thanks to Linger.

It&#39;s definitely on the expensive side, but it&#39;s worth it for both the food and the atmosphere. I&#39;d love to come back."

I&#39;m not sure if maybe we didn&#39;t get the best advice this time around but we ordered the octopus salad, I love octopus, and it was so fishy- I&#39;m not one to not finish a meal, especially not one that size, but we couldn&#39;t eat it- too fishy! The Duck Bun was really good and the pot stickers were solid but nothing to write home about. The Masala Dosa was huge, I&#39;d recommend that if you like Indian flavors and it&#39;s vegetarian. The Argentinian beef fajitas were probably my favorite- it&#39;s also a larger plate, but pricey for &#34;tacos&#34;.

Went down to dinner in the restaurant and had nice bottle of local red wine, New England fish tacos, smoked eggplant soup in a bread bowl, Vietnamese Crepe and Marsala Dosa.

The service was really excellent. Our waiter and other servers kept apologizing for the back-up in the kitchen, although we hadn&#39;t noticed any delay. Our food came out hot and delicious. The BBQ Duck Bao Buns are to die for. Everything was really amazing. If you don&#39;t have reservations, you can still head up to the bar seating area and grab a table, so don&#39;t be discouraged to go because you don&#39;t have reservations.

The food was very good! It ranges from from a lot of regions (i.e Asian to American) and my boyfriend and I chose an Indian crepe dish (cannot recall the name) and it did not dissapoint.

They tell you a reservation is necessary.  Yeah, it&#39;s busy but you really don&#39;t need one.  They will get you seated which is a huge plus!  And when the windows are open it&#39;s a cool wait.

I love the location, the building, the roof top! It has amazing views!  Most of the food is pretty good and the topless mimosa&#39;s are great! 

I HATE the fact that they don&#39;t give you regular glasses when you&#39;re on the roof. This past weekend we ordered a non-alcoholic drink and the lady brought it to us and seriously leaned in to tell me to be careful with the glass.  WTF??? Am I five?!?  It was a little offensive!  With the price points there, I think they can afford a new glass should it break. 

Our waitress sucked! She was incredibly slow... it was insane! I originally ordered a Michelada. Once it got to me I noticed they put Dill in it. Some people like Dill but I don&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t drink it.   Our waitress came to the table and didn&#39;t say a word when the drink was sitting towards the end of the table. I ordered a Coors Light instead and it came RIGHT before we were leaving. 

Again, most of the food is good and worth it. If you&#39;re looking for Pancakes, hash browns, sausage and other traditional breakfast foods - this isn&#39;t your place.    I don&#39;t know if Hipsters eat Pancakes and sausage for breakfast but I&#39;d like to see it on the menu."

Mongolian BBQ Duck Buns - The was so fluffy and soft. The meat really stole the show though. It was so tender and flavorful, keeping you wanting more. The sauce it was cooked in was a delectable blend of flavors. 

Breakfast Banh Mi - I enjoyed the meat in the bun so much that I needed more, so I got this dish. It has the same meat but it was on a french baguette with pickled vegetables, cilantro, and a bit of pork belly. This was just as good at the buns, the flavors intertwining perfectly.

We came in for brunch today and were immediately put off by how loud the music was (is the DJ necessary for brunch?) but the interior design is hip and cool and totally Highlands if you get what I mean. I ordered the green horchata and the crab cake Benedict, my dad got the dosa, my mom ordered the adobo pork Benedict as recommended by our server, and my boyfriend ordered the cubano sandwich. 

The green horchata was pretty bad. It had weird sour notes and the kale texture was a weird addition to the drink. Let&#39;s leave the horchata to people who know how to prepare it. 

The dosa had a sour aftertaste that made you question whether or not the batter was rotten and there were too many flavor profiles going on that didn&#39;t melt together seamlessly with an overall sweet note. 

The adobo pork Benedict was good, but the side salad it came with was unnecessary. I did like my crab cakes even though they were burnt - the restaurant gets busy so I didn&#39;t want to bother the server by sending it back. The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was also really good. There was a salad with the crab cake Benedict with sliced apple and that was pretty good too. My boyfriend&#39;s sandwich definitely took the cake though. Solid sandwich, but you could probably get something similar elsewhere for much cheaper and probably better tasting. Also, we subbed the side that came with the sandwich for house fries which they didn&#39;t tell us would be sweet potato fries. Not a big deal, but just so you know. 

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t come running back here, but I also wouldn&#39;t be too angry if a bunch of friends wanted to go here for lunch or dinner. It&#39;s a just okay place."

The Linger Eatuary

I am generally a food first reviewer. Some of my favorite meals have been from some of the sketchiest no ambiance dives and I have often been bored by beautiful food in beautiful spaces.  However, Linger is such a remarkable and unique dining environment that the food, as good as it is, is inevitably upstaged by the environment.   

Linger is built in the complex that once housed the Olinger mortuary complex.  Like being built on an ancient Indian burial ground the mortuary past would normally be something that most establishments would hide.  Linger does the opposite and leans into the past.  If Beatlejuice was a restaurant it would be Linger.  It is a stylized view of death that is dark but joyful. They embrace the morbidness with bar tables converted from the rollers from the cadaver drawers (non-technical name).  They have also left the original mortuary sign on their rooftop unaltered except for neon letters to accentuate the words they want you to read.  The rooftop is amazing with great views of downtown Denver and the never ending line at little man ice cream. The drinks on the rooftop bar are served out of a converted RV because they do not do anything normal.  

Oh, by the way, we actually ate there too. They serve global street food that is meant to be shared. The dishes ranged in taste from good to great with their buns and potstickers being tasty but not memorable and their Ginger Chili Shrimp and Masala Dosa being outstanding.  We were served by a friendly waiter who was as knowledgeable about the menu as he was about the history of the venue.  He even had stories of late night haunted hijinks that were probably fake but added a whimsical Disney&#39;s Haunted Mansion level of theming to the evening."

The menu showcases dishes from a number of countries so it&#39;s pretty fun to decide what type of food you&#39;re in the mood for. A friend ate a masala dosa (Indian), while another ate baos (Chinese) and I ate a Vietnamese version of a masala dosa which was basically a crepe with veggies. All of the food was delicious and generally ranged from $14-20ish/dish. Service was excellent and wait time for food was not bad at all. Also making corny jokes about lingering didn&#39;t really get old so that was a plus. 

I will say that if you&#39;re a picky eater, this is not the place for you. Another member of our dinner party doesn&#39;t really deviate from her regular diet of chicken fingers, pizza, pasta, etc. and she had a lot of trouble ordering from the menu. She ended up eating a whopping $9 bowl of ordinary mac and cheese from the kids menu that was the size of a side order. She was pretty unhappy."

The fried rice was full of flavor, and surprisingly light. Lots of veggies in there! We had the bacon wrapped dates...omg, soooo good. Oh and the buns are AMAZING! My personal favorites were the pork belly and duck. Was not a huge fan of the chicken. I can&#39;t even remember what else we had, but we had a lot and it was all so freaking good. I loved that almost all of their dishes can be made gluten free - this made me love the restaurant even more. We made reservations through opentable so didn&#39;t have to wait or anything.

After hearing about it from my client, I decided to check it out with a co-worker!

I started with a Grapefruit Daiquiri. It was as refreshing as it sounds, but not overly sweet. The server explained that they add lime juice to it so that its very fruit forward. The house popcorn was brought after we ordered. The popcorn had a house bbq spice and was a nice start while waiting for our food. However,  the popcorn was full of old maids so we only ate the top portion before giving up.

For our entrees, we ordered the Ginger Chili Shrimp, Seared Diver Scallops, and Sesame BBQ Tacos to share. The scallop entree had 3 scallops, so the server recommended that we add an additional one. It was a perfect amount for the two of us. I really enjoyed the Seared Diver Scallops. The scallops were very fresh and seared perfectly, served on a bed of saffron orzo. It had a drizzle of olive vinaigrette which added a nice finish.

The ginger chili shrimp were pan fried which was disappointing as the menu didn&#39;t allude to the fact they were fried versus sauteed. However, the ginger chili combination with the Green Papaya Salad brought some freshness to the dish. 

As anticipated the wagyu in the Sesame BBQ Tacos was very tender and juicy. But I found the guacamole on the top of the tacos to lack flavor.

The atmosphere was fun. Our server was great and attentive, but I think we just misordered from the menu because my experience didn&#39;t live up to the hype I&#39;ve heard about. I&#39;d go again, but definitely only order the Scallops again."

The service was consistently friendly, and was on-point bringing around anything I wanted, and since it was all you could drink/eat type of party, you know I was keeping people busy.  First off, it was my first visit to Linger, and found the area to be much different then it was a decade ago.  I&#39;m not sure how long Linger has been around, but I believe this used to be a mortuary.  The area now looks like downtown SF with the type of new buildings and hills you would see there.  I felt right at home, with the type of people that were attracted to this party, independent professional women looking good, and successful entrepreneurs younger then 36 years old; sure it was a Gen-Y party.

I was able to sample many of their offerings, and was impressed with their steamed buns, and sliders, but found others feasting on their fish tacos.  A few craft beers were hitting the rounds, like a bitter IPA, and an apricot ale, but was most impressed with the craft cocktails circling.  The Moscow mule was on-point, but the Corpse Reviver #21/2 made with Absinthe and slew of other liquors was amazing normally $11, but for me (FREE).  The drink not listed on their menu that was made with Turmeric was most interesting.  

A lot of the drinks names have a dark-side twist to them, and I became a firm believer that the placed is haunted, when I turned my back to my beer, and about 10 seconds later it mysteriously flew off to the ground, yet no one was around me   The next day my computer did some extremely bizarre rare things, I&#39;ve never seen, and when I turned on the TV Ghost Adventures was on, and the guy was talking about something followed him home.  Coincidence, I don&#39;t think so!"

The atmosphere is so cool and very hip without trying too hard. It still feels casual enough that you could come in jeans. I really liked how the menu is broken down into different categories and is more small-plates style. It allows you to try a ton of good food you wouldn&#39;t normally consider.

We went with the pot stickers, corn dogs, and chicken b&#39;stillah. The corn dogs were good, but seemed to have a ton of breading. Nothing special. Now I normally would never go for an African dish, but the chicken b&#39;stillah was great! It was sweet but also filling and really a unique taste. The pot stickers were DOPE! Man oh man P.F. Chang&#39;s microwave shit has nothing on these bad boys. They were so flavorful it was insane. I&#39;d honestly contemplate coming back for just a couple orders of those. 

The Taiwanese shaved ice was good, but nothing to rave about in my opinion. I ordered the green tea flavor, which, if you do, you better really really like green tea. Very strong flavor that I simply wasn&#39;t a fan of. But it was well prepared like the rest of our food. And I appreciated the popcorn while we waited and how they spaced out our dishes!

Such a cool spot and definitely a &#34;must&#34; if you&#39;re here!"

In addition, the restaurant embraces diversity of food, people, cultures and life with dishes from all over the world.  This is one of three that he owns with similar farm to table concept (RootDown and Ophelia&#39;s).  Each of the restaurants has been transformed from a prior business or site.  Linger was a mortuary converted to an appealing and lavish restaurant, with ruminant reminders of the mortuary, like the Formaldehyde water bottles on each table.  Likewise, RootDown was an old gas station and Ophelia&#39;s was transformed from a brothel to a bar and music venue.  

The restaurant focuses on customer service, beginning with the complimentary valet service.  Just because it&#39;s complimentary, don&#39;t be a douche and tip the hardworking staff.  I&#39;m pretty sure this is a common occurrence, based on the fact that the valet guy politely reminded us that the valet is free and that tips are appreciated.  The stellar service extends into the restaurant with our waiter acting professional and genuine.  They are so determined to make a memorable impression that they made a second Pad Thai dish for us to bring home.  Due to the loud ambiance, there was a miscommunication and our leftovers were not boxed.  Best part is that the manager requested a remake without even asking us, even though we didn&#39;t fuss over it.  Of course the waiter was apologetic.

We started with a couple of drinks as usual, the New Saigon and French Quarters, both awesome in their own way.  Also, popcorn is complimentary to snack on while browsing the menu.  I ordered the chicken Pad Thai, which deviated from the traditional version by including green papaya, mustard greens, pickled vegetables and black bean sauce.   It was a tasty version of the same old that is served everywhere else.  To be diverse, we ordered the Spanish Strip Steak from the Euro section.  The meat was very tender and again the complex ingredients used resulted in a delicious entree with a diverse flavors.  The sliced steak was placed atop of spaghetti squash, olive tapenade, romesco, Swiss chard, pine nuts and currents.  An awesome melody of flavors.  We finished off the night with tasty doughnut holes, which Janet loved.

If you haven&#39;t tried Justin Cucci&#39;s restaurants, you are missing out, as he is currently one of the  premier chefs in Denver."

I would love to come back during the summer. 

The menu has so many vegetarian options and also offer vegetarian versions of many of the dishes, which make it so easy to order! We got way more food than we could finish, but there was just so much I wanted to try on the menu. 

We got the masala dosa, the dahi puri, a couple of bao buns, the brussel sprouts and my bf got the lamb tacos. I was quite impressed at how accurately flavored the masala dosa and dahi puri were - they tasted quite authentic with a twist. The bao buns were so soft! They just melt in your mouth - I definitely could have eaten a few more. The brussel sprout salad was my least favorite - I wouldn&#39;t order this again nor recommend it to anyone. Was way too cold and flavorless for me; especially with all the food we had ordered beforehand that was bursting with flavor. 

I really enjoyed the vibe of this place and the ambiance. The decor was also pretty cool, with pictures of old Indian films lining the walls and signs written in Hindi and English. I would definitely visit again and recommend this to friends."

We arrived on a Saturday at approx 2pm, not overly crowded waited maybe 5-10 min for seating with a reservation.  The kitchen closes at 3pm to shift over to dinner service, wish we had been able to order off the afternoon menu as the brunch offerings weren&#39;t exactly what I was interested in.   When asked about the roof deck, we were told that the roof deck was only open for cocktails at the time

Friend had the Bahn Mi sandwich, I had the Chorizo and egg tacos.  

Everything was tasty and well prepared, it just also felt a little bit like they were trying too hard to be edgy and out there with some of their flavor combos and profiles.

Would love to visit again in the evening hours when I&#39;m back in town, but it&#39;s not something i walked away craving it."

Start with the cocktails - all amazing especially the Grapefruit cocktail. 

The food is segmented by cuisine type - there were 4 of us and we all chose 2 each as well as all of the Baos. 

Everything was amazing. Some of the favorites included the Fried Rice, all of the Baos, Pork Belly corn dogs, and Lamb (I&#39;m not much of a veggie guy but they were all delicious too)!

100% put this on your list when coming to Denver or looking for an evening out. After your meal be sure to go up to the roofdeck for another cocktail and the view! (And if you can stand the line outside get some Little Man&#39;s Ice Cream)"

Here at Linger,  for dinner it&#39;s the family style dining where you order a bunch of food and share. 

So we shared the following: one of the best if not the best chicken Padthai ever! So flavorful and just simply stunning in taste. The steak was uniquely presented and my drink was stiff. I had my bourbon with one ice cube and that&#39;s really what I needed. A no frills drink. I shy away from girlie drinks most of the time. They&#39;re too sweet!

The service was impeccable. I think there&#39;s three bars inside. One in the main dining room and a small one on the way to the restroom to your left. And an upstairs one. We were told that they&#39;re  opening a rooftop bar around April. 

I suggest making a reservation ahead of time. They are busy!

The highlights were the Sesame BBQ Tacos, the Bao&#39;s, and Potstickers.  Cocktails were really good, especially the one with charcoal, and our bartender was fantastic.

The second day, we sat on the roof . Its a great rooftop with tons of seating.  The happy hour specials are pretty awesome and well priced.  We more cocktails, which were great, and more food.  The beet salad was the highlight this time.

Mortuary turned &#34;eatuary.&#34;  We grabbed a table for the 4 of us on the rooftop.  You get to eat right next to the massive Linger sign and a old hippie bus that&#39;s up there.  I think the bus is actually the wait station.

For drinks, the ladies got the chipotle margarita concoction.  My lady wasn&#39;t a fan, it was a bit too spicy for her.  I had ordered the Bourbon Smash and we all liked it.  Bourbon with some orange bitters.  

The food here is kind of like a tapas place.  We had 4 people and we ordered 7 different plates.  You MUST get a bao bun!  I had 1 of each kind: the duck, dragon, and pork belly.  We got 4 of the Wagyu Sliders (2 per order) and they were really good.  Not too big at all.  We got the Potstickers too.  There were 5, so I doubled up for myself.  Good, but nothing super special.

We hung out after eating for a few more rounds and enjoyed the view.  There is a brand new apartment building across the street AND next door.  It kinda screws up the view of downtown.  Definitely a bummer!

The rooftop is beautiful at night, from the couches you can see downtown Denver, but from the restaurant side the view is mostly hidden by a few buildings. My favorite part of the roof is the giant O&#39;Linger neon sign, it&#39;s so much fun to see that close up and dine underneath. The other fun item on the roof is the food truck! How did they get that up there!! The food menu up here was street food from all over the world, there are enough items to choose from that we could probably go here at least 5 times to try it all! The food is all pretty much small plates but bi enough to share. There were four of us in our party and we ordered 8 small plates and were completely stuffed! We tried the sliders, the bacon wrapped dates (I could just eat these and die happy, we ordered 2), shrimp tacos, Mongolian BBQ buns, the cassava empanadas (also extremely delicious), the chickpea perfect bites served with a chutney, and the sweet potato fries. It was a fun tour around the world with these little plates! I would order everything again! Now onto the best thing about the rooftop. HAPPY HOUR!! It&#39;s 5 nights a week from 4-6:30 and we got some killer deals on the food... all those plates we just $5 each! The best way to get your money&#39;s worth here and eat and drink to your hearts delight! The cocktail menu is also $5 during happy hour and I highly recommend the Diablo, with tequila and ginger beer, it&#39;s just amazing! I love this place and am also totally impressed by their practice of sustainably, and support for local farms. I will definitely add this to my favorites list in Denver!"

It&#39;s impressive that they can successfully offer so many different types of styles of food in a more or less coherent fashion. Overall, not perfect but many more hits than misses and I&#39;m very much looking forward to coming here again. 

&#34;Mongolian&#34; Duck bao (5-): Was expected something more in your face but the bao was surprisingly balanced. Plenty of moist, flavorful meat--not overly seasoned or saucy--on top of a bao that wasn&#39;t too sweet; greens on top offered some nice brightness, and the sesame seeds on the bao were a nice touch. Could have maybe use a bit more brightness or something with a bit more wow factor. 

Pork belly corndogs (4): A rare case in which all the components of the dish were extremely good, but ultimately I couldn&#39;t decide if all went together. The crust on the pork belly &#34;dog&#34; was nicely crispy and the meat was delicious and juicy. However, the seaweed salad was a bit too tangy and spicy (not that I&#39;m afraid of heat), clashing a bit with the other elements on the plate. Condiments were extremely bold, with strong distinct flavors; I preferred the miso mustard while my date preferred the togarashi catsup. Eating it all in one bite was a bit much for me. 

Steelhead trout (5): Fish was very nicely cooked. In contrast to the corndogs, the complexity here is really thoughtful and really pays off. Plenty of nice surprises and in this dish you really want a mouthful with all the components on the plate. 

Masala dosa (4+): Nice presentation with the Indian crepe wrapped around the potato and peas filling forming a giant log. Typical Indian flavors on the potato fillings, but the crepe was pretty unique in my opinion, not that I&#39;m an expert on Indian cuisine. A touch of tanginess with something like fried cheese in the dough. Traditional or not, it was delicious. Standard sauces: something mint chutney-esque and then a tamarind (I think) chutney. The latter was described by my date as &#34;extremely earthy&#34;; for me, it had a distinct herbal quality that was reminiscent of Chinese watermelon frost. Surprising, but it worked with the dosa. 

Desserts (5): Taiwanese shaved ice, described by our server as something more like snow. A pretty description, actually, and more interesting and delicious than it sounds. The cheesecake with tapioca also exceeded my expectations, and I think the addition of the tapioca into the cheesecake filling is quite brilliant and unique."

We didn&#39;t have a reservation so we went to the fast casual order window and got lucky enough to find our own seat with a good view.

I think service was a bit off that night because they were hosting a private event or something.

Also, when you order at the quick service window they make the drinks you ordered right then and there and it really slows things down. This could go faster if they just change up the logistics a bit. 

The buns here are fire! So yummy! We got the duck buns and the chicken buns - both really yummy. I like my buns chewy and these guys do it well.

My FAVORITE order was the siracha honey duck wings. Wow. Just delicious! And actually spicy! 

We got the sliders and those were really meh. Wouldn&#39;t spend money on those again.

I&#39;d love to come back and eat downstairs with an actual server because I think the experience would have been much better------ UPDATE

An amazing spot for date night or perfect for a smaller group!

Food:
With a sort of tapas style dining experience, Linger continue to knock it out of the park with amazing food, delicious drinks, and a one of a kind view of the city that&#39;s to die for!  The last time I was there our waiter offered us an amazing strategy to attack the varied and ever so delicious menu:
Go with a group. (lets say 4 of you)
Each order 2 menu items 
(If you&#39;re feeling daring each order 2 things from the different globally inspired regions on the menu)
Share!
This way you get to taste a good amount of the fresh and delicious food they offer.

STAPLE:  ALWAYS order the Devils on Horseback and Pork Belly Buns...always....you think I&#39;m joking...I&#39;m not....always.

The Venue:
Linger has a very modern, hipster and just flat  out cool vibe. It&#39;s the kind of place you just wanna hang out at and get a drink. After dinner you have to make your way to the rooftop! It can get pretty crowded but if you&#39;re lucky (or just determined) you might be able to snag a table at the open seating part of the bar (which is an old silver camper on the roof...awesome). Seriously, don&#39;t leave without checking it out!

PRO TIP: 
Make a reservation. If you walk up expecting to get a seat right away good luck. It&#39;s probably not gonna happen. However, don&#39;t shoot for the prime dining hours. I like to go a little later, around 7:30ish, that way, after dinner you can head to the roof for an amazing view of the city as the sun is going down.

REMEMBER....Devils on Horseback and Pork Belly Buns....always.....ALWAYS!!!!!!!!!!!"

There&#39;s different tastes on the menu like from Asia, americas, carribeans, etc so it&#39;s great for someone who&#39;s indecisive. 

We ordered the duck bao bun and the pork belly bao bun, lemongrass pot stickers and masala dosa. 

The duck bao bun was alright, nothing too special. The duck meat is shredded and that takes away from the whole duck bao bun since most I&#39;ve eaten had the skin attached since that&#39;s the most flavorful part.  The pork belly bun was better since it was seasoned better, but still a bit too tangy for my taste. 

Lemongrass pot stickers were good but a tad bit spicy. 

I don&#39;t know what the hype is with masala dosa, I did not like it at all. The crepe is way too sour and the stuffing inside was a bit plain.

I took my best friend from out of town to Linger to sample some delicious food and drinks!  With the view of downtown skyline in the backdrop, it&#39;s simply the best place to be for Happy Hour!  The menu has changed a bit since last time I was here but there&#39;s still plenty vegetarian friendly options.  I was a little sad to see the falafel wraps are no longer on there.  We ordered fish tacos, roasted beet salad, sangria and Gin Collins.  I really liked all the wonderful flavors in the fish taco but the fried potato skin was kind of a miss.  It did give the taco a needed crunch but it also made it taste greasy.  Crispy Brussels sprouts or tortilla strips might have been a better alternative.  The roasted beets were very tasty with cashews and curry flavored crispy rice.  This was definitely the place to show off the best of what Denver&#39;s culinary world has to offer in a more causal and approachable way!"

We went for the rooftop view, only to learn they don&#39;t serve the roof at lunch. We ended up with a open-air, window seat instead, and it was amazing. The 70 degree breeze was blowing in while we dined and watched the people outside.

We started with beer. I ordered a delicious apricot beer that was the hit of the table. My husband switched over after his first round. It was refreshing, but not too sweet.

I ate the beet salad as my entrée, added chixken, and had the dragon Bao bun. The beet salad was fresh, colorful, and with the right amount of crunch.  If you like beets, this is the way to go. The dragon bun was so unique. It was sweet, crispy and moist, like a Chinese bun stuffed with fried avocado. I could have eaten 5 of them,  but I would have exploded.

The beet salad, 1 Bao bun and 2 apricot beers left me more than satisfied  (read full).  So glad we found this spot whole driving through Denver."

Coming from LA I can&#39;t say I was super impressed with their food... but given that Linger is located in Denver I can&#39;t hold that against them too much.  I tried a few food items and their homemade lemonade! 

+Beet salad was really good.  If I go back to Linger this is the one must have dish that I&#39;d order again.

+ Short rib tacos-  Pretty good but I&#39;ve had better in Cali.

-Dragon bun.  Didn&#39;t really like this.  Seemed soggy and too saucy.

The breakfast tacos were incredible - highly recommend. And, you obviously can&#39;t go wrong with bottomless mimosas.... Am I right, or am I right.

It was over an hour wait to be on the rooftop, but we stopped in up there and could see why - it&#39;s beautiful! Luckily we got a table inside near an open area, so we could still enjoy the nice weather.

I&#39;m actually happy we sat where we did, because Joe Y was an AWESOME server. Super friendly and accommodating. Give that guy a raise!"

The food (including gluten free and veggie options) is 75% organically sourced, and they list many local and sustainable partners on the menu. The ambience is cool and hip, (I just learned the building used to be a mortuary!) and they have a rooftop bar with a great view. The service is always stellar despite how busy it is. Surprisingly, none of those factors are what keep us coming back.

Of course it&#39;s the flavors!

The menu consists of small shareable plates, although a few are larger, and is organized by regions of the world. For example the &#34;Asia and South Asia&#34; section currently features food from Thailand, Vietnam, India and Japan. Since I only visit once a year, I don&#39;t know how often the menu changes, but I&#39;m really glad they still serve the masala dosa. So crispy. The potato filling is perfectly spiced as is the mint chutney that comes with it. I&#39;ve eaten hundreds of dosas in my life and this one is in the top 5. The Colorado lamb kebab and fatoush salad were also among last night&#39;s favorites. 

But don&#39;t let me sway your menu decisions. To paraphrase our waiter from last night: just read the menu and order what calls to you. Everything is delicious. If there are 2 people at your table, get 4-5 smaller items and share them. If you&#39;re still hungry after that, get more!

Your dinner won&#39;t be cheap, but neither will the quality of your meal. The fresh ingredients, perfect portion size, and expert seasoning will make your taste buds happy, even though it&#39;s a bit of a splurge."

Zero percent chance you would ever be expected/able to eat while staring at nasty pornographic images of men all over the walls, but it&#39;s still A-OK to parade women around like that. I&#39;m so embarrassed for people who think this is sophisticated, artistic or avant garde. The sexual exploitation of girls and women is hardly a new idea. It&#39;s just the same old tired brainless non-sense from the stone age. And you call yourselves liberal Denver! #trumpmoments #zerotolerance #endrapeculturenow
The view is great and except for the porn, the ambiance is lovely. The food was tasty &amp; innovative, but way over priced for the portion size. After spending $25 for a few bites of food, I went around the corner to a coffee shop bc I was starving. Pretty silly considering I only weigh 130lbs and I&#39;m not that big of an eater in the first place.
If they remove the porn, apologize to women and girls everywhere, and make a donation to a rape crisis center, I would change my review to 4 stars. Otherwise, I would never go back."

I just moved to Denver and was so excited to try this spot--I&#39;ve heard many good things! After arriving right at 8:30, we were told we could wait for our table at the bar. There were no seats at the bar, so we found a chair and proceeded to wait for another 30 minutes. When they called us up to tell us our table was ready, we waited a few more minutes. They apologized for the wait and said they&#39;d be bringing some &#34;treats&#34; for the inconvenience. 

When we got to our table, it was soaking wet and had a pepper shaker but was missing the salt. The waiter brought us complimentary sparkling water, which ended up being our &#34;treats.&#34; We ordered two cocktails--the French quarter, which was a little sweet, and the Thai old fashioned, which was good. We loved the popcorn they bring to the table instead of bread. As far as small plates go, we tried (and enjoyed) the BBQ duck buns our favorite!), the honey-sriracha duck wings, potstickers, and the dosa. The dishes are a bit expensive, but portions are generous. 

Wish we&#39;d had a warmer welcome, but all in all the experience was pretty good."

It&#39;s at a good location, great view of the city if you&#39;re out on the rooftop, and small bites from around the world that you can share among your party. However, a lot of the more &#34;unique&#34; dishes were Asian inspired, and being that we&#39;re a party of Asians, these dishes were extremely pricey and didn&#39;t seem worth it compared to what we can get normally.

Nevertheless, this is a really cool experience. Make a reservation because this place can get really busy really quickly. This place is a mortuary turned restaurant but you won&#39;t get that vibe at all considering how hip this place is. 

We tried the dragon bun, devils on horseback, masala dosa, ginger chili shrimp, falalel lettuce wrap, and the pork tenderloin and pupusas. My favorite of the bunch was the devils on horseback. The dragon bun was good but not worth the price for just 1 piece. Ginger chili shrimp was standard, nothing exciting about it. The pupusas weren&#39;t bad although I&#39;ve had better. The masala dosa was a disappointment because there was way too much of the potato filling compared to the size of the dosa. I had a bite of the falalel which was different but very tasty!

TLDR: wasn&#39;t too impressed with the food but the experience was fun. Make a reservation and check out the rooftop for a cool view."

I am so glad we made it in here on our short Phish stint in Colorado. We had a group of 8 of us around 8 on a Thursday and the place was jammed. The service was top notch and drinks were delivered quickly, food was ran from a few different peeps, and everyone was super friendly. I want to say our server&#39;s name was Adrienne, maybe it wasn&#39;t. Regardless, she was fabulous and I applaud anyone serving a large group of drunkards/whack jobs/indecisive people.

Dang, the cocktails were AWESOME. Half of us got the new saigon. SCRUM. Love gin. Especially when it&#39;s with thai basil, cucumber, and jalapeno. So flippin good. We got a few of those. The red sangria was also excellent.

Food: mostly everything was delicious. The menu is separated by cuisine; Asia, Africa, America. Cool. I like it. Love when there are so many vegan/veggie options. Half of us are vegetarian and it really is wonderful when everyone has a lot of things to pick from. Denver rocks for having so many vegetarian friendly restaurants. I started with a dragon bao bun. SO good. I really should have had at least 5. Tempura avocado, k sign me up. Two of my favorite things in the universe. They are $5 and only come with one, and I wanted a lot more, hence not ordering 5 buns. So good though. Most of us got one of those. My friends got a compressed watermelon dish. I snagged a few bites. Delightful. Fresh watermelon, goat cheese, cucumbers, mint pesto, some other groovy things. Awesome. Loved it. We got an order of sweet potato waffle fries, because we can&#39;t often say no to fries, especially sweet ones. They were average, nothing spectacular. In comparison to everything else, doesn&#39;t hold a candle. Sure, they&#39;re only fries, maybe that&#39;s why. A few people got the cheese curds and shishito peppers. I was expecting more from this dish. Cheese curds were too done we thought and not many peppers. Alright but wouldn&#39;t order again. We got a roasted beet salad which was one of my favorite dishes of the evening. The flavors came together wonderfully and everyone enjoyed this one. My pal got the fried rice and I tried some of that, was amazing. The true standout though was the masala dosa. Oh my goodness. Not sure what to say about this dish. Everyone was &#34;    &#34; about it. First off, it was HUGE, which is great because we all shared two of them. Second off, oh wow, the flavors were just so sexy in my mouth. Every bite was heaven. It reminded me of samosas and I flippin love samosas. This was phenomenal and I highly recommend everyone get this. Or two orders. Beware, it&#39;s very large. 

All in all, can&#39;t wait to go back here next time I&#39;m in Denver. It was on my list of places to go for a while and I am thrilled we finally made it. With so many outstanding veggie restaurants in Denver, this one really stands out at the top of my list. Great layout and ambiance, excellent service, fabulous drinks, and phenomenal food. Love it. Thank you."

Frankly, I think their brunch menu lacks variety.  I had a fried chicken bun and I swear the chicken inside looked exactly like a chicken finger from Sonic.  

I do like the atmosphere at Linger - it&#39;s sleek, quirky and has different dining rooms.  

The most annoying thing was having a 2 p.m. brunch reservation and being told at 2:45 p.m. that the kitchen is closing and you can&#39;t order any more food.  I think that policy demonstrates a lack of consideration for guests.  I understand that Justin Cucci&#39;s restaurants are very popular, but, having policies that slight customers like that shows that he thinks he&#39;s bigger than the dining scene in Denver.  

My experience with Linger was disappointing and I doubt I&#39;ll be back again.  Hospitality and consideration are non-negotiables for me in a dining experience.  Linger fell short in a major way."

This spot used to be an old mortuary and now it&#39;s turned into an amazing spot for drinks and food! A foodies haven!  When my buddy told me about this spot I was so intrigued. I&#39;m weird and twisted so this was a treat. Linger, Root Down &amp; Ophelia&#39;s are all sister restaurants. And each had their own unique thing about them. Linger, has a dark setting inside, mood lighting with a sexy glow. We sat upstairs at the lite bright bar. Yeah, you saw those pic and it is the coolest thing ever! The other tables upstairs are actual rolling tables they used to roll dead bodies into the incinerator! Behind the bar, you will notice little things like an old fashioned meat grinder. Their bottles of water are old formaldehyde jars.  My friend mentioned jars that had strange oddities inside, but I didn&#39;t see them.

Onto the food and beverages. This menu is so unique and I couldn&#39;t decide on what to get. When I saw the pork tenderloin and pupusas I was sold. I haven&#39;t had pupusas in ages and they are a favorite comfort food of mine. Fine an El Salvadorian spot and get a pupusa and thank me later. I had an open mind so I knew this dish would be different. Out it comes, three mini pupusas with the pork tenderloin on top, sesame seeds, pomegranate seeds and pumpkin seeds adorn this plate. My mouth was salivating before I could even get the food in my mouth. The aromas of the pork and pomegranate were intoxicating. I cut into my dish and was sent on a roller coaster of flavors. The pork was so tender, while the pomegranate gave it a nice sweet tarty flourish in my mouth. I was literally in heaven. Of course, I had to share with my friends. This meal looks small, but it will fill you up! I got lucky as they had a cider. It was quite refreshing without the major sweetness. After dinner, we went up to the roof top bar. Picture this, an RV that has been gutted and turned into a bar. Yes! I know! I didn&#39;t get a pic of it either! You can enjoy beverages outside while over looking downtown Denver. You can look at the original sigh that says, &#34;Olingers Mortuaries&#34;. The souls must Linger about still. I highly recommend you bookmark this spot and give it a go on your next trip to Colorado."

After my visit today, I can fully agree. The atmosphere itself is enticingly eccentric and very decorative with fun wallpaper, an open kitchen area, huge star shaped lanterns, and cozy gray booths lining the walls.

The service is outstanding and if dining with anyone who has dietary restrictions, they are more than willing to walk you through different menu options and ensure that you&#39;re satisfied with your order. 

I went to brunch with a friend and had the house coffee, and the adobo pork Benedict. I&#39;m pretty picky about my eggs benedict but this one rose to my expectations. The first thing that catches your eye is the spicy chipotle hollandaise sauce slathered on top of braised and tender pork, piled on top of grilled plantain patties. The eggs were poached perfectly and sprinkled with black beans, which added a fun texture to the overall dish.

You can&#39;t go wrong with the menu. Linger seems to pride itself on taking traditional dishes from just about every culture and fusing it with a traditional brunch menu for a touch of uniqueness that will attract any diner.

Will definitely be back for happy hour and I&#39;m looking forward to visiting the sister restaurant Root Down as well!!"

My boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town (California) and wandered upon Linger while looking for dinner. We sat upstairs and enjoyed a lot of really delicious, eclectic food and lots of meaningful suggestions and advice from our servers. We were encouraged to try the Taiwanese shaved ice by a few people so we gave it a whirl and it was Amaze-balls! We promised ourselves to return to this place on our last day in town to revisit this delicious dessert.

And that&#39;s just what we did! Sadly, we were informed the second time around that the machine they use to make our new favorite dessert of all time broke down in the process of making the dish! To say we were disappointed is an understatement; we had both been looking forward to another Taiwanese shaved ice all day. 

When the waitstaff found out that we were out of towners hoping for one more delicious dessert before we left, only to have the machine break down, they did everything in their power to make it right - they brought out a tasting of three of their other delicious desserts AND gave them to us free of charge, unsolicited but much appreciated.

We were greeted by the hostess. I didn&#39;t get her name but she had dark hair and some facial piercings. She was shockingly brusque with us, to the point of being openly hostile. The negative start overshadowed our experience. The other people working at Linger&#39;s seemed perfectly nice and the food and drinks were fine. But we spent most of our stay chatting about how we couldn&#39;t believe the hostess was so abrupt and rude. After finishing up downstairs, rather than staying for drinks on the roof, we decided to go to another place. 

When we left, we overheard another group also discussing how rude the hostess was to then and we commiserated with them briefly. Perhaps the hostess was just having a bad day.

From 4-6:30 they offer one of the best deals I&#39;ve EVER seen.  $5 for a wide array of delicious and unique sounding cocktails, international wines and domestic and imported beers.  In addition they have a fantastic and eclectic selection of happy hour appetizers...and ALL of them sound amazing!  So what was a solo business traveler to do in this situation?  order 4 or course!  I tried the cheese and shishito peppers, the short rib tacos, the dahi puri perfect bites and the wagyu slider.  Every single bit was pure bliss.  Seriously.  Every single bite.  Really.  My cocktail was the New Saigon...my mouth waters when I think of it...gin, cucumber and some kind of chili.  It was the perfect balance of heat and cucumber with a heavy pour of gin.  I sat and nibbled and of course got some funny stares as the plates kept coming, but everything was worth the judgy looks.

We shared the lemongrass pork potstickers, wagyu beef sliders with a side of sweet potato waffle fries and the devils on horseback - dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon.  The portion sizes were perfect to try a few different plates and the tastes were just amazing and so unique.

I highly recommend this hip, neighborhood hangout - such a great experience!"

We decided to come for lunch and had three dishes: soy chorizo tacos, the breakfast dosa, and the long bean salad. Such inventive plates!! It&#39;s so exciting that it&#39;s not just boring eggs for breakfast. I&#39;ve never had long beans in any other form except in Asian style, so it was interesting to taste these long beans with fried shallot (a nod to Asian flavor), grape tomatoes, and feta. The breakfast dosa was equally delicious, with a crispy dosa outside and tender eggs on the inside. The chutney didn&#39;t taste quite authentic (a touch too sweet and ketchup-y), but I was super hyped to have this dish for brunch. Finally, the soy chorizo tacos were probably the most mundane of the dishes, but tasty nonetheless. The potatoes that came with it were amazing!!

I definitely want to come back here. Despite being opened by a white guy, Linger gets the world flavors right."

We ordered a bunch of food, and to be honest it was all very sub par. I got the fried rice, with added chicken. The rice was undercooked, they didn&#39;t offer or tell me about any other sauces I could get with the rice, then we got some sort of ether pain dish which was a complete joke, it was runny and served in a bowl. Anyways. The server was nice, but our water cups where empty for about 15 minutes before I had to ask for a refill, and
She seemed rushed and didn&#39;t want to talk to us. She wasn&#39;t very helpful when asked about the food as well. (They where not busy)

The restaurant is a converted mortuary and is embraced by the restaurant by calling itself &#34;Denver&#39;s Finest Eatuary&#34;.

The food focuses on modern American cuisine.

The Crab Cake Benedict ($16.50) contains two large crab cakes loaded with crab and not much filler onto English muffins. Hidden underneath the poached eggs and Old Bay hollandaise sauce are chunks of avocado which compliment the crab. It is served with a fennel slaw to slice through the richness of the benedict, and home fries giving the dish a &#34;fish and chips&#34; feel to the dish, in a very tangential way.

The Adobo Pork Benedict ($13.50) has a distinct Latin twist. Mounds of braised pork and poached eggs slathered with hollandaise sauce are loaded into plantain sopes with lentils. A side of slaw helps to cut through the richness and fattiness of the pork and hollandaise sauce. The black beans add an earthiness to the dish.

The Roasted Beet Salad ($10) has an Indian type twist to it. Paired with chickpeas, red onions, cashews, peanuts, lentil &#34;noodles&#34;, puffed rice, tomatoes, quinoa and raita. There were too many things going on in this salad, which just didn&#39;t come together for me. The star should have been the beets, but got lost among the stronger flavors of the other ingredients.

The Fried Chicken Bun ($5.50) is a take on Korean fried chicken being paired with kimchi. The togarashi ranch took the sandwich in a totally different direction however. The honey sambal wasn&#39;t necessary as the dish already contained spice with the kimchi and togarashi. The bun itself was a little doughy. The magic of Korean fried chicken is the amount of crunch since its fried twice. With all of the &#34;wet&#34; ingredients this was lost.

Linger seems to be one of Denver&#39;s more popular restaurants. The lines were long and the place was packed, even on a rainy day.

The menu is quite eclectic with a slant towards Asian dishes. I think the menu is a little ambitious, as some dishes weren&#39;t well executed. Perhaps slimming down the menu just a tad would help focus on execution and have all dishes run on full throttle."

The rest was simply mediocre. Drinks are a little  overpriced- $8 for a can of regular cider seems a little excessive. The wait for the order seemed to be way to long (to place it &amp; to receive it) I love the sweet potato waffle fries but by the time I got them they were cold. The BBQ tacos sounded delicious and had great potential except they lacked one thing - BBQ.... Also they were a little to soggy and ripped the tortilla. Corn Dog was good and I enjoyed that very much. So that way the highlight of my night.
Overall- if you&#39;re in that area - I would recommend it for the view - the food not so much."

We absolutely loved this place! We ordered the BBQ tacos which were fantastic. The dollop of guac really made the flavored mix together with the wagyu short rib. In Texas, everyone doubles up the corn tortilla because we all know what happens with one.. That&#39;s my only suggestion for the tacos and they did start to fall apart.. We also had the sweet potato fries, don&#39;t worry the chipotle ketchup is what made the fries. Simply delicious together! 

I highly recommend taking any out of towner here, as I saw a ton of value and good memories made here."

Not perfect by any means but a pretty good sandwich. I ordered the turkey bacon ranch sandwich. Ended up being around 11 dollars with chips and drink which is a little more then subway but it&#39;s a better sandwich. My only complain is that they tended to over do it on the ranch a bit my sandwich falls apart about half way thru but I suppose I can ask them to go light on the ranch or put some on the side it could help. I think I like which wich better but this is definitely more affordable.

I think Hubs favorite sandwiches is becoming to be from this establishments.  Furthermore, this establishment is close by where we live.  Every single time, he said, can we go here.  In addition to that Hubs said, they offer MORE variety as compared to the other Sandwich establishments in town he used to go.  Hence to this establishment we went &#34;again&#34;.  This time around for TO GO ORDERS are :

*  LARGE Engineer ($8.49)
*  LARGE Steamer with Wheat Bread ($8.49)
*  Capt. Sorensen&#39;s Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken ($5.89)

Our Dinner TO GO with tax was about $24.82.

Overall, Hubs like it.  But this time around, if I am NOT mistaken, my order of LARGE Engineer, do not contain the Hot Pepper, when we requested for it to be in my order.  *SIGH*  Maybe they are swamped with the Dinner RUSH Hour.  Maybe this is an isolated incident.

Nevertheless, they still received 3.5 stars in our books due to the variety that they offer.  The service is fast.  Perhaps next time, when we return, I would rather have my order, dining in, though I can be torn about this decision.

It&#39;s always busy during the lunch hours. It&#39;s usually packed from 11am-2pm, so expect a little wait. The staff here is super friendly,  they call your order by your name,  not just a number. 

One of my favorite parts about this restaurant is the various selections of hot sauces that they offer for you to try.  They&#39;ll give you cups to pour it into. 10 is really a 10!

One big thing,  try to eat it fresh,  does not taste as good after 30+ minutes of take-out, so try to stay at the restaurant and eat it there. This is speaking from experiencing it two times.  The only sad part is the price can be a bit steeper, but it tastes great!"

What I found was really mediocre.  I have to start by saying the customer service here was really very good.  The employees talked up the subs and made sure I knew the favorites and what went standard on the sandwiches.  After some thought and debate between the New York Steamer and the Steak and Cheese, I tried the steak and cheese on wheat.  I have never been much of a combo guy so I opted for the sandwich and a cookie.  The cashier was great and gave me a water cup without having to ask!  I waited a few minutes in anticipation for my great hot sub to steam and toast.  What I got was a puny sandwich and a pickle dwarfed by a giant plastic basket.  Looking at the sandwich I had to ask myself where the meat was as I couldn&#39;t see it from the sides.  It looked nothing like what they advertise in their pictures or on tv, just a plain wheat roll.  The guy behind the counter pointed to a huge selection of hot sauces to add to the sandwich.  I took one bite and realized that the sandwich was pretty flavorless.  I went and grabbed one of their sauces and proceeded to eat the sandwich down in about five bites.  So sad... The cookie was really good though.  From the other reviews here I expected something more than I got.  Maybe this was a fluke but at nearly 7 dollars for the small (they call it medium) sandwich I feel ripped off.  There are too many other options near by to waste your money at this place.  Mc Alisters across the parking lot has sandwiches with at least double the meat I got for the same price.  What a bummer, it might have been a fluke, but I am not sure I want to give them a second chance to leave me feeling still hungry and ripped off."

Employees were obnoxious, cussing and complaining about how they couldn&#39;t wait to get off work. I gave the cashier my military ID so I could get my discount, she looked at it, then have me my receipt. I asked if they aren&#39;t doing the discount anymore and she said I had to be in uniform.. I told her I never heard that before, every other firehouse gives it to me.. But I let it go, it&#39;s a nice to have anyway. But what annoys me is she didn&#39;t say anything when I presented my ID. What&#39;s worse, there were 2 managers at a table near by that did not interject. They were working on reports.. Don&#39;t they have an office?

I had the Smash Burger with fries, and overall is was a very nicely prepared meal. I could tell the meat was cooked fresh as the patty wasn&#39;t perfectly round; there were some crumbly edges. I like this because it takes away the manufactured nature and feel that other burger chains can have. The burger being served open is also a nice touch. It lets you add on more condiments if you want. I didn&#39;t though. The Smash Burger was good on its own. Finally, the fries were the thin shoestring kind, so be prepared for that if you enjoy a thicker cut fry.

The staff is really nice and helpful here, and burgers are ok, nothing special. Sometimes they are cooked just right, but other times they are either too well done or undercooked. I&#39;m not a big fan of the egg bun thing either. The buns here aren&#39;t good. They should at least toast the bun. Sometimes they pile way too many onions on the burgers. The grilled and fried chicken sandwich is not bad. The value for the cost is average here, not terrible and not great.

What I don&#39;t like about this location is that sometimes it smells sorta like sewage/sulfur inside, and on days when it doesn&#39;t smell bad, the bad smell from before is still there. Not sure where this smell is coming from. This kinda turns me off from going here lately."

The classic burger has great flavor and a great tangy sauce on it.  The fries are skinny and come with seasoning if so desired.  Right across the street from the hospital makes it a great location to get in and out for lunch quickly.

Even better if you walk as parking is limited due to construction"

The food was great, don&#39;t get me wrong, I love smashburger. there is just nothing significant that sets this apart from the others. it looks like they&#39;re building a landing for the tram here so this place should get a lot busier here in the next year or two. smart location, smashburger. 

It looked to be minimal staffing here, a total of 3 maybe 4 workers. the dine area was a bit dirty, saw a half eaten but sitting on the floor, not sure how long it had been there but no big deal. 

Overall good experience, we accidently came here for opening day a few months ago, didn&#39;t even know it was like that but we were planning on a different restaurant in the same area and decided to come here instead. Service was quick, workers were polite. I didn&#39;t get jalapenos on my burger like I asked but that was a minor thing."

I have NEVER had a good experience at this location. They never have enough staff, and are so disorganized, you end up waiting for your food forever. Ordered online today at 11:30am for pick up at 12:00pm. Waited 10 min to be addressed/acknowledged then waited another 10 min to get my food that had been sitting on the counter, not under a warmer. So, not sure if it had been there for 45min, but it was cold, and i could not wait for them to re-make it, as I only had a 30 min lunch, which is why I ordered online. This place repeatedly has had the worst service. Do not go to this location!"

First impression was, &#34;I&#39;m eating in a strip mall off of Colorado Blvd?&#34;, but that feeling dissipated quickly; nice warm entrance from the cold outdoors, low-ish and intimate lighting, rather clean, and was very busy (which was in and of itself quite reassuring.) We were greeted authentically with a nice big smile and proceeded to order, and while ordering, other staff felt free to make fun recommendations. Menu had a nice array of healthy options, including &#34;veggie frites&#34; -- green beans and carrots in long shapes like fries!

While waiting for the food, there was plenty of marketing/decor around the restaurant to learn what &#34;Smashburger&#34; is all about.... biggest thing is the great info about the beef itself. 

Food arrived, wasn&#39;t as ordered, but the server was VERY apologetic... I didn&#39;t take a picture of our food because neither were truly photo-ready, AT ALL..... but both tasted amazing and that&#39;s what packs them in... not about presentation, certainly! I would recommend, however, that they work on this, as other fast-casual places are much better at presentation....  HOPDODDY at Union Station is a great example. My mushroom, swiss, truffle oil burger was delicious, but it looked flat, colorless, not appealing at all... but tasted amazing!

Loved that patrons cleaned up after themselves and helped staff with table turnover -- people could tell the staff needed a little help....

Perhaps i&#39;ll come back when it&#39;s warmer to check out that patio with a beer (nice that they serve beer, further differentiation from fast food)

Cheers!"

The place was bright and comfortable, the folks very friendly and the food incredible. Don&#39;t miss a chance to frequent this establishment. You will not regret it. I was only in town four days and three of them, I ate at three different Smashburger locations. All of them were incredible!

One of my best friends works at Children&#39;s Hospital. He had a root canal so I wanted to bring him a milkshake to make his day better. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t get off work so I just thought I would do a shot in the dark and see if there was any way Smash Burger would go above and beyond. I talked with the manager Cherl who was so kind and she ended up running a shake over across the street to my friend. Obviously they don&#39;t normally do delivery, but this was a special occasion and showed how dedicated they are to their customers. 

It made my friend&#39;s whole day. He was so happy. Thank you Smash Burger for going above and beyond!"

I heard from another Yelper friend (thanks Samantha) that there was now one near the hospital complex in Aurora and needing a few dinner options this week, I tried it.

It is small and quiet at dinner compared to Boulder, which can be a mobbed at this time. But the food was fresh and quick and the staff incredibly friendly and I heard that lunch and shift change times are their &#34;rush&#34; hours. I would absolutely eat here again when in the area.

My Colorado chicken burger was $7.50 and the cheese was inconsistent and dropping all over the place (not in a good way). It was pretty oily and wet which made my lettuce limp. The chicken costs more than getting their beef. I&#39;ll stick with beef next time if I try it again.

It&#39;s clean inside and workers were friendly. The burger bun has a nice texture (not too soft and not dry) but I couldn&#39;t get over how messy and unappealing the burger was. I&#39;m not sure if the juices are from the green chile or the cheese. The chilis had a subtle kick. The burger was slightly salty for my taste."

I&#39;d never been before, my guy and I decided against our better judgment of our usual whichwich. We like to try new things!
I&#39;m veggie so...okay black bean burger, I can dig it. 
Nope. Ok so the smash part, I guess I get it but the portion of my pattie that was within the bread...was about a quarter of an inch while the rest of it that fell around the outside of the bun was probably an inch. It fell apart, everywhere. I cant even say that it was grilled...it was the oddest pastey texture. I also added blue cheese, I think I saw a crumble in there somewhere...maybe. 
Also, I have to order fries separately? My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and we shared an order of fries. 18 bucks??? Should have gone to red robin, better quality food, same price and unlimited fries. 
BUT I will say that the ladies working up front were on point, handling the rush with smiles and ease. Also the only reason I&#39;m giving 2 stars. But no, never again SmashBurger."

I thought that I was cleverly hitting up a spot that we don&#39;t have at home, only to find out that there is a location in the Chesterfield area just outside of St. Louis!  Apparently someone does not get out of the city enough...
I enjoyed the experience.  Service was fast and friendly.  To see what their namesake specialties were all about, I stuck with the smash burger and smash fries.  I was not disappointed!  The burger was pretty traditional, but generously portioned and perfectly cooked.  Lots of toppings and a soft egg bun made it even better.  However, the burger is eclipsed by their amazing house fries...rosemary, olive oil, and garlic...YUM! I added pepper and was in love.  I used a little ketchup on a few bites, but it didn&#39;t need it.  They are thin, crispy, and bursting with flavor.  Very upscale for a casual burger joint.  
They have one those soda machines that you can mix and match any flavor combo known to man.  What is it with those things?  I am endlessly fascinated, and I&#39;m not even a big soda drinker.  They are good fun for a kid at heart.  Of course, it broke down momentarily while we I was waiting for my food, and it took three workers to figure out and correct the issue, so I guess they can be a hassle as well.  
Smashburger is another good addition to the ever growing list of casual burger chains popping up everywhere.  My only concern would be eventually oversaturating the market with so many options."

The beer list could use a little work, as others have mentioned. Nothing amazing going on there, I unfortunately had to order a coors light, which I drink plenty of but not when I&#39;m having a couple beers with dinner. They did have a rotating New Belgium tap with Citradelic IPA so I moved onto that afterwards but that doesn&#39;t bring up the quality of the beer offerings too much in my opinion. 

This was the night before the fourth so it was dead which usually deters me, I think a restaurant operates at peak performance while busy. However, the service was great along with the food. I was thoroughly intrigued with the decor/setup of the bar, there is a large patio and miniature cornhole is a pretty damn good idea. We will definitely be coming back.

Service is good and drinks are fast, but the arepas take a little bit of time (especially if you&#39;re dining with 11 others). The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had, no joke, and I really enjoyed the chicken and queso arepas. I recommend getting the sauce on the side so that you can dip both your arepas and fries - you definitely won&#39;t regret it."

The sliders were pretty salty but tasty over all and I loved their seasoned regular fries...the sweet potato fries looked great too. 
We were trying to find somewhere with vegan options and this turned out to be a really good choice with their salads and the plain arepas are vegan which are served with the salads. Awesome!
I enjoyed their mango/black bean salad, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember the name of it.

Or globeville if your a native(  just kidding) Is really worth a try... So first too all the parents out there this a bar not resturant I brought my 1 year old and 3 year old which was a  mistake they don&#39;t have high chairs or booster seats.... By the hip decor and innovative menu I thought It was restaurant.. No sweat though they were super slow and the Bartender\waitress did her best to make the kids comfortable.... So the arepus are there specialty and they are top notch... I highly recommend the dinner special it&#39;s available after 5pm you get 2 arepus and sweet potato fries for 10$...I got one  chicken and one steak ..  The chicken was better than the steak it was a little overcooked but still edible.. The avocado sauce is amazing and covered up the mediocre steak.
.The portion is a little on the small side so you will need 2 arepus... The sweet potato fries were awesome super sweet and well cooked...There a mulitple choices on this menu for arepus so you should able to find a combination for most people... They also have burgers which seemed delicious also..."

The food is fantastic, we started with the Shishito peppers and while I would have preferred more of a crunch to them, they flavor was outstanding. The Toastdor Arepas with a side of plantains was my choice and I was not disappointed! First of all, these plantains were legit. By far the best I&#39;ve had in the States and I would revisit Will Call for those babies all by themselves. The Toastdor was also delicious, I wish it had come with a few more pickled onions though!

Service was great - it was a really quiet afternoon for them but our server was a super chill dude who was friendly, but not in a fake way, and helpfully answered the few questions we had. 

The venue itself is pretty awesome, the patio with the fire pits will definitely become a regular thing for us this summer! Inside it is a really open, well laid out space which is a nice departure from a recent, common trend in Denver restaurants where you&#39;re elbow to elbow with everyone in the room. With no better way to describe it, it has a very industrial/Indonesian feel to it with the decor. An awkward description, I know - but it&#39;s a cool space, just trust me! We even saw a table that had mini corn hole built in!"

Nobody seems excited to work there...but they should. They always have a great selection of craft beers but now on to the arepas. Wow. As a Latino, I have a high standard for this type of fair and they nail it with a modern twist. They are cheap during the week for happy hour. Great sauces. try the plantains and sweet potato as sides.

There&#39;s a Great Divide neon sign and there just a few block from Great Divide&#39;s barrel room; yet none of their beers.

The good is everything else about the place!  The space is big and open and bright, especially if it&#39;s nice outside and those big patio doors are open and those arepas are crazy good.

Cons,
The bartender serving my friends and I seemed to be ignoring our section of the bar and only tending to his friends on the other side. 
Lack of service has become a normal thing around restaurants in Denver so I wasn&#39;t too worried... until the bartender completely forgot the glass of Cabernet I ordered and even charge me for it in my final bill.
This is very disappointing since the food and drinks are good and reasonable and it&#39;s very close to my house.

I hoped the pork was a bit more tender, it was difficult for me to rip through it on each bite. Although the dish does not look big, it is quite filling.

Will Call is one of the first bar/eateries to open in the new Industry development on Brighton Blvd (its been mostly office use until now). I really dig this place. It has a very dark/cozy/industrial feel. Plenty of big booths, bar space, and some communal tables. They also have a decent amount of TVs for your sports watching needs..but they arent obtrusive like many sports bars..I think this will become a frequent place for watching sports for me.

The tap list is pretty good..mostly local/CO beers, good seasonal, and variety. I went with one of the two Tommyknockers they had on tap. For food they have a nice menu..plenty of appetizers, burgers, etc. The main attraction here is the arepas though..and mmm are they good! I split three arepas with a friend (Point, Call, Huevo). All of them were very good but I would say the Call and Huevo were the best. Each arepa also comes with a side. We got the sweet potato fries, guisado soup, and plantains. I really am blown away by this place..I just went to NYC for a work trip and had supposedly the best areapas in the city there. While they may have had more options there Will Call is definitely better. The sides were even amazing. Probably the best plantains I have had and I even liked the sweet potato fries (I never like sweet potatoes)!!

While it wasnt very busy (kinda late sunday night) the service was great. The bartenders were very friendly and fun to chat with. I am really looking forward to coming back here to try more arepas and other things on the menu!"

You MUST have it with the avocado salsa. I work in the building so I often times have lunch or dinner here. By far the best chipotle sweet potato fries ever! And SO excited that they have deep fried plantains as an alternative choice. Both sides are amazing. 

I usually order my meal to go, and they take longer than I&#39;d like, so that&#39;s the only downside. This place is very affordable for what it is. You can get an entire meal for under $10. Their cocktails are more expensive! 

I&#39;m definitely a regular here.

Update: sooo I came here for take out.. And ordered the dinner special with plantains.. And they gave me four. FOUR!!!! When normally they&#39;d fill my plate up with them!! Such a disappointment. On another note, my husband said the bison burger I ordered was extremely salty. And he loves salty. Even HE couldn&#39;t eat it. Must be a bad night. smh"

Date of Visit: 12/19/14

I must caveat this review by saying Will Call was quite new, so maybe they&#39;ve stepped up since. Tried this place out as it was newly constructed and very close to my last apartment. The decor is very cool; a mix of neighborhood bar and trendy nightclub. The drink list was not spectacular, but offered a few good beers and some crafty cocktails. The service was also excellent, including both bar and kitchen staff.

Where Will Call fell flat for me was the food. We ordered the chicken wings (Mango Habenero sauce), and the classic arepa w/chicken. The wings were pretty disappointing, as was the arepa; not much seasoning for either. 

If Will Call can get their eats up to speed with their drinks and service, this would be 4+ stars for sure!"

I admire the fact that Will Call seems to be a spacious, open concept sports tavern that breaks the mold by serving totally unique and delicious Venezuelan food. Standard American sports bar food really does not impress me at all, but WC&#39;s arepas are seriously nomz! Yes, nomz with a Z. I&#39;ve eaten lunch with friends here on two different occasions on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the open, low key vibe of that time of day.

The Awesome.
- They describe their arepas as not-quite-taco/not-quite-pita, but I think they&#39;re perfection.
- Quiet at lunch, but open late at night too (2am I think.)
- They have gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions
- The pairings of sauces/chutneys and arepas stuffings are brilliant. I LOVE the mango. 
- Specifically I recommend the house RiNo and Call style arepas.
- You will also be pleasantly surprised if you are a sweet potato fry lover. They seem to be salty and sweet. mmmmmm
- Will Call is very well-priced, although you may want to order 2+ arepas if you&#39;re used to the giant portion size of American sports bar food.
- Cocktail choices are also decent. I&#39;m interested in their happy hour in the future...
- The staff is super friendly and gives great suggestions - so ask away!

The Critiques. 
- One friend I brought mentioned that the empanada appetizers were so-so, but I&#39;d like to try more on the menu too. 
- Not very vegetarian or vegan friendly
- Parking can be iffy because the lot seems to be under construction ...

Overall, I consistently recommend their arepas to travelers I meet and it&#39;s a go-to lunch spot for myself and friends. A solid 4.5 stars for me. I would totally give them 5 stars if this awesome Venezuelan tavern would add fish or veggie options &amp; fix their parking lot. :)"

They took our drink and dinner orders promptly and checked in on us, but weren&#39;t intrusive. I had also forgotten my credit card at the table after paying and one of our servers ran out after me with the card. D&#39;oh! I really appreciated that though.

My husband had one of their burgers, which came with delicious plantains and a raspberry sauce on the side. I had the Call and Huevo arepas, which were awesome! Very nice change of pace from your standard bar food. The interior is also very interesting, and industrial much like most of the businesses in RiNo. My only complaint is that they could use a few more beers on tap. The beer menu was a little scant."

Sexy, I know. 

The Industry complex is a really cool building and the Will Call space is quite large, really open and has a lot of big TVs. So, it&#39;s a strange mish-mash of sports bar-like feel couple with this lovely booths and wood decor that makes it feel more like a cocktail place. During late lunch time it was also pretty empty so we had no trouble finding a seat (it was a seat yourself kind of deal) and our service was super fast.

I ordered fried plantains (served with a raspberry coulis) and the Point Arepa, which is filled with ginger black bean paste, avocado, queso fresco, and your choice of pork, chicken, or steak for an extra cost. At under $10 it was easily enough food to fill me up.

The menu mostly focuses on arepas, but they do also have burgers, a few salads, and a handful of starters like wings and hummus and all of it seems to be very reasonably priced.

There is a huge parking lot next to Industry that you can use so parking isn&#39;t an issue at all. I&#39;m excited to see all these cool things popping up into this neighborhood and in Denver!"

I dated a Venezuelan guy for years, too, so I know arepas. These aren&#39;t dead-ringers for authentic Venezuelan arepas (which are pretty greasy), but will probably satisfy anyone who likes arepas (especially if you always felt the greasiness was a bit much.)

The service was good, almost TOO good (3 different bartenders/servers came by very often to check on us)- I&#39;m not complaining, but some people might not like that.

It&#39;s definitely a trailblazer location; there is lots of development going on nearby, but the Industry building itself is something of an island where it is on Brighton at the moment.  It is two seconds from the Source, and a straight shot down Brighton/Broadway to downtown, so if you want to make it a pit stop on a big night, it is easy enough to do that.  

The FOOD is delicious.  The arepas are surprisingly filling, and the sweet potato wedge fries are unparalleled.  Also, one arepa is more than enough, and comes with a side.  You can get out of there stuffed for between 7 and 9 bucks, if you don&#39;t drink.

The drinks are quite tasty, if on the expensive side.  They also have a good selection of craft microbrews.

The atmosphere is awesome....half industrial, half forgotten Mayan city.  I&#39;m not sure I quite get it, but I can tell you that they have executed their design with conviction and purpose, and it came out awesome.  

There&#39;s plenty of seating, the place is huge.  Fire pits outside, although I have never sat out there.  At the moment the parking is being built, so getting into the parking lot can be a little confusing.  BUT!  Hey, it is plentiful and free parking in RiNo, so quit yer bitchin.

I will say the atmosphere is cool , very typical bar with nice TVs and furniture. I wasn&#39;t very wow-ed or impressed though. It was a pretty slow day and the staff really wasn&#39;t on top of it. 

The food menu and beer menu wasn&#39;t very unique or special at all either. 
I ordered a salad with chicken and the chicken never came even after i mentioned it. For being the only people in there at the time I guess I was also just disappointed...even the server didn&#39;t notice until I mentioned it. 
When my date insisted on paying they still charged him for my chicken! Just because he said it was fine, doesn&#39;t mean it is. Its the principle and I found it a bit dishonest the server didn&#39;t insist on taking it off. 

The patio does look nice though, maybe i&#39;ll give this place another try in the summer when we can enjoy the patio and fire pits."

The ambiance is great. We were in last night to grab a quick bite and some drinks. Our service started out fine until we observed the bar staff taking multiple shots behind the bar and constantly being on their phones. That&#39;s when our service suffered. Refills on drinks took forever. Getting a Togo box took forever. We even noticed food piling up in the window suggesting that other guests were suffering as well. And before our server asked us if we wanted anything else he just dropped off the check. In fact we did want another round of drinks but didn&#39;t get the opportunity to do so.

My girlfriend had the buffalo burger, which she thought was great, and I had the chicken call arepas with fried plantains. Everything was delicious. The plantains especially, I hadn&#39;t previously tasted anything like it before. Fried crispy but left whole and gooey on the inside, absolutely delicious with the spicy chutney on the side.

Cool bar; three levels; stairway all the way to the roof.  The roof is a bit smaller than I had assumed; it had maybe 6 tables and a 7 seat bar.  There was 1 empty table that we claimed.  The bartender was also the server for all the tables.  She was a bit slow getting to us.  Took quite a few minutes to even get a &#34;hi, I&#39;ll be right with you.&#34;  Once came over, everything was great.  We had a few rounds of drinks, then ordered the corndog and pretzel to snack on.

The pretzel was really big, and came with a honey mustard and a cheese sauce.  Just the right amount of salt.  Good stuff.  The corndog &#34;basket&#34; is just 1 corndog.  It looked like it was made there, not some microwaved frozen thing.  I was impressed.  It came with 2 different mustards.  Great for a snack for the lady and I.

I had a few different beers.  The draft selection was kind of a bummer.  They had the standard light beers and a single IPA.  Oh well.

This is a casual, welcoming, homey pub. Wooden bar and heavy wooden tables, and everything looks kind of old and well-loved in the best way. You feel like you can stay all day and relax. That&#39;s pretty much what I did on my last visit. 

We intended to simply order beer and cider, which we did of course, but we also couldn&#39;t help perusing the menu and ordering a fair amount of food. Our waiter was so kind and patient, making sure to clarify with the chef what is gluten free and what isn&#39;t. I ended up with a burger sans bun with alllllll the toppings, plus a side of garlic mashed potatoes which were amazing.

Well, I finally came here for lunch at work one day after we decided to try somewhere new. We went at about noon and to our great surprise, were literally the only people in the joint. Not terribly surprising for a pub that probably sees most of its business in the evening and during sporting events, and kind of a nice thing.

The bartender came over right away and got our beer orders-they have standard pub beers, plus a really solid selection of local and nationwide craft beers. I had an Oskar Blues Pinner, for example.

Their menu is pretty standard pub fare. I saw a cheesesteak sandwich and was craving that HARD, so I ordered that with fries. The food only took about 20 minutes, and it came out piping hot.

So...WOW. This is not hyperbole when I say it was the best Philly Cheesesteak I have had in Colorado, bar none. The bun was perfect, the meat was juicy, and they use actual cheese whiz. I devoured that thing (which was quite sizable) in about 10 minutes and it was completely worth the food come I experienced afterwards. Holy cow.

I was a big fan of the Fainting Goat between the beer selection, service and food. I will most definitely be back."

I had a great view of the TV, which was my primary reason for coming here. Although the draft beers were a little weak. Who still drinks Coors Light? No judging, but there are some many other great beers on the market. The food was your typical dive bar cuisine. Although the bartenders were sweet and the other patrons were cool. I don&#39;t know if I would come back to watch a game, but the patio and trivia night are intriguing."

From the moment we walked in everyone was extremely nice and helpful! The place has 3 stories with a rooftop bar. The rooftop was a bit crowded so we stayed on the first floor. It was exactly what we were looking for. A nice casual place to enjoy a beer and watch the game with good people. BK was our bartender and he was great! Extremely helpful and friendly. Everyone working who we ran across had great customer service. I ordered the chicken tenders! And they were delicious. They weren&#39;t greasy and came out super hot and fresh! Great amount of tenders for the price! Great place overall! Will not disappoint.

The place is small but the second floor helps to disperse the crowd and makes for a comfortable atmosphere. There are plenty of TV&#39;s but some of them are tied to the same receiver so if you want to change to a different game, someone watching the same game in another part of the bar would have to agree. I&#39;m not sure if all TV&#39;s are like that here but upstairs, we wanted to watch a different game  than the one being shown and the server couldn&#39;t change the channel because it would change the game on another TV that someone was watching. Oh well.

I opted for the corned beef hash with an extra egg on top. It was good food and a good-sized portion. The mimosa (yes, it was that kind of Sunday morning) came in a pint glass. *high 5*

Overall a good spot in Cap Hill."

The batter has a great toothiness; it doesn&#39;t feel like a pickle is suspended inside, but rather, is being perfectly hugged by the batter. The flavor is a perfect marriage of all the components. Great pickles, too. Not too vinegary. The slightly spiced dipping sauce is really good, too, but perhaps a tad on the watery side.
My friends from out of town ordered wings and the chicken sandwich. The wings looked standard, but the chicken sandwich was overflowing like a cornucopia. Every amply sized piece of that sandwich looked perfect. It looks like a double-order. Oh, man, had a huge crush on that chicken sandwich.
The digs at the Fainting Goat were heavily wood paneled, which is par for a dive. The third-floor outdoor area was a real curveball and a value-add. I will say that on the night we were there, there was some low-rent trivia going on (neither Geeks Who Drinks nor Stump). Why not name-brand trivia? The turnout for it sort of reinforced the general tone of the night - even with a playoff basketball on the TV, people weren&#39;t really interested.
Solid food, solid environment. Everything was a little better than you&#39;d expect. Perfect."

OK, I didn&#39;t get that expression entirely right, but who needs boats when you have goats?  Seriously though, The Fainting Goat is a fantastic little pub right in the Golden Triangle neighborhood.  

You can grab a cold, frosty pint to knock the edge off of a tough workweek, or have a nice sit down meal at a table or booth of your liking.  The menu at Fainting Goat is actually one of the many pleasant surprises you&#39;ll find here.  Knock your socks off with a killer burger and an order of Irish nachos (house made chips, corned beef, &amp; Swiss cheese, topped with horseradish dijonnaise).

The weekend is for fun and fun is what you&#39;ll have!  Enjoy drinks with your friends on top of their quaint rooftop patio while basking in the midday sun or soaking in the late night breeze.

The surly bartender we were lucky enough by which we got to be served was maybe not the best representation of the bar, however the chicken fingers, grilled cheese, and tomato soup made it all better.

They pour a good Guinness and their car bombs are, well, the bomb.  The staff has always been friendly and attentive, even when it&#39;s busy."

The Goat is a great sports bar. Every time I go in, it feels like Cheers. Not that everyone knows my name, but the bartenders make you feel welcome, and all th regulars seem to know each other.
It is laid back and has pretty good bar food.
It&#39;s one of those places I think about stopping in whenever I pass by. 
The rooftop bar is a bonus. Nothing better than hanging out in the evening, on the roof, with good friends and a beer while the Bronco&#39;s are playing in the background."

It&#39;s got two floors plus a rooftop with a great view.  We found some spots at the bar and started in with the drinks.  The selection of drafts was pretty limited, I love a good IPA but they only had the Sam Adams version and while not horrible it wasn&#39;t what I wanted.  My second choice of Dale&#39;s Pale was having some keg and/or tap issues so it was onto a Guinness, the old favorite that&#39;s always a standby in these situations.   

We split some Irish nachos that were house made potato chips with corned beef, horsey sauce, and jack cheese.  All in all pretty damn tasty, especially after a few drafts.

The service was great, and while the parking lot in the back is a goner it wasn&#39;t too hard for any of us to find spots on the street.  It&#39;s a little divey, in all the best ways, and I know I&#39;ll be back another time when it&#39;s warm so I can hangout on the roof!"

I went with the buffalo chicken wrap. It was crazy good! I also got tots with it. Great tots (I love tots). The service was great here. Very cool bartenders. Once we migrated over to a table they helped us out there too.

So we started out at the bar..then a brit at a table near the bar noticed the soccer jersey I was wearing (was watching a game at the bulldog earlier that day).

First off, the servers are awesome. The bartenders are cool. They are quick and give the place a really good vibe.

They have a decent draft beer selection including rotating seasonals and old standbys. I have never left thirsty. In fact, I have left more often than not with my thirst over quenched (if you know what I mean).

It is a bar, so your selections are pretty much standard bar food on the menu. My favorite menu item: fried pickles.

Sometimes it is a little louder than I would like (the music, not the people) in the downstairs bar area. They have board games by the front windows, and I have sat there for hours playing Monopoly with my friends.

A hidden gem of the area, make sure to check out the roof top bar. You wouldn&#39;t even know it is there from the ground floor. You have to venture up the stairs.

Three storied with a rooftop patio, a shuffleboard, pool, and darts! They also have a parking lot and board games and some big TVs to watch whatever needs watching. The multi-level design is neato as each level has its own bathrooms, but the second level mezzanine is cool, but the wonky railing is just asking for a drunken injury. 

The rooftop is where it is at! The lil space has it&#39;s own bar and is partially covered / heated. Last time I was there we got table service from a great bartender during a nuggets game. 

Their fried pickles are amazing!!! They do spears - yum!! Their other food is good too, I&#39;d say high quality bar food. The service is inconsistent as far as employees, but consistent decent quality for the most part. This place is super great during the day, and is pretty cool on a weekend or weekday night as well.

We went mid-afternoon on a Saturday. My first thought was that there would be a bunch of people there watching football, but the place was actually quite empty. The staff was inviting and friendly and seemed like they were happy to be there, which is increasingly rare these days. I ordered a Reuben, she ordered Fish and Chips. Both were quite good but given the number of people there, the food probably could have been delivered a bit faster.

My most recent experience was not the tops - the two bartenders/servers at the upstairs patio could have cared less that we were there.

This is a good place during the week and they also have live trivia! High marks for the shuffle board table, darts and juke box! I also love the rooftop patio - when it&#39;s not packed. Best bet = weekday excursions.

I went to trivia night there once and had a lot of fun, considering I have no random facts knowledge and I think we took last, haha. They have good drinks at cheap rates for those looking for a place to go after work.

However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the food. I had the Irish Nachos... which were potato chips with cheese. Granted, this could be the trend, but I did not care for it. Unless you want a burger, I would rather skip the meal. Limited selection. They occasionally have a tasty soup on special.

Because of its location, the bar tends not to attract the downtown youngin&#39;s, which is a big part of its charm.

In the past the food has been hit or miss but lately I&#39;m obsessed with two things: the loaded tots which are covered in cheese and bacon, and the club sandwich.

The Goods:
Plenty of bar games including darts, shuffle board and Jenga.
Free parking lot!

1. Great buffalo sauce, if you like a Frank&#39;s Red Hot style you will like these.  Not a five alarm (thankfully), but can be partially quenched with your beer and blue cheese.

3. Nice meaty pieces.  Have never gotten cheap, dried out scrawny wings.

Friendly staff, $2 HH draft specials, all-you-can-eat wings on Wednesdays.

Great food, great drinks, a chill clientèle, and juke box that has Murder by Death and the Editors on it.  What more can a girl ask for?

Last night I met up with a few friends and we splurged on several different appetizers:  the Irish nachos, the deep fried pickles and the chicken tenders.  The two former are a must if you&#39;ve never had them!  Yum-o!

Yep, I need to get back to the Goat more often and perhaps explore the other levels.  Or maybe visit during happy hour?  Oh man, so many possibilities!"

We were ecstatic to hear that he opened his own place up.  He has been more than generous with his time, and his pizza is so damn good we make a point of getting as many pies as we can cram into our faces whenever we are in town.  

As far as generosity goes; I&#39;ll set the stage: Eden took the time on a 100+ degree day in June of 2016 to explain to me the finer points of baking (I&#39;m a hobbyist baker back home).  He thoroughly explained the fundamentals of making your own starter, recommended some fantastic books/resources, all the while whipping together one amazing pie.   If THAT isn&#39;t an example of someone passionate about their product, I don&#39;t know what is.  

If I had a way to clone this guy and bring him back to California to set up a franchise near my house I would.  For now I have to be content with waiting for our bi-annual pilgrimage to get some amazing pie (and equally fantastic company)."

I love discovering which unique pizzas he&#39;s serving - I trust it will be amazing, and I&#39;ve yet to be disappointed!

Eden, the owner, is enthusiastic, kind, and generous. You feel welcomed from the moment you step in the shop. He&#39;s as far from vanilla as possible (a welcome thing in a city of ever expanding beige condos...) Also, if he feels like he let you down in any way, he&#39;s quick to apologize and make it right. He also works hard alongside Shauna from Long I Pie to make their business space simple yet welcoming. The atmosphere alone would keep me coming back. 

The pizza is so damn good. I just finished up a peach and pulled pork pie... Holy $&amp;!/ that was tasty. I normally go for a red sauce + meat combo but have tried most his offerings and they&#39;re all incredible. 

Finally, you can&#39;t beat the price. For the ingredients used, location, and service I&#39;d expect to be paying much more. It&#39;s so shockingly affordable that we all should be leaving big fat tips!

Eden is from New York and is a super friendly dude. His pizza is also really great, and fairly priced.

We were greeted right away and given our choice of seating. Decor is nice, lights are nicely dimmed rdered the Montanera pizza: lightly fried dough topped with garlic marinara, smoked buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, and we added meatballs. 

The pizza was awesome! Better still, the service was so far beyond what you&#39;d expect from a &#34;mall restaurant.&#34; They treated us like family and talked to us about their vision for the restaurant, their emphasis on local, fresh, and scratch-made... Really surprising!

Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and really sweet. However, she kept on saying things like &#34;This is the best pizza in Denver&#34;. I know that when someone says things like that it is as if they are trying to convince you that is true before you even have a bite. We started off with the antipasti platter. The meat was as you would expect (salami pepperoni), with olive tapenade and aged balsamic alongside it. The mozzarella was not that handmade fresh variety you would expect at a pizza restaurant which prides itself on having such ingredients. Instead it was rubbery in texture and unpleasant. The pizza and salad we shared arrived within 5 minutes of our ordering it, a red flag. It takes more than 5 minutes to cook a fresh pizza and the chicken breast I ordered on my salad. Was the crust pre-made and the topping placed on and cooked in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese? Was the chicken also precooked and just warmed up to be thrown on top of the salad? A food detective would ask these questions. The pizza was chewy, not warm from center to crust and the sausage that was used looked awful. My husband took all of it off the remainder of the pizza after one bite. My caesar salad was soggy, overdressed and warm with one sliver of parmesan cheese. The chicken on top of it was rubbery. 

They played a mix of hip hop and rap from the early to mid 1990&#39;s which might not make it a kid friendly environment unless you want your child learning The Humpy Hump. 

I am in no rush to go back."

We check out APN certified pizzerias whenever we can find them,  around the country,  and this one ranks with the best of them.  The dough had a beautiful char as it came out from  the wood fired oven and the ingredients were tasteful and fresh.  To be APN certified,  they have to use specific ingredients from Italy,  but execution can vary; they are doing it well here.  My Emilia Romagna  had a great walnut paste and a smoked fresh bufala mozzarella; the Sicilia had a beautiful balance of flavors between the Genoa salami,  prosciutto,  cheeses,  and the vegetables.  

The service was impeccable: our server to great care of us and the manager took the time to show us the facilities after we had chatted about pizza for a while.

First off, everyone was so cool and friendly.  Hubby and I went right at 11 am when they opened so we were the only peeps in there for a little while.  The waitress was very informative and explained how their pizza ovens are from Italy, how they work, and gave us a run down of some of her favorite pizzas. 

We decide to start off with a Caesar Salad.  It was perfectly dressed and the dressing was amazing.  It wasn&#39;t too fishy as some Caesar dressings can be.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp.  It also came with a couple slices of cooked pizza dough.  Very light and tasty.

We decided to give the Lombardi Pizza a shot.  I&#39;m so happy we did.  The sauce was simple and complimented the toppings really well.  The ricotta was rich and creamy and the meatballs were perfectly seasoned.  The basil added freshness to each bite. 

Hubby and I LOVED this pizza and can&#39;t wait to come back!  Cheers!"

I went one evening when the wait at the Yard House was too long and ordered things from meatballs to pizza and none of it was good.

Much of the food we received came to us lukewarm and just didn&#39;t taste very good. Our server told us they were famous for their wings which were highly disappointing.

Not sure anything we had was good. My colleague was in complete agreement that it probably wasn&#39;t really worth the trip.

I&#39;d love to say something positive.....our waitress was nice....but that&#39;s probably the extent of it. I think maybe they&#39;re still in the process of being new, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it"

Gluten free pizza was good regular pizza was just okay. This place is expensive for what you get and I can certainly get better pizza elsewhere.

I honestly didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to get an authentic and delicious neapolitan pizza attached to a shopping mall, but boy was I wrong. I&#39;ve since been back 6 or 7 times. The pizza is great. Really great. Those who don&#39;t like it probably just don&#39;t like this style of pizza and are expecting your more run of the mill stuff. I&#39;m from NY, have had tons of pizza in Italy, and this honestly can compare to some of the most popular pizzas there. The brunch pizzas are my favorite, followed by the deliciously spicy Diavola special. This place isn&#39;t as busy as it should be, and it would be a shame for people to miss out. I can&#39;t speak to the other food because the pizza is so good that I don&#39;t even bother to order anything else. Decent and super cheap bloody marys for brunch, and the service has never let us down."

To find it, if you turn in from the entrance on Colfax, go to the second Mall entrance, and follow the signs to &#34;Yardhouse.&#34;  It&#39;s located right nextdoor to Yardhouse, and entrances both inside and outside the mall.  If you can&#39;t find it, just go in any Mall entrance, and start walking around the circle.  You will pass it when you get to the northeast corner of the circle.  Oh, it&#39;s also right across the street from the movie theatre.  

I recently visited a similar restaurant in another location, and I was not aware that this type of venue was so popular.  I was also not aware that Racca&#39;s had two other locations.  Anyway, it&#39;s one of those place where I LOVE the Happy Hour.  

At Happy Hour, you can get a personal size Margherita Pizza for $5, (it&#39;s  usually $9 on the regular menu), and a &#34;Select&#34; draw for $3.00!  What&#39;s nice about the beer is they give you two or three choices.  The other, similar restaurant I went to only had one choice, but they did have a greater selection of $5 pizza. 

The pizza is thin crust, Neopolitan style of course, is cooked in a wood-fired oven, and is outstanding.  I could have eaten two or three, they tasted so good.  For Happy Hour, this place rocks, and will certainly put pressure on Yardhouse nextdoor.  Good beer, good food, and good service -  a winning combination!"

Hungry from our travels and thinking we were about to eat some basic &#34;Mall food&#34;, we were completely surprised by their exceptional menu offerings.  We ordered a Neapolitan-type pizza with the following ingredients:

A mixture of ground walnuts/cream, thin slices of zucchini and the most heavenly smoked buffalo mozzarella cheese. This was a &#34;no tomato sauce based pizza&#34; that appeared brushed with a  truffle oil or some type of flavored oil as the base rather than tomato sauce.

Their style of wood oven fired pizzas are becoming more and more popular these days.  This place does a good version of it -- light crispy crust that&#39;s slightly charred with a scant amount of sauce and a variety of toppings.  As far as pizza goes, this is my favorite style.  If you&#39;re already an aficionado, theirs is quite good, but not  quite as good as, say, Settebello in Henderson, NV. 

They also do gluten free pizzas and one of the people in our group today has celiac disease.  The server was pretty good about checking on each item, whether it was GF or not."

Let&#39;s face it - those of us in western Lakewood live in a good restaurant desert.  And when it comes to pizza, the pickings are slim.  For years we have made the pilgrimage downtown to go to Marco&#39;s Coal Fired, now known as Racca&#39;s, so we were thrilled when the opened up in Colorado Mills.  While the location in the world&#39;s largest discount mall leaves something to be desired, the pizza, salads and libations are A+++.  This is our favorite place for a family meal out.  While my family exists on an all-you-can-wheat diet, I am gluten free and I am generally disappointed with GF pizza.  It&#39;s generally paper thin and too crunchy - like a cracker.  But Racca&#39;s is the best I have ever had - the crust is chewy and puffs up a little in the coal-fired oven. It even gets nice bubbles and charred spots.  

My wheat-loving family loves the Nutella pizza - it is their favorite dessert of any restaurant ever.  Sometimes we get two so that there are leftovers.

Please try Racca&#39;s soon - we&#39;d like to see them get busier!"

I am gluten free and try to avoid dairy so pizza is always an iffy situation for me. Luckily Raccas does have gluten free pizza crust and let me state this clearly -- this is the best gluten free crust I have had since going gluten free about 8 years ago!

The crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I ate all of the crusts, even the outer edges which I often skip because they are hard and dry and tasteless. I also got a pizza that came with no cheese and I didn&#39;t miss it. The eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini, etc. gave it enough flavor to totally satisfy me. Even my gluten and dairy eating friends gobbled up the rest of my pizza when I couldn&#39;t finish it all. Yes, there is a $4 upcharge for the gluten free crust but in this case it was totally worthy it!

The others in my group totally enjoyed their traditional pizza as well. We all split a large salad and it was plenty for the three of us. 

The waiter was attentive, friendly and didn&#39;t mind talking to me about the gluten free options and how they make it. I can&#39;t find one thing wrong with this visit and wish I could give them 5+ stars.

We will definitely be back to this restaurant."

The owner stopped by our table multiple times to ask how everything was and after our dinner she provided feedback cards. No complaints here besides the dining room being too bright. 

A tip to the owners:
I think by adding a dimmer switch to the main dining lights and dimming the light output to a steady flow would really change the overall experience.  This might make it too dark for the center dining tables, but some new pendant lights should fix that.

Our tab totalled $18.30 for 2 lunches.  We each pulled out a debit card, and were told there was a $10.00 minimum for using plastic.  I told the server to put the total on my card.  She refused.  My friend  gave a $50.00 bill, and the server dashed off with the cash and my debit card that I did not have the opportunity to remove from the tray.  When the server came back she had charged my card $10.00, and brought my friend $40.00 in change.  We were charged $20.00 for an $18.30 tab.  I asked to speak to a manager, and was told she was the manager.  Lots of difficulty because she did not speak adequate English.  Long story short, we were overcharged, and there is no sign stating that there is a $10.00 minimum.  It is an hour&#39;s travel time each way from my house to the restaurant, because the food is good.  However being overcharged left a bad taste in my mouth.  There are Vietnamese restaurants much closer that are honest.  I will go elsewhere."

This by far is my favorite food Ever!!   The eggrolls are the very best I ever had the fish sauce is perfect... never have I had such good Vietnamese sauce! The marinated soft shell crab deep fried for a appetizer is a must have!! It is so good that my mouth is watering as I&#39;m typing this. The noodle bowls are a winner.. I love the grilled lemongrass pork... It is so good :) Sometimes my son and I just stop in and get an order of eggrolls each and that is a full meal with all the stuff to wrap them up! The iced coffee is nothing short of heaven :) Please don&#39;t be fooled by all the new pho places popping up everywhere.. This place is a must try.. I know you will love it as much as I do!!!"

My granddaughter, a 13-year-old Vietnamese food connoisseur, said it was literally the best impulse decision she&#39;s ever made in her entire life. After every single bite our eyes would widen into saucers and we&#39;d grin from ear to ear - suddenly coming to understand the difference between food orgasms and MULTI orgasmic food experiences!! There is only one person waiting on all the tables in this space, so don&#39;t expect undivided attention, but they recently hired a fun/funny chatty-cathy hostess that will come around to try to make up the difference.

I went to Kim Ba many moons ago way before my Yelping days and NOW they relocate and open the one here.  This recent visit was on November 22nd 2014.  Time was about 20:00hrs ish.

  When we entered we are the 3rd group having Dinner here.  There are 2 other groups of patrons dining away..one being a big group and another just a couple.  We are greeted by one of the staffs, and we choose to seat at one of the booths on the Left Wing of the establishment.

  YES they have plenty to eat or choose from their Extensive Menu.  From what I could recall we ordered these :

*  Green Lip Mussels ($11.95)
*  Beef Fried Rice ($8.75)
*  Shrimp Fried Rice ($9.50)
*  Bo Xao Xa Ot aka Sautéed Beef with Lemongrass and hot chili pepper ($13.00)
*  Hot Coffee with Condensed Milk ($3.75)

  We waited for abit for our food to be ready.  What I like, was the Shrimp Fried Rice.  Who can screw up a Fried Rice??  THANK GOD for those Shrimp Fried Rice!  Just salt and pepper kind of Fried Rice with &#34;scrambled eggs&#34;.

  What I don&#39;t fancy was my order of Green Lip Mussels.  There are TOO MUCH of lemongrass in the Green Lip Mussels, and broken Mussels shells..  *SIGH*  In terms of flavor was just ok.  This dish is listed in their KIM BA Special, but its NOT Special at all.  *SIGH* and *SAD FACE INDEED*  The Green Lip Mussels is sautéed with Lemongrass in a SPICY Coconut Curry Sauce.  But where is the SPICYNESS - Hence its so misleading and so disappointing about this Dish, that I ordered.  Furthermore, the Lemongrass they used in this dish are those &#34;old&#34; ones.. aka not much of freshness at all.

  The Beef Fried Rice was OK too..  but once again what&#39;s the deal with tonnes of Lemongrass from the Bo Xao Xa Ot, aka Sautéed Beef with Lemongrass and Hot Chili Pepper.  The Sautéed Beef is NOT SPICY at all.  Just ok, NOT mind-blowing..  Hence the overall is 3 stars review for this establishment.  To return definitely NOT IN A HURRY.  Maybe we did order the wrong items from their menu.

  Nevertheless, we wish them well in their business undertakings in this part of Neighborhood and their new location.  The service from our server is prompt.  We left KIM BA at about 20:45hrs ish.

I am sad I found this place just a month before I am moving out of town. Their fish sauce and egg rolls are amazing and they wrap all the goodies for your noodle bowl separately so they stay fresh. I had one with steak wrapped shrimp that was amazing another with extra egg rolls add beef. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve eaten there - it was too good to try something new. I am going to miss it when I&#39;m gone.

I remember the old Kim Ba being a good option for Vietnamese food. Sadly, this is no longer true. Should have known right off the bat as the place even looks like a dump when you walk in -- not a good sign for a new building! 

We ordered the Spicy Pork, Beef with Vegetables, Spicy Ginger Fried Catfish and Chicken Fried Rice.

The beef and the pork were both way too salty and looked like something you dumped out of a can.

The catfish was not at all what we expected -- at every other vietnamese restaurant they serve real sections of catfish, braised in ginger sauce. This was like something you could have gotten at Long John Silvers. The catfish was deep fried, dry, flat filets... and did I mention that it was DRY?!

The Chicken Fried Rice was bland and the chicken overcooked. 

To top that all off, nothing even LOOKED good. Usually when you&#39;re starving everything looks delicious, but none of us were all to excited to even start eating regardless of how famished we were. 

As much as I hate wasting food, it just wasn&#39;t worth the calories or stomach ache. We left half of our $50 meal on the plates. Not even worth giving away!

My extreme disappointment even made me ask the waitress whether this was the same Kim Ba that used to be on Havana, just to be sure... yes, it is. And no, we won&#39;t be back."

Egg rolls were great &amp; authentic! The egg rolls were crispy &amp; made with pork &amp; vermicelli noodles. The bun I got had a nuoc mam (fish sauce) that was a little blander than normal fish sauce so I had to put a ton in my bowl to get enough flavor. I did like that it was citrusy though. The noodles were hot which is unusually for bun. The egg rolls were also piping hot. I thought it was weird that cilantro &amp; mint were only added upon request since these two vegetables come standard in bun dishes. The peanuts are also added upon request (understandably so because peanut allergies are more common). They cater events here but don&#39;t offer servers for catered events. There was only 1 other occupied table when I came around 3 PM so I can&#39;t tell if they normally get crowded or not. The interior isn&#39;t very special or appealing but it&#39;s open and clean. They play Vietnamese music and have traditional Vietnamese lacquer art on the walls. They accept credit cards (even Amex!). I also tried the Vietnamese coffee (chicory coffee- typically cafe du monde- with condensed milk served over ice) &amp; thought it was okay (I&#39;ve had probably a hundred Vietnamese coffees by now so I can assure you better ones exist). The menu is extensive but there is only 1 pho option (pho Tai).

kim-ba-vietnamese-cuisine-aurora-2,Mark T.,RYIhfaNekKLDuqmwqkVi3g,"Aurora, CO",1,1,0,200,3,ZKECZi4VQbPpsOaOktuHzw,3.0,2014-12-27,"I&#39;ve been a fan of the fabled Vietnamese eatery Kim Ba for over 25 years - ever since it was at its original location in the Havana Street District, in fact. So needless to say, I was shocked, nay, chagrined to discover that I&#39;d somehow never gotten around to writing a review for them. Well, what better time than now to rectify that little blunder - especially since they&#39;ve recently moved to a much larger, very tastefully-decorated space in the Pacific Ocean complex at Mississippi &amp; Peoria?

One of my favorite things about eating Vietnamese food is that (by and large) the names of the dishes list the primary ingredients used to make them. (I apologize for not putting any of the accents on the words by the way - the site loves some of them and hates others, and I want to be consistent). So once you know, for example, that the word &#34;Heo&#34; means pork, &#34;Thit&#34; is a generic term referring to meat, and &#34;Xa Ot&#34; signifies lemongrass, then it&#39;s fairly easy to guess what you&#39;ll end up with when you order the very tasty Thit Heo Xao Xa Ot (the middle word, &#34;Xao&#34;, indicates that the components are stir-fried by the way). Here&#39;s another one - &#34;Bo&#34; is beef, &#34;La Nho&#34; are grape leaves (some preparations use the more traditional &#34;La Lot&#34; [betel leaf] which is a bit harder to find over here) and &#34;Nuong&#34; indicates a grilled item. I just sat down and asked for Bo Nuong La Nho - can you guess what I&#39;m ordering? Why yes, it was indeed grilled beef-stuffed grape leaves - you&#39;re getting good at this! One more? Why not. &#34;Ga&#34; refers to chicken, &#34;Vit&#34; denotes duck, and &#34;Goi&#34; is the closest Vietnamese term to our word &#34;salad&#34;. So, what is &#34;Goi Ga Hoac Vit&#34;? You got it - it&#39;s either chicken or duck (&#34;Hoac&#34; means &#34;or&#34; in fact) tossed with cabbage, chopped peanuts, and an unforgettable fish sauce-based dressing. Magnificent!

But y&#39;know, I don&#39;t want you to think for a moment that Kim Ba caters only to flesh-eaters. Perish the thought! Their vegetable selections are equally dandy (as one would expect from a cuisine with a strong vegetarian tradition). One of my all-time favorites there is the flavorful amalgamation of succulent eggplant, fermented bean sauce, and just a hint of coconut milk (Ca Tim Xao Tuong Hot). Tofu lovers will go gaga over the spicy tomato-drenched beancurd extravaganza which goes by the moniker Dau Hu Sot Ca. The fried rice with mixed veggies (Com Chien Chay) is certainly no slouch either; nor is the stirfry called Rau Thap Cam, bursting with carrots, baby corn, snow peas... oh wow, you just have so many choices to pick from. The personable owner is always happy to assist you with any dietary question you may have too, so don&#39;t be shy - ask her what she recommends!

And that brings me to the French-inspired desserts (caramel custard, toasted coconut pudding), the slurp-worthy beverages (coffee with condensed milk, tangy-tart lemonade, coconut juice), or even... ooh, this review is getting long. Why don&#39;t I wrap it up here? I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re extremely famished anyway after hearing all this, so head down to Kim Ba and have a nice nosh."

My boyfriend ordered the hot and spicy beef soup. The beef was 90% fat and the broth was a little too spicy for me. He liked the taste of it though but not the fatty mean. I ordered #9 which was ok. The shrimp was good and the broth was ok but that&#39;s it. The meat looked weird, not sure what one meat was in there, and I had no crab meat. When the lady brought my card back she said she ran a different price than what I owed so I had to give her cash to cover the rest. My boyfriend was going to pay cash for the tip so I had put a $0.00 on the tip amount and she saw that and asked my &#34;where&#39;s my tip?&#34; And I said that we were giving her cash.

I also feel like the sauces were a bit lacking and there was a tiny bit of a funny taste overall. With a few improvements overall this place could be excellent.

The Food: They have a simple menu much like an Asian version Qdoba or Chipolte. You pick what you want from rolls, bowl, or banh mi (which appears to be a type of sandwich). Then it&#39;s on to your proteins, toppings, and sauces. I opted for the rolls, with five spice chicken, traditional style on veggies (though I did add avocado and jalapenos), with nom nom sauce. It was tasty. Though, if it wasn&#39;t for the mixture of spices on the chicken and the nom nom sauce they would&#39;ve been rather bland. For beverages they offer Stubborn sodas which are made with cane sugar, a couple Izze flavors, and some more traditional (?) Vietnamese offerings from behind the counter. Oh, don&#39;t forget they do offer a couple different beers as well! 

The Staff: The folks working were friendly enough, offered assistance if I had any questions, and in the end made me a tasty lunch. 

The Space: Pretty small for the amount of people that were there. Luckily the weather was nice and guests were able to take advantage of the sidewalk seating outside. Otherwise I probably would&#39;ve had to take my order to go!

I&#39;d be curious to try the bowl or the banh mi dishes next time I come by for lunch."

I&#39;ll be brief in it&#39;s comparison to Chipotle.  The only thing it has in common is the line up and picking the ingredients.  The rest I think Nom Nom does better.  I got the Brown Rice bowl, loaded with 3 meats.  It only ended up being 12 bucks, and it was a lot of food.  There are other options too like sausage, and tofu.  Tons of veggies to choose from, and a ton of sauces.

The establishment - Clean, easy on the eyes, and modern.  Sleek with wood and metal decor.  Casual eat in, nothing fancy.  In and out type place.

The Food - Very good.  The chicken is a nice mix of spices and marinade.  Very tender, and not too spicy.  The Steak is also very tender, and a nice hint of soy.  Not overpowering.  The Pork is my favorite.  It reminds me Daegee Bulgogi (Sweet/Spicy boneless pork grilled), the only difference being that it doesn&#39;t have the spicy.  Which makes sense, cause it&#39;s Vietnamese style lemongrass pork.  Nice compliment of sweet, to go with the other flavoried beef/chicken.  I suggest the traditional choice of veggies if it&#39;s your first time.  They don&#39;t skimp on the meat or veggies.  Loaded on.

The quality proteins really stood out.  I&#39;m so used to places like Qdoba and Chipotle... with their super chewy almost tendon infested chicken/beef.  This place seems to go out of their way to get the tender stuff, and nice cuts.

This is just the bowl.  They also have spring rolls, and banh mi.  I&#39;ll have to try their banh mi next time.  Haven&#39;t had it since I was living in DC, and woudl visit the Eden Center Vietnamese market.

All in all, awesome.  Quality ingredients, and quick (if you&#39;re wanting to pick it up to go).  Even with a line, it&#39;s fast.  10 minutes tops."

You can pick your meat next, which I loved the LemonGrass Pork and Garlic Soy Steak. I preferred steamed white rice over the rice noodles but hey!? 
They allow you to try some samples if you&#39;re unsure of the meat or veggies: which by the way are killer-- The Pickled veggies which include carrots and the pineapples are awesome. It was a lot fresher than most bowls I&#39;ve had in the past. I think this place kills most places on egg rolls. They are amazing egg rolls, and check in onto this app, and get an order for free ! I loved the Sesame seed sauce. 

The staff is fantastic and alive! I loved the atmosphere, definitely a place where I&#39;ll be back to take on a different option. Perhaps the Banh Mi next time."

Used the peanut sauce.  I recommend adding mangoes... yum.  Location is convenient but the plaza itself is hard to maneuver w small two way streets but you&#39;ll get the hang of how to get there if you visit frequent enough.  Set-up is like qdoba and garbanzo, easy enough if you look at the board. I would have given it 5 stars since it&#39;s good for fast food with great flavors (don&#39;t compare it to a sit down Vietnamese resto) but the food was cold. I know some ingredients like mango/pickled veg will be cold but even the meat is barely lukewarm. Maybe a better food warmer especially since the sauce aren&#39;t heated would make the food even excellent."

I got the bowl with steak and rice noodles instead of steamed ride. I got to pick every single ingredient in my bowl, from the array of lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, jalapeno, peanuts, mango, daikon, cucumber, and more. The sauces were delicious, i had the nomnom and gingin (sooo good!!!). 

My friend got the rolls with pork, tofu, and steak with avocado and fresh veggies. &#34;They were light, fresh, and rival the best I&#39;ve had in Houston. Loved being able to customize them and add avocado. Or that it didn&#39;t *have* to have cilantro, bc all speing rolls do, was really nice.&#34;

But then, there were the sodas, Stubborn. With lots of fun flavors, all without HFCS. We opted for the fresh juices, mango mint and strawberry lognan. Both light and refreshing. 

TL;DR: vibrant, fresh food. Sturdy portions, totally customizable. 

Also, the lotus chips are a must. 

And there&#39;s pho after 4. 

And the family is awesome. They chatted with us for a while."

The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rice bowls were excellent. They have a brown rice option - yay! I also really liked their siracha-cream sauce... It has the perfect amount of spice. 

There were a few things that I noticed: the veggies were not as fresh when I went in today and the pickled carrot and daikon weren&#39;t very pickled. The house sauce wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I would like it to be (I&#39;m Vietnamese and so I really like bold/strong flavors) and the banh mi wasn&#39;t as good as what I&#39;m used to (but I&#39;m really, really picky about my banh mi).

The bone-in chicken was crispy and delicious though it didn&#39;t look the way typical com ga roti does My rice was also not the red rice that it typically comes with despite their online website showing a traditional looking &#34;com ga roti&#34; dish. I think they must have ran out of the dish when I came because the chicken I got, the rice and the American-style slaw were definitely not any part of any com ga roti I&#39;ve ever had. Even so, it was tasty with their side sauces. I was impressed by their yummy looking juices that included honeydew basil seed, strawberry longan and lychee mint tea. I liked all the Vietnamese photos on the walls and the easy to follow menu. The regular menu consists of bowls, banh mi&#39;s (sandwiches) or rolls. You can choose the meat you want (lemongrass chicken, soy steak or 5 spice chicken) and then choose the toppings (vegetables, etc) and sauce. They have a yummy looking fried tofu option too for those who don&#39;t eat meat. I tried my bf&#39;s brown rice bowl and was surprised by how much rice there was. You don&#39;t get as much meat as you might at a Vietnamese restaurant if you ordered a com dac biet or com tam type plate. My com ga roti dish had a kale and brussel sprouts slaw on it that wasn&#39;t very Vietnamese but was pretty light, fresh and tasty. They have 6 sauces you can choose from and some side dishes like lotus chips."

It was flavorful, crispy yet tender, and easy to eat. It complemented the noodle bowl nicely. 

If you&#39;re getting nom nom for the first time I would recommend the Nom nom (house special) for bowls.
Bae Bae (Garlic Basil) is a refreshing alternative option. 
Yum yum (hoisin peanut sauce) for Rolls.

I saw corrals, dimming lights and overall lots of crystal palace themed decor which blew me off a great storm. He was an amazing attendee and I felt obligated to return and give it another chance. We saw a menu with potential and understood why the average person might feel 50/50. 

We started off with the soup for 2!
Appetizers: 
Hot &amp; Sour Soup was very sweet and stuck with me. I loved the Wonton Soup, it had a pint of veggies, but not too heavy. I enjoyed the daring beef strings and the wontons itself. We originally wanted the PoPo Platter as our appetizer (Wings, Wontons, Eggrolls, Beef Stick with pineapples and cherries) but Ken recommended the &#34;Family Dinner,&#34; which actually already included the PoPo Platter, the soups, an entree of chicken, beef or pork; with steamed or white rice! 

I stuck with Sesame Chicken while the other party selected Shrimp with Garlic.
Mine had plenty of lettuce and lots of sweet chicken that actually tasted overall like pineapple instead of sesame. The Shrimp with Garlic was actually really good! The PoPo Platter was not so impressive. The beef stock tasted foul and I ended up not continuing with it. I didn&#39;t want to go further with the ribs, but the wontons were delicious, the fried shrimp was crunchy and the egg rolls were not greasy. 

The restaurant did not acquire a dessert menu, which left us feeling left out. That ended a good night. Food? Not so impressive . Service? Well Ken has a charm like no other and he will have me as a returning diner."

Service was slow and the place wasn&#39;t all that busy. My egg roll tasted like chemicals.  I actually sent my lemon chicken back because it had a horrible taste. I order lemon chicken at almost every Chinese place I go to and for me to send any Chinese dish back is unheard of!!!  The dish was just bland and tasted almost gamey. Weird. I ended up substituting with the Four Treasures which is a mix of beef, chicken, pork and shrimp in a garlic sauce with broccoli. It definitely tasted better than the lemon chicken but even the broccoli had an odd taste. I dunno. Either my taste buds have suddenly gone awry or there is something seriously wrong with this place&#39;s cooking or recipes or just freshness of ingredients. I wont be back."

Now we moved back to the hood  and here I am.  One thing I did notice  was this place was updated.   It was clean, tacky lights and salt water fish tank to admire while waiting for your food.  As soon as i walked in, thing that turned me off was the smell.  Smell of the detergent similar to the restroom chemical.  

I ordered 3 dinners and large hot and sour soup.  I was glad to hear the soup didnt have pork.  It was &#34;to go&#34; and friendly lady told me will take about 10 minute.  Food came out super fast.. 5 min?  Brought it home to find out it was very well packaged.  Very pleased.  Found some almond cookies and also fortune cookies.

However, food was quite bland.  Any of the item with chilli pepper wasnt spicy at all.  Szechun beef (shredded vegi and beef with specks of hot pepper) was so so.  Tofu family style wasnt appetizing.  Fried tofu seemed not so fresh. Hot and sour soup (no pork) was very sweet which I didnt like it  at all.   Prawns with garlic sauce was also disappointing.

Overall, it wasnt spicy....  it wasnt flavorful,  just plain boring.  Good thing they give you lots of soy sauces.  

Pros: quick n clean
Cons: close by so keep trying until I find something that they do well?"

I simply cannot believe that I have never taken the time to review Golden Wok, whom I&#39;ve patronized for many, many years. How tacky of me. Let&#39;s just go ahead and fix that now, shall we?

To my mind, some of the best dishes at GW (yes, I called it that) are the ones that are just a bit out of the ordinary. The offering of plump scallops in a white wine reduction proves my point rather vividly doesn&#39;t it? Or how about a plentiful serving of tofu with five-spice sauce? (For those playing along at home, the spices in question are fennel, star anise, cloves, Sichuan peppercorn, and the cinnamon relative known as cassia). Sssssssssssssssssss! No, I&#39;m not casting aspersions - I was in fact just reminded of their black-pepper strip steak served on a sizzling platter! Then again, how often do you see a soup made with pork and Zha Cai (pickled mustard greens) at your usual Chinese restaurant? Yes, that&#39;s what I thought you&#39;d say. To sum up, if you&#39;re looking for a little diversion from the everyday with regards to Chinese cuisine, I think Golden Wok will suit you just fine.

And then again (it&#39;s vacillation time people), there&#39;s something to be said for the old favorites, and Lord knows GW has them in large numbers (abbondanza!) as well. The yellow curry-kissed, mixed-meat extravaganza often known as &#34;Singapore noodles&#34; (although it&#39;s about as Singaporean as I am) is a standout dish in this regard, as are the plentiful (in terms of both variety and size) egg fu yung offerings. Oh, you&#39;re in a poultry kind of mood today? Then may I suggest a little ginger duck, or almond chicken? I think you&#39;ll approve. Don&#39;t worry, vegetable fans, I wouldn&#39;t dream of leaving you out - see if a little Yuxiang (garlic-sauce) eggplant or a snowpea/black mushroom stirfry will ring those culinary chimes for you. I think it&#39;s pretty safe to say that Golden Wok will suit a wide range of palates - and in fact, I just said exactly that, so how much more motivation do you need to try them out already?"

The owner&#39;s wife is a big fan of Swarovski, its crystals nicely displayed in a huge glass case. She is a very friendly woman and warms up to you in no time, she likes to chat while giving great service!

This past time we came here for a dinner party presented in a five course meal. The soup was Minced Beef with Egg Whites and you don&#39;t see that on the regular menu, guess it&#39;s only for special occasions! It was OK, I&#39;ve had better somewhere else, it&#39;s a tricky soup to make authentically anyway. The second course was appetizers which included Cheese Wonton and Pot Stickers, with sweet and sour and dumpling dipping sauces, respetively. Both items were very fresh and hot, the taste was standard. 

The main course included my favorite of Golden Wok&#39;s best dish - Sizzling Short Rib Platter. You can smell it from the kitchen and the flavor is incredible, a must try if you visit this restaurant! We also had Chicken in Black Bean Sauce, Chinese Broccoli, and Shrimp Two-Ways. I find Golden Wok makes great sauces and as a result, you can easily down a couple bowls of rices.

The online menu is super handy and made it nice and easy for ordering. Everything seemed to be $9-10 each and you can make a dish a meal for $2.

We got the mongolian beef, beef lo mein, and snow peas with water chestnuts. It came with two huge packages of rice and everything was $34. We were quoted a wait time of 50 minutes and everything showed up within 20.

Food wise, everything was very fresh and not too oily. The mongolian beef was delicious and comes on a bed of little noodles. The veggies were still crisp and went well over the rice. 
I&#39;ve been on the hunt for the perfect egg noodle chow mein/lo mein and still can&#39;t find what I&#39;m used to. The lo mein here consists of thick noodles, kind of like udon. While it tasted good, it wasn&#39;t what I was hoping for. I may need to point out that we googled the difference before chow mein and lo mein before ordering.

I would definitely order from here again and recommend this place."

Their food is great. We have ventured from our standard orders and everything we have ordered we have liked. They even accommodate special requests without a problem. 

The people that own/operate Golden Wok are very friendly. Ask about the fish tank if you have a minute. It is very beautiful and Mr Wong can tell you all about it. 

We often use their delivery service, and the food is still fantastic - Crab Cheese Wontons arrive and are still crispy. 

Golden Wok may seem a bit expensive, but we always have enough leftovers for a decent sized lunch or dinner the next day. So you do get quite a bit for what you pay."

We got fried rice, crab cheese wontons, sesame chicken, and general Taos chicken.

Fried rice was delish, no onions which is just fine by me.

Sesame and general tsaos chicken tasted almost identical to me equally yum-tastic with a hint of spice.

The wontons were good not amazing, I was a little disappointed that there wasn&#39;t much in the way of actual crab. But still what&#39;s not to like about deep fried cream cheese? Oh ya that&#39;s right nothing.


All in all this is the best delivery Chinese I have ever had in this area. A tad more expensive than other places but 100% worth it. And the owners are so sweet I&#39;ll support their business for sure."

Service is excellent and would be hard to beat. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Great Kung Pao Beef.

Onto the food:

Ordered the crab/cream cheese wantons, veggie egg rolls, and moo shu shrimp.

The appetizers were good.  Ton of cheese, not so much crab.  And excellent horseradish sauce.

The moo shu was tasty, but immediately following the food came an intense headache that made me feel like those pool party nights in college.  Not good.

If you are sensitive, allergic, or just avoid MSG, don&#39;t order entrees.  They are friendly, and I assumed that the food did not have MSG in it, but never assume.  The plum sauce very well could have been the culprit.  It may not say MSG directly, but plum sauce and hoisin sauce found in many Asian markets have a crap ton of E-### chemicals in them that can cause similar reactions.  Call ahead and see what the deal is if you want to, some places are typically good about making things without MSG.

I will give them another shot if that is the case and no MSG meals can be accomodated."

The menu is not too large like many Chinese joints.  The selection gives plenty of choices without being overwhelming.  The place is very nice inside, clean and nicely decorated with some fountains and a salt water fish tank.

My girlfriend and I have been meaning to try this place for a while and decided to head over and give it a shot.  We agreed on some fried dumplings for an appetizer.  They came out hot and perfectly presented beautifully on a bed of shredded lettuce.  They were excellent with lots of flavor, the sauce had just a hint of spice, soy and a little plum sweetness.

I decided on the sesame beef dinner with soup, egg roll, and a fried won-ton.  The egg drop soup is great, served piping hot, plenty of eggs, has some veggies, tofu and a great thick flavorful base.  The egg roll and won ton were fired to perfection, the egg roll has a spice that I am unsure what it is but compliments it and makes it unique.  The sesame beef is very tender, slightly crispy on the outside and the sauce is great, a little spicy and a little bit sweet.

My girlfriend opted for the prawns in lobster sauce.  Good size prawns not overcooked and served in a large dish full of flavorful sauce with lots of sautéed mushrooms.

I found that the service was probably some of the best service I have had in a long time.  Water and iced tea glasses never got to the bottom and dishes came and went off the table as if automatic removal upon last bite was enabled...

Overall we had a very pleasant dining experience.  They serve large portions and the price is right in line with what I was expecting to pay for dinner."

I&#39;m not sure the chicken was actually chicken.  The prawns were rubbery and bland.  The veggies were a pile of mush.  The only reason they got 1 star is because they do have good rice.

The food was excellent and there was more than enough, even with me not eating rice.  The drinks (Alcoholic) were good, reasonably priced and not watered down like most places so expect them to be nice and strong.  Service was great and they were attentive without being too much.  We have been back several times with friends and family and it has been consistently good in all things.

That being said the choices on the menu are very standard fair so don&#39;t come in expecting a lot of super unique or rare dishes.  It is great as a general Chinese food place but it doesn&#39;t have a lot of wow factor to really impress.  There are a lot better places to take a date to really impress but if you have been together and now want someplace to have a nice relaxing meal out at someplace that still remembers it is a restaurant and not someone&#39;s kitchen then this is a good place to go.

I do recommend ordering a Volcano if you are over 21 and drink, it is an experience and meant for 2+ people to drink."

I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special and crab cheese wontons. The wontons were lovely. Lots of chunky crab meat inside and nicely crisp. I&#39;m a sucker for a good house mustard and I&#39;m always pleased when they don&#39;t stick me with the gross packets for take out. Their hot mustard was nice and spicy! Great flavor, but it was grainy and runny. And the sweet and sour sauce was very watery as well; slid right off my wontons, but was tasty all the same. I love a lunch take out that includes soup; so many places offer it dine in only and the hot and sour soup was absolutely delicious. Perfect consistency and spice! The sesame chicken wasn&#39;t anything special. The sauce was yummy but had a gelatanous consistency and there wasn&#39;t much of it, and the chicken wasn&#39;t crispy even though it was quite fresh. The rice was plain but would have been great with more soy sauce... But they only gave me one packet. Who only uses one packet of soy sauce!? The wontons and soup far made up for the lack of a super main course. Next time I&#39;ll probably just order the wontons and a large order of soup, or try a different entree. Also, staff was prompt and friendly and the decor would have made for great discussion so I wouldn&#39;t have minded sitting down here."

We got the dinner option, that comes with soup, spring rolls, a wonton, and fried or steamed rice.  I had a tofu dish that was wonderful, and my gf had a chicken dish which, while nothing fancy, was perfectly executed.  The menu includes a vast array of dishes that should have something for everyone.  To top it all off, it was very reasonably priced.

Had take out one night.

Chow fun was SPICY.  Did I ask for spicy?  No.  Why the hell would a Chinese restaurant prepare beef with wide flat noodles SPICY?

Tofu with Black Mushrooms.  Okay I asked for this one (literally).  Tried to see if they had a dish like this...one of my favorites at Cafe Ambrosia.  All I can say is that I have NEVER tasted black mushrooms that were as bad as these.  They were bitter!  WTF!  Not only that, the dish had red pepper flakes in it and was spicy.  Did I ask for spicy?  No.

Wonton Soup...meh
Fried Rice...meh

Seriously, I know Chinese food and Chop Suey.  This is NOT it.

Better options nearby:
Cafe Ambrosia
Paradise Asian Cafe
Little Panda (not great, but sticks to chop suey pretty good)
Moon Thai Cafe (not great, but WAY better than this place)
Panda Express (seriously, it&#39;s better)
China Chef Express (a drive to Mississippi and Peoria, but worth it; Roast Pork Fried Rice is very classic chop suey style; well, technically, everything here is.  :) )
Hoong&#39;s Palace (expensive for chop suey, but very good; try their lunch specials for an idea of what they can do)

Would I try it again?  (Are you seriously interested in my answer to this?!??  Really?  Did you not read my review?  In case you need an answer.  No.)

UPDATE:  Added China Chef Express and Hoong&#39;s Palace to list of better options.  
UPDATE2:  For fairness, I am only rating what I have ordered.  Therefore, I will raise it to 2 stars."

To date, I have worked through about half of the menu, and I have no complaints.  The steaks are great.  To some, they may be pricey.  I suggest the sampler of 3 filets to try the different crusts, Gorgonzola, Kona coffee, and wasabi. If steak is not your thing, the scallops are amazing.  

My only suggestion would be to include a bar menu.  We usually sit at the bar and order from the dinner menu.  However, we are usually the only people in the bar.  Thus, the bar is an underutilized space missing revenue.  Maybe an upscale house ground burger and other high end bar menu items could be a good addition."

I&#39;ve lived in Colorado for a year now after moving from Chicago, so my comparison is a high end Chicago steakhouse and while The Butchery was good, it was not as good as those I&#39;ve frequented in Chicago.

Pros:
Service was very attentive and friendly. If you&#39;re from Colorado, you&#39;ll swoon over the level of attention and interaction with the staff. We actually waited an additional 15 minutes after being served our appetizers to put in our entree order just to slow the pace of the meal.
The cornbread, soup, wedge, au gratin potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts, and lamb meatballs were all delicious.
Wine was also quite affordability priced.

Cons:
The restaurant is set up nicely inside, but is incredibly bright. So no semblance of a pleasant warm candlelit dinner. Also, the bar might have been playing music we think, but it didn&#39;t reach our table. So we had no respite from conversational noise from our neighboring booth. 

Wife&#39;s NY strip was cooked a hair over the medium she asked for, but my bone in ribeye (ordered as rare+) came out medium.
We were dining late and I decided the meat was tasty enough to finish so I didn&#39;t complain, but I&#39;m 100% certain they would have taken back the meat and fired another one had I asked.
Even cooked to medium, the streak was tender and had good flavor due to its marbling and seasoning.
The meat itself was a thinner cut than I&#39;m used to at a steakhouse and did not lend itself to cutting thin slices from a buttery-tender, thick, pleasantly red inside steak as I&#39;ve grown to enjoy. Perhaps I&#39;m just used to Midwestern meat? Hard to say.

Overall, for the price point ($75/person with some drinks/apps) it is a solid steakhouse that I am pleased is located in Arvada.
We might be back."

The decor of the remodeled restaurant was a very pleasant surprise and beautifully modernized. We both started with the lobster bisque and were very happy with the light taste. We both had the prime top sirloin and it was melt in your mouth delicious. We shared the sticky toffee pudding, which was rich tasty.

We were looking for a new place to celebrate my husband&#39;s 40th birthday and stumbled across The Butchery while checking out Yelp.  The reviews were great and we were surprised we had never heard of this place before, so we decided to check them out.  Upon arriving we were greeted at the door with a warm welcome from Danny, and our server Courtney was fun and inviting.  We learned that The Butchery just opened 2 weeks ago and we were excited that we discovered them on Yelp!  

The complimentary green chili cornbread with honey butter they serve at the beginning was DIVINE!  We also really enjoyed the crab, goat cheese, artichoke dip with sour dough bread as an appetizer.  For dinner I had the Bourbon Barrel Salmon and my husband had the bacon wrapped filet mignon with lobster tail - both of which were delicious!  To celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday they brought out a caramel creme brûlée that was to die for!  Overall we were very pleased with our experience and will definitely be back soon!  

The only problem we noticed is that from 80th Ave or even Allison Way, you would never know they even exist or are even open as there is no lighting in the parking lot or on the signage to the restaurant.  If driving by the restaurant at night, you *might* notice a building with lights on through the windows, but it would be helpful if there was some sort of signage from the road, lights in the parking lot and lights shining on the building/restaurant sign so it&#39;s easier to find.

Despite that, they are definitely worth trying out if you enjoy quality steak and seafood."

Made a reservation, they were prepared and we were seated promptly.  

Lobster bisque was very good, per my husband.  He loves the bisque!  I had a wedge salad, very good and one of my favorites.  Son had the soup of the day, also very good

Two of us had steaks, (tenderloin and sirloin) and one of us ordered the chicken.  The chicken was well cooked, but not as flavorful as anticipated - but hte star of the chicken dish was the polenta!  Wonderful cheesy and creamy, excellent dish.

The steaks were all marvelous.  My son commented that his favorite of the tenderloin medallion trio was the wasabi - he thought they wasabi would have been too skimpy, but was a good marriage with the steak.  Steaks were perfectly cooked and tender.

We will come back.

I agree with the other comments, it is difficult to find if you are thinking it&#39;s near Wadsworth or 80th, better signage would be helpful."

Not a huge menu, but a great variety, prices vary for selection of course (there are dishes under $31).  First time we have been here since it changed a few months ago from the Old Neighborhood to the Butchery. Kaela was our server and she was very knowledgeable and friendly.  They still have the bar area and she did say they had a good happy hour, so we will have to try that as well. We WILL go back!"

Met another couple for diner there. We sat in the bar to have a drink while waiting for our table. The couple we were meeting had arrived previously and ordered their drinks. When the bartender delivered their drinks he said he&#39;d be right back, never came back. Really? Take the order save the trip. I stood at the bar for 5-7 minutes. He never came down. Finally another staff member came over and took my drink order.
Second round, the BT made it to our table. Got the drink order wrong, even after repeating the order back to us. 

I noticed full glass racks with clean glasses scattered on the floor behind the bar with staff stepping over them. Makes you wonder what&#39;s going on behind the scenes.

Sat for dinner. Our waitress was pleasant,  but did not know how to deliver / sell the menu. She spent way too much time at our table explaining menu items with no idea what she was talking about. Very scripted as opposed to experienced or informed.

The menu looked great. The food was not. The steaks were cooked to perfection. But that&#39;s where it ended. The menu descriptions do not match what comes to the table, not by any stretch. 

Ordered a cup of lobster bisque. It was thick as paste, salty, no lobster ( this after our waitress raved about the amount of lobster you get) and no sherry. 

Ordered the meat and cheese tray. Again, our waitresses time spent describing it bordered on documentary like. However, the presentation was great, the cheeses awesome, the fig preserves good, but the generic salami was in no way soppressata  as our waitress had claimed.

Our waitress proudly told us they owned all of the animals from where the various cuts of meet hailed. Um... find that hard to believe.

Ordered the steak trio - encrusted tenderloins - wasabi, gorgonzola and porcini mushroom. Not encrusted but topped with a veiled attempt of some sort of crouton. The claimed Flavors didn&#39;t exist. Although the steak was cooked correctly, it was tasteless. 

The lobster mac n cheese resembled top ramen. It had a seasoning that was so predominant that, that was all you could taste. It muted everything else.

The floor staff has no idea how to deliver at the level the menu demands.

The kitchen staff has created a cheap knockoff as to what is described on the menu.

Although the management offered to comp our meal, we respectfully declined. Not looking for a free meal, but a solid restaurant close to home.

In short. The menu looks great, but they food doesn&#39;t even come close to the description. Nothing special and no value. What a disappointment"

This seems to be a great repurposing of The Old Neighborhood building that has been in Arvada for as long as I can remember.  The inside isn&#39;t drastically different but the changes are a welcome refresh that gives it a contemporary feel.

We started with the cheese board with the tallow candle which was a fun dish and worth trying; especially if you&#39;re not afraid of fat!  I followed that up with the NY strip which was cooked perfectly.  Crispy sear on the outside and not overdone.  We tried a few different drinks and all were all tasty without being overly fussy.  Everything seemed fresh which is great considering most local options seem to be chains that serve packaged and canned food.

Prices seem to be about on par considering the neighborhood and theme.  I can see this place growing a long list of regulars from the surrounding area.  I feel like they would benefit from a sign on the street though because the place is easy to miss, unfortunately.  Overall a welcome addition to the neighborhood, though."

Our waitress Kelly did a really nice job, kudos to her! Soup of the day beef vegetable, very good, along with a nice crisp wedge salad. Chicken piccata had a nice flavor, but had a unusual presentation that looked a little off? Bone in rib eye, was average in taste, wasn&#39;t a aged steak that could be more flavorful and tender. The potato Au gratin was excellent and the asparagus were nice and big. So I would go again to try different things on the menu, but I would not give this restaurant 5 stars, but it does have promise, only being open a couple of months."

We started with the Artichoke Crab Dip that was creamy and savory that was complemented by sour dough bread. The complimentary green chili cornbread was a nice and delicious. My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the bone-in ribeye. My wife absolutely loved her scallops; they were cooked beautifully and smelled amazing. My ribeye was perfectly cooked to medium rare and was melt in my mouth tender. We both ordered the lobster Mac and cheese as our side which was creamy, cheesy, lobstery goodness. To end the dinner we ordered a chocolate cake slice to go and it was rich, mellow, and delicious.

My wife and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the people, the food, and the service. We will definitely recommend to our friends and will be visiting again."

Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t what I expected.  There were three other tables filled at the time of our visit so fairly empty and quiet.  Our server was pleasant and did a good job.  

To start, we were served a green chile corn bread that was to die for.  Ordered a shrimp cocktail which had nicely sized, plain boiled shrimp (nothing fancy) and cocktail with bland tomato paste seemingly missing the horseradish.  We weren&#39;t hungry enough to do justice to a $40.00+\- steak so ventured to order a non-steak entree. 

I ordered the pork chop medium well and it arrived dried out and burnt but it appeared to have started as a nice sized chop.  The cherry compote was fabulous but the scalloped potatoes were not quite done and bland (needed lots of salt to add flavor).

My Mom ordered chicken piccata and it was good. Again though, needed lots of lemon and salt but nice portion and pretty on plate.  It was served with a massive dollop of bland mashed potatoes which was odd to me.  They too were lacking salt and a little runny. I thought they might be instant.

We will try again at some future time but they should consider seasoning adjustments and maybe a pasta to go underneath the piccata.  I hope they make this work but I haven&#39;t seen any advertisement or other indication that it is now open and prices seem high for Arvada and the location considering all sides are extra.  The manager compensated our meal and was very gracious about our concerns so that was handled well but first impressions at what is priced to be a high end steak and seafood restaurant is so very critical."

prompt and courteous. She went over the menu in detail giving great suggestions and feedback on the wonderful selection of appetizers and entrees on the menu. We started with the lump crab, goat cheese and artichoke app and it was fabulous. We then each ordered the chophouse wedge salad and it is truly amazing. For the main course I selected the 10 oz Kona Coffee rubbed sirloin and my wife ordered the Brown Butter Seared Scallops. My steak was done perfectly (ordered medium) and was an absolute delight. I thought there was no way I would finish it, but before I knew it, it was gone. The asparagus side was also cooked perfectly, tender with just a hint of crispness. My wife&#39;s sea scallops were outstanding. They too were cooked perfectly and had an unbelievable flavor. We left no room for dessert, so will have to comment on that next time. The Maitre d&#39; thanked us again when we left.

Pork LoMein - all grease and water and belly aches all night.

Egg Rolls - right from the frozen food section of Wal-Mart.

The food is below average: cashew chicken lacked flavor and was full of onions as &#34;fillers.&#34;  Worse than the cashew chicken was the shrimp in lobster sauce: it came in a large bowl and looked more like soup. Absolutely zero flavor: it just tasted like shrimp boiled in water. 

All of the above, combined with a hostess/server with the personality of a doorknob, is a sure guarantee that this is a &#34;one and done&#34; place."

Ordered large hot and sour soup that was &#34;meh&#34;.  Was hoping to share with others but came with only one spoon. I was thinking of huge bowl for the price but it was served in Correll soup bowl meant for one with good appetite.  It was mostly liquid and not much of anything in it.

Steamed bok choi was seasoned pretty well but other entries had strange taste that I didnt like.  Maybe its authentic Chinese food? Definitely not to my liking. 

The pu pu platter was also quite different  than other restaurants.  It was cheaper than other places but also came out with less and not so appetizing items. 

Pricing wise,  similar to Hoongs Palace but definitely &#34;NOT&#34; in service,  atmosphere, presentation or in food quality.  Once is enough to this restauant.

My boyfriend ordered the scallion beef - also very tasty. I would definitely come back!

After reading some of the reviews, this place is not for the customers who constantly need to make adjustments to their order. You know the customer who orders beef with broccoli, and then asks that it is served with bok choy with light sauce. This is a family run business that makes good authentic food, if you want Americanized Chinese, just go to Panda Express and save everyone the hassle.

Lucky China has now redesigned their menu and really pretty much abandoned the Korean-Chinese amalgamation.  It was a quiet night so we talked with the owner, who is a nice Chinese woman who does front-of-house (and her husband cooks).  She said that the Korean items were not hits with the Koreans, and people are coming in mostly for the authentic Chinese fare at Lucky China.  (Shows how much I know about the restaurant business; I was saying that they should embrace the Korean-Chinese fusion.)   There are some Korean noodle dishes remaining, but they are relegated to their own section on the back of the menu, and Northern Chinese cuisine now reigns.   

Call it whatever you want, it&#39;s still some great food.   I&#39;ve enjoyed some of the best vegetable dishes in town here.  Try the Bok Choy, Chinese Lettuce, and Water Spinach dishes; they are cooked with such panache and flavor, you&#39;re not going to miss the meat.    Of course if you are an omnivore, there&#39;s a great many other things to sample: red-cooked pork, the spicy boiled fish, and spectacular soup noodle bowls (made with handmade noodles).  We haven&#39;t gone wrong once with anything we have ordered."

Not much on the outside and decor inside is minimal but the staff is friendly and this is some of the most flavorful Chinese I have had in all of my four years in Denver. To the left of the M Mart. Lunch special is highly inclusive for the $8.95 - including rice choice, soup choice, fried wonton, egg roll, and beverage. I highly recommend."

All that shopping at M-Mart (or, if you prefer, Midopa) can really wear out a person. At times like these, I&#39;m glad that I can pop right next door and have a great meal at Lucky China, which offers no less than *three* menus to choose from.

As you may have guessed, LC does indeed have the more Americanized options offered by many of our Sinitic-focused places around town. So if you want to get your mouth around a Pu Pu - Platter, that is! - you&#39;re in good company here, with a plate loaded with six different appetizers (egg rolls, cheese wontons, skewered beef, pork ribs, chicken wings and for you seafood lovers, even fantail shrimp). You can of course have your pick of sesame chicken, egg fu yung, garlic beef, and so on too... but wouldn&#39;t you like to hear a bit about their Traditional Chinese menu? I suspected you might.

One of my favorite things here is the whole butterfish braised in a brown sauce boasting just the faintest whisper of star anise. In fact, it&#39;s one of the most toothsome fish dishes I&#39;ve ever tried - honest! But then again, I&#39;m also enamored with the stirfry of pork, dried beancurd and spring onion. The wholesome, comforting beef brisket hotpot is another idea for you, as is the eggplant with basil, or the shrimp with rich salted egg, or even the Omasum (bible-tripe - specifically the cow&#39;s third stomach) in red chile oil. Honestly, you&#39;re going to enjoy anything you try, so why not be a little adventurous? If you get really stuck, let your charming host (why yes, he did formerly work at China Jade a bit east of here) give you some suggestions.

And as if all that wasn&#39;t enough, they even offer a few Korean-Chinese options. Jajangmyeon (noodles with black bean sauce)... Bokkeumbap (fried rice)... Jjamppong (spicy noodle soup)... the gang&#39;s all here. If you get a big enough group together, you can have a grand old time sampling from all three menus. Doesn&#39;t that sound fun? So next time you find yourself needing some Pocky, Pretz, or even Calpis, try your luck at Lucky China too."

I didn&#39;t have high hopes so I ordered the sesame chicken. It was in my top 3 in best sesame chickens. It was so good I literally ate it 5 days in a row. So I wanted to try some new things, and that&#39;s when it started crashing down. I ordered the Kung pao chicken. It was awful! It literally was chicken with only bell peppers!  I didnt give up so I ordered curry chicken and asked for no bell peppers  since they over did it on my last order. So guess what I get? Onion curry with very little chicken. I gave up on trying new things so just ordered sesame chicken until they served me hard rice. This isn&#39;t a place to be a regular because I&#39;m pretty sure if I wasn&#39;t, they would&#39;ve put more effort in the other dishes. Will I go back? Probably not."

I loved eating it throughout the winter in Seoul and San Diego has an awesome Korean/Chinese place to grab some. Out here in Denver/Aurora, I haven&#39;t adventured out to try some until the snow storm we just had this weekend. Since Im recovering from the common cold and the cold temps, Jjampong, instead of Pho, was what my body was craving. Lucky China popped up and I headed out. 

Wonderfully Spicy! with tons of fish, shrimp, and bok choy. They even brought over some gochugaru (red pepper flakes) in case I needed extra spice, which I did, since I love spicy. The hand-cut noodles were chewy and delicious. You can tell the noodles are hand made when they have all sorts of kinks and slight variances in width. And the soup wasn&#39;t too oily, which forebodes stomach aches. The servers were kind and fast. I will definitely go to Lucky China again to try the Jjajangmyeon."

The waiter is friendly from the time we first walked in, diligently serving throughout the meal, and very accommodating.  He&#39;s also pretty honest, I would trust his recommendations on food. 

I&#39;ve yet to try any Korean dishes from them, but their Chinese dishes are pretty good.  I had a Szechuan style spicy chicken once, and it&#39;s too salty for my taste, that&#39;s the only reason why I knocked it down 1 star, cuz their food can be on the strong side.  The waiter told me their noodles for the non spicy seafood noodles is hand made, my bf had it once and it&#39;s hooked.  Now everytime we go back, we HAD to order that dish.  The prices/portions are well balanced.  It&#39;s maybe $2-3 more than if you were to get stuff from a Chinese takeout place, but the quality is much better, and it&#39;s family style so their portion is better as well.  I ordered their salt and pepper spare ribs for myself since my bf doesn&#39;t eat meat, it was awesome (garlicky!) with enough for me to have it for a second meal. 

They don&#39;t have a lot of tables but I&#39;ve never really had to wait. If you have a bigger party, they only have 1-2 big tables so I&#39;d suggest you calling ahead of time.  I went with a party of 8 and the food was amazing and the bill wasn&#39;t bad neither.  People come in for take out constantly while we eat there and I believe they do delivery as well. 

I&#39;ll definitely go back and drag some friends along as well.  And remember, it&#39;s family style so order to share."

First thing was the lamb skewer, meat was too lean and dry, too much cumin and not enough spicy seasoning. The real lam skewers should&#39;ve been a lot fattier that those. 

Second was the beef brisket noodle soup. I had a lot of hope for this one because of all the good reviews they had, but it was a total disappointment. The soup was watered down, brisket was complete fatty tissue, the only good thing was the noodle itself but I had to put a lot of seasoning to make it taste good. 

Third thing, we put in an order for the fried fish, but the waitress forgot our order and never brought it out. After waiting for 30 minutes we finally figured out it wasn&#39;t being cooked, so we told them never mind.

The Waiter recommended some good dishes. The food is excellent. Although not spicy enough for me since I am a big fan of hot and spicy dishes, the rest of the party thought it was just right. I was told the Chef is from one of the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco. The price is reasonable and the portions are very generous. This place is so much better than China Jade in Aurora.

They have two different types of menus. If you are up for more authentic dishes, go for the Authentic Chinese Menu. Will definitely go back to Lucky."

Very little ambulatory movement required, which I support.

The order person was friendly and personable (and quick to remind me about the lunch special so I could get my
complementary soda), the prices were good for the portion sizes, and the delivery was stupid prompt, like so prompt that the food came while I was still on my pre-lunch smoke break.  Despite the fact that my vices had inconvenienced the hell out of her, the woman who brought my food was all smiles. She fretted that my food had gotten cold while she&#39;d waited for me, but given that she&#39;d functionally teleported to my office, these fears were entirely unfounded.

As for the food, I had egg drop soup (good, was surprised by the addition of what I think was silken tofu, but not at all mad at it), a large portion if chicken fried rice (also good, and came without veg, which I&#39;d asked for), and the Szechuan Beef extra hot (nomnomnom), which as a lunch special, came with an egg roll, a filled wonton, and the aforementioned soda.  Everything was tasty as a mofo, and I definitely have enough left over for lunch tomorrow.

All in all, good food, good price, good delivery - everything you could ask for in an impromptu decision to have Chinese for lunch, and one I will definitely repeat."

If it&#39;s your first time dining in you have to get the jerk chicken with Jamaican rice. So good! The jerk chicken or any of their chicken is so tender it just falls off the bone. I have also heard the patties are very good but I have yet to try them.  Honey has also had the curry shrimp and the curry sauce it comes cooked in was nothing short of amazing.

Come at lunch time to get the best selection of foods available, they usually end up selling out of something by late afternoon. Service is fast and efficient and prices are reasonable for the portion size.

I love that you can order the jerk chicken at varied spiciness. I ordered it medium and thought it was perfect...nicely spicy of those wonderful Scotch bonnets but also allspice, black pepper and cinnamon. The sauce had a fruity came right off the bone. Delicious!  My co-worker did order his &#34;hot&#34; though and looked like he had a rough time with it.

On the side are a handful of delicious fried plantains and a creamy red beans and rice that I think may of had coconut milk in it. The jerk chicken was a lunch special so it was only $10....not at all bad for a good lunch.

The decor has lots of black, yellow and green for the Jamaican flag and lots of Rastafarian imagery. Not a large interior space but enough to accommodate several parties.

My co-workers and I had a strict hour to walk three blocks eat and return, but the service was quite efficient and we ate in plenty of time.

I got the lunch special for jerk chicken, spicy. It came with rice and a side, and I chose the plantains. The jerk flavor on the chicken/sauce was phenomenal! Unfortunately the skin wasn&#39;t remotely crispy, it was rather soggy, the rice was bland, and I got a mere 3 slices of bland plantains as the side.

Our table tried a number of things, but the biggest hit was the jerk chicken served mild, medium or spicy, served with a rice blend and your choice of sides. Just a note on spice, they keep it pretty mild- so medium is pretty mild, and spicy is enjoyably so but not too hot.We enjoyed every bite!

That experience with the food was just &#34;MEH&#34;.  Hence to this establishment we went again, in hoping by this time things could have been better.  I do hope so.  First when we arrived at this establishment is DEAD!  Seems DEAD.. NO other patrons.  This recent visit was on Saturday September 20th 2014.  That evening the time was about 18:50hrs ish.

  Our lovely staff gave us the Menu, and took our order.  We ordered the following items :

*  1 order of Beef Patties ($2.59)
*  1 order of Curry Chicken Patties ($3.49)
*  1 order of Beef &amp; Cheese Patties ($2.89)
*  Jerk Chicken and Pasta ($9.90)
*  Curry Mutton (Goat) ($12.89) with an option of side, I opt to have Potato Salad.
*  Mexican Coke Cola ($2.00)

  For one, when our Patties arrived, ERR it was like its already pre-made.  Micro-waved or put in the oven for several minutes.  The Patties came luke-warm.. its more like Err, NOT a way to a good start.  Its NOT freshly made or even freshly fried or baked.  *SAD FACE*  The Patties are 2 stars in our books with More Like &#34;MEGA MEH&#34;.  We opt to have the, Beef, Curry Chicken, Beef and Cheese.

  Hubs like his order of Jerk Chicken and Pasta.  But the word &#34;LIKE&#34; here is an understatement.  Its just Chicken pieces, on some &#34;Penne&#34; Pasta and drizzled with some Generic Hot Sauce.  Coz for one, its something that we could &#34;stir&#34; up at home.  *SIGH*

    My order of Mutton (Goat) Curry comes with Rice and Beans and one option of Side.  The Side option, I opt for is Potato Salad.  I am OK with my order of Mutton (Goat) Curry but somehow felt the portions can be skimpy and some key notes of certain flavor from the Mutton (Goat) Curry was missing...  *DOUBLE SIGH*  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes from their Menu.

  All in all SUB-PAR Options.  The dishes we ordered DID NOT WOW Us as much as we were hoping for.  We felt underwhelmed from the OVERALL experience dining here in terms of Ambience, Food and Services.  Hence this Generous 2 Stars Review.  *SAD FACE INDEED*

  By the time we almost finish our Dinner, many more Patrons came for dining in or opt to have their orders TO GO.  Above anything else, we hope and wish Jamaican Grill best wishes and may all good things come along their way, in their future business undertakings.

I ordered the boneless jerk chicken lunch with plantains because they were out of almost everything else--including ripe plantains.

The plate of food I had was delicious. And the service was excellent, better than I typically receive. There&#39;s really nothing to complain about. 

My only issue is a strictly personal one, trying to replicate the food I had in Jamaican 15 years ago. The jerk chicken and rice and peas just aren&#39;t as good as I remember.

Place is small, but cozy. They have a bar in the back, but don&#39;t think they turned the heat on and it was freezing if you say towards the back. 
We got there just in time before the rush and there was one waitress. 
We ordered the brown stew chicken, red snapper and brown stew oxtail. 
Keep in mind that any of the seafood items will take 25 minutes so to keep from starving we ordered some bed patties to keep us from falling out. 
The patties were decent. The pastry was a bit hard but the meat filling was pretty Delish. It was a bit spicy, but my six year old was still able to enjoy one by himself. 
The snapper and chicken were good and the portion was huge. On the other hand the oxtail wasn&#39;t worth the price. Considering the amount of meat that comes on those things, a few more oxtail a would be nice. 
The rice was well cooked and seasoned well, the plantains could use a bit more crisp, but the cabbage was pretty tasty. 
I would go back here for sure. I just hope they would hire more help and add more oxtails. 
My husband ordered two drinks as well and our bill was $60. A bit much for lunch, but we walked out full and satisfied."

I was hanging out with Cyn and we decided food was in order. We stopped here and found parking right out front.

Upon entering, the waitress seated us and handed us menus. As it was lunch time, Jamaican Grill has some lunch specials. However, I love patties and really wanted one. The waitress told me they were out, but in fact, they were cooking 2 at that time. I ordered both of them, as well as an order of coco bread.

Cyn ordered the lunch special of brown stew chicken. To be honest, a &#34;brown stew&#34; chicken did not sound appetizing to me at all. When Cyn&#39;s dish was brought out and I had a bite, I was proven wrong. It was delicious and the chicken was almost fall of the bone tender. When I come back, I will give this a try.

My beef patties were tasty and a bit spicy, but not too much. I was interested to try the curried chicken patties, but they were out that day. My waitress did forget about my nonalcoholic ginger beer, but didn&#39;t charge me for it, so it was fine.

I did enjoy the food and will probably take my stepson next time he&#39;s in town, as he loves beef patties too. The food was very well-priced. Good food and happy to have a Jamaican place in Denver."

There were multiple items that the restaurant was &#34;out&#34; of (or it would&#39;ve taken a long time) like patties and coconut rice. So i had to make do with jamaican rice and coco bread instead. I ordered too much b/c my eyes are always bigger than my stomach. I got the lunch special, which is about $8, for a lunch portion (quite generous) of brown stew chicken, a bed of jamaican rice, and a few plantains. And a fountain soda is included. 

I ordered cocobread b/c I was hungry and wanted some bread, ok? 

Brown stew chicken might not SOUND all that appetizing, but it&#39;s fall off the bone tender, so flavorful w/o being spicy in the hot kind of way. 

Service friendly if a little slow. But you should expect that at a mom-and-pop type shop where food is made fresh. I&#39;m not sure I should be so happy that such a delicious place is so close to home."

Some tables still had drinks on them with trash littered on the floor. It took about 5 minutes or so for the server to talk to us or provide any drinks. It took another 5 minutes for iced water to come. It took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive but as long as they were cooking it on the spot, I didn&#39;t mind the wait. 

When the food arrived, the server basically ran away and hid in the kitchen. He popped his head out to look at us and laugh, then talked on his phone. I wanted hot sauce because the food was bland, and napkins but it was a hassle trying to get the server&#39;s attention. Heck, I couldn&#39;t even find him! 

They provided a lot of food, served hot, which I appreciated. I ordered the tilapia dish. The fried fish was good, crispy and not overcooked. The sauce was curry not mango, like in the description. The potato salad tasted store-bought. The &#34;hot&#34; sauce, in a red ketchup squeezy bottle, was nearly empty and had a gooey crust on top. EW. I was brave and tasted it. It was more like sweet &amp; sour sauce from Panda Express than fire-y hot sauce. I had a hard time getting anything out of the bottle and then, KAPLOP! A stringy piece or bone came shooting out. 

Overall, I would not go back. Dirty, lack of customer service, and no parking space available. That area is just terrible for driving in general."

We had the original jerked pork ribs and wow they were good. It is is certainly spicy and we live scotch bell peppers and they were definitely in the sauce. 

So they have mild, original and hot. Normally I go straight to hot, but thought better of it and got original. It was a good thing because they were as hot as I cared for. 

Great Jamaican food!"

We came in around 7:30 and apparently they close at like 8 in the winter, which is kind of weird but whatever. I think because we unknowingly came in close to &#34;closing time&#34; the food we got was all the leftover meat from the rest of the day.  I ordered the curried goat and my friend ordered the jerk chicken and both of them had more bones than actual meat. That being said, the flavor of both was great, I just wish I had gotten a little more meat out of it.

We also ordered a beef patty which was also just ok.  The fried plaintains and rice were good.  I might give this place another shot earlier in the day to see if the quality of the meat is improved."

Sizable mutton portions so if you are a meat lover, this is the dish for you!

My dining companion and I also shared the tradtitional  Jamaican jerk chicken, its pleasantly piquant marinade blending well with the crisp crunch of the cabbage slaw.

Second time in this comfortable, laid back Marley inspired restaurant.  Green walls are brightly coloured, adding to the blooming island atmosphere.

I can tell my meal was slow cooked because the chicken was very tender. For $7.89, during lunch, I received a great meal with a soda included. I had to opt for water to preserve calories lol. 

The restaurant looks small but there is a full bar in the back. The hostess was very welcoming especially when I told her it was my first visit. It will not be my last. I wasn&#39;t able to try the bar since it was my lunch hour but there is a happy hour from 5-8 with pretty good drink specials.

Well cheer up friends, because Jamaican Grill has arrived to curb those Yardy yearnings.

To begin? Well, I&#39;m so glad you asked. Why not partake of some earthy carrot juice, or even the thick, creamy (and nutrition-packed) dairy delight known as Supligen? Then, pop a few festivals in your mouth. I know - you&#39;re thinking I&#39;ve completely lost it -  but in fact, a festival is a type of fried, lightly-sweetened dumpling that&#39;s sure to get those tastebuds a-tinglin&#39;. You could also avail yourself of one or more of the handheld pies called patties, with their golden crusts (trademark people, please don&#39;t come after me) stuffed with chicken, mixed veggies or even spicy beef. (This last one is especially nice when supplemented inside with gooey melted cheese). Since patties can be a bit messy to eat, I suggest you also go all-in on an order of dense, doughy coco bread to stuff them into, rather than risk soiling your clothes, and the tablecloth, and...

Where was I? Oh yes, I was about to begin discussing the magnificent main courses on offer at Jamaican Grill. How about a whole fish marinated in vinegar, onions, and plenty of Scotch bonnet peppers (a preparation known as Escovitch)? Or some squidgy, slow-braised oxtails, or spicy curried goat? For something a bit lighter, you could try the Shrimp Delight, with its bounty of assorted steamed veggies. Each dish comes with one side item (crunchy sautéed cabbage, melt-in-the-mouth plantains, creamy potato salad...) and a choice of rice too (I personally like the preparation called rice-and-peas which, despite the name, actually features red beans and just a hint of coconut milk).

So if you want a mouthful of Mandeville, a sampling of Spanish Town, or more MoBay than you can imagine, head to Jamaican Grill. It&#39;s irie."

Caribbean is a much needed food genre in general in Denver and now I can count on Caribbean Bakery on Colfax and Jamaican Grill near Santa Fe.

I was really a fan of the bright greens and yellows and open space of the place.  The food was actually large in portion and the selection was pretty wide (not eating meat for a while).  I had the Stew Fish and tasted some of the sauce on the Oxtail and Curried Mutton.  I thought the flavors were ok, though the stew fish was overly sweet, though that may be what it is supposed to taste like.  I will be back to try the oxtail as that flavor appealed most of the three.  Goat curry is one of my all time favorite foods, so am curious as to how they achieve it with mutton.

Pricewise, I think they charge a little too much, but the lunch special sound like the best deal.

Overall I am interested in exploring the rest of the menu....though I cannot completely cheat on the goodness of Caribbean Bakery.  I will find what I like from each.....to be continued.

Interior - yellow, green, and black (the colors of the Jamaican flag).  There are 4 tables and 4 booths, so a very small interior. Jamaican music plays in the background. I believe the kitchen was just behind a wall that separated the dining area from the kitchen, so it was loud, with the banging of pots, pans, and dishes. I would have prefered to not have heard any of that noise. In most restaurants, you would not, here you do, 

Food - good, but nothing special. I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting, but I expected more. 
I had the (mild) Jamaican Fried Chicken. It was good, the meat was tender, but nothing fancy. The bean and rice that came with it were good, but nothing outstanding.  For the side, I had the potato salad. It was good, but, again, not outstanding. 

Service - ok. I think they are still working out the kinks, as to who is doing what, the flow of things, etc.

Parking - street parking, but this area is just off of Santa Fe, and not a crowded area, so parking was fairly easy.

Will we be back - most likely not.  The restaurant feels like something thrown together. Maybe with more time, things will flow better, and the kinks will be worked out."

I live a few blocks from Jamaican Grill and so when it moved into the neighborhood, I had to try it. I&#39;m now a regular. The oxtail stew, curried goat, and jerk chicken are my favorites. The beef and cheese patty is also delicious. They have a selection of drinks which are interesting and unusual to my palate; the sorrel drink is the most refreshing thing ever on a hot day. The cabbage delight and the plantains are delicious. I have yet to try something here that I dislike!

Just a warning: If you get the jerk chicken &#34;spicy&#34; instead of &#34;mild&#34;, it is VERY SPICY. I think they&#39;ve toned down the spice level since they first moved in - when I first went, the curried goat was at the top edge of my (very moderate) spice tolerance, and the jerk chicken was at the top edge of my partner&#39;s (very high) spice tolerance (and way beyond mine). I get the jerk chicken mild and it has very little bite; if you like a lot of heat, though, get it spicy.

Service is excellent. I think one of the main servers is also the manager? She is super friendly and fun, and really knows her stuff. The atmosphere is colorful and casual, with Bob Marley playing on the speakers at a reasonable volume. Portion sizes are just about perfect - not too much food (I personally don&#39;t like getting gigantic plates at restaurants) and not too little.

Lunch is inexpensive ($), dinner is more expensive but still eminently doable ($$)."

Vegetables seemed of the frozen and then microwaved kind :( rice lacked any real flavor considering it was flavored with something. Don&#39;t think it was the coconut rice. It&#39;s too close to my house to not try another dish, maybe the jerk chicken next time. Also the ginger beer is gross. It&#39;s all high fructose corn syrup and a bunch of other bs ingredients, including some kind of vegetable oil- gross! Made my stomach upset after two sips.
Decor is cute. Still happy to have some different flavor in Denver. Maybe they dumbed it down or something though for the white folks? Hope they step it up with bigger &amp; tastier portions, organic ginger beer, and fresh veggies!!"

I thought the portions were generous for lunch, but everything was so good we managed to clean all of the plates.
I will definitely be back, and am looking forward to washing down my next meal with a cold Red Stripe at the little back bar.

The chicken, what I believe is mostly breast, is super tender. It tastes lightly smoked, which is an awesome compliment to the sweet and spicy flavor of the jerk seasoning. 

The coconut rice is a great compliment, and the plantains are as good as you&#39;ll get plantains in this region. Can&#39;t do much about the distance they have to travel."

This. Place. Is. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
This was another of our stumble upon eatery joints we found on vaca. I am so glad we did!  No wait, walked in and was seated at the bar. Service was fast and friendly. I must say, my potatoes were some of the most scrumptious starch products that have every reached my palette. Impeccable! 
We had two large platters of all sorts of breakfast foods and all were above our standard, except one. This is something that is just a southern thing and is no way a negative on the food! (Lol) I ordered grits, or so called grits and let me tell you, I have no idea what they served me but in the south these were not grits! But they were still good regardless and ate them. :)"

What kills me is food coming out luke warm...and that&#39;s generous. This was bordering on downright cold.

I had the chicken sausage scramble and wanted to LOVE it. It has all my faves - carmelized onions, goat cheese, delicious chicken sausage -  nom nom, right? But where&#39;s the heat?? The butter on my toast didn&#39;t even melt.

It was busy for a Sunday morning and they don&#39;t take reservations so it&#39;s understood (although I don&#39;t understand places that don&#39;t take reservations for brunch, but that&#39;s another rant for another time). I put our name in and waited about 15 minutes. They have a couple of chairs inside and then a little patio outside to wait on. It&#39;s in a strip mall so there really isn&#39;t a lot to see/do so grab a drink and wait if you must!

The menu was fantastic, just the right amount of items and I ended up going with the special of the day-beef brisket with collards and grits. The portion was huge and I got a box to take half of it home with me. The brisket was perfection, it fell off with just the touch of my fork and the collards were excellent. The grits were a little lumpy but we are in Colorado so you can&#39;t really expect grits to be up to the standards of the South. They have coffee drinks as well like iced coffee, Americano , espresso and cappuccino which always scores points in my book. Definitely worth a visit!!"

The reason being the mass produced one of a kind breakfasts you buy are pretty one dimensional and uninspired.  The Universal is one of those cool places that breaks that mold. 

I was fortunate enough to find this cool eatery on a morning I craved breakfast. The menu is small but well conceived.  Great choices to satisfy pretty much any palate but not overly cluttered. I had a hard choice deciding but settled on the Universal, 2 eggs any style, potatoes or grits, pancake or biscuit and gravy and any choice of meat. I chose eggs poached, biscuit &amp; gravy, in-house make sausage and potatoes. I had intended to get the grits but failed to do so, which is ok since it gives me a reason to return! My meal was delicious. I word of warning, the sausage is spicy. I love spice and it was a hit for me, however if you are not a spice person you may want to choose something else. The potatoes were perfectly fried and seasoned, the biscuit &amp; gravy outstanding. The eggs were very good, though if I were to find any fault it would be that one of the eggs. One of the yokes was just slightly over cooked and the eggs needed to be drain a bit better. There was a small pool of water in the small bowl they were served in. Honestly pretty minor stuff. All for $11. The coffee was excellent and my cup was always full. 

The Universal represents what&#39;s great about small privately owned breakfast eateries around the country. Small well thought out menus, food prepared with care, served with pride and priced at a great value. Cheers!"

The food was amazing! It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been so impressed with a dish and I must admit I&#39;ve missed the feeling.
The only reason for the missing star is because of the staff. I was told a 15-20 minute wait which was perfectly fine on a Sunday. The hostess just seemed too flustered and couldn&#39;t give me any information when I asked for patio seating. Maybe because people had to keep showing her empty tables? The place isn&#39;t big by any means! I just had to say &#34; We would prefer the patio if anything comes up around our turn.&#34; Simple enough. Our waiter was no help either. He forgot we had ordered drinks and you could see the light bulb go off when he was taking our food order. No big deal but the service definitely didn&#39;t match the food.
-Fried egg sanwich
-The Hibl. Definitely the winner

the-universal-denver,Michael T.,vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,"Reno, NV",1,1,1,1944,57,RzcS6qNUpcwBgaoUdmVanw,4.0,2016-03-23,"Strip malls hold many secrets and surprises. Sometimes they&#39;re the kind you would rather forget about, like the things you might witness in the dark shadows behind closed businesses, but more often than not, they&#39;re the kinds of secrets you simply cannot keep to yourself. The Universal is one such story, but based on the mighty long wait we experienced, this secret is already out! I&#39;ll tell you about it anyway...

The Universal is a real deal, neighborhood breakfast, brunch, and lunch joint, and though it&#39;s located in a strip mall, the character of is flowing out of the front door, plastered all over the facade of the building, and alive and well on the outdoor patio as well. You might be asking... Who would want to dine on a patio in a strip mall? I&#39;ll answer that one... Anyone, so long as they&#39;re enjoying the homestyle eats coming out of this kitchen.

The menu is pretty simple. Eggs done many ways, including scrambles and  omelettes, or with a side of Tender Belly bacon or housemade sausage, Custard Toast, Breakfast sammies, and the real star on the menu, The Universal&#39;s grits bowls! There are a few standards on the menu and one daily grits special on the board. 

So what&#39;s special about the grits? For starters they&#39;re Anson Mills heirloom grits, which means more flavor and texture right out of the gate. Add to it whatever mixture of butter and cream The Universal pours in, and you&#39;ve got this incredibly rich and decadent, savory dish that would be amazing all on its own. Using it as a base for building a breakfast, you could add just about anything to it and it would be absolutely fabulous. The special of the day was a house smoked pulled pork and braised collard greens with bacon, to which I added a few poached eggs. Man was that incredibly good. The pork was smoked and seasoned and fantastic, collards had that tangy vinegar finish and smokey hit from the bacon that makes them authentically southern, and the egg yolk just melded it all together! 

This is really 4.5-stars. Why? First, I felt service had some slip ups including coffee spilling on the table from the carafe a few times, and no move was made to help clean it up. My warm biscuit came out before my meal (someone else at the table had ordered there&#39;s that way) and then was almost accidentally cleared because I&#39;d covered it with a napkin to keep it warm. Last, my dish came to the table warm but not hot, and the grits has skinned over a bit, typically a sign it had been sitting for a bit before delivery. 

All that said, these were minor service slips that didn&#39;t detract from the delicious food or great company. I&#39;d return to The Universal in a heartbeat. In fact, I&#39;d recommend The Universal land on your must eat spots when visiting Denver!"

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It also happens to be the most delicious meal of the day. It gets even better when you head into the highlands and enjoy some incredible creations at the Universal.

Nothing too cute or whimsical going on here, just some straight up delicious breakfast/brunch choices. I&#39;ve had both the cornbread rancheros and the eggs benedict and both item&#39;s were filling and delicious. 

One thing that sets this place apart is the freshness of the ingredients. You can just tell that everything is made to order and nothing is going old, drying out or about to expire. Breakfast is delicious on it&#39;s own, but when ingredients are fresh then it gets even better.

I&#39;ve also had incredible and timely service each time i&#39;ve gone. I can&#39;t remember our waitresses name, but she was excellent. And, the owner works there and walks around making sure everything is perfect.

That is how I made it to The Universal!
 The restaurant looked amazing. Was greeted right off the bat. Decided to sit at the bar. Carrie was my server. She was great. Very nice and very friendly. Makes a mean Bloody Mary too!
Had The Universal for breakfast. It was amazing. The atmosphere was great too! I would recommend this place to anyone no matter where you stay in Denver!

the-universal-denver,Kimberly S.,QCpSrT3fEDq2uJYy78Ujig,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,297,118,3V96JAFoV5DN4eC8greVKw,4.0,2016-02-27,"We decided to take a walk, one Saturday morning, wanting to try a new breakfast place. We had heard good things about, &#34;The Universal,&#34; so, why not?

After a 2 hour walk there (no kidding, we like to walk), we had to wait 45 minutes, but that was no problem.  The outside of the restaurant has a small (uncovered) patio area, where the chairs were stacked, so we couldn&#39;t use them yet (it was the end of February, not Spring yet in Colorado). There is a very small waiting area just inside the front door, with about 8 chairs.  The host stand is directly inside the restaurant, right by the front door. Your name is taken, and you wait. From reading other Yelp! reviews, the earlier you get there, the better. We will take that into consideration the next time we go. (Oops, I gave that away too soon. LOL!).

Once seated, at a small table for two just inside the door, which I would have preferred another location, but after waiting 45 minutes, I was not going to wait any longer. My husband and I sat down and looked over the menu.  I had my regular of bacon and eggs, or what is referred to there as, &#34;The Universal&#34;:  two eggs any style, potatoes or grits, pancake or biscuit and sausage gravy, and choice of meat.  I choose the potatoes, as I usually am not crazy about grits, or have not yet found any that I really liked, let&#39;s say that. I also upgraded to the fruit pancake (an additional 75 cents), which was good, nothing spectacular, but good. 

My husband also had &#34;The Universal,&#34; but choose the biscuit and gravy, and grits instead of the potatoes.  I tried his grits, WOW! Their grits were very, very good! I&#39;d definitely would have them again! Awesome! My husband said the biscuits and gravy were good, a black pepper kind of spicy, which I also like. Not a hot sauce spicy, which was a nice change.

On the menu, you will also find scrambles, such as the sausage scramble with chicken sausage and onions, or the bacon and tomato scramble. There are omelets, fried egg sandwiches, pancakes, grains - like oatmeal, and yogurt with granola. They also have Grits of the Day too (sounds inviting!). These are just a few things on their menu.

The interior is nice, open, and very bright. It is noisy, so be aware of that before you go. The tables are very close together, so don&#39;t bring large bags or backpacks, as it will be hard to move around with such items, and there really is no place to put them. While there, one couple brought in their baby stroller. Yes, it folded up (somewhat), but to me, this seemed inconvenient  and rather inconsiderate to the other patrons, but that&#39;s my opinion.

Service was good, I have nothing to complain about there.  The final bill was what you would expect for breakfast today (without tip, $30.51). While checking out the bottom of the bill, it states only Visa and Mastercard are accepted there, and, of course, cash. We only had coffee, no alcoholic drinks.  One Yelp! review of this restaurant, states for two, their total was $50. I wonder what they ordered, or how much they possibly drank? 

Parking is on the street, or a nearby side street, but it&#39;s free, so that&#39;s awesome.

With their (small) outdoor patio area, our thought was to put a cover over it, and put out the chairs, and a few small tables, add some outdoor heaters, and they would have a decent waiting area for their customers. It&#39;s a thought as there really is not much of a waiting area now. You can try to grab one of the few chairs just inside the door or you are waiting (standing) outside in the elements, which in Colorado, can be gorgeous, or a bit chilly. 

Yes, you bet we will be back. Good food, good prices.
Thanks Universal, see you next time!"

Coda Coffee
Corn Bread
Biscuit with Preserves
Banana Walnut Pancakes
Custard Toast - Soaked in Nutmeg Custard Overnight, Griddled, Baked, Garnished with Orange Marmalade and Berries

Located on West 38th Avenue with a reputation as one of the best spots for breakfast in town, it was with a local friend that I sat down at The Universal and although only open from 7am-2:30pm daily the homey restaurant nonetheless takes itself very seriously, everything from food to service highly praised by patrons as well as media ever since opening the doors in late 2012.

Described as &#34;Southern&#34; by some, though recent culinary trends would more appropriately classify the menu as Modern American Comfort Food with craftsmanship and quality sourcing helping to enliven even the most basic omelet or hash, it was in acknowledging my friend&#39;s Vegetarianism and my substantial Sweet Tooth that a four-part order was created, the tiny $22 tab literally raising eyebrows in the setting of so much food.

No longer under the toque of its opening chef, though staff turnover has seemingly done little to diminish to quality or popularity of the space, it was acknowledging at 20-minute prep-time for The Universal&#39;s signature entrée that locally roasted Coffee from Coda was sipped slowly, a sizable wedge of cornbread rich with butter amidst toothsome textures while a fluffy biscuit separated in soft layers ready to be gilded in honey or housemade fruit puree. 

Okaying both main plates to be served simultaneously, the hubcap size short-stack eating far lighter than one might guess considering a substantial studding with Bananas and toasted Nuts, there is little doubt that the morning&#39;s spotlight shined most brightly upon Nutmeg soaked Brioche souffled after a quick pan searing, the pure Maple Syrup blending nicely with bitter Orange Marmalade and a handful of Fresh Fruit."

I must say my service was just okay when I visited but I will blame the crazy crowds. They were VERY busy. I was able to sang a bar seat (cheers to solo dining) and it took a while before I got my order taken. The bar tender was super busy but one of the waitress was kind enough to step in and get my food going. 

I got the corn bread rancheros with eggs over medium. Fantastic flavors with an appealing presentation. I was so eager to eat it that I didn&#39;t even get a photo. However there are many pictures of that dish represented on Yelp and it is as good as it looks. My peach mimosa was also great. I appreciated the large serving.

One of the ladies in the group suggested this place because it got a great review as one of the top breakfast places in Denver. I&#39;m so glad we got there at 8:00 a.m. because that place gets busy quickly!  And rightly so. The food is divine and the service is just as great. One of my friends ordered banana pancakes that were so large, they were about 1/4&#34; off the plate all the way around.  Ha!!  She ordered a single stack as opposed to a double stack. She would have been full all day! My breakfast of choice was the cornbread rancheros.  They were so good and just as filling as those enormous banana pancakes. If you want a place with a wide variety of food options for breakfast and you&#39;re really hungry, this is the place to go.

Luckily for me, I have found the perfect partner in crime, Lindsey K. We decided to head here for our latest installment of the bloody mary tour, and we were not disappointed.

Personally, I like a chewy, spicy, and &#34;thick&#34; bloody. With plenty of salad. The Universal serves theirs with a giant stalk of celery, a slice of cucumber, peperoncini, and an olive. The spicy salt they use to rim the glass is terrific with the celery. One will leave you pretty happy...more than two means you need to uber it home.

Food:
I ordered the nitty gritty: anson mill grits with two over easy eggs and choice of breakfast meat. I got the bacon (tender belly). Mmmmm. PERFECT. Grits were creamy, eggs were cooked to perfection (nice and runny yolks), and the bacon crispy. I tried Lindsey&#39;s dish too, the grits of the day. Pulled pork, collard greens, and grits. ZOMG. 

I can not wait to keep returning to try the entire menu. Despite the fact that it&#39;s located in a strip mall, this place has a nice atmosphere. Service is spectacular, and we were seated faster than expected."

super excited about making this a regular destination. 
I went last weekend with a group and sampled a few menu items- all were quite good. 
The grits were phenomenal! I subbed them instead of breakfast potatoes which I definitely recommend if you want to try them. The benedicts are great as are the biscuits and gravy. If you can&#39;t decide, try the HIBL- it is a mixture of the two- basically tasty eggs Benedict on a buttery biscuit. That was my favorite!

Luckily, there is no strip mall vibe once you&#39;re inside and there&#39;s also plenty of free parking.  We dined on a Friday morning without waiting, thank goodness!  Despite the beautiful weather, the patio wasn&#39;t open but there were plenty of available tables inside.

I realize that I am in a very small minority with this two star review.  Maybe it is a bit harsh, but I hold Southern cooking to a very high standard, as did my ancestors before me.  No complaints whatsoever about the friendly and efficient service!

If you know me, then you know I ordered a mimosa.  They come in several flavors:  orange, pineapple, cranberry, and something else (maybe mango?) for $6.  They also have peach for $7 but I think that one has an extra ingredient.  I didn&#39;t notice a bottomless option but that may be reserved for weekend brunch.  My pineapple mimosa was presented in a tall glass with ice.  Strike one.

I wanted to try both the biscuits and the grits, so I ordered The Universal, which also comes with two eggs your way and your choice of breakfast meat.  Our food came out quickly and portions were large.

I am convinced that authentic Southern-style biscuits do not exist in this town.  And honestly, the altitude rightly shoulders much of the blame.  I have yet to see a restaurant biscuit that is crispy golden brown on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside (but if you know where I can find one, I&#39;m all ears!).  The Universal&#39;s biscuits are nicely browned but far too dense on the inside (and also too yellow but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s from unbleached flour).  Thankfully, I did not detect any sugar, so points for that.  Sausage gravy has never been my thing, therefore I have no comment on it on way or the other.  The Anson Mills grits were perfectly flavored, even with the included sprinkle of pepper, which I never put on my grits.  However, the texture was all wrong.  They were thick and lumpy, perhaps from sitting around in the pot all morning.  I enjoyed the meaty texture of the Tender Belly bacon and because Tender Belly specializes in such high quality meat, I didn&#39;t mind so much that it wasn&#39;t the least bit crispy.  Mr. P. had some kind of boar sausage scramble and he really liked the link sausage (possibly also from Tender Belly) but didn&#39;t have any other raves about the dish.

I&#39;m glad I gave this place a try to see what all the hype was about and now I can cross it off my list.  No need to make the drive across town when there are much better breakfast options close to home."

Too much food! He had the eggs rancheros. I got the green chili pork and eggs. Both dishes were terrific and I have fallen in love with grits. But only if they come with green chili pork.

The Bloody Mary seemed like a popular choice and after ordering one, this is for good reason as it was delicious. Just make sure you add in the bacon, as the nice, thick piece of bacon with this great cocktail is the perfect way to get the morning started. 

I struggled a bit with what to order as almost all the options looked tempting, but I opted for the Wild Boar Scramble. It was the greasy, filling dish I was craving. Scrambled eggs, gouda cheese, boar sausage, with griddled potatoes and sourdough bread definitely helped to provide some fuel for our shenanigans later in the day. 

Good drinks and plenty of awesome breakfast options. Everyone left satisfied. A great way to start your day/end your hangover."

We have a two year old, so the hours, food and option of booze keeps up frequenting brunchy type places. Saw this spot featured in westword, checked yelp and headed out after naptime. 
I&#39;m a server so I know the woes of people coming in before close (they close at 230, we got there at 2). However, tiny humans have short attention spans so we&#39;re usually in and out. The hostess was super friendly and warm, but I got the feeling our server wasn&#39;t thrilled with our presence. She wasn&#39;t rude, just not friendly. They definitely do not cater to families as we were not given a kids menu, crayons or even a drink for the kid. Seriously, she brought us two waters right away but nothing for the little one. I figured they probably didn&#39;t have kids cups, so I didn&#39;t ask.
Started with a bloody. It was great. Nothing over the top presentation wise, but for $6 a good deal. Perfectly seasoned.
I asked the waitress for her recommendation between the seasonal veggie Benny or the Ranchero. I went with the Ranchero, their take on huerovos. It was fantastic.  I should&#39;ve tasted before adding pepper because it needed zero seasoning. I requested hot sauce, but it went unused. The flavor profile in this dish was perfect, for me. The corn bread (instead of tortillas) was incredible. I mashed it up and mixed it with the egg, black bean, cheesy, saucy goodness, and the bread provided just the right amount of sweet amongst the savory, southwestern smoky. 
Ordered my kid a banana walnut pancake. It was crazy good. I&#39;m going to try to copy those walnuts at home. They were candied with cinnamon and absolutely made this pancake one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. She though so too and nearly ate the entire thing, which was bigger than her head.
My partner got the Universal, which is a little bit of everything. He choose scrambled, grits, housemade sausage and biscuits and gravy. He said, of course, best grits ever ever. However, he thought the sausage had way too much seasoning and too peppery, so that went untouched on his plate. I tried it and thought it was good, but he says that&#39;s because I like too much pepper  He also wasn&#39;t a fan of the biscuits and gravy. I, on the other hand, also found this to be one of the best versions of it ever. They might use the same sausage in the gravy and it was perfect to me. The biscuit was also perfectly prepared.
We got out of there for $34 plus tip, not bad at all for two adults, one kid and a bloody.
We&#39;ll definitely be back."

I have eaten breakfast there at least once each week since May of 2014. I am consistently pleased with the tastiness of the food and friendliness of the wait staff. I am not an adventurous eater, so for breakfast it&#39;s eggs and hash browns and pancakes for me. In all that time I think I&#39;ve had maybe two bad meals. Both times I complained and both times I received fresh, new, good meals. Two bad meals since May of 2014; that&#39;s an amazing record.

Now I have a different sort of complaint. At the risk of having my certificate of political correctness revoked, please Universal, find a better, tastier bacon. I&#39;m pretty sure the bacon you use is Local, and therefore Sacred. But to me, and I love bacon, the bacon that you serve doesn&#39;t taste good. It doesn&#39;t taste like bacon, and it doesn&#39;t have the texture of bacon. The most painful way to understand this is to ask for it crispy. What you get is a piece of shoe leather. Seriously, a nice, simple applewood smoked bacon would be so much better. Maybe your Local bacon-maker makes one. It&#39;s not a big deal, I just don&#39;t ever order bacon at The Universal. But I sure wish I could. 

Besides, everything else is so good, I can live without better bacon."

Standing here on a beautiful day waiting at the bar. Waiting waiting waiting. Everyone behind the bar working working working away. About 4 of them. Smiles, every one of them is smiling as they continue to walk past us but seem to have lost their words. Fortunately, we made friends. A couple standing at the bar when we walked up. Both drink less. 2 mins, 4 mins, 6 mins later 1 of the 4 behind the bar learned to speak, &#34;someone will be right with you&#34; , &#34;great, thanks&#34; 

10 minutes, &#34;what can I get for you&#34; &#34;2 minosas&#34;

The Mimosa came out first in a glass with ice and straw but everything after that was great! The Server was super friendly the food was OMG delicious! Cornbread, grits, and shaved potatoes were on point. The smoked tomatoes were my husbands favorite and the apple chicken sausage scramble was mine! Old fashioned was perfect with muddled orange. The only thing that was a deterrent was how humid was inside. Anyway great place and we will be back!"

The Universal is hands down some of the best brunch I&#39;ve had in a long time. We bring all of our out-of-towners here, and come quite often ourselves. The staff is amazing, and we usually just get whatever is on the specials board since it&#39;s always amazing!

Recently we went and had some sort of BBQ sauce with one of our meals (I think it was on special) and have been trying to recreate it ever since. It. Was. Amazing.

Go here. Eat it all. And whatever you do, get a Keoke. It&#39;ll wake you up and knock you on your ass at the same time, and it&#39;s DELICIOUS!"

This is easily the best grits I&#39;ve had in Denver and its even better than some I&#39;ve had in texas. i would come here to swim in this buttery goodness daily if i could but, alas, I am not rich. 

The ambiance and the atmosphere is casual and reminiscent of a classic breakfast place. its not as inviting as some places but its still a warm environment. 

The service was amazing. She was patient and was quick with the help and suggestions. She was even gracious when i decided that a cold brew coffee (which was delicious) was not what i thought i wanted. she quickly gave me a warm cup of delicious joe. 

The food was the best part, of course. I had the &#34;universal.&#34; it had EGGS (over medium) It had PANCAKES (banana walnut). it had KOREAN STYLE STEAK (you drooling yet) but best of all it had GRITS(OMGOMGOMG). The eggs were cooked to perfection. the Pancakes, not only had bananas and walnuts on top was was cooked with bananas in the batter and the Korean style steak had the perfect amount of heat that didnt bother you but told you that it was there. And the grits, OOOOOOHHHH the grits. grits grits grits. i can go on all day about these grits. 
Three Words:
GET THE GRITS."

Not only do they serve a unique grits of the day, they also have the most delicious and perfectly spicy bloody out there. The owner looks like an old school newsy and is the nicest guy out there. A few ago we had a German server named Nuni who was pleasant and sweet. I personally love the HIBL and the Huevos Rancheros ( without egg since I dont eat egg) and they are both so good. The HIBL has a lovely spicy sausage and the Rancheros have homemade salsas and cornbread. Genuinely love coming here.

After reading numerous reviews raving about The Universal&#39;s, I knew I had to try this place.  I got the opportunity about a month ago and was very pleased.  The reviews were dead on, definitely some of the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had.  They give you two big ol&#39; fluffy biscuits that they cover in a spicy pork sausage gravy.  The gravy was delectable. Spicy, sausagey, green oniony.  It was perfection.  

The Universal also makes the best bacon.  They use Tender Belly and this bacon is legit.   The quintessential bacon with the perfect crisp, perfect chew, and perfect flavor.  

The stand-outs here are definitely the biscuits and gravy and the bacon.  My friend got the blueberry pancakes and they were underwhelming.  He favored my dish over his, and he is not typically a biscuits and gravy kind of guy.  

Service was a bit spotty.  Drink orders took awhile.  My friend had to actually remind our waitress about his coffee three times. He finally got it when we were finishing up.  

The four stars here is strictly based on the biscuits and gravy and the bacon.  If it wasn&#39;t for these items, I likely wouldn&#39;t return. So, if you scope out brunch spots solely for biscuits and gravy, this is your spot!"

While the menu has traditional breakfast items, it&#39;s the more unique items that stood out to me.  I ordered the pork green chili and grits which was delicious. My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy, which was also excellent.  Despite the busy Saturday morning rush, service was quick and friendly.  My one negative to the restaurant is the price.  My dish of green chili, 2 eggs, and grits cost $13.  While I understand eggs are expensive right now, but I still thought prices seemed to be inflated by a couple dollars.  Overall the Universal is a great experience and I would have no qualms returning for another delicious breakfast."

The menu carries innovative &amp; interesting twists on traditional items using what I would call high quality ingredients for reasonable prices. Delicious. The owner was there one time. Nice guy, very down to earth. The inside is simple, small, and clean with a small patio that has some umbrella shade but borders on the parking lot of a strip mall.

I was very excited to try this place and knew coming in on a Sunday we would have a wait, but what unfolded was really disappointing. We were told to expect a 45 minute wait, but that turned into an 1 hour and 30 minutes. I pointed out 4 open tables that had been empty on the patio for over 10 minutes and the hostess had no idea. Suddenly we were seated immediately. However, the most disappointing part was our server. He seemed very inconvenienced by our presence and was quite condescending the times I asked questions. Two days later, I discovered my credit card had been charged twice, and I had to reverse it with my bank. You know, I don&#39;t want to be pampered as a costumer, but I definitely don&#39;t want to be treated as an is inconvenience and given crap service."

The universal is definitely one of the staples of the gentrification of the Highlands. Diversity is low within the walls of the universal, and it&#39;s clear that you have to be part of the upper middles class to be able to afford  eating here.

Hey breakfast for two totals around $50, and, well let&#39;s just say that I wished that I had taken that $50 and going to the natural grocery store to go home and cook my own breakfast.

The bartender was friendly, but also overly pushy in his persistent attempts to upsell. Annoying.

The bread did not taste fresh and in fact was quite stale - that goes for the sliced toast and the English muffin. 

I won&#39;t be going back. This place is a little too &#34;trendy hipster-ish for me&#34;"

Even though I love the food is feel like every time I go in to the restaurant is leave disappointed.  Portions get smaller and I feel like I&#39;m nickeled and dimed to death. Pancakes used to be bigger. Bacon sides were larger. This last time I ordered one of your scrambles and because I wanted tomatoes instead of such dried tomatoes I had to build  my own and by the time I added my biscuit instead of toast my entree was $15.50 instead of $10.25. Just price things accordingly your food is good people will pay.

Uber dropped us here and from the outside, I was like, it this really it? From outside, it&#39;s all black like a club. Thank goodness inside was inviting. 

We got a booth seat but if you&#39;re like me that plops heavily on it, don&#39;t. The seating is pretty thin so you&#39;ll hurt your butt. 

Our server was great and looked after us well. I&#39;ve never had ice in my mimosa before so that was different. It was served in a tall glass too. They have almond milk, yes! It&#39;s extra so I&#39;m like, what? I didn&#39;t know that and almond milk is not that much more than soy. I have to admit, it was one of the best chais I&#39;ve ever had. Yummy lavendar mimosa. Hubby doctored the bloody mary that he got. He wanted it spicier. It was spicy to me.

Careful when you order bacon, when it says tender on the menu, it is tender so don&#39;t expect crunchy. Hubby still enjoyed his brekkie. I enjoyed my creamy spinach on portobello. Grits was yum and creamy!

All the staff we interacted with were very nice, helpful and polite. I really appreciate it since I&#39;m from the Bay (CA).

This is easily one of my fave places in Denver."

I&#39;m not sure why, and maybe this is why it was so frustrating, but we were completely ignored by the host. We were patiently waiting for our table and the host was coming torward us to show us to a freshly vacated and cleaned 4 top.  Another customer intercepted him and they began a long and casual chat. The host reverted to his station and continued to chat about this and that, very casually as our table sat empty.  This lasted for ten our fifteen additional minutes.
We noticed the wait staff continue to look at the host wondering what was going on, but they never interrupted him to gain his attention. I walked up to engage the host, but he was just too busy with this other guest, who I assume at this point must be a very important person. 
We were a family of four with two kids. We had the only kids in place, so I can only assume it is not a kid friendly establishment. This is my only guess for this treatment.  Disappointed and aggravated."

The homemade biscuits were so good and the homemade breakfast sausage was really spicy to the point where I could see it being to hot for some but I loved it. The biscuits and gravy was spicy as well and one of the best I&#39;ve had. 
I like having breakfast in Colorado for the simple reason that you can get a biscuit and gravy instead of boring old toast.
A great, hip, earthy, organic breakfast spot that I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like as much as I did when I first walked in. (Luckily before it got busy)

The Bloody Mary had very little actual bloody flavor, had to ask for extra mix, and heavily season it myself to make it palatable.

The pancake was good, a little underdone. BUT, the biggest problem was the little packets of cold butter. What self proclaimed brunch business doesn&#39;t whip their own butter? Also, their syrup is half maple and half corn syrup :| Why not just serve real maple?!

The Sausage was good in the sandwich (and the gravy), the egg was well cooked but needed a punch of flavor, and the tomato was mushy and bland. They need to change the dish in winter if it depends on fresh, acidic tomatoes. Also, the potatoes :(. Incredibly greasy, no seasoning, and I would say quite old. 

The biscuits were excellent, however the gravy was too dehydrated from being an old batch, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s much better fresh.

Bottom line, could be great, but shortcuts were taken and the overall effect is mediocre."

I was there on Sunday and my fiancé was served the world&#39;s worst grits. He&#39;s sadly naive when it comes to grits but my family is from New Orleans so I know bad grits when I see (or taste) them and those were horrific.

I had the eggs Benedict. It&#39;s one of my favorite breakfasts of all time and I usually cannot get enough of the hollandaise sauce. However, the hollandaise sauce was not the star of this dish. It was mediocre and there wasn&#39;t very much if it. But, the ham made up for it, and I am not even a big ham fan. The ham was amazing and pulled the whole dish together. I would definitely order it again.

Now my husband&#39;s complaints: there isn&#39;t any white sugar at the table for coffee, there is only a sugar substitute and sugar in the raw. Our server did bring is a small cup from the kitchen when we asked. They also do not have fountain soda. Instead they have glass bottled soda that is not your typical Pepsi or Coke brands. It&#39;s a soda made with cane sugar.

Aesthetically there are some intentional designs but nothing that really is unique or artistic. I wish that the dining room had a little more personality and intentional design. 

The coffee leaves you with something to be desired. The server clearly didn&#39;t know how to describe it other than &#34;it&#39;s a nice dark roasted coffee&#34; which to me &#34;nice&#34; and &#34;dark&#34; don&#39;t always go synonymously together. And who ever assumed that a dark roast meant, good? Anyway, I got a latte and the milk was not steamed quite well and didn&#39;t have a quality velvety texture. 

I ordered the grits with two sunny side eggs and the homemade sausage which was all superb and brought out in a timely manner. My wife order the eggs Benedict and it was wonderful. Both plates were delicious and I was very happy with our choices. 

The service was decent but not remarkable. I would have appreciated a slightly more attentive server, and despite the ridiculously hipster dress of the staff, they were very kind and helpful staff.

The awesome brunch place has got a modern and hippie feel to it. There are plenty of street parking as well as limited parking outside the restaurant in their lot. The wait for a party of 3 was only about 20 minutes and during the mean time I got myself a bloody mary. It was one of the best blood marys I have ever had. Way better than the one at Snooze. It&#39;s not too overwhelming and not too spicy either. I loved how they give you a celery stalk, olive, lime, cucumber, and banana pepper all with the drink. Beat that! I gladly enjoyed my wait while sipping on the drink, only 6 dollars btw. 

We were quickly seated at a spacious table. I absolutely adored our waiter, Ara. He&#39;s got a personality and energy I&#39;ve never seen in a waiter before. He probably came back to check on us at least 10 times throughout the course of brunch, each time making a joke that kept us very entertained the whole time. As for the food, I absolutely loved my ranchero. It&#39;s a healthy blend of black beans, egg, salsa, avocado, and amazing cornbread. You can also get a side of cornbread which is much larger which I would love to do next time because it&#39;s so freaking good. My friends got the benedict and boar scramble. They both loved their dishes as well. I tried some of theirs and I really liked the potatoes that came in those dishes. The three of us also decided to split a blueberry pancake. For 3 dollars you get a MASSIVE pancake. It&#39;s so fluffy as well and the syrup is delicious. It&#39;s as good as the pancakes at snooze for half the cost and double the amount!! I couldn&#39;t believe how good it was and of course, we finished all the food even though we were stuffed. My friends also really liked their bhakti chai and black cherry soda recommended by Ara. The atmosphere was so lively and relaxing, and I will most definitely come back and recommend it to my friends!"

I&#39;ve enjoyed every item on the menu including their lunch salads :) there is a wait, but worth it. Parking always available in lot. Plus def order their bloody Mary&#39;s and GRITS and PANCAKES you won&#39;t be disappointed. Plus the coda coffee is delicious. I&#39;m not usu a fan of grits but this is by far the place for GRITS options. They seem to have quite a few regulars :) nice outside patio area.

We unknowingly arrived half an hour before closing one Saturday, but they were still accommodating for us and patiently seated us, took our orders, and didn&#39;t rush us with the check. As a person who was starving, thank you!

Between the four of us, we ordered biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict, two bacon and tomato scrambles, and an egg sandwich, plus coffee all around. The biscuits and gravy were shared among us and disappeared pretty quickly, despite how full we were after our own individual breakfast meals. It has a bit of a kick to it, so if you&#39;re wimpy like me, watch out! The eggs benedict was mine and tasted amazing. It came with griddled potatoes and a side of salad, but I was so full from the benedict that I only ate some of the potatoes and didn&#39;t touch the salad. So filling! The scrambles and the sandwich must have also been delicious since they were inhaled.

As I mentioned, the service was great. They made sure our coffee mugs were filled and didn&#39;t try to shoo us off, even though we accidentally stayed a little bit after closing. I heard that the Universal can be pretty packed during their peak hours though, so not sure how the service will compare then, but when we went, the restaurant was maybe half full, so that may have helped with the attentiveness.

I love a good breakfast at any time of day, and I will be dreaming of coming back to this place soon!"

It was Saturday morning and I thought this was a happenin&#39; place. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy and it was outstanding. I could only have a bite because it was SO not Paleo-friendly nor was it gluten-free. I wanted to have the pork chili hash but found it wasn&#39;t gluten-free when I went to order it =( Boo. So I built my own scramble instead. It wasn&#39;t anything I couldn&#39;t have easily made at home. I didn&#39;t even finish it and I NEVER waste food. Ordered a bloody mary and it was also just OK.

Dates of Visit: Countless

Stumbled upon this place during my first trip to Denver. I was a bit skeptical of waiting times for a breakfast place, but glad I did.  I&#39;ve always judged a breakfast place by their biscuits &amp; gravy, and The Universal&#39;s are my favorite - Ever. The biscuits are insanely large/flaky, and the gravy has a depth and spiciness that most restaurants don&#39;t dare try. On top of that, the full portion, which can feed a small scout troop, runs $7 - Can&#39;t beat that. Other all-star items include the The Banana Nut Pancakes, which run the size of dinner plates, and the Custard Toast, which might redefine your concept of what French Toast could/should be. They also do a mean Eggs Benedict and Bloody Mary, but if they only did Biscuits &amp; Gravy - I&#39;d still go.

I personally consider breakfast the hardest meal to impress with. Eggs are eggs, biscuits are biscuits, right? If you agree with this, the Universal might just change/blow your mind."

My only real complaint is their grits. They pride themselves on selling Anson Mills grains, which they should, but I have never seen anyone prepare them so poorly. To say they are improperly cooked would be unfair, but to say they are criminally bland would be accurate. You have to work very hard to make something so good taste so bland."

We got a Fried egg &amp; Gruyere croissant, blueberry pancake and the Italian BLT. All were cooked just right. My only negative thought is that the sandwiches were on the greasy side.

For drinks they have chocolate syrup for the chocolate milk which is exactly how my husband likes it. It was the first time I&#39;ve had a mate latte. I liked it. And the Bloody Mary is excellent. Just a good amount of spice!

Overall a cute spot with great food. They were out of the dally grits special by the time we got there but they sound yummy! We&#39;ll be back to try other items from the menu."

He asked me to give them another chance and sent me some vouchers to do so (awesome customer service).  As much as I was really didn&#39;t want to go back, I did.  

HOLY COW, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!!!! :-)

First, I ordered online for pick up at 1:15.  When I got there, the cashier greeted me with a smile (before I presented my vouchers).  I told her that I was there for a pick up order and she notified the back that I was there and offered me a drink while I waited.  My order was ready in about 1 minute and was fresh and the gentleman who gave it to me thanked me for my order.

The tuna burger was done perfectly and I loved the sauce and cilantro.  The fries were crispy this time with no hint of truffle.  Everything was really, really yummy.  The napkins were still a little greasy but not as bad as the first time.  It also occurred to me that most napkins from a burger joint probably are greasy, its just that you don&#39;t notice it because the napkins are typically white, not brown, which makes it more noticeable.

I&#39;m not sure if the first time I went they were just having a bad day or if it was the effort of the company to correct some internal issues, but whatever it was, it was a great experience this time.  

Based on this visit, I would definitely go back again and I would definitely recommend it!  I could see myself getting addicted to the tuna burgers!"

I arrived around 6pm and it only had a few people in the restaurant. It was very clean and organized. The environment is modern, sleek and comfortable. They had some great music playing and it was very chill. 

The menu is simple yet has just the right amount of food. I settled on the truffle burger and a small French fries. I ordered my burger medium and it was cooked to perfection. The fries and food came out fast and hot.  The burger taste amazing, I haven&#39;t had a burger this good since fleur in Las Vegas. The meat was outstanding the lettuce was superb, onion was perfect and pickles were the perfect balance. The truffle aioli was just enough and not to much. The fries were crunchy and had an amazing taste with the sea salt. This was all partnered with a Dale&#39;s Pale Ale (local brew beer)

All in all I had an amazing visit. I flew 1100 miles and landed in Denver and was taken care by this great place. Keep up the amazing atmosphere and perfect food. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try the chicken burger"

The truffle fries were equally delicious, though I was slightly disappointed at the size. The bottom of the box pops up a bit, making it seem at first like there&#39;s more there. 

The only negative thing was the smell when I first walked in. I couldn&#39;t decide if it was a bad smell in drain or something simply having been burnt in the kitchen. I sat outside, which was nice."

I&#39;ve always ordered the chicken burger because it always hits the spot. My boyfriend has tried every single burger on the menu and the chicken burger is still his favorite. The truffle fries are always a hit as well.

This location was clean as well! Some places get super busy and it&#39;s hard for them to keep up with the table cleaning since you have to clean it yourself but this one was great. I will say that most of the tables are wobbly so definitely sit at a booth if you eat there!"

My only complaints were the truffled fries didn&#39;t come with aioli sauce. I feel like I could have just had regular fries. Plus they were a little on the small side and pretty greasy. Another thing I didn&#39;t like about this place was how long it took to grill up the burgers. I appreciate them fully cooking my burgers, but we waited for a good 20 mins!

Larkburger not only sources some of the most natural and fresh ingredients around, but they use no preservatives or additives and all of their sauces and dressings are made in-house. 

My favorite aspect of my brief encounter with Larkburger yesterday was their staff. The two people helping take my eye-roll worthy substitution order - were excited to help me, they were patient, and they were intent on making sure that I enjoyed my meal.

In fact - this location&#39;s chef even came out and personally handed me my Ahi Tuna mini masterpiece (Larkburger allows you to pick a small or large patty option) and reassured me that my new choice of dressing - would pair well with my order.

If you&#39;re looking for high quality fast food that doesn&#39;t skimp on the ingredients or taste - I highly recommend Larkburger. They have a keen understanding of what their customers want and it&#39;s evident that the people behind the business care about their product and want their patrons to too.

Trust."

The burger, ordered it medium rare, it was PERFECT.
Ordered a chicken sammy too.  With cilantro and other stuff, AMAZING. 

The craziest thing to me was the fact that both sammies were intact upon delivery.  They were still packed with flavor and juicy but it wasn&#39;t soggy and it was just urgh, SO GOOD.  I wanted to order like ten more. I think the burger is almost as good, (shhhh) as Wholly Cow burger in Austin, TX, and the chicken sammy was almost as good as (shhhh) the chicken sammy at Gourdough&#39;s in ATX as well.

Truffle burger - Regular $7.50
Truffle and Parmesan fries - small $2.50

The burger was cooked to perfection- medium with light pink center. Very juicy. The Fries are your shoe string fries garnished with truffle oil and parmesan cheese. Really Really good. Compared to some of the burger joints out there(im from san diego). This is a must try if your out in Denver.

You name it, it&#39;s prohibited.  

So being that I was selecting for low-carb options, I was happy to find this place within close distance.  I decided to go with the Adobe Chicken Burger albeit with a lettuce wrap.  Added cheddar for $0.75 and Applewood Bacon for $1.75.   Not great pricing schemes, but not the worst either.   I also ordered a fountain soda and they had plenty of options for zero/low calorie sodas.  Who knew there was a Pibb Vanilla Zero?

I ordered a bacon cheese burger and the parmesan truffle fries. I didn&#39;t go with an adventurous burger as much as I wanted to because I&#39;m about to get on a plane for 5hrs. I&#39;ll start with the fries. They were perfect. Small, skinny, crispy fries. Not oily like some truffle fries can get. Great flavor. The burger....also perfect. I skipped another burger place I saw on yelp because their buns were too big (contain yourself). I like the taste of the burger not drowned out with bread. The burger here was flawless. Cooked perfectly medium, super juicy, awesome bacon. I can find no complaints with this place. I was going to do 4 stars because the ice cream was the most lackluster thing here.

It was actually quite filling and very delicious and the price was reasonable (approx. $6).

I&#39;m a french fry connoisseur and Larkburger gets two thumbs up from me! 

The applesauce was the GoGo Squeeze (which I&#39;ve seen in the grocery store but never tasted) -- very delicious. And there were a few juice choices."

The restaurant always has a clean feel and the staff is usually very friendly and helpful. I&#39;ve had the truffle burger, tuna burger, chicken burger, and the lark burger before. In my opinion, based off my taste buds...you cannot go wrong with the chicken burger. I&#39;ve taken many friends and family from out of town here and the chicken burger never disappoints. Not to mention the awesome Truffle Parm Fries! Don&#39;t forget to order those!

Pros: Chicken burger will not disappoint. Fries are awesome. Friendly staff.
Cons: Wish they had more locations.
Overall: I would definitely recommend the Chicken burger and fries to anyone!"

My burger was quite simply gross, when asked for how I&#39;d like it done I said medium but it was one of the most rare slabs of beef I&#39;ve ever bit into. Not only that, but the bread was almost stale. It was not good in the least I&#39;m sad to say, and everyone with me felt the same way.

They gave my wife a COLD (not cooked) piece of Ahi tuna on her tuna burger, and screwed up the ingredients on my own burger. Every visit since then has been passable, but it&#39;s amazing to me how a restaurant that specializes in *burgers* can&#39;t cook their *burgers* to order.

This is the third time in a row I&#39;ve ordered the Denver Battle Burger winner, and it&#39;s the third time they&#39;ve gotten it wrong. First time, they put the wrong cheese on it and added pickles. Second time, they got the ingredients right but they cooked it &#34;medium&#34; instead of &#34;well done,&#34; as I&#39;d requested. This third time, they put pickles on it AGAIN, and forgot the bacon. You&#39;d think Larkburger would know how to make their own signature burgers that have won them awards in the past, but this location clearly can&#39;t quite pull that off.

Four visits: one visit with seriously unsafe, undercooked food, and three visits with food not cooked to order (but at least safe to eat).

This Larkburger is almost always empty when we go in. I used to think it was because their location was not in a great spot, being a bit off the main 16th Street drag. Now I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s because the staff here just doesn&#39;t care enough to gain and keep the loyalty of people like me, who are madly in love with Larkburger&#39;s OTHER locations (Westminster, Boulder, and so on)."

Walking in I can say that the place looks very trendy, everything is clean, and I felt welcomed.

I asked for a recommendation on what to order and ended up getting the truffle burger, with truffle fries and a milkshake. I sat down and received my food at a timely manner. 
I would say judging this brand solely up to this point would have yielded an easy 5 star rating.

The moment I started eating, my growing enthusiasm slowly diminished. The truffle burger was a bit underwhelming with no real distinct taste. My favorite part was the fresh lettuce on top. That pretty much sums that up.
The fries on the other hand were a bit too overwhelming. I couldn&#39;t even finish them. And I&#39;ve had truffle fries tons of times before.
My milkshake was delicious though. I&#39;ll give them that. I&#39;m from out of town but I probably won&#39;t be back. Happy I tried it though."

REALLY enjoys burgers... (make sure you say &#34;Burger&#34; in an exaggerated Australian accent too!)  So a friend told us to visit Larkburger, located just a few steps from 16th Street off California.  

What can I say?  SUPER clean establishment, EASY ordering process, SWIFT delivery of food, and TASTY bites!  We both got the Truffle Burger, mine with Pepperjack and his plain.  We also ordered regular French Fries and Truffle &amp; Parmesan Fries. The burgers included a well-balanced amount of truffle aioli and were cooked to perfectly pink Medium centers!  The fries, regular or special, were crispy and soft at the same time, and lacked all fussy greasiness opposite to its competitors. 

I would say the best part of this visit was the cashier&#39;s kindness!  He delivered a sample of his winter soup during our first few bites.  It was a hearty chili topped with a dash of sour cream and a monster tortilla chip.  I cannot wait for winter now!!

I still had a free burger coupon from the Denver Burger Battle (which all burger aficionados should consider attending).  This Larkburger is new, and clean, and modern, and nice.  They could really benefit from a &#34;go this way&#34; sign right after you enter, as the customers seem to ignore the right-side line area (like you would see in other fast casual restaurants), and bunch up in one spot in front of the leftmost register (blocking the soda machine and the door to the bathrooms).

I had the Chicken Burger (adobo grilled chicken breast, crispy jalapeños, lettuce, tomato, onion, fresh cilantro and chipotle sauce).  As you can see from the description, it really is more of chicken sandwich on a burger bun.  It was very tasty.  The chipotle and  jalapeños added zing, without overpowering the flavors.  And, although it was not huge, it was not unreasonably priced for what you got.  

People rave about the Truffle Burger at Larkburger.  I did try this at the Denver Burger Battle.  It is 1/3 lb certified angus beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and truffle aioli.  Although it was not my favorite (I actively chose not to do the &#34;truffle shuffle&#34;), it tasted better than certain burgers that other places seem to drown in cheap, chemically, white truffle oil.  Larkburger uses (in my opinion) a delicate hand with their aioli.   I have also heard good things about the fries, but only tried a few at the DBB.

Not aware of another place to get one like they make here. It&#39;s a bit pricier than everything else on the menu but for a pescatarian that doesn&#39;t like mushroom cap burgers -- woohoo! The $5 shakes are pretty damn good shakes and I like the parmesan &amp; truffle fries too.

Like to order online which has never been a problem. One time, they were out of tuna and told me they&#39;d give me free burgers next time. Went in about a month or two later, and the guy that was working behind the counter remembered me. He gave us the entire meal for free. Thanks JJ!!

This is in the rotation of neighborhood places that we will continue to visit regularly."

You can definitely tell its in the CBD district. Its retro with the wood floors and tables. They have a small menu to grab right by the door if you arent hungry right then but want to see what they have to offer. 

Upon approaching the counter. I was greeted immediately by a friendly employee. Placed my order checked out the Cool Soda Machine. I stumbled hazily looking for the Bathroom. They seen that and pointed me in the right direction. Its not McDonalds fast but its made to order. Didnt take to long for it to come out either. 

Ordered it Medium Well. It could of been a little more on the well side. The Truffle Parm Fries are on point as always. Love the fresh veggies and the sauce they put on the burger. And The Bun is good and crunchy but chewy. Nice Music is playing as well."

I&#39;ve eaten here a couple of times. Honestly, the first time I at here, and probably the second, I wasn&#39;t blown away. The truffle burger and truffle fries are good, and they give you a lot of fries, so that&#39;s a plus. The burger has a taste about it that&#39;s delicious, and it&#39;s always cooked to order. I&#39;ve had several of the options with chicken too, and they&#39;ve always been decent. 

I&#39;m not blown away by this place though. Maybe I&#39;m just hard to impress. And maybe it&#39;s just run of the mill to me because I eat out A LOT, but it&#39;s not spectacular. I recommend it over the other burger places I&#39;ve reviewed on 16th street mall though, so if you&#39;re looking for somewhere with a good burger, fries, and a soda machine with a million combinations, this place is for you. 

As far as the interior...there&#39;s not much to it. There is an outside seating area, I think. Maybe not. I never eat outside because it&#39;s on a heavily traveled side street, and there are homeless people abound. There&#39;s also not much to look at outside, or inside, for that matter. If you&#39;re staying at a hotel and you want to eat here, grabbing it to go and heading back to your hotel might be the best option. 

Cons: No TV&#39;s"

The interior is modern with wooden walls and metal tables and chairs. But it was the outside patio I enjoyed most watching the people walk by. 

What I found was some happy hour specials like the $2 small shake or cans of beer. I opted for the shake and it was fantastic. It&#39;s made of Colorado ice cream and milk. That&#39;s it (I think!). Haha. If you&#39;re watching calories it&#39;s not that much either. 

Also, I just went with the Larkburger. I wanted something simple but good. It was good except the guy assured me that medium here is like medium rare but it really wasn&#39;t. It was a little disappointing but I guess I could live with it. 

Overall if you think of the happy hour specials and the location and that you&#39;re going to get a good quality burger in the evening, I don&#39;t know how you could beat this!"

It was a nice little place with all the amenities, which includes beer and outside seating.  I remember when little burger joints didn&#39;t serve beer, just milk shakes, although Larkburger&#39;s shakes did tempt me.

According to their website, &#34;this isn&#39;t a burger you hold. It&#39;s a burger you behold.&#34;  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever felt this way about a burger, although I might if actually faced with a bacon, fried egg, cheeseburger between a glazed donut instead of a bun.  I once ordered a hamburger at an &#34;Irish&#34; bar in Shanghai, that was a mistake, but a burger in China that is not in a fast food restaurant is something rare, so while not something you want to eat, I suppose it is something to behold."

Nice fresh interior with a simple menu of various types of burgers. I ordered something with bacon, cheddar cheese, and some kind of delicious mayonnaise-mushroom sauce. Beer was $2 because it was happy hour

Walked over super hungry after a long day at work. Walked in and was happily surprised there was no one in line and the place was clean.

However, at that point it took at least 5 minutes for someone to come out of the kitchen and actually take my order. Then it was another 25 minutes for 2 burgers &amp; 2 fries... Although people who came in after me and sat down were eating their food by the time I got mine. I ordered 1 burger with added cheese which they forgot and by the time I got home and found this I realized I had to go back because the bf really wanted cheese. 

Overall, for something I thought was going to be quick after a long day, it really wasn&#39;t. I will say that when I called about the burger missing cheese and the wait the guy made me new burgers immediately and when I walked in for the second time they were ready to go and I got a coupon for a free burger &amp; fry.   

That made up for it a little bit. Also, the burgers were pretty good. The fries... meh. They were just kind of a mess and got all soggy and icky after all that time which made me a little sad because I got the truffle Parmesan ones. 

Anyways, I&#39;m giving them 3 stars because the burgers were good, and they did try to help me out after. Hopefully next time I have a better experience."

Normally this would have been done at a restaurant level, so I&#39;m guessing that the cashier lacked the authorization to do so.  Either that, or it was just a bad call on their part.

The Parmesan fries are worth the visit by themselves.  The fries are skin-on, thin sliced, topped with truffle oil, parsley, coarse sea salt and Parmesan cheese.  The truffle oil really adds nice, aromatic flavor.  Really good fries and not too oily, I&#39;ll go back for the fries alone.

The downtown location is new and therefore is trendy right now, and thus there is a noon-lunch-rush-crowd line to wait in, all tables were full at 11:45 so go early for a table.  The staff seemed up to the challenge of the lunch rush and had orders out in reasonable time.

My meal consisted of a little lark burger, a small chili, and truffle fries. The burger was cooked a perfect medium. The burger was well seasoned with no need for any condiments. I had onions and lettuce and it was perfect. The chili was deep and rich in flavor. There was just enough spice to get your attention but still great. The masa chips added a little sweet as well. The truffle fries were full of flavor but could gave been cooked a little longer. I do like crispy fries, so maybe it&#39;s just a preference. The subtle taste of truffle brought a whole new level of complexity to what would have been a typical order of French fried potatoes.

And the funniest part is, that by the time I actually got around to trying this BURGER place, I had gone vegetarian. But have no fear, because Larkburgers options were still quite yummy for this non-burger eater. I opted for the Amy Burger, which is their grilled portabella cap, sauteed with a yummy marinade. It&#39;s also served with some great grilled onions. I honestly didn&#39;t even miss the meat! The marinade, I swear, makes you think you aren&#39;t missing a thing by choosing a mushroom cap versus the normal beef burger.  The bun was great. Fresh and light.  The fries were yummy too.

They give an option on if you want your burger rare, medium or well...

I order mine well, and it was amazing, very juicy, great seasoning and Im not sure which bread they use for the bun but it was great...

I wanted to order a second but I decide to order the Truffle &amp; Parmesan Fries which were also amazing...

Three stars because the burger is above average and was cooked properly, albeit dreadfully underseasoned, and the accompanying garden setup seemed fresh. 
But these correctable and preventable issues all happened, 
Fries were way under done, like maybe halfway done at best. I asked for a replacement, which they were happy to provide, but the replacement was also halfway done. I mean soggy floppy almost raw style halfway done. 
I ordered 2 burgers with bacon (an upcharge), neither included it, so I had to go fetch it, which they happily provided. 
The front door has been sticking for years and these guys have done nothing visible to unstick it. That may sound petty, but when it&#39;s 10 degrees (like on this day) and random jackasses don&#39;t make sure the door shuts when they walk in, it becomes a problem. And this problem has been there for as long as I can remember.  -1 for that crap. 
Will I go back? Maybe. But don&#39;t sit by the door, don&#39;t get fries and don&#39;t ask for bacon, I guess."

The burger I had was good. I had the Ahi burger. I did ask for it rare. I was thinking that would mean a quick sear on both sides, but there wasn&#39;t even that. I&#39;m pretty sure it was just raw. Good thing I&#39;m a huge ahi and sashimi fan because some people might have been turned off by that. For me, it was ok.

My wife had the turkey burger and she said it was pretty good. I didn&#39;t really get much feedback for her, but she didn&#39;t complain either. I had a bite and it tasted pretty well seasoned. 

The truffle parmesan fries were a huge draw for us as well. We make our own truffle fries at home and for our business. I have to say that we were a bit disappointed. They used russet potatoes which is fine, but they were very brown almost to the point of being over cooked. The fries were oily, but not with truffle oil. I mean you could smell the truffle oil, but you couldn&#39;t really taste it. That&#39;s usually the case when you use Olive Oil with truffle &#34;essence&#34;. In any case, we were expecting a bit more for such a popular burger joint in downtown Denver.

We may try out another location if we are in town again. Maybe it was just the day we went..."

Go here if you feel like trying lark burger.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with cross contamination here, though they do grill the buns on the same flat top grill,  so if you are extra sensitive you may want to skip having them grill it.

Also had a side of truffle fries that were really good, though they would have been awesome with just a few more seconds in the fryer. Shake was great too, though I wish they had a couple more options on flavors besides the basic 3. Anyway, ridiculously good burger, and off the 16th St Mall, so a bit more peaceful inside, too."

I have had the chicken ramen (spicy and mild) and the gyoza. It has been great both times I have visited. Ramen and gyoza for 11 bucks... you can&#39;t beat that! You definitely won&#39;t leave hungry and the flavor is spot on. They have made me a regular!"

If you are just driving by, you&#39;ll never find this place. It is sandwiched between apartment hell, a Goodyear repair shop, and a parking lot. Rely on your sense of smell and drive around until you find Sakura. If you happen to get your car repaired along the way, that&#39;s probably OK too.

Don&#39;t be deterred by the basic and unappealing atmosphere. That is not what Sakura is all about. Focus your energy on the menu filled with delicious items that will surely fulfill your Asian food needs. On this visit, I have the beef bulgogi with some gyoza. The large bowl and these little dumpling dream pillows were plenty for lunch, if not a little too much. All of that and a drink for $16, which is a little pricey. That is the only reason why Sakura did not earn a 5 star.

It&#39;s time to enjoy some really good Korean food. Enough reading and just go!"

Until today. The first attempt to visit them at 8pm one night was met with a very nice older gentleman who kindly informed us that they&#39;re closed.

Today we went in for lunch. They were out of Kalbi over rice and veggies. I ended up with their awesome Beef Bulgogi in a bowl with a choice of brown rice or white. I opted for brown rice. Large $8.45. The small would set you back $6.85.

Oh yeah! Am I happy or what?! Delicious well marinated beef. Generous portion. Well distributed ratio of rice to beef to veggies.

They have Bento Box , Hot Pot, Rolls, Appetizers, Noodles (miso, udon and yaki-udon). 

My guess is that this is a mom and pops business. The guy that helped us was very knowledgeable. When he informed me that they ran out of Kalbi he suggested another dish similar to it. I appreciate the help since my favorite Friday K friend is not around.

Very simple decor inside. Even sparse. I Love it! Fast service with warmth. Free hot tea.

Tip: Grab your utensils and water or tea while waiting for your order. 

I&#39;m going back to try everything on their menu...one dish at a time. Duh!"

I ordered the beef bulgolgi bowl with brown rice, small size, and a side of kimchi. My boyfriend ordered the spicy pork bento box. We both received a VERY generous portion of food, yet somehow managed to scarf down every bit because it was so tasty. When I notified an employee that my side of kimchi was missing, he apologized several times and immediately brought it out...it turns out they make it homemade. It&#39;s nice and cabbage-y, and is spicier than most I&#39;ve had in the states with a great balanced tang. The bulgolgi tasted very similar to any I had in Korea, maybe a tad bit less marinated but oh so delish regardless. I crave this place so often. 


I am also a big fan that hot tea is served at no cost alongside the meal. For a meal under $8, this is one of my new favorite places for an Asian food fix!"

You can add meat or an egg to it for a few dollars but I prefer it just plain. I&#39;ve also had the curry tofu and it was delicious!

The interior decor brought back good memories of exploring the country and ducking into a little storefront space for a bowl of noodles.

As another out-of-town Yelper asked, where&#39;s the dinner crowd? Sakura is a great place to get your Asian comfort food fix. The prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is authentic. The food is prepared with a lot of detail and care.

When visiting Japanese places, my task is to see if it&#39;s better than my mom&#39;s cooking. So, I started off with the gyoza. It seems like every culture has it&#39;s own version of gyoza - a dough wrap filled with meat and/or vegetables and then steamed or pan fried. Sakura fries their gyoza. The wrapper was crispy with a nice crunch, while the filling was tender. I liked this better than my mom&#39;s (if anyone tells her, I&#39;ll deny it). Sakura - WIN!

The next course was the Japanese-style chicken curry with white rice (you get an option of white or brown rice). This curry was more in the style of the Curry House restaurant chain. The gravy was thick and slightly sweet, with a kick of heat that sneaks up on you. Sakura places their curry on a bed of shredded lettuce and carrots, very different from the stew-like consistency that I make at home. Sakura - mom - TIE!

For dessert, I ordered the California roll. They use the same rice as they use for the meals, which is what my mom does. They use a generous amount of avocado and shredded surimi (most sushi places just use insert a block of surimi, shredding it takes some time, and care). My only disappointment is that the roll isn&#39;t packed very tightly, so the roll comes apart very easily, and I don&#39;t believe they vinegar their rice. Flavor-wise, it&#39;s a tie.

I would put Sakura up against my mom&#39;s cooking any day. If I lived anywhere near here, I would be a regular. It&#39;&#39;s that good."

We were the only table in there which made me a little sad because it seems like a solid place for Japanese and Korean food and the two ladies running the operation were nice but not overbearing whatsoever. I got the chicken katsu bento box which had a generous portion of food including soup, salad, sushi rolls, rice and chicken. The chicken was a little too dry and overcooked for my liking but everything else was fantastic. They have a vat of hot tea right near the utensils so if you&#39;re looking for something to drink and don&#39;t want to pay for a can or bottle of soda, get your antioxidants in and have some tea! Once we were done, my belly was happy and I was satisfied yet not disgusted with myself so that was a win.

&#34;Unassuming&#34; seems to be their MO in terms of location and store front. A buddy recommended I drop by here ages ago when he heard I was having trouble getting my Asian comfort food fix. I initially didn&#39;t believe him when he described where it was. 

Just off Arapahoe?

Between Quebec and Yosemite?

No way, man, I&#39;ve driven by that spot hundreds of times. I would&#39;ve seen this place. I can list every other store in the area.

...it faces AWAY from the street?

It&#39;s fairly simple to find if you know it&#39;s there, but they aren&#39;t doing themselves any favors as far as happenstance walk-ins go. Few forces on Earth would let you stumble upon the tasty goodness of Sakura by accident, so carry this review close to your chest.

Once you get past the location and a lackluster exterior, Sakura is quaint and inviting. Recommended specials are described with colorful bursts of chalk next to a tv that cycles through their top selling items. If you didn&#39;t know what you wanted to eat, you&#39;ll know soon: EVERYTHING.

I&#39;ve only ever come for lunch, but this has always paid off with great bentos and rice dishes at a fair price. The bibimbap comes to mind, though you will miss the giant cast iron bowl if you&#39;re used to dolsot. Their ramen is pretty average by most reports, so stick to what they do well.

Sakura is a family operation and that&#39;s reflected in their slowdown whenever they get busy. But it also shows in the consistent quality of food and their care for the customer. You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find better Japanese/Korean lunch dishes in a ten mile radius for these prices, so if you live in the area, definitely give it a try."

So, we drove there thinking we&#39;re going to have a Japanese meal. To our surprise and disappointment, SAKURA IS NOT A JAPANESE RESTAURANT as advertise, rather IT IS A KOREAN RESTAURANT. Since we drove a few miles, we decided to give it a try. We ordered Super Bento. The chicken was very dry and tough, and the beef was very, very low quality and full of fat. The people sitting next to us also complaint about the long wait for the food to arrive. 

I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone, because of the poor quality (meat, chicken, pork) of the food. The cashier was nice, but that did not make up for it."

I was curious since I&#39;ve seen the reviews on Bibimbop but the restaurant has a Japanese name.  Most of the menu items are Japanese style, like ramen and bento boxes.  I stayed the course and ordered the bibimbop with a side of Kimchi.  Service is incredibly slow.  Three people were working, one in the kitchen, one to bring out the dishes and one basically standing at the register.  When I sat down after ordering at the counter, I noted 4 out the 5 tables with patrons were waiting for their meal...there was no one in front of me at the counter when I ordered so I assume they had been waiting several minutes.  About 20 minutes after my order, the bibimbop arrived.  It was pretty dismal.  A bowl of iceberg lettuce, beef, a teaspoon of shredded carrots and a few sprigs of soybean with a large portion of rice with a side watery Gochuchang.  Not what you get in Korea (I lived in Seoul for 4 years)...in fact it had no taste even with the Gochuchang. The beef was the best of the meal...seasoned and tender.  Oh and remember the kimchi side order...it came about 10 minutes after the Bibimbop.  I supposed it had to be made, since it was new Kimchi and not the fermented stuff.  The cabbage was crispy and the peppers and garlic had not had a chance to sink in.  Definitely not traditional.  I may come back to try the Japanese cuisine, but for the Korean side I will not come back."

About six(ish) months ago I brought a Korean co-worker here.  He inhaled the food in minutes and wondered why I didn&#39;t as well.  I eat here a lot more now; probably weekly.  We get the veggie hot pots most of the time (I&#39;ve tried them with meat; they are good but I enjoy the veggie one the most).  For a meal those are lighter and probably a bit healthier as the bentos simply have a lot of food.  Especially if you are going to eat here a lot.

My co-worker told me today he thinks this is the best restaurant in Denver (at a pause for breath from inhaling his soup).  I&#39;m not qualified to speak to authenticity of the food but he certainly is having grown up in Korea.  I&#39;ll take him at his word and continue to come back often.  

I also know that at other restaurants he is often the last to finish eating - here he is the first by miles.  If you want to try real Korean food eat here."

Did bibibop for take out on Sat lunch time.  It was fast, lady was friendly and at $9, it was kinda luxury lunch. Its filled with lots of meat and came with salad and soup.

We met here for the June UYE DTC Lunch Club.  I think I may have dropped by here several years ago.

We were still excited at their selection and ordered katsu curry, ramen and spicy hot pot to share.  The broths on both the ramen and hot pot were amazing and the katsu was good (not quite as good as the Katsu I remember from Asia...but American good).  It is seriously worth the trip for the spicy hot pot and ramen though.  Lots of flavor.  I&#39;m not sure why this place isn&#39;t more popular.

Finally, the bowls that we did receive were hardly warm and quite bland. Neither of us could finish it.

Perhaps we just went on the wrong night."

A legit place to have Korean (and some) Japanese rice plates, noodles, and soup! I have never been so happy to find an Asian restaurant that is authentic, delicious, and affordable here in Colorado - especially in the suburbs of Denver. Coming from the Bay Area, we were definitely spoiled to have joints only a few blocks away from home. It&#39;s been pretty difficult to find good Asian places around here so I&#39;ve resorted to learning some recipes myself! So far we&#39;ve been here twice and we plan on visiting at least once a week after a good workout at the gym (hey the food&#39;s pretty healthy so no guilt there!).

On our first visit, the Hubbs and I had the small Spicy Pork bowl (aka Daeji Bulgogi) over brown rice and boy it was good -- and SPICY! The balance between the tender pork slices, crunchy veggies, and the fragrant rice totally hit the spot. It was a little too spicy for us both so next time we&#39;ll be asking for the sauce on the side. Also, they do have a kids&#39; menu which isn&#39;t listed on their menu -- just ask. My son usually gets the Beef Bulgogi which comes with a side of rice and choice of a drink or miso soup.

On our second visit yesterday, Hubbs had the Beef Bulgogi rice bowl with a side of Kim Chee, our son had the kid&#39;s Beef Bulgogi again, and I had the Bibimbap - which was deelicious! I&#39;ve always heard about and watched videos on how to make Bibimbap but never tried it till then. It did not contain the usual ingredients like the bean sprouts, kosari, and a few other veggies but it didn&#39;t ruin the dish at all. Bibimbap is another rice bowl that contains a side of beef and veggies infused with sesame oil over rice and topped with an over easy egg. It also comes with a spicy sauce. You basically add your sauce, break up the egg, and mix everything in the bowl and eat! SO GOOD. It tasted even better with a few pieces of kim chee! 

Customer service-wise: we had two different ladies help us and they were both very polite. Oh FYI - although the restaurant&#39;s name is Japanese, the owners are Korean :)

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try their other dishes - especially their soups when winter comes around!"

I went recently during the week and wound up back here a few days later. The lady at the counter is very friendly and makes you feel very welcomed. She even remembered that they owed my friend a complimentary side dish from a previous dining experience he had.

The spicy level is really spicy. If you customarily order the HOT breakfast burrito or even the INSANE breakfast burrito at Santiagos you will appreciate the Spicy option at Sakura. If you are not a huge fan of burning spicy, you probably should not choose Spicy.

The ramen, the bento boxes, and the udon dishes are each really good. The food has a great homemade comforting feel to it.  There surprisingly quite a few good places to eat in this little strip mall, but; Sakura is truly one of the best."

The prices are also great in relation to the food you get. I haven&#39;t gone wrong yet with eating here for lunch. Also, you don&#39;t have to wait long for your food either. The place seems to never be super busy but I think that is because it is hidden and not everyone knows it is there.

Sakura simply executes their compact menu extremely well.  It&#39;s just so nice to be able to pick from a single page of offerings and know exactly what to expect every visit versus wading through endless pages of a menu.

My favorites are the bimbimbop, bulgogi and spicy ramen. The homemade kim chee is also a big hit. Service is genuine and the ladies who work there are lovely. My office is just down the street, so Sakura&#39;s become a regular in my work lunch rotation. 

Highly recommended."

I had the teriyaki chicken bento box, and it was perfect! The miso was fantastic, the salad was fresh and tasty, good dumplings, a hearty side of rice, and some excellent chicken!

This falls under the &#34;hidden gem&#34; category-- not the easiest place to find, but once you&#39;ve tried it, you&#39;ll be back! Everyone was happy with their meals, great portions for an excellent price, and friendly service. If you hit them during their rush, you may be waiting a little, but it&#39;s totally worth it for the freshness and quality of the meal.

Absolutely going back. And often."

It&#39;s a little mom-and-pop type shop that&#39;s tucked away in a corner.

Being that, the place isn&#39;t really highly staffed and food can take quite a bit of time to come out.

However, the food was delicious. I had the Kal-bi bento box, and it was amazing.

I would not, however, recomment the ramen. The spicy ramen, I am pretty sure, was just a pack of Shin Ramyun.

I would recomment this place, but not if you are looking to take a quick lunch break."

There is really no room to sit at their location, so plan on picking up.  Price point is high, but the value is still fine because the pizza is so damn good.  

Tip: get the kids an order of cheese bread, instead of a cheese pizza. It is essentially a cheese pizza cut into strips, but is only 6.00 for a 10&#34; pizza."

The pizza quality was rather good since I had originally self created my pizza with pepperoni and sausage and got the 18&#39; pizza. Price turned out to be over $20 which is to be expected for most places selling large pizzas besides pizza chains. The pizza may be a bit thinner then I liked but i couldn&#39;t happen to enjoy the taste of the pizza. 
I&#39;ll be stopping in again for sure to try there specials (Not created) to see what else I may enjoy. Only reason I didn&#39;t give it the 5 stars is I would enjoy the pizza a tad thicker and even a bigger pizza option. But overall me and my girlfriend enjoyed be pizza."

It had the holes in the bottom for fast cooking and screen marks from places like chuck E cheese or fast food places.

Anyway, we ordered a half and half, Cheesy Goomba and the Super Goomba.  My half was the cheese half and it was delicious.

They have a couple of small tables with 2 chairs each, though, and everyone was really nice. The Greek salad was really nice and big. It had great toppings and everything was fresh (no wilted veggies). There was a big slab of feta cheese on top and the vinaigrette was tasty. It would easily be big enough as a lunch salad for one, or to share along with your pizza, you could serve 2-3 people. We tried the Sofia Mia pizza (my friends said it was good) and the Cheesy Goomba. The cheese pizza had a bunch of different cheeses on it. It was tasty in the way that a very good cheese pizza will be, but I honestly couldn&#39;t pick out the individual cheeses used. Still, the pizza was among the better I&#39;ve tried in Colorado.

I take pizza very seriously. Not in the &#34;NYC-vs-Chicago-there-is-no-decent-pizza-except-from-a-place-that-is-located-NOT-where-we-are-right-now-so-you&#39;re-comment-is-stupid&#34; kind of way. 

I take pizza seriously as in the &#34;I&#39;m lactose-intolerant&#34; kind of way. Serious as in my lactose-intolerance showed itself well into adulthood when I was eating pizza. Serious as in simultaneous explosiveness from both ends. 

If I have to use 2-3 lactase tablets, that pizza better be worth it. Goombas pizza is worth a package of lactase.

My pepperoni and anchovy pizza was ordered online and was freshly done when I arrived. I was so pleasantly greeted when I arrived, I worried the pizza would be a disappointment...especially after I was told that the anchovies were awesome. 

My Goombas 10&#34; pizza was epic!

The thin crisp/chewy crust is a much a star as the just right sauce. Not too sweet with a nice bite. Just the right amount of pepperoni and cheese and authentic just-right grease. But it was the anchovies that blew me away! Best anchovies I&#39;ve ever had on a pizza. 

I live 30 minutes away. I swear I might go back tonight. Well worth paying a bit more than I would normally pay. I was stuffed because I went into a taste-trance and could&#39;t stop eating. 

Goombas is good stuff."

The prices are more than fair for the monster-sized pies, and the sandwiches are so tantalizing that I almost got both a grinder and a pizza at the same time, though I knew I&#39;d not be able to finish one, much less both.
My brother and I walked in, placed our order, and walked out within fifteen minutes, after kicking each others&#39; trash at Connect Four while waiting at a little table in the lobby. I&#39;m not sure what we ordered on the pizza, because it had just about everything but anchovies and the kitchen sink, but it was delicious. The crust was soft under the sauce and crisp on the bottom, and the cheese was fantastic.
The service was superb; we had several questions (because we hadn&#39;t tried any of their offerings before, a mistake that I&#39;m glad we rectified) and the gentleman behind the counter was accommodating, professional, and forthright about all of his answers. We&#39;ll definitely be back."

We ordered a margherita, sausage/onion, and a Greek salad. The pizza dough was soft but with a good crispiness on the bottom. Sauce was tasty and mild. The margherita was beautiful and had tons of semi-melted mozz balls and fresh basil. Fresh tomatoes would make it even better.  Sausage was ground and evenly spread around the pizza. So in addition to delicious pizzas, these guys obviously have the aesthetic part down too. This food is beautiful.

And the Greek salad.....oh my. We&#39;re not salad people, but we fought over the salad. Fresh, flavorful dolmades and veggies, with the best freakin dressing....oh my lord...the dressing. Amazing. I dunked my pizza crusts in it and tried to get up every last drop with my fork (in retrospect, I should&#39;ve gotten a spoon). And actually, I hope the hubs doesn&#39;t read this, or he&#39;ll realize that there were dolmades included that I didn&#39;t share....

I was staying at a nearby hotel and decided to try Goombas based on the yelp reviews here. Because it was close to closing time, I phoned in my order. When I arrived, the pizza was being pulled out of the oven - right on schedule. When the employee (possibly the owner?) cut it, it really caught my attention. It almost sounded like he was cutting a cracker (this was a good sound)! Once back at the hotel, I opened the box and did not find a discombobulated or greasy mess, but a pizza that looked every bit as good as when it was boxed in front of me.

The pizza was probably the best I have ever had, and definitely the best I remember ever having eaten. Under the pie, the crust was chewy, but not doughy. At the edges, it was crispy like it should be. The toppings were well proportioned, and evenly distributed. Finally, the sauce could be likened to a support cast (in a movie); although important to the finished product, it allowed the toppings and crust to really center stage.

Goombas is too far from my home to frequent, but is now on my short list when I am in this area of the state."

I am so happy we did.  Our family likes simple cheese pizza and their cheese pizza is wonderful.  It had the perfect amount of sauce (some places put way too much).  

The crust on the pizza is SOOOOOO good, my son kept stealing my pizza crust off of my plate!!!  My two kids are very picky eaters and they loved this pizza.

We never finish a large pizza and we ate this entire pizza.

Ordering is so easy!  You can place your order online through their Facebook page...our pizza was ready in 25 minutes.

You can not sit down here and eat your pizza, it is take away only.

We will be ordering here from now on, love this place.  I am even more happy that it is a locally owned pizza place as opposed to the chain pizza places.

This place - hands down - is incredible.  They are a small business that has only been open two months and based on the reviews since their opening...that should be enough of an answer for you to get off your butt and get down to this pizza place ASAP.  

I heard about this place from a co-worker and promptly checked out the reviews.  I was not disappointed and the reviews do not lie. :)  They are located right in Arvada near Olde Town - basically a neighborhood business.  So if you prefer supporting local business you can&#39;t go wrong.

We ordered the GrindHouse and the Game Over pizza - AMAZING -both of them.  There really is something magical in the crust.  A few previous reviewers on here complained of them not having small pizzas or slices and this goes to show you the owner listens - because they updated their menu and now offer small pizzas for the family of two.  I was worried about that at first as it&#39;s just my boyfriend and I - but was pleasantly surprised when we stopped in to order and saw that we didn&#39;t have to order a large pizza.  The employees were also incredibly patient with our ridiculous requests and changes to our order and that is always a plus.  

This place is strictly take out.  I thought it was sit down at first but was wrong and that is fine.  They had all sorts of fun games to keep you occupied while you wait.  All in all...do yourself a favor...and go support this business.  We need more establishments like this - small and family owned - unique - and great PERSONAL service.  Keep up the great work guys!  I&#39;d rather order from you than anywhere else!"

It was quite big, I was only able to eat about 1/2, so I&#39;ve got some leftovers to look forward to.  The guys behind the counter were great, everyone was friendly and let me know about when it&#39;d be ready.

It be nice if they had more of a seating area, they don&#39;t have much room if you&#39;re not getting it to go...but today I was on the go.

I like Etai&#39;s because it&#39;s a convenient on-campus lunch/brunch/breakfast option that offers fun stuff like pumpkin or butterscotch vanilla lattes, banana pastry (delicious BTW), sandwiches, breakfast burritos, yogurt, tea, salads, etc. Their pastries are better than the ones served at Starbucks in my opinion.

I&#39;ve come here on 3-4 occasions before exams to grab food when I don&#39;t have time to prepare any. I haven&#39;t been dissatisfied with anything I&#39;ve tried. Today I tried the California breakfast sandwich with tomato, avocado, egg and mayonaise on a nice crispy bread. It was appropriately priced @ less than $5 &amp; came with a small slice of cantaloupe. There is seating both indoors and outdoors. You are given a buzzing plastic disc to let you know when your food is ready. Typically the workers there will just bring it to your table for you.

The Wednesday special was a pastrami sandwich with slaw, whole grain mustard, horse radish sauce, and side salad (or other side of your choice). I got the sesame carrot dressing for my salad &amp; thought it was super unique &amp; yummy. It tasted like sushi to me. The pastrami sandwich had big fluffy light bread and was very delicious. There was slightly too much horse radish (and trust me- I&#39;m a huge fan of horse radish and spicy food). My nose was barely tolerating the latter end of the sandwich. 

I tried the minty vanilla latte for under $4 for a small &amp; thought there  wasn&#39;t enough mint. It also tasted like there wasn&#39;t enough coffee. It mostly tasted like milk &amp; vanilla."

The kale was a little overpowering, but I still enjoyed it. I also really liked that I could get quinoa as a side.

The problem is, it&#39;s just too expensive. That sandwich was $8. At the cafeteria at the last university medical center I worked at I could get a whole meal for $4.

The lines aren&#39;t terrible if you get there right before the noon rush.

The new Tuscan Mushroom sandwich was tasty, though I wish it was a bit bigger for my $8.50.  And that&#39;s the chief complaint about any Udi&#39;s sandwich - as good as it tastes, you&#39;re paying quite a bit for it.  Some of the ingredient combinations are a little strange, and I wish they would openly give you choice of bread, because some of us are allergic to walnuts and would like certain sandwiches to be made on something else instead.

The sitting area is way too small to accommodate the crowd.  Surprising these medical professionals and students don&#39;t mind eating outside, and then leaving their plates and trash in the middle of the lawn.  

I tried the tomato spinach soup and the japanese salad.  The 1/2 salad is more like 1/4 salad.  My clutch cocktail purse can hold more lettuce than what Udi&#34;s is willing to offer.  The chicken part of the salad was 3 small pieces no bigger than an infants palm, being sliced as thin as a stridex pad.    The soup tasted of parmesan tomato and more parmesan.  It wasn&#39;t worth the sodium spike.

A good selection of sandwiches and pastries but you can&#39;t help thinking that a salad or sandwich from Whole Foods would be just as good in terms of produce and half the price.

That said, the food is generally good, the staff are great and they do half price pastries in the afternoon (while they last).


Some downsides? The coffee is horrifically strong though, to the point where it&#39;s almost undrinkable at times. I generally have to water it down. The sandwiches vary greatly in portion size. Some are too much to eat in one sitting while others leave you thinking you&#39;ve been ripped off.

But, regardless of that when I asked my server to change her gloves she complied happily!! Parking is sometimes difficult to get but there is always an option of taking it to-go and parking in those 15 minute spots."

But tonight made me think twice about that. I do believe that people transfer their energies into their work, and tonight when I went in the energy was pretty intense.

As I approached the line, I wasn&#39;t even acknowledged and then shortly after one young girl finished with two people in front of me, she finally got to me. I had to say hello first and when I said hello she sort of rolled her eyes at me. I am very specific and I know what I want so I don&#39;t take more time, but I feel that wasn&#39;t even enough for her. I would have walked out immediately, but then the nice cashier - whom I believe his name is David - jumped in to help and he was amazingly nice. He was patient even if I didn&#39;t need it, but now to think about it, I did. He did turn my experience around. Even after I went to grab some napkins, I went back for a lid for my Tabasco and he made me feel like I was still a valued customer.

Guess it&#39;s a hit and miss with some people, but David is definitely great! If you see him, give him a shout out. Nice young man who wears glasses!

Unfortunately I did not eat even half of my meal because I felt odd after a certain point, but my partner did finish theirs and I am grateful for her taking the time to service my family."

I usually get a rice bowl with chicken and it lasts me two meals. Watch out for BOGO coupons which are amazing. Chipotle is actually pretty healthy if you skip the tortilla and sour cream. This location&#39;s napkins and utensils are always fully stocked which is a perk. I also really like the smoked tabasco sauce because I like my chipotle extra spicy. Definitely one of my fav fast food chains.

I come here frequently, especially during lunchtime, when it can get pretty packed. However, they are always able to move the line quickly and I&#39;ve never spent more than 5 minutes waiting for my food. Their food is always fresh, I&#39;ve never had any issues. Sometimes they can be a little small on the portions but if I ask for a little more, I&#39;ve never had a problem. Parking in front of the store can be a bit of a nuisance but they have a fairly large lot shared with other places but I&#39;ve never had a problem with parking. It can be tough to find a seat sometimes, especially with a larger party on the week days around noon but I think that&#39;s to be expected given the location.
My only complaint is that I ordered online one time and they didn&#39;t drain the salsa before adding it so I ended up with a very soupy and gross bowl. Because they do move so quickly, I just wait in line instead and have never otherwise had that issue."

You&#39;d think that being right off of I-225 and Colfax would be good, but in reality the shopping center is a nightmare for driving and parking.  If you manage to get in and find a spot, then you&#39;re fine, but don&#39;t go right at noon if you head there for lunch.  Go early or late and avoid the rush.  They get hurried and sometimes the food amount/quality suffers as a result, but that&#39;s probably true at every location during a lunch crush.  Generally good, though if it were a little closer to the Anschutz campus it would be better because then we could walk there more easily instead of having to navigate the parking insanity."

While dining there today, my friend decided to pay for my food after the cashier had already swiped my card. One worker said they could refund it and made it feel like not a big deal.
While the cashier waited for a manager to override the charge to my card, I mentioned to her that I had forgotten to ask for lettuce, so she quickly grabbed gloves and got me some lettuce! She could have asked someone else to do it or said it was too late but she did it herself!

Hard to find a spot to sit or a parking spot if you come in when it&#39;s busy.

Chipotle as a whole gets my 5 star vote, but this location is lucky to get 2 stars. There are a lot of rude and cranky employees that work here, which is abnormal for this company. If you can get past the unhappy employees, keep an eye on your food. They are extremely stingy at this location and I&#39;m not kidding when I say you&#39;ll probably get half the portion of meat that you&#39;re used to. Don&#39;t bother mentioning it as all you&#39;ll get is an argument. Also, make sure you&#39;re not being charged for items that you did not order or receive as this has also happened... more than once.

UPDATE:
Someone is listening as things improved. For about a week....
Now the portioning is worse than ever. You literally get a half a scoop of meat. Then they actually take a couple of pieces of meat back in the scoop and put it back into the main tray. It&#39;s ridiculous. I just ordered a bowl with extra rice, extra veggies, extra meat, extra cheese, along with all the other ingredients, and my bowl was barely filled up to the rim, without me even pressing down on it. Something is wrong here and two stars is even too much for this location.

UPDATE 2:
This is a different restaurant than the one I originally reviewed. A year ago this place didn&#39;t deserve 1 star but I&#39;m bumping it up to 4 stars today. The employees are generally friendly, the line usually moves fast, everything tastes as it should, and the portions are now consistent and adequate. Whoever is running this place is doing a much better job, so thank you!

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that this location is always busy now and the parking lot isn&#39;t that great. No fault of the current management but not &#34;as good as it gets.&#34; Maybe they should open up another Chipotle across the street to relieve some of the congestion? That seems to work for Starbucks :)"

This one stinks. Having eaten here several times and had lackluster experiences both with the food and service, I&#39;m going to have to totally forgo Chipotle unless I happen to be in a different area. There&#39;s definitely some issue with the quality of the ingredients here, I don&#39;t think the food tastes as good and the chips are almost always stale and hard. Tonight I placed an internet order, my husband brought it home and my bowl had no rice. We looked at the receipt and &#34;white rice&#34; was very clearly located on the list of ingredients. We paid about twenty-five dollars for our meal and I feel totally ripped off. Without rice, the serving size is totally anemic. How did someone forgot such a vital ingredient in all of their bowls? I certainly didn&#39;t feel like hopping in the car and driving it all the way back. To avoid such experiences in the future, we won&#39;t be coming here again."

It&#39;s a no frills, rough around the edges sandwich shop.  I expected better decor for a chain restaurant,  but I don&#39;t go for the ambiance,  its about the sandwich.  

I have eaten here many times, and tried the regular philly, green chili philly (my favorite), and the philly cheese steak salad.  

The sandwiches are very good for a chain restaurant. The steak is seasoned and cooked well, the cheese Is smooth and gooey, and the bread is never soggy (even when I get it delivered.)  The philly salad comes in small or large sizes, with the same delicious steak, along with iceberg lettuce, tomato,  cucumber,  and red onion.  The large size I can rarely finish, but its good cold the next day.

They also carry a variety of salads and sandwiches of the non cheese steak variety.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a philly, a birch beer, and a tasty cake, in a sandwich shop that smells strongly of meat and onions.  I ment that to sound more appealing than not."

But it occurred to me recently that sandwiches are an item that honestly doesn&#39;t come up much in my, um, literary canon. So why don&#39;t we just plug that gap with a review of Taste of Philly?

Since ToP is literally right up the street from me, you would be correct in assuming that I&#39;ve sampled quite a few of their sandwich creations over the years. And no matter which one I choose, I can always count on a couple things. The bread is always pleasantly soft, yet sturdy - which stands to reason given that it comes directly from the esteemed, longstanding West Philadelphia bakery known as Amoroso&#39;s. The possible toppings are impressively diverse and varied - a boon to those who may be just a bit indecisive (or dare I say, jaded). Most importantly friends, I have to mention - while certain other Philly sandwich purveyors in town may be a little skimpy with their meats, ToP piles it on, ensuring plentiful protein in every chew. Indeed, if you&#39;ve ever heard someone exclaim, &#34;I don&#39;t think I can fit this much meat in my mouth!&#34; they were more than likely partaking in a Taste of Philly sandwich at that time.

And on that note, here&#39;s just a smattering of their menu for your perusal. One of my newest finds is the Cuban, with its cohabitation of ham and pulled pork along with pickles, mustard and Swiss cheese. Besides being quite tasty, their Chicken Cordon Bleu is also remarkably literal, including a generous dollop of blue cheese dressing between the buns. Out of their more traditional offerings, I&#39;d say that the Pepperoni Philly is my favorite because who doesn&#39;t like a little pepperoni with their chopped steak now and again? If you&#39;re set on something a touch lighter you&#39;re sure to fill that void with the Turkey Wrap featuring an unlikely (but thankfully yummy) combination of cream cheese and guacamole. And there&#39;s also pastrami, meatballs, tuna, mixed veggies, and so forth for you to try too. But folks, if you take nothing else from this review, remember - your meal is never complete without an Oreo brownie."

I really wish I could give this place a better than average rating. I love a great Philly, however, this one just didn&#39;t make the cut. I ordered a philly with all the fixings on it and it seemed to have more flavor from the fixings and condiments then the actual meat did. 
My kids had a Ruben and a chicken salad and neither of them were too impressed. 
I am willing to give them a shot again, but understand my plight, when you are super hungry and you just want that &#34;special something&#34; to fix your appetite and then it doesn&#39;t... you are disappointed and wish you ate somewhere else.

2 biggest things from holding back a 5 star from me.

#1 No french fries?  Common now - those little potato sticks are a cash cow for a place like this! 

#2 The steak needs a bit more flavor. Overall its good, but with maybe some seasoning salt or something it could be bettrr.

All and all... great little hole in the wall."

Lady on the phone is a mixture of confused, incompetent, and rude.

Even though we order the same thing and tip well, price keeps going up.

Last time we ordered, the price the guy gave us when he got here was more than the price we got over the phone when we placed the order.

It took them over an hour to deliver. When we called back to see where our order was, the lady over the phone said she didn&#39;t know where it was or when it was coming.

It is definitely a no frills type spot.  A few tables and chairs, counter service and smells of meat and onions fill the air.  

They have a variety of cheese steaks to choose from, but on my first go in I went original - steak, onions and cheese on a roll.  I didn&#39;t eat it there.  I actually took it home - which is about a 10m drive.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the bread held up. It wasn&#39;t soggy at all and had the perfect amount of chewiness to it! I loved the meat - it was seasoned perfectly and well chopped.  The onions were caramelized nicely and the cheese was gooey (although I will get extra next time).

Trying to decide on a quick lunch I figured it had been a month so lets give it a shot.  That and Mom was wanting to try it. 

I called and placed an order.  On the second ring the phone was answered.  Guess the phone situation has been fixed (1Star)

I made my order, large regular with Extra Onions.  10-15 for pickup, yep that&#39;s normal.  

Pulled into the parking lot as I was only like 6 blocks away when I ordered and waited a bit before going in.  

A nice young lady was in the window at the grill and immediately told me she would be right with me. (1Star) I let her know I was picking up and order and it appears she was just finishing it up.  Good timing on my part I guess. 

She had it bagged up in a jiffy and came out so I could pay, she was plesant and quickly rang me up.  I could tell immediately upon lifting the bag that it was quite possibly back to the quality I had been used to.  You can tell how much meat is in most sandwhiches just by lifting them, even in the bag site unseen.  This was a bag with a bit of weight to it.  Now we are getting somewhere!

I came home and quickly unwrapped it to see if I was right.  I live close enough that it was stll pipping hot when I unwrapped it.  I was very excited to see that the quality that I had loved had returned to my beloved cheesesteak.  

I could see the extra oinions waiving to me from beneith the foil as I lifted it. There was a little steam even and I could see that juicy steak goodness on the wrapping.  This was again a sandwhich that would make you do the &#34;Hunch&#34;.  (2Stars)

For those who don&#39;t know what that is.  It&#39;s when it&#39;s got so much juice in it from the meat and things that you have to hunch over with your elbows high to eat it.  This &#34;hunch&#34; keeps the juice from running down your arms.  

This made me again a happy cheesesteak eatin girl.  This is the closest thing you can get in my opionion to the streets that made this sandwhich famous.   I have tried several others around town and I am always open to suggestion, but for me this is it."

Tonight was the last of our &#34;tolerance&#34; of the place because the food isn&#39;t even good anymore.  Ordered a delivery order at 6:35pm, nothing unusual-Philly cheesesteak and a ham grinder.  Delivery girl arrived at 7:05pm, 30 minutes, which is typical, maybe a little longer when they are busy.  At 7:10pm, we called back as the ham grinder was slathered in mustard instead of mayonnaise and the bread was mangled to the point it didn&#39;t even constitute a &#34;sub sandwich&#34; any longer; one half was ripped off leaving a small piece of bread for a 6:1 ham vs bread ratio and not even edible.  Spoke to &#34;Chris&#34; who was less than accommodating and after he pulled up the order, realized it was wrong and blurted out &#34;Well do you want us to bring you another one or is that one okay?&#34;.  SERIOUSLY?!?  Would I have called if I was going to eat it and deal with it-NO!  We deal with mistakes, it happens, but after his attitude, I requested a new sandwich be made and delivered to which Chris&#39; response was &#34;make sure you give the other sandwich back to the driver and I&#39;ll have one right out to you.&#34;  Fair enough as we live 2 miles away...

8pm comes around and I call back, young girl answering the phone who has no idea what I&#39;m even talking about and asks me to hold on so she can find out where my sandwich is.  My girlfriend had long eaten her philly by then as I didn&#39;t want to make her wait and we truly thought it would take a short time to get my correct sandwich.  WRONG.  The girl gets back on the phone and tells us the order was already on its way.  Remember...2 miles away.   She said &#34;we are giving you a $10 coupon to use&#34;.  After I tell her I expect my money back as it had now been ANOTHER hour since my sandwich was going to be &#34;right out to us&#34;, she went silent and &#34;Chris&#34; came on the line.  &#34;Chris&#34; became very unprofessional after I questioned why my order was taking longer than the original one did and stated, &#34;I don&#39;t have time to argue with you, I have a lot of customer&#39;s food on the grill and we are busy.&#34;  I was also told, &#34;yours was the first one cooked after we messed up before these so we are behind and I don&#39;t have time to talk.&#34;  REALLY?  My ham sub put you behind?  It&#39;s a ham sub, enough said.  

So....I was then told it had already left the premises and the driver should be arriving while we were on the phone.  NOPE!  8:35pm the driver arrives, 2 hours after the original order, 1 hour and 20 minutes after the call requesting a new sandwich and 35 minutes after we were told by multiple people that &#34;it was already on the way&#34;.  Needless to say, the sandwich was not accepted for fear of what was done to it, seeing as it probably hadn&#39;t even be made until a few minutes before it finally arrived.  My attempt to get a manager&#39;s name was met with &#34;I don&#39;t feel comfortable giving that information out to you&#34; multiple times and &#34;you can just come in and ask to speak to the manager&#34;.  

By the professionalism of the staff, it&#39;s no wonder they are having problems again.  My original review a few years ago talked about how well they had turned it around but the past several months have shown that even Gordon Ramsay couldn&#39;t fix this place."

I swear I had a menu for this place, but I couldn&#39;t find it!  I called the restaurant and asked if they had a menu on line?  The man on the phone was very helpful and polite.  He gave me the link and I told him I&#39;d call back.

The menu has a coupon for a $6.99 12&#34; philly!  Score!  I called them right back and ordered a mushroom philly with extra cheese and a can of Coke.  I barely hit the $10 minimum for delivery by about a quarter ;)  I was told on the phone that you never have to present the coupons on line.  You just need to tell them over the phone and you can use them over and over again.... SCORE!

I was told it would be about 45-50 minutes.  My food showed up in 30 minutes.  Yet another score!  When I brought the bag downstairs, it was super soggy and dripping... ewww.  The paper around my sandwich was so soggy that it had ripped.  Either that was some super sloppy meat, or it sat in the bag a real long time before it got to my door.  It did taste pretty good, but it was missing something.  I couldn&#39;t quite pinpoint it, but it was missing some seasoning.

Anyway, I downed the whole thing.  I can&#39;t believe I did it!  Slightly mad at myself this morning for eating that much last night, but it was a good end to a lazy Sunday.  Overall, a strong 3 stars.  I would have given it 4, but the under seasoned meat and the sandwich being so soggy that part of the bread was ruined and the paper wrapping was falling off (it also made a mess of my coffee table).  I will totally order from this place again in hope of a less soggy sandwich next time."

Not the worst sandwich around, but certainly not the best. I used to go here quite a bit but then I moved and didn&#39;t go for about 6 months. When I went back, I was quite disappointed at the drop off in quality.
However, that is not why I am writing this review. I recently decided to try it one more time. I called and ordered 3 sandwiches, 2 cheese steaks and one Italian hoagie with no mayo, oil on the side.  When I arrived, i paid with my debit card. She runs the card and hands me the receipt to sign, and it is for the amount of $2.72. Not wanting her to get in trouble, I notified her of her mistake. Instead of cancelling the transaction and re-doing it, she does the math and runs my card a 2nd time to collect the balance ($24.80). I thought this was weird but I let it go.
When I get home. the steaks were correct, but they gave me a club Italian that was loaded with mayo, instead of the regular Italian. I immediately called to speak to the manager. I requested he comp me the club Italian and call it even. He refused, saying it is against their policy to refund the money. My choices were to come back to pick up the right sandwich or they would send me coupons.

What kind of business has a policy that no matter what they do wrong, you can not have your money back??? I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing. Pathetic!!!

I chose the coupons as I was no longer close to the business. Needless to say, 3 weeks later and I have not received a coupon from them, nor would I use it if they had sent it.

This place is a joke."

Here&#39;s my reasoning on getting a person&#39;s order wrong- When you go to a store and buy something, you are agreeing to give your hard earned money in exchange for the product you are asking for and nothing else. If the product that is delivered is not what you ordered, they should have to fix it and for the trouble caused, should offer compensation for that or the next transaction to keep you coming back. Now I&#39;ll explain what happened. We ordered 3 &#34;The Works&#34; subs, 2 of those were ordered with mayo, pickles and banana peppers and one with &#34;a seriously large amount of pickles&#34;, mayo and no cheese. The guy told me the total, that it would be about an hour and 15 for delivery and hung up. They got here in about 40 minutes. Yay! When we opened up the sandwiches though, there were no peppers, mayo or pickles that we could see on the first 2 and the 3rd also appeared to have been missing pickles. Not THAT big of a deal, but still this is not the way we ordered them, not what we agreed to pay for. So I called to tell them they had made a mistake. They kept hanging up on me after asking me to hold and acting like they couldn&#39;t hear me. I finally was able to speak with an employee who couldn&#39;t have cared less, told me a manager had made our sammies, so they must have been made right and wanted to just pick up the sandwiches and give us a refund, leaving us waiting for them to pick up and then having to start over figuring out what to eat. Who wins with this solution? Then he tells me they are out of banana peppers and that they had told me that. So I asked him, why would I be calling to complain if you told me?? He said that he didn&#39;t know. All I really wanted was a decent apology and maybe a coupon for next time or to send out sides of what they failed to give us in the 1st place! So I for a manager. They hung up on me. I called back, AGAIN!! At this point, I was pissed and wanted to get someone to give a crap that they screwed up. The manager finally came on, said he made the sandwiches and knew they were right. I went and pulled my entire 12 inch sub apart, the one that was supposed to have triple pickles and found 3 1/4 pickles on the WHOLE thing!! I ordered no cheese and at .30 a slice, I think it was a fair trade. The other 2 subs had a total of 4 pickles on 24&#34; of sub. They basically called me a liar several times and only after 11 phone calls did they offer to remake the sandwiches. I didn&#39;t want anything but an apology by then though, just admit you made a mistake and quit acting like it was me! My husband already ate his and my kids were eating as well after adding our own condiments. At this point though, they had been extremely rude, ungracious and unprofessional, so I stated that I was worried that they would just spit in it and I didn&#39;t want a remake. The MANAGER acted like this was unheard of, that THEY would NEVER do anything like that (after everything you just did and said? Really?) He said that &#34;I&#34; was being disrespectful and HUNG UP ON ME!!!! WHAT?? Hahahaha!! That&#39;s pretty funny. I called one more time to mention how ironic this was for a total of 12 calls and that I would be posting about this. They told me to email the owner, but I don&#39;t want my money back and I won&#39;t do business with them again, so what&#39;s the point? If I can just get other people to not go there and I will tell LOTS of people, that will be payment enough for me. :)"

My only other points of comparison are cheesesteaks from a local bar near our old house (big, chunky steak cubes adhered into a tube via a surprisingly pliant provolone) and Pat&#39;s.  Taste of Philly handily beats both of them.

Extra points are scored for wrapping only the top of the philly in foil, rather than the whole sandwich.  The greasy delicious stuff is held in place and the paper wrapping keeps anything that does get by the foil from ruining the rest of the sandwich.

The other two-thirds of the menu (hoagies/grinders and wraps) are delightful as well.  The Italian is straightforward and, when loaded, uber-tasty.  The bread is heavy enough to withstand a vinegar and oil onslaught, but still soft enough that I devour every last bit of the sandwich.

And that&#39;s probably what I like most about this place - it doesn&#39;t screw around with a formula that works.  I call ahead because it can take a bit to get the order made (and I know this will sound weird to most) and because I don&#39;t have any trouble understanding the guys who answer the phone.  It&#39;s easy, fast and, best of all, reliably delicious."

After a few days of digestion i&#39;m now ready to put Taste of Philly into perspective.

First off the sandwiches were great. Much like my thoughts about Chester&#39;s, a little salt would have kicked this thing up a notch or two.

Otherwise very good for what I now know is a chain although I couldn&#39;t tell from taking a look around. They certainly did a good job of importing that cluttered, greasy spoon atmosphere. Definitely feels authentic so that&#39;s a good thing. 

Very busy place on a weekend night so be prepared for a little bit of a wait to order. 

No French fries. That really bugged me for some reason. I really felt like fries would have complemented things here well."

I am pretty picky about cheese steaks since I can&#39;t stand onions and I am allergic to mushrooms. So I usually tend to steer clear. This places is pretty good. Sandwiches are pretty greasy, but isn&#39;t that the point of a Philly Cheese? One thing I would recommend...stick to what&#39;s on the menu. If you ask for modifications, they get it right about 50% of the time. I always double check my sammy before I leave.

The floor is this place is oddly slick, so be careful when you walk in. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a waxy floor or if it&#39;s just grease everywhere (*gag*). The staff there is kinda grungy...so you have to kind of put it out of your mind when you walk in there. But they are friendly.

Oh and they have Tasty Cakes here. Butterscotch are the best.

I will go back, cause I think it&#39;s tasty."

I have been going to this location since I found out about it last year, and they haven&#39;t disappointed me.  My son loves it as well, and even wanted his last birthday there.

I read a couple of the past reviews, and noticed some said the people who worked there were less than desirable, but I have had pretty decent experiences.  Today I was there, and they were all super friendly.

The food came out fast and correct (we ordered ours with no onions).  It was nice and hot, and wonderfully tasty.  The steaks were chopped to perfection, and the cheese was melted almost to invisibility, but I like that... it is almost evenly distributed through the cheesesteak then, and I think that makes it fabulous.  I LOVE the bread they use, too!  The only complaint I could possibly have would be that it could use some salt, but that is easily remedied by just adding salt myself, and for people who don&#39;t like salt, this would probably be a good thing!

This review is strictly for the Philly cheese steaks served here.  It&#39;s a nice, clean shop, with good service, a good selection of sandwiches, and reasonable prices.  I&#39;m not knocking the shop in general.

The amount of grilled steak in the sandwich was a little light, compared to my favorite sandwich shops (Denver Ted&#39;s, Pat&#39;s and Lenny&#39;s).  It was dry and less flavorful by comparison.  The onions weren&#39;t grilled.  Onions in a proper cheese steak are thinly sliced and sautéed &#39;til they&#39;re soft and slightly brown before they get mixed into the beef.  These were chopped and still crunchy.  Also, there wasn&#39;t nearly enough provolone on it.  I know it was there, because I could see bits if it here and there, but I couldn&#39;t taste it.  Probably overpowered by the nearly raw onions.

I&#39;ll give it another try the next time I&#39;m in that part of town, but not for the cheese steak.  Maybe they&#39;ll do better with an Italian hoagie."

I have eaten at all the cheesesteak places in the area and ToP puts more meat on than the others do.  It is a much better sandwich than the one at South Philly.  Their sandwich is much drier.  My biggest complaint is that this location is filthy and the employees have a very low standard for personal hygiene.

And the new must try menu item that&#39;s being advertised up front I can&#39;t order because they don&#39;t have that either. They forgot to bring out our soup and when we asked for an extra plate and some napkins the waitress just walked away while shouting ya from across the restaurant. They never brought the extra plate, they didn&#39;t split the bill like we asked at the beginning of the order. And once we did pay, they came back and told us they charged us wrong and now we need to pay them more money. On top of the fact that the waitress then got into an argument with my sister.

The restaurant&#39;s rather laconic name belies the wealth of Chinese culinary delights offered within its doors.

It would be a bit silly to review a place called &#34;Tea Station&#34; without mentioning their renowned range of beverages. From almond to green-tea to honey to taro to cookies-n-cream, there&#39;s a flavor for every palate - and that&#39;s even before the addition of boba (tapioca balls) or fruit-flavored jellies. But honestly, the eatery has so much more to offer. Take, for example, the salt-and-pepper chicken wings which are always juicy and perfectly seasoned. Another idea to consider are the pork dumplings colloquially called &#34;pot stickers&#34; or Jiaozi (available either steamed or fried). Perhaps a cup of creamy egg-drop soup is in your future instead? But these bountiful beginnings will seem like a mere trifle (no, not the sweet kind) when your primary plate is plopped in front of you.

Despite what you may think, &#34;lobster sauce&#34; in fact contains no lobster; it&#39;s thusly named because the velvet-smooth white sauce (generally made from eggs, chicken stock and cornstarch) bears similarities to certain seafood sauces from Traditional Chinese cuisines. But this disparity doesn&#39;t make Tea Station&#39;s offering of plump shrimp, peas, carrots and the sauce in question any less tasty. Alternatively, if you really want to get those tastebuds a-talkin&#39;, you&#39;re sure to enjoy every nibble of Sweet &amp; Spicy Peppered Beef. Of course, there&#39;s also curry chicken, sesame pork, and so forth, plus their Happy Hour menu of assorted fried numnums - and they&#39;re even introducing a few Vietnamese items soon! So stop by, won&#39;t you?"

Most places either do not change that much, or it is very gradual over considerable time.  My experiences today made me feel that an update was warranted.  I am taking away two stars from my previous review.

The first star removal is due to food quality.  It just was not as good as on my previous visit.  I am not sure if the cook is new, or if it is just luck of the draw on the dishes I ordered last time versus this time.  The hot and sour soup had okay flavor this time.  However, it was so heavily corn-starched as to almost be gelatinous enough to stand a spoon up in.  The egg roll had an oddly squishy center (and no sauces were brought out with it).  The beef and snow peas dish was sub-par.  The brown sauce heavily coating the meat was as thick as ketchup and was significantly over-salted.  The portion size was decent, and the &#34;fried&#34; rice on the side was fair.

The second star removal is due to not honoring the 25% off of your bill with Yelp check-in special.  I showed this to the server when I first sat down at the table and indicated I would be using it.  After the meal was over, and she was bringing out the checks, I reminded her of this.  She went in the back, came out a few minutes later, and said, &#34;The manager said this deal has expired.&#34;  I pointed out that there was no expiration date on it, and pulled up the offer to show her.  She asked, then took my phone in back to show the manager.  She returned a few minutes later and said &#34;sorry&#34;.  She asked if I wanted to speak to the manager, so I did.  He said, &#34;We have been meaning to take that offer down, but have not gotten around to it.&#34;  He did not honor the offer and did not seem especially apologetic about it.

Other than the issues mentioned above, the service was good."

The Boba Drink cost was $3.79.  That was the smallest cup that Tea Station Chinese Cuisine had to offer.

We waited like about 5 minutes or so.  Maybe would return for Dinner and see how things might differ.  Though I cannot deny, its more like &#34;Americanize-Chinese&#34; food when I did get the chance to glance thru the Menu...

It&#39;s nice to go to a restaurant where they aren&#39;t just using the same two sauces for everything. You can get the lunch deal for dinner. Good service. It&#39;s never been busy when I have gone there- they do have takeout and delivery. Seating area is a good size with a variety of booths and tables that aren&#39;t packed in.

The best part about this place is that you can customize your drink. Typically at most restaurant who serves Boba, especially Pho restaurants, Boba drinks are smoothie/snow-like, but here at Tea Station, you can order it in other version like ice tea or milk tea."

This particular area is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, what with the goldmine of delicious foods scattered throughout!  From pizza to tacos and now to beef and broccoli...

Tea Station is a great little restaurant located near Hobby Lobby.  They offer plenty of seating, so don&#39;t worry about beating a lunch rush here.  Quite extensive menu with plenty of options to satisfy a large group.  Not to mention awesome prices!  My favorite Chinese dish, beef and broccoli, was $6.95 for a small, which holy cow, was still too much for me to eat in one sitting!  Fresh and super tasty, Tea Station will now be my go-to for Chinese food in the area for lunch.  Aside from my awesome beef and broccoli, everyone else from the East Side Crew seemed to enjoy their dishes as well:  clean plates and to-go boxes all around!

So why the 3 stars?  Mainly, the service.  It was just off on our visit.  The restaurant wasn&#39;t too busy aside from our table of five, but at least two or three orders were incorrect or missing something.  And when we asked for separate checks, we were given one check at the end of the meal, which took another 10-15 minutes to split up.  Deal breakers?  Definitely not.  Perhaps this was simply an off day or a new server or cook in the back.

While the service was a bit of a fright during our visit, the delicious food Tea Station is serving up is certainly enough for me to make a return visit soon.  And next time, I&#39;ve got to try one of the many bobas offered!  Super yum!"

I tried the chow mein that came with fried rice and I couldn&#39;t finish it because it wasn&#39;t very tasty. The rice lacked flavor and felt stale and the chow mein also lacked flavor. I tried a mango milk tea which was tasty but was made with a powder that has a pretty artificial flavor. 

I even gave this place a 2nd try that same night when I came back and got a yogurt frost. It was made with a powder yogurt flavor rather than real yogurt. It tasted very artificial and sweet.

So, my excitement was sadly replaced by disappointment. I would come here only if this was the only milk tea option in the city."

Additionally their Boba drinks (which they deliver!) - are great! The Passion Fruit slush is by far my favorite. 

It pains me to say that their food gets one star because I was so sad that my highly anticipated Chinese dinner was a total letdown.

The food is super bland - even the sweet and sour sauce is neither sweet or sour, it&#39;s simply a murky dark pink gel you apply to whatever dish you are eating that needs it, it mostly serves to soften the sharp edges of whatever fried item you are eating.

The egg rolls have an almost pureed cabbage fill that doesn&#39;t do anything to delight your taste buds - even the usually pleasing deep fried shell isn&#39;t enough to save it. Eating this eggroll forced me have a moment to regret the calories I had just consumed.

The crab cheese wontons looked promising - but then I ate one. &#34;Was that canned cubed carrot I just ate?&#34; is something that has never crossed my mind when eating a wonton. The filling seems to be cream cheese and cubed carrot from the taste of it - I tried salvaging it by dunking it in the sweet nor sour sauce, it was a futile attempt. 

I opened the Lo Mein and saw spaghetti noodles covered with sauce. I will say that despite the noodles, it was GOOD - the beef was tender and flavorful, the sauce was amazing, but the noodles weren&#39;t those big, fat flavor absorbing noodles.

I like the employees of this place - they are good folks. I love their Boba... but the food, THE FOOD! I wanted so much to love it, but I couldnt. Even the next day, when I got to attack the leftovers - I was reminded of my disappointment. I&#39;m actually bummed out that the food wasn&#39;t great, because I like Tea Station as a business. I hope other people like it more than I did/do."

I&#39;ve tried many bobba at pho restaurants but they weren&#39;t as good. They would always have the bobba be super warm like it just came off the pot or something..and I hated how too soft it was!

Anyways, I read on yelp a couple weeks ago about Tea Station, because I was desperate as to finding a delicious bobba shop. So last week I decided to stop by and try the bobba that everyone on here has been raving about, and I have to say man, you guys are right! The bobba here is delicious. I got the green tea bobba and my sister got the mango bobba. The girl at the counter was very nice and at $3.50 for a large bobba, I thought the price was fair and good. When I took the first sip of the bobba juice immediately I fell in love. It was delicious! I felt like for months I have been missing out on delicious bobba juice and finally I found the place! The bobba was cooked to perfection. It wasn&#39;t too hard or too soft. Just enough firmness for me to bite on them a little but also soft enough to swallow so I don&#39;t choke on them hahaha. :P. The green tea tasted like green tea which was lovely.

I was also hungry so I looked at the 5 dollar menu and got myself Mongolian Chicken. I tried it and it was alright. They gave me a lot of food for 5 bucks so that was great. I can&#39;t wait to try more of their food and bobba flavors. I love this place so much already, that I came back twice :) and my sister got the lychee flavor, which tasted like real lychee! and it was lovely!

I will come back to this place again for bobba :)"

For some reason (even if most places use it) I don&#39;t like watching my tea be made with various random powders.  They have powdered everything here.  The boba came out of a big plastic tub, it was over cooked and it had bits of jelly in it that were not boba.  I could overlook one, but my drink consisted of 1/10 jelly bits.  I got one per sip.  Seeing as they were fruity flavored this really ruined my milk tea.

I won&#39;t come here again and I&#39;d rate 0 stars if it were possible.  Hands down worst bubble tea ever."

Actually perhaps I had one vegetable dish here that was pretty decent (fresh tasting from my vague memory) but the bubble tea is great. Its 150% better than the Lollicup on Colorado Blvd even though they still make it with powdered mixes. Its all about the balls my friend. Those tapioca balls are very smartly sweetened.

I completely forgot about them (my usual boba-fix is the Lollicup on Colorado) until last week when a friend said we should check it out.  The menu has plenty of standard Chinese restaurant entrees and noodles.  A big plus is the SIZE option, since I don&#39;t always want to be eating the same Chinese food for 3 days... so the ability to get a smaller portion is great.  The combo option (a mid-sized portion) comes with tons of rice and an eggroll.  ... and I still made 3 meals out of it.

The atmosphere is typical Chinese Restaurant, but I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s too relaxing with blenders running up front.  We took our food to-go.  Blender-noise is one of the unavoidable pet-peeves of the Trendy Drink market...

They have a solid boba-drink menu, with the typical Milk Teas, Slushes, and Snows.  I was excited (as usual) by the green tea, which wasn&#39;t too sweet.  I&#39;ve tried a few of the fruity slush options, which are also tasty.  The bobas themselves are softer than most you&#39;ll find in Denver.

The milk tea is always flavored with the right amount of sweetness, and the qualities are always the same. This is surprising to me, because some of other more famous boba tea places on Colorado Blvd. still has altering qualities of milk tea depending on who makes it, but this place does not have the problem. I also like the fact that they make the drinks right in front of me, instead of being pre-made and not knowing if the drinks had sat there for hours or days....It&#39;s as if my drink is more individualized for me!

I was looking for an authentic Mexican meal that is not your usual flare.  I chose this place because they have tongue and tripe tacos.  And now I can&#39;t get enough of this place!  So far I head tried the tongue, tripe, chicharon rojo, head, lamb, carnitas, cheek, and even the shrimp cocktail.  I will say that I can do without the cocktail but all the tacos taste so good!  Each bite is full of flavor.  Some meats are crispy, and some just melt in your mouth.  My goal is to eventually try all of them.  They do serve other things like the sandwiches, and burritos.  But I won&#39;t get to those until I am done with the taco list. 
Service is also good, they do speak English so that&#39;s a plus.  They also have a salsa/fresh greens bar.  It isn&#39;t much but good enough.  The price is also pretty cheap at around $2/taco.

We stopped by this place based on the reviews. All in all it&#39;s good, but not blow your mind great. The menudo was INSANELY hot, temperature wise, to the point where we were putting ice cubes just to be able to eat at a reasonable pace. It was mainly tripe, with not much hominy.

My choice was chili rellenos and a strawberry agua fresca. The rellenos were served piping hot and with corn tortillas on the side. I made tacos out of them and added some of their amazing salsa from the bar. The beans were good but not amazing. 

To go I took a carnitas torta for my husband. He really enjoyed the flavors but thought the meat to bread ratio was a little disproportionate. 

If we lived closer we would be regulars for sure."

I HEART TACOS, The Ultimate Taco Tour.  Saturday February 22nd 2014.  Arrived at this establishment at about 14:00hrs ish.  We went in-line to order our tacos.  Man at that hour, this establishment is jam packed, aka packed to the Brim.  Hmmm...

Yes, the kitchen was INDEED SWAMPED!  The wait indeed took F.O.R.E.V.E.R!  Was the wait worth, waiting for???....  Hmmm...  Hence I am indeed torn about this establishment.  From this establishment, I opt to have the following Tacos :

*  Tripa ($2.00)
*  Lengua ($2.00)
*  Cabeza ($2.00)

With tax, my Tacos order was $6.51.  My order # was Order # 80.

Yes, you get all your condiments, such as Lime, Cilantro, Dice Raw Onions, Radishes and Salsas from the Salsas Bar that they have.  The lovely lady who also runs the behind the counter and at times even send the food to our table, her name is Luis.  While ordering, Luis asked me how I want my Tripa order to be done, I told her &#34;Crunchy&#34;.

While waiting, I see that one of the Main servers, or staff kept on replenishing the Salsa bar.  That is good in my books.

I received my order at 14:38hrs ish.  I like my order of Tripa the Best at this establishment coz they made it so crunchy, I like it a lot!  Hmm, the Cabeza comes as some what shredded meat that I cannot identify.  Hmmm, I wonder if they got my order wrong.  I whispered silently in my heart.  But since I am NOW already more starving, I just ate what I got.  As for the Lengua, it was just A-Okay.

Maybe due to the &#34;AFTER Lunch Rush&#34;, this place gets &#34;overwhelmed&#34; and some orders were mixed up.  So definitely ask for your receipt when ordering, and keep that receipt, so the servers can double check aka identify, who ordered what etc etc.   I might return again to this establishment and see how it might differ if I were to go with Hubs.  Furthermore, I am eyeing the Ice Cream Parlor next door and I am intrigued what they might offer in the future.

In conclusion, I think I prefer the Hampden Location better maybe for one, when I was there, it was NOT that Chaotic.  Furthermore, the Hampden Location, the dining area is spacious and NOT as cramped, and the parking lot outside is way bigger as compared to this location.

For this establishment, overall I rate it as 3.5 stars.

To start out as soon as I came in thought the prices seemed little high compared to other restaurants; I don&#39;t mind paying or waiting f the taste makes up for it. I ordered 4 tacos to sample, one was suadero, barbacoa, lengua and cabeza. At first I thought the lengua was little cold, bland and hard to chew. After the 3rd tacos I realiezed that my first tacos was either cabeza or suadero which should not been an issue distinguishing. (not sure what happened there). I would say the Lengua was one of their best tacos I would give it a 3.5-4 stars. The barbacoa was also not bad but I would give it a 3.5 max. Now the other two tacos which ever one or the other was, think  the cabeza was the more grinded meat and 3rd taste wise. Didn&#39;t taste like I was expecting. The worst if i&#39;m not mistaken was chopped in chunks like many places dice lengua..must of been the suadero. Was really bland and not fully warmed/heated. I was expecting much more being that the menu and restaurant seemed clean and well organized. Sometime it&#39;s better to focus on fewer items. It was also not busy either."

At first glance the plate could have been presented better, the burrito barely had any chile on it and the cheese wasn&#39;t melted but hey I had an open mind and jumped in, the cubed steak was pretty good and juicy, but the burrito could have been hotter temperature wise, my girlfriends enchiladas were having the same problem, they could have been hotter. I feel if they were hotter it would be a 5 star restaurant because this place was clean and friendly, horchata was good too.

Overall, it wasn&#39;t the fresh well-prepared tacos I was expecting, but it was delicious. Plus, it&#39;s hard to compare when you don&#39;t have the local context in perspective. I asked the cashier what three she liked best, and ended up with the taco al pastor, chicharron verde, and one more I didn&#39;t catch the name of. Each were $2, and all three were equally tasty.  

They had a salsa bar, which I always love. Two salsas, red and white onions, cilantro, cabbage, radishes, cucumber, lime wedges, and cooked veggies.

We went closer to 7:30ish on a Monday night, so the place wasn&#39;t busy at all. Seemed like plenty of seating inside, with an addition next door that sold desserts.

I was the only haole in the place, which is always a good sign.  

Their salsa bar is a little skimpy, with only two salsas--one green, one red, both yummy--cilantro, raw and sauteed onions, and some whole peppers, but there were cups and lids and I helped myself to a bunch of the red salsa.

I tried a little of everything:  

I started with chips and salsa:  Made fresh on site and quite yummy.  Both salsas were spicy enough to make me blow my nose a few times, and I LOVE spicy food.

The Chile Relleno Burrito, smothered:  This is huge and heavenly!  The green chile is so good, with big chunks of pork and just the right amount of heat.  The crunch on the relleno did not overpower the dish, and they topped the burrito with a little fresh cream. 

Three tacos:  The Barbacoa de Borrego, the Chicken Mole, and the Carnitas.  All were superb!  Two tortillas each with HUGE portions of meat on each one.  The Borrego (lamb) wasn&#39;t even remotely gamey, the Mole was the perfect mix of spice and sweet but not drowning in it, and the Carnitas was tender and flavorful.

Two cheese enchiladas a la carte:  Unfortunately, they got this part of the order wrong:  I had asked for cheese only, no chicken, and instead I got chicken only, no cheese.  And despite this rather large mistake, they are still DELICIOUS.  Yes, that&#39;s how good this place is.

I ate my chips and salsa and enjoyed a Mexican Coke while waiting for my food to be prepared.  Just as I sat down, two men walked in with guitars and began playing and singing.  What a treat!  

I&#39;m so happy to have found this place.  Please, don&#39;t tell anyone about it.  I don&#39;t want it to get ruined with fame.  It will be our little secret, ok?"

We were supposed to try Tacos Y Salsas as stop number 3 but they were slammed, so we went to our final stop and overwhelmed El Trompito instead. 

There was plenty of room, but apparently having so many orders all at once rather boggled the staff. People were being brought the wrong orders and very often couldn&#39;t identify what the tacos were supposed to look like so ate the wrong things. That may have happened to us in one instance; our suadero taco looked much more like carnitas than suadero. It was delicious though, so no complaints. The chuleta taco was excellent; little chunks of salted grilled pork. The barbacoa de borrego (lamb) was outstanding. 

It&#39;s a good idea to keep your sales slip so the waitress can maybe figure out if you have the right order. The numbered delivery system is very hit-and-miss when it&#39;s crowded. Our friend ordered three tacos and got two, neither of them hers. We pointed this out several times, and she finally got what she had ordered.

I ordered a taco de chicharron verde and another one rojo (chicharrones with green or red sauce). The chicharrones were the crispy kind, but then they were stewed in the sauce; I had hoped the sauce would be spooned over crispiness. Oh well. I didn&#39;t much care for the texture but was glad I had tried them. 

This was my favorite stop. In addition to good food, it feels like a place of the people, a place with spirit. An excellent and varied menu has us dreaming over what we&#39;ll order next time we go. Bonus: the attached fruit-and-ice cream bar in the next room. Son had pumpkin ice cream and chocolate amaretto almond - oh my, smooth and delicious, great combination of flavors, so good!"

When we got there, we were the only ones. We ordered and sat down. About 2 minutes after we sat down, four other families came in. 5 minutes later, they all started getting their food, as well as menudo soup, which we also ordered. By this time, we have not even received our drinks. Horrible customer service. The waitress was handing out treats to the little kids of the Hispanic families, but did not even acknowledged us. 

Finally 15 minutes after everyone else received their food, we got our drinks. The horchata was ok, but the mango was grossly watered down so I only tasted the sugar. 

When our food finally arrived, I had to question why this place has such a high rating. The food had absolutely no flavor, with the exception of my son&#39;s lamb shank, which was decent. My husband said his gordita was hard like it was made from old dough. My chile rellenos were bland. The menudo soup was watery with no flavors, even when we added thyme, lime juice, and pepper flakes. 

This is not home cooking, not even close. This is commercialized, all about the profit, restaurant. Everything tasted like it was from a can. 

Horrible customer service, especially to those who cannot speak spanish, and nasty food. Will not be returning."

Interior is quite large and clean. Came at the lunch rush, with only two women working. Waited about 40 minutes total for my food, they just needed more staff. That, and they make everything absolutely fresh. 

I got the Burrito Supreme, which came with a green chili smothered burrito and chips. Very very tasty! Chips were home made and the burrito was fantastic! The staff was friendly as well and apologized for the wait. 

I&#39;m a little conflicted, on the one hand the food was fantastic, but the wait was quite long. I&#39;ll have to try again and hope the wait was a unique experience."

          food: 4 dinner plates and soft drinks
          Staff: very nice
cleanliness: clean
          price: overpriced
food quality: overall, average to above average

Went to this with some friends because of the high ratings.  We had 4 dinner plates.  Carne asada and the chicken mole.  My friends liked the carne asada and I thought the mole was about average quality. The pieces of chicken were tiny and the sauce didn&#39;t taste that fresh. Although, my friends did like the carne asada plates. We also liked the salsa bar. We all did agree that to pay over $ 50.00 for 4 people, for this meal was too pricey.  Now if the hype would have corresponded with reality, then......maybe it would have been worth it. 

I gave it 2 1/2 stars, my friends 3 stars."

My husband disagrees with me here, because his beef tongue taco (ew!) was stellar, he said. I had the enchiladas suizas, however, and they were bland and uninteresting. Our companion had a burrito and it was just okay. 

Taqueria el Trompito has an extensive menu and I mean exTENSIVE. It also isn&#39;t on the cheap end ... though it&#39;s affordable enough. Service was kind of slow on the entrees --- which were delivered separately. Our dessert wasn&#39;t even served at all -- we had to ask TWICE for it. And it was bad (pineapple upside down cake).

I had a tasty lamb shank, (falling off the bone, so the steak knife they provided was totally unnecessary), covered in a spicy reddish-brown sauce with roasted chunks of cactus. Yum! With a side of rice &#39;n&#39; beans, about $10.50.

Don&#39;t be afraid, El Trompito&#39;s Borrego doesn&#39;t taste overly gamy, neither is cooked forever losing its own distinct textures, aromas and taste. Surprisingly, tacos de pancita de Borrego tasted pretty good, and texture was interesting, good interesting though, will order that next time for sure. These are the tacos we&#39;ve ordered:

Tacos al Albañil
Tacos de Borrego
Tacos de Cabeza
Tacos de Pastor
Tacos de Mole
Tacos de Pancita de Borrego
Tacos de Lengua
Tacos de Suadero
Tacos de Carne Assada
Tacos al Pastor
Tacos de Barbacoa
Tacos de Carnitas

They also have a salsa bar, which is not just the salsa bar you&#39;re used to... They have all freshly chopped herbs, toppings, cucumbers, pickles, and even nopales!

Portions are decent, double small corn tortillas, topped with meat of choice. Besides tacos, they serve a vast array of tortas, taquitos, burritos, Mexican plates, Mexican breakfast plates, made from scratch aguas frescas to horchata, fridge filled all Mexican sodas, canned juices, and a rainbow Fanta flavors...

Thinking this place is awesome already?! Well, next to the taqueria/restaurant side, you&#39;ll find a modern, totally different décor from next door, an ice cream parlor, with waffle cones found at any upper scale ice cream shop, an extended variety of toppings, and very interesting flavors; from American favorites to Mexican favorites...

Otherwise, you will love the huge menu and you&#39;ll be wanting to come back to try other items you saw that you couldn&#39;t get this time. My husband always orders one of their Lengua tacos along with one of the many selections, and has also ordered their menudo before. Always hits the spot, and he&#39;s Mexican by the way.

I am a burrito gal, and they have one of the tastiest burritos that I doubt I&#39;ll find anywhere else. It&#39;s a Chile Relleno Burrito, and I ask for it smothered in green chile for the extra $1. It&#39;s just spicy enough and the burrito is big, I usually finish up to 3/4 of it and take the rest to go, because I WILL be snacking on it later.

The traditional salsa bar is nice. Food is ready relatively quickly and they bring it out to your table. Diners in this hole-in-the-wall location are usually hispanic and they have Telanovelas playing on the tv during the day. They have some desserts, but my recommendation is to walk next door (there is an open archway from inside) to get some homemade ice cream."

We ate here 2 nights in a row, partly because we were starving both nights and lost track of time and secondly, we wondered if the first time was too good to be true.  
Previous reviews saying the menu is in spanish is in my opinion a little misleading or they have changed it.  There are translations, and heck, its mexican food with a picture menu on the wall if you want.  The order taker behind the counter also spoke excellent english.
The smothered burrito is huge and great as was everything else we ordered.  We concluded we could probably order that and split it.  The chips that come with an order of chips are thick, and amazing.

Until we ate at this restaurant, we thought we could only get such wonderful Mexican food in Mexico!!!  OMG - we felt like we were sitting in a restaurant down in San Felipe!!  The menu is extensive and the food couldn&#39;t taste any better.  My wife had the three Flautas with fresh guacamole (they were big PACKED with meat!!) and I had chicken enchiladas which were the best I have ever had north of the border!!  The dining area is big, but certainly not high-end, and the staff were prompt and courteous, making sure we were taken care of.  The best part to us is that they had bottles of the REAL Coca-Cola and Fanta, not the U.S. versions (much better tasting).  This restaurant was a bit of a trek for us, but well worth the trip.  We will be back again and again!"

So good, and so many choices, you really can&#39;t go wrong here. Unless you don&#39;t like Mexican food. Even then, I bet you&#39;d like their Tortas."

We were in town for business for 5 days and from the spot on rave reviews on Yelp,  made it in here for dinner on the second night and it was so good, we made it back for lunch 2 of the next 3 days.  
At least one of us got the excellent pollo asado plate every day.   The chicken mole was delicious, if not a little messy for take out.  The soft tacos were just tacos with nicely seasoned meat, which required a quick trip to the bar with seasoned onions, cilantro, cucumbers, etc. as well as a super flavorful guacamole and red salsa (didn&#39;t try as the guac was awesome).  The first night, one of us also ordered a great chicken dish with small pieces of cactus (i think).  
Service is as good as a busy, perhaps overworked staff can give, feels like a busy cantina in Guadalajara, with great food.  Among our top 5 favorite Mexican places and we have tried at least 60, from Texas to California and in between and a definite stop anytime we are within an hour&#39;s drive of Denver."

Whatever kind of meat you want, from whatever part of the animal, they make it and they make it well. However, none of it truly compares to the awesomeness of their pollo asado. The seasonings have been perfect every time.

The tortillas are fresh and probably made at the tortillería next door, and the salsa bar has some of the best salsa my picky tongue has tasted. If you are looking for a taco-induced food coma for cheap, this is the place to go. Chase it with horchata, and nothing can go wrong with your day."

Highlights were the beet salad with steak, the smothered burrito, and the tacos (both the pork and chipotle beef).  We were less impressed with the chicken salad, which came in a taco salad bowl and was drowning in refried beans.

I really have no idea how this restaurant has so many good reviews. Because what we found was far from stellar. The service was great, but the food was some of the worst Mexican food we&#39;ve ever eaten. My girlfriend had the breakfast burrito which she barely ate. What little she did eat upset her stomach hours later. I had the chicken flautas which were bland and could only be eaten with a lot of their medium salsa on top. And speaking of salsas, the hot salsa was completely inedible and was far and away the worst salsa I&#39;ve ever tasted.

The service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I were seated promptly, but literally had to go track someone down to order drinks. The margaritas were good (served in mason jars... ugh).
The food was pretty good and came out quick but was not outstanding. It&#39;s definitely not your traditional Mexican. 

On the service: 
The bus person brought chips and salsa and water right away.
I then waited 15 minutes trying to order and went and got him. Tracked him down. I tried multiple times to get his attention. He sent a waitress over who took our drink order. We ordered food when she brought the drinks. She did not check back in with us after ordering food (i.e. we wanted another round of margaritas..) and ran away as soon as she dropped off the food. I had to track her down again to request the bill.

Food as good but I just couldn&#39;t get past the noise level and terrible service."

As a margarita fan their house margs are excellent. The rub eye meat for various dishes is tasty and tender. Chili nogada is a must try for at least someone in your group. Downside - they have been a tad inconsistent of late. When its on its superb. When not it is still excellent and authentic Mexican food. 

About that - The food is all in the style of cuisine from Puebla state. Dont come expecting Tex Mex tacos and burritos. The chef brings a lot of creativity to use of poblano peppers. This is real Mexican cuisine. Hope you enjoy as much as I do!"

We came last night for dinner and lucked out in getting a table. Friday and Saturday nights are reservation recommended, FYI which we didn&#39;t have. 

Our waitress was awesome and I put her in the tricky position of choosing what she thought was the best dish to represent the Puebla region of Mexico. She chose very well with the signature dish of Chili en Nogada. It actually sounds not great from the description with a blend of peaches, beef, walnuts, pepper and pomegranate. But when the flavors come together, it works. I didn&#39;t find it to be salty enough so I did add a little salt. 

The hubs opted for the chili verde. He thought his pork had great flavor but was a little dry. We both found the rice to have excellent flavor but was overcooked and on the mushy side. 

The chips and salsa were excellent as were the house margaritas. This is a great restaurant to expose people to other regions of Mexican cuisine that are not at all what most people think of in regards to the typical Tex Mex version we so often get."

I am glad we tried out the place and can see this in our rotation! I just saw that brunch is served on Saturdays and Sundas between 10AM-2PM, so we will be back for sure!

Food: For my meal, I chose off of the appetizer menu and selected the Tamal Casero. This was a tasty vegetarian tamale made with black-eyed peas! This was very delicious and I was a great recommendation from our server! My other half chose the Relleno de Mariscos (another spot-on suggestion) with ingredient pairings that were more inline with Pueblan-Mexican cuisine. I really enjoyed my sample of the dish and appreciated the fresh take on different flavor combinations.

Drinks: We made it just in time for Happy Hour! The House Margs were tasty and pretty strong!

Staff: Our server and the bartender were in a league of their own... super friendly and attentive! The service was a great compliment to our dining experience.

There is a patio available that will open in the spring/summer. It is currently being remodeled and looks like it could be a promising venue during patio season! I really loved the feel of the place - great ambiance, art and enjoyed the 90s music playing. 

My only constructive critique would be to suggest more vegetarian options for dinner. The chef seems creative enough to deliver a couple more vegetarian entrees. With all of the development, I am sure more pescatarians (feature another fish outside of tilapia), vegetarians and vegans will be moving into the hood.

Overall, great experience and I will be back!"

A few week ago, a guy named Custo messaged me on here to reach out and make things better after my previous review- it&#39;s always awesome when owners/managers do that &amp; I&#39;ve never had an issue doing it before. He had offered dinner on him so tonight I was going to swing by. I thought it was cool they wanted me to give them a second chance and the way to my heart is some bomb food lol.

I wanted to call my order ahead and the guy who picked up the phone had no idea who Custo was and said he had never heard of anything like that happening, but he would ask his GM. This was annoying but I figured they would figure it out. I mean I even told him I&#39;d show them the message on my phone and everything. When the employee came back on the phone he said his GM told him no. I asked if I could talk to the GM and he said &#34;hold on.&#34; I then heard this punk frat boy ask a co worker to &#34;pretend to be the GM for this girl.&#34; (!!!) when the next guy came on the phone, I called him out but in typical frat boy fashion he just thought it was hilarious. Come on if you&#39;re going to lie, lie well!!! Call me if you need lessons. really, I would&#39;ve been annoyed but understood the miscommunication situation if these alpha phi beta bros wouldn&#39;t have lied.

Needless to say, I&#39;ll never be back here. You guys suck. If you were a tv show, you would be the Duggars. If you were a politician, you would be Sara Palin.

We just ordered ceviche because we weren&#39;t impressed with the menu, and the ceviche was not fresh - super salty that gave off a bad overall taste.

To make matters worse the manager emailed my friend when she put this information in her updated Yelp review and said she shouldn&#39;t write reviews based on his &#34;young and unprofessional staff&#34;. Not only did Custo not follow up on what he said he would do but he bad mouthed his staff in the process. He called my friend unprofessional for writing the review after only trying one dish.

But after seeing the high ratings for this place and the reviews, I felt I had to write this review after our disappointing visit.. I went with a group of 8 people for drinks and dinner. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Our waitress was very nice and we were served delicious chips and salsa soon after sitting down. From that point forward, it went downhill. We all ordered drinks, and after about 30 minutes when they hadn&#39;t arrived, our waitress told us that somehow the orders didn&#39;t make it to the bar. When the drinks finally did come out, the margaritas were extremely sweet... So much so that several of us switched to beer for our next drink.

The restaurant was busy, and they just seemed very understaffed. When asked if someone had called in sick and that was why there weren&#39;t enough servers, our server very proudly stated that the place had been dead a few months ago until she had started working there, and now it was busy all the time. That&#39;s wonderful, but you need to hire more servers so people can be served in a timely manner and all the servers don&#39;t look like they&#39;re running around like crazy! 

When we finally got our food, it had taken so long that we were all full on chips and salsa. Not only that, but it was just mediocre. We got the chicken crepes, a friend got the mole, (I don&#39;t remember other plates that were served), but they were all just &#39;ok&#39;. Nothing to write home about, nothing memorable.

Overall, it was extremely overpriced for the mediocre food and drinks. Although we live in the neighborhood and were excited to have somewhere to walk to, we won&#39;t be going back."

Truly, I never have had better. Then I had a smothered beef burrito which tasted amazing. Perfect amount of cheese, rice and beef! I also ordered the coconut margarita which was spectacular.

We started with perhaps the best dish of the night: the Pozole. This was easily the best rendition of this Mexican favorite I have ever had. It was complex, smokey and delicious. We also tried the ceviche but the  Pozole was everyone&#39;s favorite.

For mains we had the chicken mole, stuffed pepper (En Nojada) and the namesake Chile Verde. All were good and popular choices. The mole tasted very authentic and the chicken breast meat came apart easily when pulled with a fork. The stuffed chili was reminiscent of a Middle Eastern dish with its ground beef, almonds and raisin filling. The Chili Verde was a bit too salty for me which was disappointing.

There were many dishes that we said we&#39;d try on our next visit so I&#39;ll be sure to update my review."

This might be the best Mexican food I&#39;ve had in Denver, and one of the best I&#39;ve had in the US period. Even in San Francisco, finding an authentic, classy Mexican restaurant is no easy feat. 

Their brunch menu was delicious. I had Chilaquiles w/ mole poblano (imported). Overall, it was great, if a tad bit expensive for the portions, but worth it for the quality.

I&#39;ll be back soon to sit on their new patio for happy hour, and looking forward to Chiles en Nogada- a Mexican classic!"

Guacamole was amazing and chunky but they don&#39;t season it with salt for the purpose of you seasoning it yourself which is nice. The chips are AMAZING! Probably the best chips I&#39;ve ever had at a mexican restaurant in Denver. Nice, crispy, warm and made in-house. Everything about the carne adada plate was spicy so if you like spicy then this dish is for you. Never had carne asada with mashed potatoes before so that part was a bit weird. Wish I had it with rice instead. The mashed potatoes also had piece did jalapeño in it which made it spicy. The plate also came with sautéed mushrooms which were delicious. 

I think the woman who rang us up overcharged though. She split our bill and it came out to $23 each, which now that I think of it means we had a $46 lunch which really doesn&#39;t make any sense when you order guacamole and two entrees. Minus one star for her lack of inaccuracy."

If you&#39;re into  wearing skinny jeans and sport a silly mustache then you&#39;ll be happy to know that they have a well stocked bar with elixirs to mix up your favorite concoction.

Could be my best new meal.   There were four lovely ladies and three of use ordered this yummy meal. The pomegranate seeds just escalated the dish. My other friend had the spicy pork and loved every bite. The chips and salsas were a good beginning

The rice was a beautiful compliment. Of course the shots if Tequila certainly didn&#39;t hurt.  Could not eat dessert maybe next time

Two things to note. There is Parking in the back but you have to be lucky.  The tables have white table cloths under the white paper.  Its lovely inside. Can&#39;t wait to go back"

Though a limited menu, I would say that it is diverse enough to appease the whole dinner party. Homemade chips and guacamole are a must! Table side guac is always an interesting experience, especially if you have your own recipe at home. The staff is very receptive to customizing however you&#39;d like. Those chips to go along with the guac are addicting! So good and homemade! On top of that, the salsas/sauces that come to the table are delicious as well. Their red sauce is rich with a tad of heat. Loved this stuff and found myself combining it with....basically everything. I ordered the chipotle shrimp dish. When it came, I was a little surprised that it was only shrimp and rice, and found myself questioning whether or not that would be enough food (and diversity of ingredients). PLENTY OF FOOD! I would have liked to see a little more color on the plate with other ingredients, but what was on the plate was delicious. 

Chili Verde is definitely more of an upscale Mexican restaurant feel. Picture eating table side guac on white tablecloths. As I mentioned, this place is a bit more pricey than your average restaurant, so be prepared to pay a bit more for your meals. All in all, Chili Verde delivers."

Did you know Pueblan Cuisine is one of the oldest and most savory regional cuisines of Mexico?  Did you know that&#39;s what&#39;s served here?  I think it&#39;s time to rid yourself of some of these questions and fill your stomach with great food and drink at the same time!

OK, it&#39;s on Federal and the area is just a little sketchy but the inside is very nicely appointed.  Table spacing is excellent and there is a fairly long bar along one wall.   My party of four was greeted warmly and had menus in our hands immediately.

We began with adult libations. I started with the house marg and it was decent for $6 but nothing special.  But then I moved up to a tequila flight. I choose the &#34;Plata&#34; for $14.  The menu says it should be three  1/2 oz. pours but that is a happy mistake!  I enjoyed three 1 1/2 oz. pours.  See my pic.  For me this was a five star flight and an excellent value!  Others in my party also said their drinks were excellent.

Chips and salsa here are exceptional.  You receive warm gluten free chips and three types of salsa ranging in heat from mild to fiery.  The entire table loved them.

For an appetizer we shared TOSTADAS DE TINGA- Three tostadas made with chipotle marinated beef and topped with lettuce, queso fresco &amp; crema for $8.  Heads up!  They were smoky and delicious and very spicy.  Prepare for some heat!  My Denver Elite daughter Jennifer B. posted some outstanding pics.

My entrée was RIB-EYE POBLANO- Rib-eye steak served on a bed of rich poblano sauce for $16. One again it was excellent and the pablano sauce packed some heat.

Throughout the evening our waiter and also the bartender were excellent so no problems with customer service.

I love small places like this and would return in a heartbeat!"

Three salsas you get to start that are all different and really good. Lots of tequilas and Margs. The skinny marg is amazing. the coconut marg is made with house made coconut fizz that&#39;s very sweet, similar to a piña colada, but really good. 

We had the choriqueso, which was large enough for 4 people to split. It wasn&#39;t your typical queso, more meat heavy, but still good. For dinner we split the poblano crepes and the relleno mariscos, both were very flavorful and filling. 

Service was friendly, welcoming and fast. This is a step above most other Mexican joints. We enjoyed it and will definitely come back."

Bartender said grab a table. Waited forever for menus. Waitress argued about the happy hour hours that were clearly listed on the freaking menu. Took forever to get food menus. Waitress let us know she was the only person after we asked. Tip: That&#39;s your first clue that you&#39;re doing a horrible job. She was clueless about multi-tasking too. Maybe just inexperienced for the job. We walked out and went to tried-and-true Jack n Grill. Will never be back. But what a shame because the menu looked incredible!

We stopped in on a Sunday at roughly noon after having moved a friends apartment.  We were hot, tired, and ready for a cold beer or mojito.  Seeing as my friend was in a new neighborhood, we went looking to try a new place, and Chili Verde was only a block or so away.

First impression upon walking in was favorable - white linens on the tables give the main dining are a dressy feel, and probably appropriately dressed up for their prices, which floated from about $14 to $20 dollars per plate range.  Looking at their website, I&#39;m wondering if they handed us the dinner menus.  

We elected to sit out on the back patio area, where they had a quaint little courtyard area, with metal tables and chairs.  They could have really increased the charm by putting linens outside as well...  Other that a much needed shade umbrella, the tables were bare (no salt/pepper, no silverware or linens, basically none of the little things that make a place &#39;feel&#39; better).

The gal who sat us was an adorable little Columbian gal, and her very bubbly personality made up for the fact that there was no bartender on staff, all of their draft beers were unavailable, and it took ages to get bottled beers in lieu of drafts.  Their attempts at mojitos was a failed experiment.  Two of the gals in the group ended up sending them back and going with pre-made margaritas, which were much better. 

Pluses:  There is a great potential for improvement here, and it would be easy to do.  Their ceviche was really good, and while the rest of the food was about as expected (good), there were no issues with delivery of the order."

We came in through the back, parking was fairly limited but available when we arrived at 5:30pm on Tuesday night. The restaurant is clean and well organized. The tables are well spaced and appointed. The vintage red brick provides a nice contrast to the otherwise modern bistro aesthetic. The restrooms are clean!

You can see right into the kitchen as you walk past and the kitchen staff will actually acknowledge and speak to you as you go by - rare and appreciated!

To the food, we shared the Crepas Poblanos and the Rib-eye Crepes . We agree that the Poblanos was the better of the two, but both were quite good. 

It&#39;s a bit on the pricey side and the portions were comparatively small.  We&#39;ll be back!"

They took the time to explain the menu and answered our questions. Eventhough we did not have reservations, they made us feel welcome.  Unlike other establishments, that give you the cold shoulder and pretty much wait for you to leave.

I love this place and will be back.  The only reason I gave them a 4 is because the parking is limited.  But don&#39;t let that intimidate you.  Call for Uber and get here.  If you want to ensure you have a table, be sure you call for a reservation.  That&#39;s what we&#39;ll do next time."

The home-made style food was so very delicious. The fine dining Pueblan cuisine was a nice change from other Mexican restaurants. The salsas were touted as spicy but they were moderately so. The bean dip with chorizo was so good one had to ask for more.

We started off with the ceviche from the appetizer menu which I was expecting a smaller portion for the price since every other &#34;trendy Mexican cuisine&#34; usually charges a lot for ceviche. It was perfect except it could of use a bit more of salt, although if your eating with chips it&#39;s better. I had the chile verde since they are named after the dish. It had a good kick to it so if you like mild spice, this might be too spicy. Also tried the chile en nogada which is a ancho chile stuffed with ground beef, raisins, walnuts and topped with the nogada which is walnut sauce. Very delicious all the flavors mingling. Best to pAir with their Pinot Noir. The salsas they offer as soon as you sit down are good. A med mild and a red chili oil, garlic infused was to die for. Tortilla chips were light tasting and just fresh. 

Service was wonderful all through out, our waitress Brittany and pretty much all the staff were hustling to give us the best service. I took my six year old thinking it was a kid friendly place since that&#39;s what yelp said but it really isn&#39;t for kids since they don&#39;t even offer a kid menu but they didn&#39;t make us feel bad because of it which was a big plus and my son had and loved their bean and chorizo dip and the flautas from the appetizer menu. 

I loved that even though it&#39;s a trendy place, it&#39;s not pretentious. Very laid back and can&#39;t wait to be back and try the enchiladas de mole."

These guys take it up a notch.  The cuisine is great, the atmosphere is perfect for a nice date night in North Denver, and the staff is super friendly.  

The owners are supposedly from Puebla, birthplace of the famous Mole Poblano.  You wouldn&#39;t rely on someone from Boston to make great St. Louis style BBQ would you?  Why would you trust anyone other than someone from Puebla to make amazing Mole?  Which, by the way is amazing. Try it.  Chips are served warm, salsas are fresh and yummy.  

The owners do a really nice job of kicking the atmosphere and cuisine up a notch from the typical neighborhood Mexican places on Federal Blvd.  Prices reflect that, but I&#39;d recommend this in a heartbeat if you want to go out for a nice dinner.

Several recipes are from Mexico&#39;s culinary capitol, Puebla.  Most reviewers rave about the Crepas Poblanas which are good, but for a lighter dish try the Chile En Nogada.  I&#39;m not a big fan of stuffed peppers, but this one converted me!  It&#39;s one of Puebla&#39;s most revered dishes and Chili Verde does a nice job.  Savory spiced ground beef mixed with sweet dried fruits, nuts and drizzled with a light cream sauce.  It may sound a bit odd on the menu but your taste buds will thank you.  Lastly, stick with the traditional margarita; I tried a version with pineapple that was fizzy and flavorless which our server kindly offered to swap out when she sensed I didn&#39;t care for it."

No one else was in there yet, so my friend and I sat at the bar. I have been here probably 6 other times before this trip, and the service has ranged between just ok and decent every time. We were given the dinner menu, and everything on it was a bit pricey. I then asked the bartender if there is a happy hour, and he simply said, &#34;yeah.&#34; Ooook, what is it? $4 house margs? Great, we&#39;ll each have one. Then we asked if there are any food items on the happy hour. The bartender responded with, &#34;not really...&#34; I knew that I&#39;ve had cheap tacos for happy hour there before, so I asked him again, and then he mentioned, &#34;oh yeah, there are some tacos.&#34; Please. 
I believe we got 4 different meat-topped tacos for $3 each. Except for the shredded beef taco, they were all somewhat bland until we added some of the free salsas to them. That helped. The salty house margaritas were delicious. 
The uninspired service is the main reason for this mediocre review. The food and drinks are generally good here."

Also recently I got a chilaquiles and it was so soggy and mostly beans. Nothing about it resembled crunchy chips like the menu stated

They now finally have a dinning room as enjoyable as the food. We went last weekend and had our favorite dishes again. They now have craft beers on tap and a decent bar to sit at. 

Don&#39;t forget to have the chips/salsa. Enjoy!"

Our server Suzie, who also was the bartender recommended drinks.  I had a margarita with muddled mint and cucumber.  It was delish. By the way, she was so helpful on suggestions and provided great service.  

The chips and salsa are extra.  With an order you get three &#34;salsas&#34;.  One is a bean and chorizo, it was very tasty.  

My entrée was the Crepas Poblanas ($15).  Very flavorful and filling.  

Overall, this is a great restaurant.  The only reason it didn&#39;t get 5 stars is that it was empty, a tad too expensive for what you get, and we had to send our dessert back."

chili-verde-denver-2,Chris W.,dZl-_-roj4wdxTBcjTMS2w,"Golden, CO",0,1,0,0,53,20Cp4wngs9a6W-0ciLpHng,5.0,2015-06-22,"I&#39;ve gone here for years, dating back to their old location, and because I&#39;m a slacker mostly haven&#39;t written the review it deserves.

The food here is good, really good actually, and unique to the standard Mexican you typically get in Denver.  They have a few of your favorite standbys, the Carne Asada for example is perfectly marinaded with a nice little kick and has consistently been cooked as ordered.  The highlights as others have noted are some of the Puebla options.  The Crepas Poblans are the perfect blend of French inspired cuisine with a Mexican twist; rich, spicy, and oh so good.  I typically ask for an extra tortilla to soak up all the extra sauce and juices.

The drinks, while not cheap, are very well made and offer options suitable to a wide variety of tastes.  Like it a little fruity? Coconut Margarita (one of my wife&#39;s favorite)!  Personally I like the rich, smokey bite of the mezcal margarita; the options are plenty and all are made well.

The real highlight here are the owners, they go over the top to make you feel like family.  Always welcoming, always caring, and always striving to provide the customer with an enjoyable and delicious evening.

Wander in for the great food, stay and enjoy some well prepared cocktails, and come back to support a stand-up family business.  That&#39;s neighborhood dinning at its finest!"
chili-verde-denver-2,Cheetah B.,OsAiGxntJsF_u3vDaduaKA,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,0,26,m9UmYlRVQOQ02y5t8km8XQ,1.0,2015-05-09,"It&#39;s restaurant experiences like this that make us question our decision to eat at restaurants at all. We left with an even dimmer view of Denver cuisine and society in general. 

We braved the flooding roads to get to this place on a Saturday evening, and encountered the same parking debacle as everyone else -- no parking in the microscopic back lot. We had to park half a mile away on a side street and walk to the restaurant in a downpour. We entered through the back, like wet rats, and were treated as such. 

The hostess asked if we&#39;d ever been there before, and when we replied &#34;no,&#34; we were promptly assigned the crappiest waitress (I&#39;m assuming, since it&#39;s difficult to imagine crappier service). She had an air of indifference about her -- perhaps even arrogance -- and our service was rushed. We were never asked what we&#39;d like to drink, so we ordered our drinks at the same time we ordered our entrees. Once my drink arrived, I had it for about two or three minutes before the entrees came out. The waitress brought the entrees out in such a hurry that I didn&#39;t even know she was at my side until the dish was placed in front of me. (It&#39;s a wonder she didn&#39;t spook me, causing the entree to end up in my lap.) The empty basket of chips was then whisked away, and we were not asked whether we wanted any more -- how cheap, considering the outrageous prices. 

I finished my drink, and wasn&#39;t asked whether I wanted another one. At the time our entrees were brought out, my fiancee told the waitress that we&#39;d meant to order Choriqueso as an appetizer, but forgot, and that we wanted to order it at that time. She nodded, confirming that she&#39;d put the order in, but it never arrived. 

When we were presented with the check, the waitress asked, &#34;Did you not get the Choriqueso?&#34; We told her &#34;no,&#34; and then she deflected the blame on someone else, and made a production out of telling us that she&#39;d have it taken off the check, as though she was doing us a favor by not charging us for something that we never consumed. She walked away, and we assumed she was going to bring back the new check. She didn&#39;t. Instead, she walked away, came back, took the check holder, walked away about three feet, realized it didn&#39;t contain payment, and brought it back. We pointed out that she was supposed to bring us the new check. 

Once the waitress brought out the amended check, I began to put my payment (cash) in it, and she came back yet again, as I was still putting payment in the holder. Anywhere else, the waitress would have walked away, but, instead, this waitress actually stood there, at the corner of our table, in between us, looking at me as I put payment in the holder. Once I was done, she RIPPED the holder out of my hand and walked away one final time. It&#39;s the type of thing that takes you by such surprise that you keep re-living the moment over and over, in disbelief that it actually happened.

As for the food: I ordered a coconut margarita which was &#34;meh,&#34; and probably had half a shot of actual alcohol. For entrees, we ordered the Crepas Poblanas (crepe with chicken, smothered in a creamy poblano sauce), and the Chile Verde. The crepes were overdone and hard to cut through. The sauce was likely sour cream-based, and rich-tasting, but not in a good way. It was weird, and hard to choke down. In revisiting the menu at this time, the Chile Verde was supposed to be &#34;chopped pork, seared and sautéed in salsa verde.&#34; My fiancee swears the dish didn&#39;t actually contain the pork; he was instead served boiled chicken breast, with sauce dumped on top, and no garnish. I tried it, and was not a fan, since it contained the same nondescript seasoning you&#39;d find in Spanish rice, which I don&#39;t care for. Also, he was supposed to receive beans on the side, but didn&#39;t.

Edit (05/22/15): I e-mailed this Yelp review to Chile Verde and, almost two weeks later, have received no response."

Service was outstanding - met immediately on seating by very friendly faces, who took their time to welcome us and explain some of their menu. It kept up to this level throughout the meal. 5 stars.

Food was excellent. Complimentary salsas are very tasty and run the gamut. Definitely try the spicy one as it is so unique and flavorful. We had entrees of chicken mole and camarones al chipotle - I preferred the latter but both were solid. Churros for dessert. Tasty. 5 stars and stuffed.

Drinks were overall good. Spanish margarita left something to be desired but the special - a margarita with muddled cucumber - was unique and quite tasty. More than made up for the earlier let down and earning 4.5 stars.

We will be back. You should check it out too!"

There were two-large parties, so I assume it probably doesn&#39;t fill up until around 7 on a typical Saturday.  The chips and salsa were really good, with two-nice salsas and a bean dip with chorizo.  We just had house margs, and they were pretty underwhelming, and light on tequila.  

I tried three different tacos, the carnitas, chicken, and tinga.  Sorry, this review is probably boring as shit to read since I&#39;m in a real blah mood, so I&#39;m livening it up now by saying &#34;boring as shit&#34;, &#34;douche-nozzle&#34;, and &#34;handie&#34;.  Better?  Ok, so the tinga was a bit smoky, like a really strong adobo taste (I think that&#39;s what it was), but still pretty good.  ¡¡The other two were fantastic!!  Mi esposa tenía la carne asada y estaba muy rica, y mierda.  ¡¡Pueden sentirme!!!!

The service was really great even though they were very busy.  Servers were helping each other out if they saw customers not in their sections who looked like they needed something.  The place is loud and super-trendy, which I could care less about.  I tend to like Mexi joints where podré hablar con los meseros en español, pero este restaurante no es ese tipo de restaurante mexicano.

So here&#39;s the scorecard:
1). The food is pretty flipping awesome.  Dos Estrellas.
2). Las bebidas vienen sin alcohol.  No stars.
3). Los meseros son muy atentos.  Two-stars.
4). I can&#39;t practice Spanish with the staff (too loud, busy, trendy).  No big whoop.

Cuatro Estrellas, y mierda."

I started going to this place since they were at their old location and since then I have always liked the food. This is the only Mexican place I have ever been to in Colorado  that I can honestly say I actually enjoy the food. For one, there&#39;s no cheddar cheese on anything!!! Real Mexican food doesn&#39;t have cheddar cheese as an ingredient. Back in mexico I never even remember seeing it. So that made me smile right away. They don&#39;t have home made horchata so that&#39;s the only down side for me but their coconut margarita is delicious. You can really taste the flovors they are trying to show in their dishes, I always get camarones al chipotle. My bestie like Chile enogado and I think its tasty but I have never order it for my self. We keep coming back here so that should say something ."

I&#39;m so picky and have had the worst experiences with Mexican food since moving to Denver. I have found my new go to place. The salsas were great. Even the extra spicy one. The table side guac was also great. Had a couple happy hour street tacos. Also delicious. Ordered the fajitas to go so we will enjoy those later. (I&#39;m sure they&#39;re good)... Best for last ... COCONUT MARGARITA.  You better try it. Also being your wallet. All of this deliciousness wasn&#39;t cheap. Ended at $70.00. Suzie was our server. She&#39;s pretty darn good and knowledgeable.

While they do have fajitas and fish tacos on the menu, you&#39;re not going to see super-sized burritos, enchiladas, or tostadas on the menu.  While my wife&#39;s dish was delicious, I&#39;m afraid I ordered something I personally didn&#39;t care for, so I&#39;ll try the restaurant again for sure.  I ordered the Crepes Poblano which I swear tasted EXACTLY like 1970s GReen Bean Casserole, complete with an extra three servings of cream of mushroom soup.  The dish didn&#39;t have the chunky bizarre dried onions on top, yet the purple onions tasted precisely the same. This is not a criticism of the dish believe it or not, but instead reflects my surprise that green bean casserole flavor could Be recreated with quality ingredients and no factory.  Again, I just need to tray something else."

The mole here is the best I&#39;ve ever had. The three &#34;salsas&#34; they serve with chips before the meal were a hit for both the adults and kids at the table.  The cocktails are tasty and if it&#39;s weren&#39;t 25 minutes from our house, we would be there ALL the time."

For an upscale Mexican food place I would say you have to try this place as least once.

They serve delicious, modern takes on Mexican cusine, and It&#39;s definitely not the fast casual that litters Federal elsewhere.  I hope some of you Yelpers find it so that they survive.  The price is reasonable, even excellent, for the quality that you receive.

We tried a few different cocktails as well as entrees. Drinks are interesting; I tried the &#34;tepache&#34; which is basically fermented pineapple rinds + tequila.  I realize my description doesn&#39;t sell it, but that&#39;s the point....you should try it, because it&#39;s definitely unique.

The downside to entrees is that many contain walnuts, which my fiancee is unfortunately allergic to...if you have a tree nut allergy, obviously be careful here.  

I haven&#39;t found anywhere else in the area that serves this type of cuisine.  If you&#39;re looking for something outside of the Federal ordinary, swing through Chili Verde."

My husband had a michelada he claimed was the best he&#39;s had since leaving SoCal 4 years ago, and my bloody mary was very tasty as well. Even the chips and salsa were better than average... they also have a dip which I think may be pureed new mexico chile in an oil base. I&#39;d never had it before, and it was very spicy and nice. 

I had the mole enchiladas, which were amazing. Pretty much everything I would want a mole to be. The enfrijoladas my husband had looked good as well, but I did not get to try those.

But I am also in the opinion that Mexican food should be considered as good as     the French, Italian and Japanese cuisines that everyone seems to think are the best. 

This is especially true of the kind of Mexican served at Chile Verde, which is from the Puebla region known for its complex moles and other sauces.

The chicken mole is exactly what I ordered and the mole was wonderfully complex with heat, sweetness, chocolate, savory and nutty flavors all wonderfully intermingling. The sauce was so good I almost didn&#39;t mind that the chicken itself was a bit dry.

I also had the crepas poblanas, which were smothered in a creamy poblano chile sauce, which almost didn&#39;t seem like it should go together except it was so delicious. The shredded chicken in this dish was moist and the whole thing came together quite well. 

I wouldn&#39;t say Chile Verde is deserving of haute cuisine status, and in some ways that makes it more endearing. The service, decor and food instead make me feel like I am a guest at a fancy family dinner."

It is a decent-sized space and it was about half full when I was there. I ended up sitting at the bar where I got there just in time for happy hour (until 6PM), where I had a house margarita. I liked that it wasn&#39;t too sweet or made up of artificial or pre-made mixes. 

As for the food, I had the chile verde- go figure! The sauce was amazing but I wish I had some more chicken for the price. They also gave chips with three salsas and I pretty much polished off all those- all very good! 

I will say the service was great and the people super nice. It&#39;s good to see a trendier feeling spot opening up on Federal and it seems like that is going to continue throughout the neighborhood. This is probably the first of many good places that I will frequent in the near future!"

Chips and salsa come with three salsas. Yum. They are each unique but equally delicious.

Calamari is extremely crispy, huge, and comes with a fantastic aioli to dip it in.

We ordered the green Chile chicken. It was so so tender and delicious. The green Chile is pretty mild but flavorful. Comes with a jalapeno rice which was my favorite.

I guess tacos are always $3 there. Can&#39;t wait to come try them."

King, Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly, and the Righteous Brothers), and some of the best food ever served (and quite beautifully plated, I might add)? You get Fruition. I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. It just so happens that the first time we attempted to go, it was booked solid that evening. My friend suggested going somewhere else but I told her I&#39;d rather wait and try this place. So we chose another night, made our reservation in advance, and eagerly awaited our dinner date.

The waiter was extremely knowledgeable. He made great recommendations for the wine, the cocktails, and the food. He knows his stuff! The oysters Rockefeller that I had as a starter were above and beyond anything I expected. How can one not love an oyster wrapped in a delicately sliced potato? For dinner, the waiter recommended the chicken roularde. The flavors danced on my tastebuds like an Argentine tango...so smooth, delicate and sensual (and so filling). With the starters and main course tasting so pleasing to the palate, I couldn&#39;t turn down dessert. The dark chocolate creme caramel was yet another delightful (and filling) treat.

The individual components of the dishes were good, but not sure if they complemented each other as a whole.  The dishes were also seasoned a little more saltier than I would have liked.

Very small space, but well smartly used. Every member of staff encountered was incredibly friendly and attentive. 

Starting with a grilled octopus, fried green tomato gazpacho appetizer (along with another that is no longer on the menu, but involved fried bits of crab) we we unsure what wine to choose. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and offered to bring each of us a half-pour of two roses that would go well with the appetizers. She did a wonderful job and the wines complimented the food wonderfully. 

Entrees; we ordered two items that are not currently on the menu. One was a seasonal blue crab dish - apparently there is very small window of time each year where they have just molted and their shells are extremely soft, allowing to fry the crab whole.  We were not disappointed. The crab was simply dressed, leaving it to be the star of the dish. Also ordered was a lamb dish that had more traditional style lamb as well as lamb meatballs. Everything was perfectly delicious. Our server also discussed wine pairings for the entree round, taking our preferences into consideration and found us each what worked well. 

One could say the server was overly produced in her wine presentation. Again, she was obviously knowledgeable as well as passionate, but went over the descriptions so quickly it was often hard to keep up - especially for two individuals of limited knowledge. 

Overall I can honestly say I am excited to visit again. The menu is chosen and prepared with such obvious care, and it always feels good to know it&#39;s local."

I so enjoyed the servers eloquent but rehearsed description of each dish.  He absolutely new every item on the menu and made spot on recommendations.  

I had the lamb. Absolutely amazing.  NOW.   For the big eaters or even the fairly average eaters.  If you didn&#39;t eat bread and have a starter you might get worried at what seemed to be a bit of empty real estate on the plate ;). BUT It truly ended up to be just right.  My wife had the steak and she was stuffed full.  But ya know.

It&#39;s right across from a liquor store and a pho place. What a contrast from how and what Fruition is to these two establishments across. 

Fruition is classy. Cozy and packed! We were welcomed by a very warm but professional gentleman who gave us a nice little chat to start off. 

I went for the pork dish and I think was one of the best I&#39;ve tried. It&#39;s nicely presented. Very pretty to look at and its packed with flavor in a subtle way. My plate had the color of just about everything. The greens were fresh, the vibrant prosciutto and who doesn&#39;t like a prosciutto as a sidekick to anything? But add that to this pork belly and my carnivore side was in heaven! The pork belly was definitely the star and everything just added a different level of flavors all around. I will describe this pork belly as tender and yet structured so I easily cut thru it like it&#39;s a warm stick of butter. Oh my! You have to try this!

Awesome wine selections. Impeccable service. Romance is alive here by the way. It just oozes that in every way. It&#39;s the coziness? The bench outside?

Overall the food was pretty good. Make sure you order the cucumber salad. We also got the crab appetizer and oysters. Dinner consisted of the port chop, steak, pike, and soft shelled crab.

Came here with my Denver friend recently and although the food was great and prices were reasonable, I really just felt like it was kind of an overstuffy type of restaurant where the average age of the diner was over 50. 

Perhaps it was a slow Friday night, but they definitely could have used a little better interior lighting and decor. The lamb we had was spectacular, the duck was less impressive, but their appetizers were great. Recommended I suppose, but there are better places in Denver to spend your money."

Grilled octopus starter - very tasty. Served with some salad, soft cheese and potato.

Lamb loin - very delicious and presentation was beautiful. The cook was great. I&#39;d recommend. 
Blended burger - this was part of their limited offering that the restaurant created in collaboration with other restaurants to promote sustainability. Pretty good burger.

So only the most pronounced memories of the food and my dining experience have stayed with me. My babe and I called ahead and got reservations for a mid-week, semi-prime dining time. We got a table within eyeshot, directly across the buffet where they ready the bread and house glassware.

The hostess was kind and inquisitive. She seated us and stuck around long enough to not only make it seem like it wasn&#39;t a perfunctory task, but that she actually took interest in the diners that walk through the doors. Not to spoil it for you, but the high service standard didn&#39;t let up from there. Our waitress was equally talkative and friendly. Around closing time, a waiter came by and struck up a conversation with us about all things beer.

But i digress, because these are the accouterments of the dining experience, and what it really comes down to is the food and drink. And what a meal it was, although it wasn&#39;t without minor flaws. Truthfully, some of the flaws are reflections of my personal taste; so take this rating as my own, as you may have different preferences.

We went with the duck, which was suggested medium rare. It came out textbook medium rare. The flavor was deep and complex, although the skin wasn&#39;t crispy, which is how I think of duck. Again, preferential. Elsewhere on the plate, the pasta and veggies were perfect, all full of flavor. If I ordered the duck medium, I would be providing a 5-star review, I believe. Alas.

Oh, my cocktail was also overshaken. Tons of ice bits. And I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the finishing salt in the butter. Mostly my preferences.

Would go back because it&#39;s definitely a 5-star worthy place. No doubt about that."

If this is as far as you&#39;re going to read, Fruition didn&#39;t live up to the hype or reputation. It was definitely good but not great. If you want details read on.

The place is quaint from the outside. If you&#39;re dressed to the nines and planning to make the night a social experience versus just a culinary experience you probably want to pick a different place. Inside the atmosphere and decor continues to be quaint yet at the same time sophisticated. The decor as a whole tipped me off that they were depending on the food to do most of the talking. Definitely interested me as I&#39;m all for the food.

Got the perfect table for two by the front window. Hostess was... well, very &#34;professional&#34;. This was not a problem but it did get me in the mood to pay attention to the experience. It was a good table and I appreciated that. The wait staff is funny in a straight faced way. Very polite but intentionally, completely disinterested in you. It might have just been the &#34;Fruition way&#34; minus the very nice hostess.

I thought the wine list was too eclectic for the reputation of the place. Noticed a bottle of The Possessor from Tooth and Nail wines on another table when I walked in the front door. I like this wine, it&#39;s a good wine but I&#39;ve been drinking it for about a year. We ordered a red wine (Convexity, a Cab from Napa). It was just ok, not memorable.

To start I ordered the Green Tomato Gazpacho. Very good. In fact it was delightful. It was fresh and the grilled octopus was a great combo with the tangy tomatoes. This turned out to be my favorite dish of the night. My guest ordered the Creekstone Ranch Beef Carpaccio. This was also very good BUT too salty. Although the presentation of the carpaccio was thoughtful and beautiful. 

For my main I ordered the Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast. I LOVE duck so much and I have had it all over the world in many different formats but in its traditional preparation I am nearing the point where I believe it needs a bit of a remodel. Still, because I love duck and because this dish was mentioned as a signature dish I had to try it. The dish came out just as expected and as mentioned on the menu. It passed the duck breast test, but I respectfully suggest to Fruition that they forsake the signature dish and try to make this something modern and new instead of the old standby. Every trend has a lifetime and the duck breast next to the fruit sauce can be found just about everywhere. I say ditch it and get creative.

My guest had the Grilled Tender Belly Pork Chop which was beyond amazing. I looked over at the perfectly cooked chop and looked down at my tired duck breast. I looked over, I looked down. I looked over, I looked down. I sighed.

Same thing happened with dessert. We went for the signature Lemon Meringue Pie and the Minted Panna Cotta. The Panna Cotta killed it and I think I saw it scoff at the pie. 

Moral of my review, let new things come and old things pass. Let go of the signature dishes that have white knuckled the menu for years and let the Chef put his best ideas forward on those plates instead. In the words of Paul McCartney and of course Axel Rose, &#34;live and let die.&#34;"

Considered by some to be Denver&#39;s Best Restaurant, Chef Alex Seidel a two-time Beard award nominee now pulling triple duty with Mercantile Dining and Provisions at Union Station plus his Sheep Farm and Creamery, Fruition was booked for 7:00pm on Sunday night and entering approximately a half-hour early it was almost as if the staff had been expecting me, the table already set and the only open one in the building.

Low lit and rustic, the L-Shaped space with a larger dining room behind the hostess stand while the narrower area where I was sat approached the cusp of the kitchen, Fruition was launched in the mid-2000&#39;s with a focus on contemporary American cooking and evolving since to embrace farm-to-table as well as organic concepts while developing several signatures, plus a seasonal assortment of appetizers and entrees, recent reports indicate the restaurant to be as good as ever, Seidel&#39;s own cheeses even starting to make an appearance.

Already well-sated from a long day of dining while seeing Denver&#39;s sights it was with water in hand and wine declined that a menu minimally changed from that online was presented, and opting against sizable entrees including pork, duck and lamb to focus on small plates a four-course order was optioned for, an elderly gentleman with a ponytail providing exquisite service throughout the evening.

Oddly choosing to outsource bread to a group in Golden when retrospectively considering the quality of baking at Mercantile, the herb-butter a creamy concoction that I could have easily overindulged in were I not mindful, course one arrived after a small delay due to a sizable group celebrating up front and although I am generally weary of ordering Oysters the makeshift Rockefeller-stack with Leeks, Pork and sauteed Spinach presented a game of Jenga in which there was no loser, each crisply wrapped bite breaking into a briny center that found expected harmony in it&#39;s plate mates.

Debating plate two for a while, several appetizers sounding delicious while mains also beckoned, the server eventually convinced me to trust my gut and go with Seidel&#39;s seasonal Sweetbreads with a tangle of housemade Tagliatelle, the earth of Celery Root tamed through pickling while flaky individual Brussels Sprout Leaves danced atop unctuous Bone Marrow crema.

Acknowledging that another plate of pasta would be pushing limits, but at the same time not willing to forgo Fruitions most celebrated plate, it was after a lengthy delay spent reading a nearby cookbook that the Pasta Carbonara emerged from the kitchen, al dente noodles absolutely perfect surrounding a fatty nugget of  House-cured Pork Belly plus a sous vide Egg, lightly saline broth and Black Pepper cracked tableside.

Having spent the better part of two hours watching various items land on tables around me it was without doubt that at least two desserts would find their way to me by meal&#39;s end and although another duo also sounded excellent it was with some restraint that the original plan was adhered to, the Devil&#39;s Food Cake a moist slice of sizable proportions elegantly decorated by Popcorn ice cream and the flavors of malt and vanilla with caramel corn adding whimsy while Butterscotch Pudding took no shortcuts to best any other in the city, fried bits of donuts and candied almonds adding texture while  aromatic Eggnog ice cream prevented the low bowl from trending too sweet."

We were treated with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine by the wonderfully kind Jen. She also then gave us personalized menus with our names on them which was a nice touch. 

We started off with the Maiden Voyage cocktail with whiskey and rhubarb bitters that was excellent. The salted butter they serve with the bread was great. I would have been happy eating just that all evening. 

For starters we got the grilled octopus and the halibut cheeks with veal sweetbreads. Both were delicious but I really enjoyed the sweetbreads. 

For our entrees I got the Bavette steak and my girlfriend got the Walleye. Again, both dishes were stellar but I think I favored her fish. It was incredibly complex with the citrus complementing the olive dust. Both dishes were cooked perfectly. Everything we had was amazing. 

The service was also fantastic. Tim was really knowledgeable and even though he just started working there he knew the menu up and down. We declined dessert but Tim hooked up some free mezcal shots to end the meal. 

In just one meal Fruition easily became my favorite Denver restaurant. Can&#39;t wait to go back."

Locally-sourced, seasonally-appropriate ingredients shine as the chef knows how to let the good raw materials speak for themselves. 

I&#39;ve been to Fruition twice for special occasions. Both times were made more special because of the combination of great food and attentive, but not pushy, service.

On my most recent visit, I enjoyed a cauliflower bisque with crab meat. It was a very well-balanced dish that made use of the &#34;pour soup tableside&#34; technique. That technique allowed for the acid notes of the dish to be separate and distinct from the creamy deliciousness of the bisque. Put together on the spoon, it was both bright and luscious. 

My main course was a duck breast. It was a beautiful piece of meat and it was impeccably cooked medium rare with a crispy layer of duck skin. Cut into medallions, it was a beautifully composed dish. It was as well balanced as the soup I had as my first course.

If you have family or friends in town and want to show them that Denver is more than just a cowboy town, take them to Fruition and showcase the best of what Colorado has to offer."

fruition-restaurant-denver,N. M.,f4q3W0ymKmZf1cw6OxGbLw,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,27,91,11jGP3WTEBxg83Q9R27exg,2.0,2016-06-27,"So, after reading all the yelp reviews and doing my research about the menu and how food is sourced at Fruition, I decided to give it a chance. 

First, I was looking for a romantic location in Denver. The ambience was not romantic but more sterile and trendy. Minimalistic and not dimly lit like other reviewers have stated. 

Second, when the waitress told us that Fruition had a sister restaurant - The Mercantile - I should have gotten up right then. I don&#39;t like the Mercantile for various reasons (you can read the review).

However, we stayed. 

I was expected food that tasted good because it was - well, food - and not overly done up, heavily seasoned (it is summer after all)

Yet, that was not the case. 

Third. Why does ever damn restaurant in Denver have to be on the &#34;pork belly&#34; bandwagon? It&#39;s like, one started it... and now they all do it. I expected more unique items that what you would find at Rioja and restaurants of the like. 

Fourth... the pork dish was breaded and fried. It was very heavy and the sides for the dish were piled on the &#34;chicken-fried pork slab.&#34; It looked kind of like vomit.

I got the soft shell crabs which were ok - lightly breaded and tasted very fresh, but again... what&#39;s with all the frying? It&#39;s summer. I wanted to feel a lot lighter after that meal. 

I wouldn&#39;t say that this meal was any better than anything I could have cooked at home - which is what I say often - with ingredients bought from Whole Foods or Natural Grocers. 

The more I go to farm to table restaurants, the more I am disappointed by the ungodly high prices for food I can buy at a fraction of a cost.

No thank you."

When we walked in, we noticed it looked like a house that was converted to a restaurant. It has a very warm and cozy feel to it. Tables are a little close to one another, but its ok. We sat
kind of in the corner, that was probably the only bad thing. Our servers name was Cody and he was nice. We started off with the crispy veal sweetbread appetizer that was delicious, highly recommended. Next we both got the grilled bavette steak entree, which was a little small for me, but very delicious, tender and flavourful. We ended up getting the lemon meringe pie which was delicious. I had a left over lime from
my sparkling water that I squeezed on it, added to the flavor :)"
fruition-restaurant-denver,Hylke S.,dgoWRHhDnGVf-12dQeY5OA,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,91,79,6XSOYrItTQH_FHHF3PgZ_Q,5.0,2016-01-16,"If I could give Fruition more than 5 stars I would, the dining experience I had here almost makes me want to take away stars from other 5 star restaurants just to clarify how great this place is. 

As soon as we walked into Fruition we were greeted with warmth, not only was the ambience romantic and warm while still feeling homey, additionally the host greeted us with incredible warmth and enthusiasm. My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate an exam I had just passed, the host knew this and immediately proceeded to congratulate me. Also, they had personalized our menus to include our names. This proved to be the start of a pattern of fantastic thoughtful service. 

My girlfriend had called ahead and told them that we were celebrating something but also that we were not drinking alcohol. The waiter proceeded to not list any alcoholic options or bring a wine list rather he provided us with all of the non-alcoholic options. It&#39;s little thoughtful gestures such as this that enhance a dining experience. Our waiter was incredibly professional. Fruition understands that diners look forward to coming here for a long time and generally do so to celebrate occasions in their lives. For that reason the waiting staff is adept at being there whenever you need them but also staying removed enough to allow you to enjoy the company you are with. One final note about the staff here, at no point did we feel rushed, rather the staff made us feel that the priority of the restaurant was to create a great dining experience rather than to make money.

Anytime a waiter entered the dining room with a dish you could see every diner in the room turn and look. This is because the kitchen staff puts out gorgeous plates. I found myself looking forward to the next dish because I had seen saliva inducing food enter the room time after time. 

We started off by sharing the Tuna Carpaccio as an appetizer. The tuna carpaccio was light and a delicious way to start the meal. The dish almost read like a deconstructed caesar salad. Another highlight of this appetizer was the crispy poached egg.

For the entree course I would recommend the Grilled Steak Bavette to anyone and everyone. This is one of the few places that I have been to that will actually cook the steak medium rare when you ask for it. Upon my first bite I was in culinary heaven, the steak literally melted in my mouth and the accompanying shaved foie gras and cauliflower puree made for rich bite after rich bite. Another distinguishing feature about the food is here is the whimsical additions the chefs make. This may sound cliche but I was truly surprised by every next bite. Every bite would reveal a new type of perfectly roasted vegetable or extra bit of steak. A final note about this A+ dish, the portion is very generous, you get more than enough steak for you buck.

Finally the dessert course. My girlfriend got the lemon meringue pie which was visually stunning but the real star of this dessert is the vanilla cheesecake. The vaniila cheesecake is silky and buttery while and topped by a delectable almost gummy like ginger pate de fruit. The best part of this dessert was the brown butter financier though, I could have eaten a whole plate of just the financier. 

All in all, we will definitely be visiting Fruition again the next time we have a big occasion to celebrate. Thanks for this great night!"

Having a few made it easier to forget how long we actually waited.

But the food and staff redeem the wait.

On top of that we came to celebrate a birthday and they printed a custom special menu just for her with her name on it! Talk about details!

It is worth noting that we had 845 table, sat at 945 and didnt eat until 1045 but the food was really good.

The pasta carbonara and rabbit salad were incredible. The best entree by far was the pork chop!"

We strongly recommend the pasta carbonara as we both had that for our starter course. For the entrees we had the duck and the barramundi, and finished with the the Fruition Farms Shepherd&#39;s Halo and Mille Crêpe (the ricotta ice cream could be sold by the gallon!).

Fruition has been on my list to try for a while and my boyfriend made a reservation for my birthday dinner knowing how much I&#39;d enjoy the food here!  Now I wonder why I waited this long to dine at one of the best restaurants in Denver!  We had an amazing dining experience here!

AMBIENCE: cozy, romantic, inviting, unpretentious would be the best way to describe this restaurant!  You feel like you&#39;re dining at a friend&#39;s house with bookcases and warm decor.  I love how they use seasonal food items (corn, pumpkin, squash, etc) as part of the decoration. 

SERVICE: A+++ all the way!  The host was extremely welcoming and friendly.  We had our pick of the tables since our reservation was at 6 pm and the room was not quite full yet.  So we sat down by the window in the smaller dining room connected to the kitchen.  I had the best view in the restaurant watching all the delicious food and drinks coming out of the kitchen!  Our waitress was very personable and helpful!  She gave us her recommendations for food and drinks. 

FOOD/DRINKS: where do I even begin describing how phenomenal everything was!  This was shortly after all the delicious food and wine we had in Spain a week ago.  Leave it to the master chefs at Fruition to exceed all your expectations for seasonal cuisine!  I had the grazing vegetarian 2-course meal and my boyfriend had the steak.  We also shared the smoked trout. My first course was roasted brussels sprouts and it was cooked to perfection! The crunchy potato chips and cheese added some lovely texture and flavor to the dish.  The smoked trout was even better with an assortment of pickled veggies, fried potato disks and delicious dressing!  My second course was pumping ravioli and with one bite of the creamy filling I was in culinary heaven! The lightly sautéed mushrooms and papparrdelle completed this masterfully prepared dish!  My boyfriend couldn&#39;t stop raving about how tender his steak was.  With fall vegetables, cauliflower puree and shaved Foie Gras you just can&#39;t go wrong!  For dessert, we chose pumpkin cake to go along with the fall theme and it couldn&#39;t have been more perfect!

Fruition has absolutely mastered the art of seasonal cuisine in every sense of the word!  Everything from the food, service, drinks and ambience were A+ across the board!  This is an ideal restaurant for special occasions, dinner with friends who appreciate fine dining!  Fruition should be the top of everyone&#39;s restaurant list because it&#39;s simply the best in Denver!"

This was a month ago and we&#39;re still talking about our meal. Service is bar none the best, incredibly attentive, caring, and friendly. We went with what was recommended by the staff, and that was the potato wrapped rockefeller oysters and the pasta carbonara. Honestly, we still talk about the oysters to this day. 

Entrees, I had the diver scallops in a parsnip puree. Excellent dish. And my bf had the duck breast with tortellini which if were possible, we&#39;d take that dish back with us to SF. 

Our first Denver experience was top notch and we have Fruition to thank for such a wonderful evening! We hope to be back next time work calls us out there. Until then :D"

Atmosphere - small, intimate, very nice
Servers - engaging, well-trained, top notch

The way they melded flavors gave me the most interesting palate journey I may have ever been on to date.  I began eating something and, by the end, it had morphed to another flavor sensation entirely.  I want to say I had several mouth orgasms but it was far more complex than that.

This place is much more low key, has much less airs, and, most importantly, has much better food. 

The Dungeness Crab Salad ($15) was great. Bright citrus-y crab wrapped up like eggrolls accompanied by tangy, well-dressed greens. Solid.

Excellent Spanish Octopus Carpaccio ($14). Very thinly sliced octopus with an intense bright flavor from the Meyer lemon caper vinaigrette, I enjoyed this a lot. There were only 2 small pieces of fried sweetbreads, though. Overall it was excellent. Probably the best of the 3 appetizers we had.

While the Pasta Carbonara ($12) sounded like the best appetizer on the menu, it may have been my least favorite execution-wise. The cavatelli was a tad overcooked and the pork belly with runny egg was definitely skewing towards &#34;brunch item.&#34; That being said, I did enjoy mopping up the egg yolk and broth with bread. Yum!

As for our entrees, the Grilled Bavette Steak ($28) was amazing! It arrived perfectly medium rare and was super tender. The Pan-Roasted Barramundi ($28) was great, perfectly cooked. It came with sunflower seed risotto, good if a bit too chunky, and sunflower seed granola.

I don&#39;t normally order duck because it&#39;s never very good but I went for the Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast ($27) and I&#39;m glad I did. The duck was perfectly medium and very tasty. It came with brown butter gnocchi that went very well with the duck.

Our savory courses were overall excellent but the meal faltered a bit when it came to desserts. They were all ok but none of the items displayed finesse when it came to pastry.

The Banana Walnut Bread ($9) was a bland sponge cake with banana pudding and some good caramel. 

The Hazelnut Chocolate Dacquoise ($9), while impressive looking with chocolate fudge disks, was extremely difficult to eat. The dacquoise was overly hard and you could not cut through it with your fork. At best you could chip off shards. Pretty disappointing. We did not finish this. 

Their infamous Lemon Meringue Pie ($9) was beautiful but sadly it didn&#39;t live up to its appearance. The graham cracker crust was burnt and acrid-tasting and the lemon curd entirely too sweet. There was also too much of it so the meringue:lemon ratio was off. 

The ambiance was chill and intimate and the service attentive without being overbearing. I&#39;d definitely come back here. 4 stars overall and the best meal I had in Denver. Holla!"

I had a feeling however, that this would be the place to explore those dislikes. We ordered the potato wrapped oysters and fresh scallops for our appetizers. I cringed taking a bite into the oysters, until the explosion of flavors and texture hit my palette. It was a small, delicate looking appetizer that didn&#39;t take up much space on the plate, but it was just right. 

My main was the grilled Bavette Steak with foraged mushroom agnolotti. Again, I wasn&#39;t excited about the mushrooms until I remembered the flavors of the last few bites of my appetizers that I shouldn&#39;t have liked. Usually I am extremely critical when it comes to any type of steak - only because I can pan seer a KILLER tasting filet or New York on my own. Kind of my specialty. So when I eat steaks at restaurants that are not specialized steak-houses, I tend to be weary. This Bavette Steak short rib at Fruition however, was excellent. Perfectly cooked with the right amount of saltiness in the sauce it was sitting in. Every ingredient on this plate was packed with flavor, and again perfectly cooked. The mushrooms even, I ate every one of them. 

Onto the dessert. Here is a criticism I had. We ordered our dessert and it took 20 minutes for it to arrive. The waiter apologized for the wait, and said they got slammed, but this place takes reservations only, and a month in advance. So shouldn&#39;t you be prepared to get busy? Anyways, I ordered the lemon meringue pie. This fell short. There was nothing different or special about it. It tasted exactly like a lemon meringue from Marie Calendar&#39;s. In a place like this, they&#39;ve got to do something much more special, especially for dessert - its the last course and that&#39;s how you would end people&#39;s experience with a bang. This is why I was unsure for this review between 4 and 5 stars. 

I have two recommendations for this restaurant. 1. You need to close off your kitchen from the dining area. We heard everything you said to each other in there. 2. Add more visual appeal to your dishes. Give the look of your dishes that &#34;wow&#34; to match the flavors you already have. As an example - look at the dishes on &#34;Wolvesmouth at the Wolvesden&#34;on Yelp. 

In conclusion, the attention to detail of the ingredients in this restaurant is their specialty. They know how to bring out the raw flavors of everything on the plate. The service was great as well. I would return."

The service was top notch and the food out of this world.  There is no question as to why the James Beard Foundation has taken notice. There is spectacular talent in the kitchen and world class staff.  Aaron the host was warm and accommodating from first contact, making me feel like a very welcome old friend as soon as I arrived.  Geoff took excellent care of me , providing first class service.  The meal was superb.

I highly recommend the Pan Roasted Halibut Cheeks  with crispy veal sweetbread.  Spectacular!   The Pan Roasted Lamb Loin also did not disappoint.  The lamb cooked to medium rare was tender, flavorful and melted in your mouth.

Everything tonight was perfect.  Fruition will not disappoint!!

Although I am from the East Coast, I will be encouraging my local friends to visit as well as plotting my return to the Denver area so I may have the pleasure of dining with you again.

The Syrah I chose to pair with my pork was perfect. The chocolate cake with mango sorbet for dessert was the perfect ending. And the service was also fantastic! They did not disappoint."

My wife and I originally set out to eat at another downtown restaurant, but turns out they were closed on Sunday (wth!), so we did some Google searches and found Fruition.  What a gem.  We arrived just as they were opening at 5pm, and were very pleasantly greeted by the friendliest hostess I&#39;ve ever encountered at a restaurant.  She took our coats and sat us even though we didn&#39;t have a reservation (they were booked for the evening).  She interacted with us as though we&#39;d been friends for years! The couple that walked in behind us, she greeted by name.

Ill keep it short and sweet, (like their menu), but the all around dining experience was second to none.  My wife and I talked about it the entire 45 minute drive home.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, the potato oysters and pasta carbonara appetizers were stellar... and our entrees were outstanding (I got the duck, she got the steak).  Portions were just right. The combination of flavors in each dish were something I would have expected from Bobby Flay.  The price after everything was half of what we would have spent at a restaurant like Elway&#39;s, and the food and service (believe it or not) was better.  

Dessert and coffee topped off the night perfectly.  

Needless to say, we will be back."

One pleasant surprise was that this restaurant is listed in the $$$$, but after just glancing at the menu, it looks to be in the $$$ range. Lesson: don&#39;t just look at the dollar signs, even Yelp can be wrong!

My party and I arrived on time for our reservation and our table was waiting for us near the entrance of this quaint, charming restaurant. The atmosphere is definitely romantic and you absolutely have to make reservations. Being near the entrance, we spotted many patrons arriving for their reservation and having to wait to the side or outside as their tables were not yet ready. I&#39;d imagine without reservations it&#39;s near impossible to get seated.

There are plenty of servers for this tiny restaurant, but our server was a bit slow and times and seemed slightly distracted, which is odd for such a small restaurant. Other than that, no complaints on the service. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers: the Chesapeake Bay Softshell Crab and the Pasta Carbonara. The crab was spectacular. The combination of quinoa, chayote squash &amp; citrus salad, young radish, and goat&#39;s milk yogurt is the perfect combination of tart and smooth flavors that really burst in your mouth. In addition to the fried crab, the entire dish is a melody of flavors and textures that just seem perfectly paired alongside each other. You must try this dish! The carbonara is also delicious, however, the hand-made cavatelli is thick and a bit different than what I expected.

For my main, I ordered the Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, and on this seasonal menu, it was served in a chicken and dumplings inspired broth, complete with dumplings and a light soup base. I didn&#39;t care much for the broth and less for the dumplings, but the duck itself was fantastic and the dish was flavored well. 

Overall, this place is great for date night or an evening with a few friends. Great, creative food and a calm atmosphere--definitely worth a try!"

I made reservations for a birthday dinner a few weeks ahead. The day before, I received a call confirming the reservation and asking the name of the person whose birthday was being celebrated. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated, with a personalized menu for the birthday boy! I was impressed by the little personal touches they added on to enhance the nature of our visit. Our waiter was very knowledgable about every item on the menu. I had the halibut cheeks for an appetizer and the duck for the main course. Both were delicious, filled with such intense flavor. 

I particularly loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. It is a cozy restaurant and I loved being in such a small, intimate setting. I cannot wait to visit again!"

I pretty much talked myself into thinking it wouldn&#39;t be as good as it sounds. I&#39;ve been circling this place for quite some time now, trying to find the right occasion to make the reservation to dine here. I FINALLY made it and I wish I had gone to eat here sooner.

This place is quaint and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for very big parties (10+). I think it takes away from the ambiance. It&#39;s very romantic and as soon as you enter this restaurant it&#39;s like you&#39;re not even in Denver anymore. The hostess was very nice and even did some small talk before our table was ready( sometimes they stand there in awkward silence...you know what I&#39;m talking about). 

They have a nice list of wines, but I love tea so we had the Chamomile lavender. It&#39;s $4 and it comes with a pot. I think we each got a little more than 2 cups each so it was definitely worth it. I think I could&#39;ve just lived off the aroma of the tea alone, it smelt absolutely amazing. I wish I could buy this by the pound actually. Enough about the tea, on to the food. I ordered the Bavette steak (medium rare) and my friend had the Maple leaf duck(medium). Our food was cooked perfectly all the way down to the vegetables. My steak had that rich red in the center and it was tender and full of flavor. The vegetables and puree accompanied the steak very well. I am always scared to order duck so I never have. I have this fear of having overly dried duck. My friend gave me half of hers and the skin was crispy and the center was moist and nothing like I thought it would be. I liked the butternut squash gnocchi that added just the right amount of flavor to the duck. I have to mention the butter that came with the bread. It is smooth and creamy with little salt crystals on top and we devoured that just as quickly as our dinner.

The service was amazing. It wasn&#39;t very busy when we had dinner, but our waiter was attentive and my water glass was never empty. I truly enjoyed my visit here and I will undoubtedly be back for more."

The kind of impressed you would expect after spending $150 on a meal for two people.  The kind of impressed that comes from a server who can identify every ingredient in every dish, and can tell you the acreage on the farm from which the ingredients were sourced.

The food was well-prepared, the service was some of the best I have had in Denver.  The menu rotates with the season.  

My only criticism would be that the name reminds me of a cheap frozen yogurt franchise.  But I think I&#39;ll get over it."

But birthdays call for nice dinners, so it was time to use my special occasion budget.  We had a wonderfully marvelous experience.

As others have mentioned, it&#39;s cramped quarters in the dining room.  We were seated in a corner, so we at least had privacy on one side.  It took several minutes for someone to approach our table after we were seated and I was beginning to worry about the service.  But after the initial contact, we received spectacular service throughout the evening.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful and the rest of the staff, including a lovely and charming young lady serving bread and filling up our water and wine glasses, were equally attentive.

In short, our meal was phenomenal.  At the recommendation of 5280 Magazine http://www.5280.com/eatanddrink/digital/2014/05/02/best-bites-fruitions-grilled-spanish-octopus I began with the grilled Spanish octopus.  The dish was indeed quite amazing.  Mr. P ordered the asparagus salad and he kindly shared some bites with me.  For entrees, I went with the stuffed sole and he got the grilled pork tenderloin.  Our server helped us choose a bottle of wine to perfectly accompany the meal.

For dessert, we shared the German chocolate cake and ice cream.  I normally don&#39;t care for German chocolate cake but this one was a creamy dark chocolate and the ice cream was freshly made in house.  Delicious!  I also sipped on a nice after dinner blend tea from neighboring Moondance Botanicals.

Thank you, Fruition, for dazzling me on my birthday!"

I don&#39;t remember exactly what I had, but my date and I shared a bottle of wine, an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert and I believe our total was close to $200 with tip.

The restaurant itself is very small with a bunch of tables for two and I believe a few for larger groups. You definitely make a reservation, especially for weekends!"

Excellent service and good food, mostly really good food. The fact that the kitchen will not split meals I find unreasonable and pretentious. Loved the octopus. If they are going to have such a thickly sliced carpaccio at the very least they should present a steak knife as it was a battle to eat. The walleye pike was excellent.

Sadly we were not wowed. We had reservation at 9:30 PM because that&#39;s all they had left, the restaurant closes at 10! We didn&#39;t get seated until 10PM! The server did not come talk to us for about 8 minutes while we were sitting there. The host was super sweet and really inviting. We got some &#34;special&#34; craft drinks from their menu that was still in the works. The whiskey drink was wayyyyy too strong and lacked imagination. I had a tequila drink that tasted like a margharita. WORSE! It was just tequila with a bunch of lime juice. The breads were yummy otherwise.

We ordered the potato wrapped oysters and the pork belly pasta carbonara (looked like gnocchi, but I love gnocchi!). Those two dishes were really interested and delicious. I was impressed with the flavors of the potato oysters. We got the duck for our main course and really enjoyed that as well. The duck was cooked nicely. I wasn&#39;t blown away by any of the food, unfortunately. They were innovative to an extent, but I feel like the use of peas in their food was overdone and the dishes weren&#39;t super exciting. I would recommend it, but will not be visiting again.

Ambiance was crowded and loud. You will be hearing everything that your neighbor is talking about. You might as well join their table conversation and share food, you&#39;re that close. Did I mention how awful our waiter was? We could tell that he was just visiting our table as little as possible. Maybe he thought we looked like a young couple who couldn&#39;t afford it or wouldn&#39;t tip well. Far from the truth. We noticed he spent a lot of time with other tables right next to us and often visited their tables to make sure they were doing good and asked if they needed anything else. He came and got our order, stopped by to drop off the main entree, asked if we wanted dessert, and then brought us the check. Not exactly the type of service you expect when you&#39;re paying $30 per entree and your check is well over $100 for 2 people."

I cannot recommend this place enough to vegetarians, the dishes are incredibly thoughtful &amp; very flavorful. My partner had the beef crudo to start which came with an herb puree &amp; morel mushrooms, he said it was very good &amp; fresh.

The waitress was friendly and great in giving a description of the type of wine we were looking for to have with our dinner. The food....amazing.

The decor is simple yet elegant and cozy. 
There are no words that could do the food justice. I had the English Pea Bisque (to die for) which has a unique flavor that sends you off into food heaven. 
I also had the vegetarian selection which included a small starter and a small dish. The starter: tempura avocado in a bed of watercress an sliced carrots with a delicious sauce. The dish: vegetarian dumplings with a mind-blowing sofrito sauce and green beans. 
Finally, the dessert! Lemon Merengue Pie was another taste-bud flavor explosion: Graham cracker crust and topped with slightly toasted merengue, all sitting in a perfect drizzle of blueberry compote."

This restaurant has a good reputation and it&#39;s busy so I can understand a 10-15 minute wait, even with a reservation.

I liked that we were one of the last reservations on a Sunday night because it was not as loud as others have reviewed.  

We split the pasta carbonara and while it was good, it was not the best pork belly dish I&#39;ve ever had.  I&#39;d probably do a different app if I went again.  My meal, though, was excellent.  I had the duck entree and it was delicious (done medium, exactly as I ordered).  And I don&#39;t normally order duck.  My husband&#39;s entree left a little to be desired - the seafood dish with scallops and clams (there was only one of each with tons of potatoes) - and he wasn&#39;t too happy with it.  The dessert, a banana bread caramel dish, was delicious.  The french press coffee was strong and great with the dessert.

The drinks were good, but on the expensive side.  Also, it would be nice for them to add a bar for people to have a drink while waiting for their table.   Overall, a very nice evening."

Though the second strike was the lack of oysters (my first choice).  So operations isn&#39;t nailed down here. . .no way to keep cold air out - no way to keep oysters in stock


My true disappointment (for service was awesome) was the bouillabaisse scallop dish. Maybe it said scallop, if it was plural (Scallops) it was a lie.  Seriously I got one ugly shrimp thing on top (unexpected) 1 scallop and 1 clam. The rest was sauce and a LOT of potatoes. . .

They don&#39;t seem to serve pot coffee, and make you buy these french press things for the table. . so no real refills. The coffee was good . . .but I expected more.

The dessert, banana bread pudding, was good . . and we loved it.

All in all &#34;A-Okay&#34; per yelp fits the bill.  I would of given 4 stars IF the bouillabaisse wasn&#39;t such a disappointment.


So many good restaurants in Denver, this one won&#39;t get a second chance."

It was absolutely lovely. This space is small and cozy, the staff are sweet and attentive and knowledgable, and the food was fabulous.

We started with the veal sweetbreads, which were excellent. The plate as a whole was a little sweeter than I expected, but it was amazing.

I had the duck breast and my partner had the Bavette steak. Both were absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection with amazing flavors. 

We finished up with the devil&#39;s food cake and apple bread pudding for dessert.

Can&#39;t recommend highly enough. We will be back to try everything else on the menu!"

We noticed it one morning on a walk and I looked at the reviews -- we then realized we needed to come here immediately. We went on a Wednesday night and while it was full, it wasn&#39;t loud at all. A few things about the liquor -- the wine by glass list is short but that&#39;s not uncommon small restaurants like this one. Also, they do have a full service bar, and they make some mean cocktails upon request. 

Do get the pasta carbonara. The pork they used in it literally melts like butter. My fiance shoved a fork-full at me and I almost wasn&#39;t sure that it was meat at all. The waitress steered me towards their vegetarian option and I&#39;m so glad she did. She said that the vegetarian dishes are usually the chef&#39;s &#34;creative outlet&#34; and that she always got them when she ate there. After ordering it, I can see why! The option comes with 2 plates for $25, which is a fantastic deal. I had walnut butter stuffed ravioli with figs and roasted leaks dish and a roasted fennel and butternut squash cornbread dish.  Both were so unique and taste exquisite. Half the time, Ii wasn&#39;t even sure I was eating and I was so amazed at the flavors the chef coaxed out of the vegetables. 

Service is great, the restaurant is small and intimate, and the food is phenomenal. 

I definitely will be back and I will definitely encourage everyone I know to eat here."

Then call them directly and ask if there have been any cancellations. Nab one. 

Happened just like that last night. First snowy/blowy/wintery day of November and I seized the opportunity to brave the terrible weather and take my honey out to a special romantic dinner treat.

We started with the beet salad and the deconstructed pasta carbonara, which I swear had a subtle touch of truffle in the densely flavored broth. Both were ridiculously, head shakingly good. Then we each had the duck as our main course. Cooked perfectly, it was layered over the most creamy risotto, and served along with delicious preserved fig slices and frisee accenting the plate. We finished with what they call the &#34;lemon meringue pie,&#34; but it wasn&#39;t. It was &#34;Lemon Meringue Oral Orgasm&#34; on a plate. Ummmm Ummmm, way more than good. Along with a bottle of Cune Rioja Reserva dinner set us back a couple of Franklins when you include tax and tip.

Was it worth it, you ask?

Well . . . yes, if you can afford it, or if you want to show your honey that no, you really can&#39;t afford it, but you are spending it anyhow to show in some small measure how much s/he means to you.

Each dish was excellently plated with flavors to compliment the main ingredient.  The staff was extra friendly and had good recommendations for my courses.

I started with the potato-wrapped oysters Rockefeller, which was the perfect starter. Deep fried potato wrapper provided the perfect crunch to the oyster and the Parmesan leek emulsion added a soft and savory dipping sauce.

I was told the pasta carbonara was a staple since the first version of the menu so I had to order it.  Wow was this an amazing course!  A quick cut of the poached egg and it oozed all over the pasta and house cured pork belly for a spectacular combination of sweet and savory flavors.  The Cavatelli pasta was perfectly cooked al dente.  This dish is not to be missed!  It&#39;s so rich that it certainly could be shared.

The third course was the standout.  The duck breast combined with the other ingredients on the plate provided the most memorable bite of the evening.  Onion soubise with brown butter gnocchi, butternut squash and carrots, cherry jam sauce, kale chips, confit of duck leg, crispy duck skin, topped with grated smoked chestnuts - wow!  Total flavor and texture explosion.  Every bite was delicious - you have to get this entree if you like duck!

The second entree was the roasted lamb loin cooked a perfect medium rare resting on a bed of whipped black trumpet mushrooms.  There were some cracked grains plated on the mushrooms which added some more texture to the bite.  I couldn&#39;t do this dish justice as I was simply too full.

I was too full to order any dessert, but the waitress was kind enough to treat me to a taste of their bourbon ice cream and it was delicious! Nice bite of sweetness to finish off the meal. 

Everyone at the restaurant was super friendly and I would recommend this place to all my friends.  They mentioned if I give them a weeks notice the chef could prepare a tasting menu of all the courses.  Sounds spectacular! Will definitely look this place up again when I return to Denver."

The space is perfect for a group, and the food was fantastic. However, I will not bring my annual holiday party back to this place! 

A couple days before my holiday party in Dec 2015, I gave them our final total RSVP count, which included 2 children brought by a couple. It was relayed to both the restaurant and my attendees that everyone paid for their individual bill, and that each attendee would pay $8 per person for the cheese tray hors d&#39;oeuvres. At the end of the event, I expected to pay around $50 for my meal, but as my attendees were walking out the door to go to our next destination, I got slapped with a bill for over $100. Half of that charge, to their credit was correct due to some no shows we had, so I was charged for their portion of the cheese tray and I recouped that money from those people. The other half is because they charged ME for the 2 children&#39;s portions of the cheese tray, rather than the parents! Plus, they miscounted the number of attendees we had, so they charged me erroneously for 2 additional no shows for people who were actually there.

I tried on several occasions to communicate with the 2 women who own the place, to get $24 reimbursed to me, but they were too stuck on being stubborn and hard headed, than they were to provide good customer service and give me my money back. I kept getting the run around from the one woman that she had to talk to her co-owner who was in Russia. I followed up multiple times with no resolution. I mean, some companies will give a reimbursement just to keep the customer happy, even if they doubted the customer. In my case, the reimbursement that was due to me was legitimate, and they still refused to give it to me!

It&#39;s too bad that their customer service left me so bitter about the place. Like I said, the space and food were perfect (the reason it gets 2 stars instead of the deserving 1-star), and I would have loved to have held my party here again this year. But I REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE WOMEN WHO OWN THE PLACE EVER AGAIN!!"

The place really wasn&#39;t that busy, but we had to assume that at least 2 people didn&#39;t show up for their shifts.  There were two servers on.  We waited excessively long for everything.  10 minutes for water, 30 minutes for our drinks (which we had to ask twice for), 45 minutes for food, etc, overall this meal took the better part of 2 hours.

Mom and Jess both had omelettes, and enjoyed them very much.  I ordered a beef stroganoff crepe.  It was ok, nothing special and not very flavorful.  The portion sizes were about right.

I can forgive the service up to the part where I got attitude from the server when I was inquiring about our first round of drinks for the second time.  I would have been a happier customer if we had been offered an apology, a brief explanation, or a table touch by a manager, the latter of which I saw no trace of throughout the time we were here.  I doubt I&#39;ll be back based upon this first experience."

This was not remotely close to an authentic French dining experience.   We started with salads.  My wife had the Caesar and I had the salad maison with viniagrette .   They were tasty and pretty authentic, but then it was salad.   Pretty hard to mess up.   We also received a tiny bit of bread.   It was a baguette type of Frence bread, but it was in miniature and was about the size of a hot dog bun.  ????
   The entrees were a disaster.  My wife had the chicken croquettes and I had the beef  bourguignon.   French food?  Yes, but the execution was not French.   The croquettes were essentially ground up baked chicken and were served with Pommes (potatoes).   The croquettes were extremely dry and mostly tasteless unless you liberally used the Dill cream sauce that came with it.  The sauce fortunately made it palatable.    The potatoes were dry and overdone without much taste.
The bourguignon was very average.  It is a stew like dish, with beef, vegetables and mushrooms in a wine sauce.   Ordinarily it is very tasty, but La Merise&#39;s version used very tough beef and there was not a lot of it.   The vegetables were ok and the sauce was passable.   The dish had a small spoonful of mashed potatoes in the middle of it.   Ok, but not outstanding by any means.
The best part of the meal was the dessert.   We both had the crepes with banana and chocolate and I had mine with ice cream.    The dessert was actually quite good and I could honestly recommend this part of the meal.   We had a French dessert wine with the crepes and the wine was fabulous.   The portion and the price was not.   We received less than an inch of wine in the bottom of the glass for $12.00 each.   
Overall I would go elsewhere for good French food.  The most authentic part of the experience was the tiny portions.   The food was merely average or worse and was absurdly expensive for what you got.     We both had a salad, an entree and a dessert with a glass of dessert wine.  I had an additional glass of house white wine with dinner.   The bill with a 20% tip came to $150.00.     Save the $ and go elsewhere.    In Paris, a meal such as this would have been absolutely delicious and the cost would have been roughly half of what we paid at La Marise.   If they are going to charge as much as they do, they need to up their quality substantially and their portion size as well."

Resigning to calling it fate, we allowed the tractor beams to pull us in...

Right away we noticed a very friendly and neighborhood-ish vibe. It seemed immediately clear that the people sitting outside on the patio were regulars - which definitely served to augment our perception of what we were getting into. 

The inside was gorgeous, with a low-ceiling and very French feeling to it. Surely, this would be a great place to enjoy a meal, say, in the Winter, but it was Spring - so we sat outside. The maitre d&#39; was genuinely French, which was awesome - but we were handed off to a very American server. Of course, he was equally awesome, and knew a considerable amount about the menu and wine list without any tentative delay (a true plus at a French restaurant). 

We ordered the Salmon Cote d&#39;Azur, as I had relatively recently returned from the riviera, and had this dish during my time there. Additionally, we ordered the Warm Ahi Tuna Nicoise. Both were plated beautifully, and had great flavor. I&#39;d say that the Salmon was very close to what I had remembered.

The reason I&#39;m giving 4 stars is simply due to the price:quality ratio. Although the dishes were great, they weren&#39;t amazing. There wasn&#39;t much Tuna on the plate with the Nicoise, and the Salmon had some fairly bland notes in the garnishing. Still quite delicious, but for the price, I didn&#39;t find enough of a draw for me to crave a return."

I came here for my birthday lunch with a bunch of girl friends and we thought they had brunch all day but apparently it&#39;s only on weekends. Nevertheless, the lunch menu was equally enticing. 

The first thing I noticed was how unique their interior decor was. One side of their entire wall was lined with empty wine bottles and the environment was very chill. The tables were wooden and just complemented the whole chill, european vibe all together. 

The starter was bread with butter which was pretty standard. My friend and I shared a plate of the garlic mussels. We did not anticipate the huge portion size and we had thought it would be more like an appetizer size. There were at least 40 mussels and it was delicious! They don&#39;t give you bread with it, however, so we just asked for refills of the starter bread and the waiter was very accommodating. For my main meal, I ordered the guyere cheese and ham sandwich. It&#39;s also huge and came with two sandwiches and a bunch of delicious fries. My friend I should have split the sandwich and mussels since we were stuffed and I had to take half the sandwich home. The french fries are very crisp and coated with parmesan and basil. The sandwich was definitely very unique. The outside is coated with cheese and they grilled it so it&#39;s a crispy texture and everything just tasted great together. 

Overall, great ambience, delicious food, reasonable price, and a good time!"

Friendly and professional service in a quaint little restaurant in Cherry Creek.  This location has been a couple of different establishments since I moved here in 2002, and I hope this one stays.
Older, not typical trendy Cherry Creek atmosphere, but of a cozy place like it has been here for years.

Great wine selection and we went for smaller items instead of full entrees and definitely left here stuffed for dinner.  We made a reservation for 7PM and were seated promptly on at Saturday night, the restaurant was full so I recommend reservations for a weekend night.

A friend recommended the cheese plate, which we ordered.  It was good and nice cuts of 4 cheeses (brie, blue cheese, not sure on the 3rd but a mild cheddar type cheese, and 4 crostinis with a soft spread cheese), it came with grapes, apple slices, and crostini.  Loved this plate, however I recommend a little more fruit (maybe less crostini and maybe a thin sliced pear for the cheeses.  I was paring the cheese with the grapes and that part was wonderful.

We ordered the mussels based on Yelp recommendations (which did not disappoint).  Typical CO restaurant sized mussels and some people mentioned that the broth was so good ask for extra bread.  Here is where I disagree, the broth was so good I would skip the bread and just use a spoon and soak it up like a soup.  The white wine broth has great notes of garlic, a light crème, and maybe shallots and parsley.  I would definitely come back for this.

My husband got the house salad and I ordered the beat salad.  These items were both good, but we were already getting full at this point.  My husband also ordered the soup of the day, which was a New England style fish chowder (halibut) which I did have a bite and it was flavorful

Other Yelp recommendation was to get the Chocolate mousse...OK remember I said when I was getting full?  I was going to get an order to go, but since my husband ordered a port wine, I decided to order a coffee and the chocolate mousse with too spoons.  HEAVENLY....home made whipped cream and a creamy and rich chocolaty experience that went well with their coffee which was just right.

We will definitely be back.  Next time I will not be so gluttonous and order the mussels, the beet salad, and chocolate mousse with coffee..

I will be back oui oui, tout simplement magnifique! Oh and I haven&#39;t been to Le Central in a long time, but I would say that this place definitely beats them."

Now for the food: the escargot was tasty but the foie gras was unexplainably untasty. The steak au poivre was decent, very tender and juicy. So were the lambchops. Small portions but what lacked in quantity made up in quality. (Still overpriced though)

The service SUCKED and we both work in the restaurant service industry. They rushed us and brought out the dessert before we even finished eating and the waitress was uncaring (we were so nice why?!?!?) 

Overall, okay food, bad service, not worth the price."

I have been a faithful patron of this restaurant for years, but on Sunday we were asked to leave right after settling the check, as they had many reservations and needed the table.  I wrote to Le Merise directly on Sunday, hoping they would be able to assure that this was not becoming normal practice, but my complaint was not addressed.  In fact, it was not even acknowledged.

I had the breakfast pancakes, which were delicious!  Cottage cheese pancakes that come with butter soft enough to melt as soon as you put it on, a tasty berry compote, and perfectly cooked bacon.  The coffee is excellent, and fresh squeezed orange juice is always a treat.

My husband and I were actually on our way to another breakfast place this morning when we walked by Merise, saw large, inviting, shaded patio dining area and just couldn&#39;t pass it up. The indoor dining space is cute too, but I love a shaded patio!

We were served water and a small basket of baguette slices, jam and REAL butter shortly after we were seated. The coffee was good, and very hot. Plus, they have fresh squeezed orange juice! Always a must have in my book!

The brunch menu features quite a few stuffed, savory crapes. I tried the florentine. It was decent, I didn&#39;t like that it was covered in sauce, and seemed a little cold. My husband ordered the Breakfast Pancakes, which were described as cottage cheese pancakes on the menu...I wasn&#39;t sure how that would turn out, but they were DELICIOUS! They were small, fluffy and came with a blackberry compote and, of course, more butter.
While, the place we were originally headed is still our favorite in Cherry Creek, Merise did not let us down."

I was pleasantly surprised. We sat on the terrace which was nice. Inside the restaurant was mostly empty. Great wine by the glass with the most generous pour around- OK it was $10 a glass but a great French wine. I had two glasses which had to be 2/3rd of a bottle. Appetizer of muscles were way above average for most fine restaurants in Denver. Well prepared. I had a tenderloin peppered steak with a white cognac sauce which was absolutely to die for. My wife raved about her trout. My escalloped potatoes were a perfect cube on my plate (how do they do that) and delicious. Service was perfect. The bill seemed fair. Can&#39;t wait to go back.

A friend and I went today for lunch and I ended up spending $26 for a small bowl of onion soup (which was very good) and a small house salad  (key word here is small) to which I added shrimp (five medium sized very delicious ones) with only water for a beverage.  To add the shrimp to the salad of about five leaves of lettuce and four slices of cucumber cost me an additional $9.  My friend had the same thing plus desert.  The two of us also shared three small pieces of French bread in a basket placed on our table when we sat down.  The food was good-not outstanding-and way over-priced for what you get.  However, the worst part of the meal was the waitress (who had a French or maybe German accent) who took our order.  The only words she said to us were, &#34;Do you want anything to drink&#34; and &#34;Have you decided what you want to eat?&#34;  She never smiled or said a nice word or asked how our lunches were or acted like there was any reason for us to enjoy having lunch there.  She also got a little nasty when she took away a plate which we then asked to have back because we told her we weren&#39;t finished eating yet.  Luckily, she soon disappeared and a very nice and accommodating young man took over and treated us very well.

If you can&#39;t be bothered to Google the correct spelling and accentuation of French dishes, you have no business overcharging for them. 

The onion soup was, well, onion soup. The Caesar salad was oily and just shy of wilted. I didn&#39;t bother ordering any of the misspelled dishes.

Perhaps I&#39;m biased; granted, my bf and I had our first date here (and many months later are still going strong) and we continue to frequent La Merise for the fabulous wine, phenomenal food, and great company. But I can&#39;t think of another place where the waitstaff are so genuinely friendly; where they get to personally know their customers, and where the food is so consistently excellent.  La Merise has a very consistent and loyal following from local Cherry Creek residents like me.  This is not a restaurant for suburbanites looking for the Elway&#39;s or North experience just up the street.  This is a restaurant for great food and great wine without a douchy &#34;scene&#34; attached to it.  Try the Steak Au Poivre for $29 and it will give Elway&#39;s a run for it&#39;s money for $20 less, guaranteed.

The restaurant was decorated with gold balloons on the ceiling, and we assumed there must be a private party or something.

When we were seated, we were each brought a small taste of champagne wih a strawberry in it, and we were told it was the restaurant&#39;s one year anniversary celebration.  What a nice touch!

I ordered a glass of the Bordeaux that was on special for $8 a glass.  It was a lovely wine, and they gave a very generous pour.

There was a special beet, orange and endive salad that I had from the specials menu.  It was delicious with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts.  It was a nice sized portion, and I wish I hadn&#39;t eaten it all as I ended up being too full to finish my dinner.

I had the salmon for dinner...another large portion that was cooked perfectly to order.  The spinach it came with was also tasty.  My friend got the seafood stew special which was filled with clams, mussels and other fish that looked fantasic.  She enjoyed it.

We were brought a piece of strawberry cake for dessert as part of their anniversary celebration.  The cake was delicious.

The service was good, and the waitress didn&#39;t mind splitting our check.

The reason for the 1.5 reduction was the steak was a bit  tough. I would forgive them if the steak was a skirt / hanger (which they do not appear to offer) but it was thick sirloin.

Nice evening, pedestrian friendly sidewalks, restaurants with nice patios everywhere.  La Merise is a nice French restaurant where we decided to give it a go just on a whim.  We started with a beer and a house wine which was reasonably priced at five dollars and the red was quite smooth.  
We started with an appetizer of mussels.  The mussels came out promptly and were very delicious.  Nice white wine cream based sauce.  I wish they had more bread with it.  I then ordered the steak and frites.  I&#39;m not sure if this is part of the French dining experience, but it took a long time for the food to come out.  Like I said, it was a nice evening and the wine helps pass the evening, but eventually, you just get hungry.  
When my steak and frites came out, the steak was well done and I had asked for medium.  The server was very apologetic about it and asked to correct the issue.  It took little longer for it to come out again and unfortunately, it was well done again.

The crab salad consisted of a pile of lettuce, a pile of avocado, and a small pile of crab.  Nothing worth returning for.  The service was missing in action.  We waited forever for our food.

Our waitress was nice and smiled even when my friend, aka Beotch, decided to, in a very snarky manner, complain about his iced tea. She removed it quickly and brought him over a bottle of some new &#39;wham-a-dine&#39; tea and apologized. After she walked away; I gave Beotch a verbal beating..... like I was Joan Crawford with a wire hanger. 
I shared the escargot with another friend to start (Beotch was in a time out).....the butter and herbs were overflowing; so, instead of faining concern for our waste lines we dug in like troppers. We practically ate a loaf of bread dunked in all the butter. YUM!
I followed up with the Tartine Au Poulet. This is an OPEN FACE sandwiche consisting of grilled chix breast on large slices of toasted bread topped with brie. with fries. It was wonderful! 
One of my cohorts ordered the Chicken Croquettes. It was very good, too. This friend is from the midwest and complained about the portion size (I thought it was fine, after all this isn&#39;t the Golden Corral). The dill sauce was very good and the rice pilaf...oh, so good!
Beotch ordered the Croque Monsier. Now, this is a SANDWICHE. I was really good. I mean really good. ....and you know what? He wouldn&#39;t share...the heifer!! And! he complaind about the time it took for the food to come out.
Now, I kinda agree that the kitchen &#39;seems&#39; slow until you take into consideration that the food it excellent and it takes time to prepare correctly....and it&#39;s French. So, slow down and enjoy your company and your lunch.

When we arrived we presented the coupon and were kicked out. They said they no longer honored it (even though we had three weeks til expiration) and then guided us back out. We would have still had dinner there but the hostess? Alana was so rude that we refuse to enter that place again. I called later and asked for a manager and &#34;Alana&#34; said that she was the manager. when asked for a last name she hung up on me. I was really hoping to try the food but with such horrible first impression, I chose not. We tried some other places in the neighborhood and apparently La Merise has a bad reputation. Too bad. Can&#39;t comment on food, but service is the worst we have ever, ever experienced."

Tried the foie gras which was runny and couldn&#39;t even be tasted among the huge quantity of jam.  Definitely not as good as reviewed in the Post.  Fish Stew was average.  Bananas foster for dessert was the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  Again, more like bananas floating in soup.  Terrible.  We wouldn&#39;t go again."

The food itself is-- well, not super authentically French and actually not that great, especially for the prices. However, the wine list is pretty decent and offers wines by the glass. It&#39;s a large pour for very reasonable prices and the service we had was very good. I also enjoyed the bread, which they kept bringing us, along with what seemed like French butter. I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d ever make a special trip here again, but I could see stopping by the bar for a glass of wine and a snack of some sort."

When I first walked in it was as if I had just been transported to another world, Europe! The ambiance is elegant, yet not pretentious. Their staff is friendly and helpful. It is hard to believe this is a &#34;hole in the wall&#34; type of business once you&#39;re inside. This restaurant is a cut above the rest. I did not end up ordering the foie gras as I had intended (at $25 is a tad steep but maybe next time), I had the steak pouvre instead. The steak was very tender, well seasoned and juicy. I also had the creme brulee, just because I love it. The portions are not enormous as the typical American restaurant offers but reasonably sized. The tables are not big, which facilitates a more intimate interaction with their customers, candlelight included. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant!"

I came upon it when a friend and I were to meet at the Argyll in Cherry Creek. To our surprise we found that it is no longer in business and is now the home of La Merise, we decided to give it a go and were happy we did. The brunch was delicious, and the $9 bottomless mimosas and bellinis were a huge plus. I kept it simple with the French Toast tpped with a creme anglaze and fresh fruit which was amazing, and my friend had a crepe I forget which it was/what it was called -it had spinach, feta, calamata olives... We both thoroughly enjoyed our choices. 

It was just the 4th day open but you wouldn&#39;t have known it, our server (who was on his first shift ever at La Merise) was confident and very helpful with the menu. He made us feel comfortable and welcomed... so much so that we sat there chatting for about three hours! Throughout, we were topped off with bellinis and water and enjoyed the very friendly and professional service. We will absolutely return to La Merise. I highly recommend it."

The ambience of the place is quaint but beautiful. My date loved the small tables with candles, flowers and white linens. We were able to sit promptly and recieved great service even though they were very busy. Our first round of drinks came quickly and our server was very pleasant. 
For the first course we had the mussels and escargot. Both dishes were delicious and I would recommend either appetizer. The mussels were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  
For entrees I had the steak au poivre and she had the trout. My steak was done just right and the rich sauce was delicious with a little bit of spice which I liked. The trout was light, yet a nice size entree that she thouroughly enjoyed.  I thought the sauce for that dish excellent as well. 
For dessert we had the chocolate torte cake. I think it was a flourless cake. It was amazing. I love chocolate and this thing was chocolate heaven. We also shared a bottle of a French Bordeaux from the list that was really nice for the price point. Overall I thought La Merise was a great french dining experience and a perfect addition to the area. Thanks La Merise, we&#39;ll be back."

My companion and I stumbled upon La Merise recently and discovered a new favorite! We were cheerfully greeted and promptly seated at a table in the bustling dining room. Our waiter arrived and gave us some direction on the wine list and informed us of the specials for the evening. As our evening moved along we couldn&#39;t help to notice how well done everything is done here. We truly felt as though we were sitting in a French restaurant in New York City. Cozy, sophisticated and buzzing with tables full of happy diners sharing good conversation and great wine.

They were packed, probably due to a Travelzoo deal (which we benefitted from), but, because of this, we had the worst table in the house, and no possibility of moving... oh, well.  They say &#34;good food takes time&#34; which applied here, but at least it was worth the wait.
  We started with the house red (French) which was fine and a French Martini, very good.  Very basic french bread, like that from Safeway.  The foie gras was excellent, new to us, served in a tiny iron skillet with a biscuit, sauteed grapes, over some mashed potatoes. However, at $23.95 we would not have indulged without our Travelzoo voucher.  We both had the Steak au poivre, an excellent filet with a cognac peppercream sauce.  The scalloped potatoes were better than the mashed, and the veggie side, roasted carrots and sweet potatoes were yummy.  For dessert, the crepes suzette was terrific.  Coffee was fine, but I was surprised they served Coffeemate with it!
   Service was pleasant, although they did not check on us after the main course arrived, and I would have ordered more wine.
   One odd thing, I&#39;ve never encountered in a restaurant before, a woman was walking around with a brochure raising money for some Asian charity, not a welcome intrusion.
    This restaurant is off to a great start, they have a lovely menu of good, solid French cuisine, and I hope they do well!"

The manager refused to make any amends. As for the food, the Caesar salad was sent back because it was very bitter. $10 for a tiny salad was outrageous. The crab stuffed advocado was very good but $17 was too much. The lamb and potatoes were both good. The steak was good but a bit overcooked.

Food seemed very microwaved, I&#39;m not stating that it is the case, just how it seems because certain foods will come out a bit odd like the cheese fries, either they undertook the fries or the microwaving to melt the cheese makes the fries soggy, not sure. They must have a fryer though because the onion rings came out pretty normal.

Right when we enter, there are like a couple of &#34;flies&#34; flying around at the Waiting Area.  Hmmm, is this a norm??

We had to wait for about 10 to 15 minutes at the waiting area.  The personnel behind the &#34;waiting booth&#34; gave us the &#34;electronic flashing token&#34;.  Actually I do not want to wait but since we are already there, we just go with the flow.  Man at that time, this establishment is packed to the brim.  Perhaps for one it was a Sunday.  Duh!  Plenty of TV screens for you to catch the NFL game which was airing that evening.  Plenty of patrons bringing their family there too including kids.

About 10 minutes later, we are ushered to one of the Booth seating.  Err for one, personally, for 2 person its a little too cramp for my liking.  Then they show the &#34;in-thing&#34; technology, like the &#34;ordering TABLET&#34; if you want to order your Appetizers or Play Games online etc.  YES, they are in the technology, but that &#34;TABLET&#34; alone took up a lot of space for our so call cramp dining table.

Anyways we went on to order from the Restaurant Menu.

*  Texas Cheese Fries WITHOUT BACON - Full ORDER ($7.69)
Topped with Monterey &amp; Pepper Jack and Cheddar Cheese, Jalapeños &amp; Green Onions. Served with house-made ranch dressing

*  Classic Sirloin* - 10oz Sirloin with Customize Combination ($17.49)
100% USDA Choice Sirloin with Chili&#39;s seasoning &amp; topped with garlic butter. Served with loaded mashed potatoes (WITHOUT BACON) &amp; steamed broccoli.  I opt to have Seared Shrimp with my Main Entrée order.  

*  Classic Sirloin* - ($16.19)
100% USDA Choice Sirloin with Chili&#39;s seasoning &amp; topped with garlic butter. Served with loaded mashed potatoes (WITHOUT BACON) &amp; steamed broccoli.  I think Hubs ordered the 12oz Sirloin for his Main Entrée. 

For our beverages, Hubs opt to have Coffee ($2.19) and Fountain Drink ($2.39) while I opt to have water.

The food came out on a timely manner.  But as for our appetizer of Texas Cheese Fries WITHOUT BACON, er those can do better.  I was disappointed with our order Appetizer.  It went COLD so fast.  Those Texas Cheese Fries, DO NOT WOW me.  *SAD FACE INDEED*

Hubs said the appetizers are OK.  Hubs wasn&#39;t feeling that good that evening.  THANK GOD we live close by, managed to pack our food and Hubs Dinner in TO GO Boxes.  Hubs ate his Dinner at home and he like his order of Customize Combination of the Sirloin.

Service was OK.  That evening our Main Server her name is Kayla.

But I think Chili&#39;s can do better.  Personally from what I observed and have, I rate them 2.5 stars, but with 3 stars for Service.  Maybe we ordered the wrong item that evening.  Nothing stellar nothing fancy.  YES there are plenty of items to choose, but I WONT BE in a HURRY to return.  *SIGH*

They have the two for 20 where you can pick a appetizer and two meals for 20 bucks. Great value specially since they listed the fajitas on there which some of the best! However, I feel like they have gone down hill in quality. The fajitas are still decent but they just don&#39;t taste as fresh as they once did. One of my other favorites was the chicken crispers. They come with fries and corn on the cob. The corn is the best part of that plate now that the chicken crispers are soggy every time I receive them. They seem to have changed their margaritas up also which is a bummer. One of my old favorite places is no longer a favorite..."

The egg rolls were good but the chicken was overcooked and the burgers were undercooked. Solid pink in the middle is not how a burger should be.

Well, you&#39;d be wrong.  First, I had a craving for Chicken Fried Steak, so we ventured to this location because it&#39;s pretty close to home.  We should have just braved the rush hour traffic and traveled the extra distance and gone to BJ&#39;s like we originally planned.  

I had the trio fajitas with steak, chicken, and shrimp.  Whoever cut that steak had NO CLUE what they were doing, and the result was a shoe leather tough steak.  The chicken and the shrimp were good, but the steak ruined it.  After informing our waitress (who was pretty attentive and accommodating), that nasty steak was replaced with the carnitas.  The carnitas were good, but i feel like it didn&#39;t make up for the faux pas of the steak.  I wound up bringing most of my meal home since I was just so perturbed at that point.

My mom had the margarita chicken and Dr. Pepper baby backs.  She said they were okay, but she agreed that we should have gone to BJ&#39;s.  We&#39;ll definitely take the trek a few extra miles in the opposite direction to get what we want.  You live and you learn, I guess..."

The restaurant however needs to get it together. This is the only restaurant in the area at the moment - so they are always slammed.

Two of my to-go orders have been lost. Each time, after waiting 30 minutes to leave my place to pick up the food since they said it&#39;d be ready in 40 - I get there - wait in line for 10 minutes to get my food - only to find out the entire orders has to be re-entered and then I sit for another 40 minutes waiting on the food. What really burns me is that there&#39;s never an apology, or a discount. There is no attempt to redeem themselves. And, the last time, you could tell the manager was there trying to help keep the orders straight.

When we ate inside we were waited on by someone claiming to regularly be a bartender. She was just as direct as a bartender, so it makes sense. But, well, I left with mixed feelings about the experience. She pulled out some card about girls ordering first. Look, we were a large group, let us order in order by person if that&#39;s what we wish. I have special order needs due to allergies and my partner helps me out as he worked for Chili&#39;s for years. Not only was I made terribly uncomfortable, the order was screwed up by her enforcement of her system. But then, she brings me a box without me needing to ask for it and makes it all happy and themed for the season. I felt appreciated as a customer, but only after being &#34;scolded&#34; for our way of ordering in order by person.

There wasn&#39;t a wait, to our surprise, when we went in to eat. Which was awesome. The drinks kept coming. But, the staff needs to treat the customers better - and they need to figure out how to handle the high volume of to-go orders. The music is way, way, way too quiet - always."

Decided on the 2 for $20 dinner. I got the chicken fajitas and my son got the 6oz steak. We did get an appetizer  with meal and we chose a flatbread with chicken. Small, 4 pieces, but tasty.  Fajitas were acceptable although the chicken had no spices at all which made the dish bland. No salsa on the table so had to ask for that and it made the dish better. Enough food so the portion size was good. The steak was a fair steak, came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The staff was friendly, attentive, made you welcome and seemed to be enjoying their jobs. All in all an acceptable atmosphere (if you like kids) and food."

They have an online ordering system that lets to you place an order ahead of time so that you can just pick it up and go.  THe food is decent, nothing fancy just your typical burgers and other grilled items.  Over the past few weeks ive had the bonless chicken wings, the bone in chicken wings, the monterey chicken, honey chipotle crispers, and the mango tilapia.  

I prefer the bone in wings vs the boneless wings, really only because dark meat over white meat.  You get about 8 wings per order, 4 lil drums and 4 wing pieces with celery sticks and your choice of blue cheese or ranch dressing.  

I wasnt a big fan of the monterey chicken, it came out a little dry, but i did enjoy the sides of the mashed potatoes and the corn on the cob.

THe honey chipotle crispers were good but the sauce was a little too sweet. Next time i will probably order the regular chrispers and ask for a side of bbq.

I was impressed with the mango tilapia.  Probably the best dish so far, and pretty healthy interms of calorie count.  It came with a side of rice and brocolli.  The tilapia was grilled and topped with mango and avacado.  

Overall the value is decent, especially if you sign up for their email club,  you usually get coupons for free dessert or appetizer with an entree order.  Works out pretty good if your not ordering from the 2 for $20 menu, which is a good value."

Every time I go though the hosts/hostesses have no enthusiasm or let alone a smile on their face. Working in customer service I can&#39;t stand be greeted without a smile. Small, but it&#39;s important to me.

I love the food and the 2 for $20 meal deal. I always get the steak, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed. If it wasn&#39;t for the food I&#39;d probably never go there because the service, like I said is hit or miss."

When I eat there, I feel like I am not eating food. That is a hard concept to explain, but it is like the food looks like food, some of it tastes like food, but it isn&#39;t really food, in the same way that the stuff at Sonic isn&#39;t food. You go there to eat, not to dine, or nourish your soul, or feel better than before you went there, you just go to fill your stomach. And that is what my recent visit to the Tower road location was like. I must say that they do have a competitor in this regard, and that is Ruby Tuesday."

Do people really have two hour lunch breaks?  Because it always took us at least 90 minutes to get through a meal there.

Many of the lunch specials come with endless chips.  They were always running out of chips.  You are a national chain restaurant.  Surely you can estimate, after serving thousands of customers nationwide, how many chips a given location should order.

The service was half-hearted.  Waters weren&#39;t refilled very frequently.  We had to wait a long time to order and the waitress rarely came to check up on us (get more chips, replace a fallen utensil, etc.).

After two or three trips, we just stopped going.  Methinks not, indeed."

Same ole&#39; thing, and we get the same exact appetizer, meal and dessert always. The Texas Cheese Fries tasted like they collected everyone&#39;s leftover fries threw some cheese on it and served. Mine and my daughters burgers were dry and the buns hard. Annoyed but not having high hopes to began with, we ordered our usual dessert but to go, and that&#39;s when I decided to write a review.

The to go aspect is a complete joke. If you choose this option please check your entire order carefully before you leave. What you may have typed in online is definitely not what you&#39;ll receive. The last 3 to go orders I have ordered for family has been wrong. Just tonight, food was 20 minutes past wait time. Thanks for the extra scoop of ice cream after I already paid for extra scoops. 2 people came back in missing items from their orders while I was waiting. The queso fresco salad is missing the queso and had the wrong dressing. The burger had sauce when it wasn&#39;t supposed to, and was cold. Our side of lettuce for the burger had the other veggies-which we are allergic to- simply pulled back out. How do I know? The tomato seeds on the lettuce gave it away. Chili&#39;s- you suck.

Our server was over right away and took our drink order. Our drinks came right away and we ordered the sampler with sliders, cheese curds, and buffalo chicken tenders.  My strawberry lemonade was extremely weak; each time the server brought another, which took a while each time, they were weaker and weaker until they were slightly pink.  

The appetizer came within a reasonable amount of time. The cheese curds and sliders were good. The Buffalo chicken tenders were small, but good. Overall I didn&#39;t feel like it was a good portioned amount for what it cost.

My entree of loaded baked potato soup with a side of mac and cheese and my girlfriend&#39;s buffalo chicken sandwich arrived quite a while after our appetizer.  The soup and mac and cheese were great, no complaints. The Buffalo chicken had almost no sauce on it. The sandwich was good, the chicken juicy, but without sauce it was very bland.  The fries.......were cold! I couldn&#39;t believe it.

Overall two stars for the slow service and below par food. Chili&#39;s, I know you are better than this....."

The chicken fajitas were AWFUL.  There was no spice in the cooked chicken.  The onions had a BAD flavor to them, heavy of smoke and just not right at all.  The green peppers were under-cooked.

The food has always been good, though they often forget sides that are asked for (particularly anytime I ask for a side of BBQ sauce for some reason). Overall good though, I&#39;ll be back for more."

We came in one night for a drink and dessert. Both bartenders and the manager came over, introduced themselves, and struck up conversations. The margarita was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had and the service couldn&#39;t have been better. Looking forward to a return visit!"

The server, Tegan, was clearly in the weeds at the bar, she was flustered and really let it show. I witnessed the manager give her more of a sympathetic shoulder wiggle than any actual assistance, and her obvious nonchalant attitude was seriously infuriating. Our skillet queso showed up sans skillet, and about fifteen minutes later, Tegan finally took our order then. We stayed in good spirits, even though we were in a hurry, and ended up just staying there and eating a desert along with our apps. We weren&#39;t hungry anymore, so I took the bag of Togo food home, and never gave it a second glance, it would be my meal for my double the next day at work. When I went to eat my food I realized it wasn&#39;t even there, the only food I had for the day wasn&#39;t even there! Chili&#39;s was closed by the time I got off work, and you just know you can&#39;t go back after an entire day has passed. I wasn&#39;t do disappointed with the bartender, as it was clear she was doing everything she can, but shame on management, for poor staffing on a Friday night, and not doing anything while your team clearly struggled."

Placed my order online which was easy!  Said my order would be ready at 12:25pm on a Friday.  I got there at 12:20pm so that I made sure my food didn&#39;t sit for too long.  Went in and to the bar (per the sign on the To-Go counter).  A lady walked by and said, &#34;one moment.&#34;  5 minutes later and watching multiple staff stand around talking that same lady came back and asked if I had a To-Go order.  She told me my total and I told her I paid online.  She said that it didn&#39;t go through.  I asked her to check.  As she was checking I looked on my phone and noticed that the amount was taken from my bank account.  I explained that it went through.  She insisted I pay again. She went and got the manager who also said I didn&#39;t pay yet.  I was about ready to walk out.  They realized that I did pay and off I went.  I got home (2 miles away).  I opened the food and it did not look good.  I ordered chicken with sweet potato fries.  The chicken was cold and the fries were extremely soggy from the juices of the chicken.  We both ate about 1/2 of our food and the rest went to the dogs.  Was really bummed as the To-Go option was very handy thought when pizza just isn&#39;t what we&#39;re craving."

But if you want something quick, cheap, and dependable and a better-than-average margarita, you could do worse. And we had really fabulous service today. My son didn&#39;t eat his chicken (he thought it was too spicy). We didn&#39;t see the point in complaining about it, but they noticed, comped the chicken, and asked us if we&#39;d like them to make some plain chicken for us to take home.

Ambience is nice and it was not too loud. We were seated pretty quickly and our server was attentive and gave his opinions on what&#39;s best. We ordered queso with spinach appetizer which was delicious!!! we all loved it. It came with chips and salsa. 
I ordered a black bean veggie burger! A little disappointing at first because the server brought it in a burger which looked like meat to me. He was staring at it and was questioning it himself. I told him that it doesn&#39;t look right to me and he agreed and had it switched. So, no foul there! However, I was still upset because I have been a vegetarian all my life and I would hate to think this could have been the reason for my frantically crying at a restaurant!
The burger that he went and replaced was delicious and he even gave me extra guacamole on the side for my burger. I loved the flavors. It came with french fries. I was too full from the queso to really eat anything. The order did take a really long time to come. Something else that I felt wasn&#39;t appropriate is that they did not bring our check out 20 minutes after we asked for it. This was after we had to seek them out to ask for a check. We found another server and asked them to bring our check- not good customer service right there!!!"

Boyfriend and I both got different kinds of their &#34;smothered burritos&#34; and they were pretty pricey for how bland they were. The burritos are nothing but rice and some meat. We also ordered the two for one margaritas and they had barely any alcohol in them, if any at all. It&#39;s like you pay for one drink and they just split it into two. Our waiter was very nice and served us quickly. The appetizers were so good!! Definitely try the new queso items. The reason for the two stars was because I felt like I got ripped off. Burritos at taco bell have more flavor and are almost as good for 1/5 of the price. I don&#39;t really recommend this location. It isn&#39;t the worst but it isn&#39;t very great either."

I  should have walked out right away because  when I was waiting at the bar to get my food, there was a continuous yelling and screaming match coming from the kitchen. I  waited about 15 minutes to get my food after calling in my order 30  minutes beforehand.  As I was waiting I noticed all the other customers sitting at the bar trying to decide if they should leave or wait for their food as they too were listening to the fighting match in the kitchen.
I ordered a cheeseburger and repeated over and over that it had to be well done,  even burnt was good. The woman taking my order agreed and stated that she would be sure it came out that way. 
I arrived home and my burger was so pink in the middle that I  couldn&#39;t  eat it.  So between the loud and constant fighting match in the kitchen that I  endured  while waiting for my food and now the uncooked burger,  I  decided to call and ask for the Manager.  This was at approximately 4pm. I  was told both managers were busy at the moment and the kind young man stated he would take my phone number and one of them would call me back.   It&#39;s now 9am the following day,  and I  have yet to hear from anyone at Chili&#39;s. 
This used to be a great place I would frequent with friends and family.  Over the last 3-4 months the quality of food has gone down and after yesterday&#39;s  experience,  the management has showed me that they just don&#39;t  care anymore.   I  will NEVER return!"

It was around 1459 calories with over 850 of them from fat. 

The flatbread fell flat. I guess I should have expected that. It was more visually appealing than anything. The taste was all right but the texture of the flatbread was definitely unremarkable. There was also a lot of mayo-like sauce on top which is probably where all those added calories come from. 

Do not come here if you are in anyway counting calories. 

Other than that, this place is pretty clean and they have happy hours on margaritas where you can buy one and get one free. 

They have a digital device that allows you to split the bill and pay by card but I didn&#39;t see anyone use it."

This location, however, has failed me each time.

We like to sit in the bar/lounge, as there are TVs with constant sports on, and my husband can happily sit there with his 2 beer. The lounge was fairly empty today when we went in around 2 and we yet again experienced less than stellar service.

First off, super dirty menus. Menus stay at your table in the lounge, which makes me think they aren&#39;t looked after. Mine was sticky and had food stuck to it, which I don&#39;t even understand as you generally look at it before food arrives. Gross. But, that being said, the menu is fairly large and offers a wide variety of treats.

I had my usual margaritas and husband had his beer. My first sip of my margarita consisted of a blob of salt. Gross. The rest of the time, they were fine. Noted, ask for no salt. 

We had the 2 for $20 meal and our chips and guacamole were brought out promptly. Guac badly needed salt and after it was added, it was much better. The top was also black, meaning it had been sitting out and had oxidized. Not awesome. Our entrees arrived a bit later and both were quite tasty. My shrimp tacos came with a side of beans, that were more mystery liquid than beans. Kinda like a bean soup. Delicious, but soup.

We finished as much as we could and sat at our table with our plates. And waited. Our server was also the bartender and was having an in depth conversation with two gentlemen at the bar. To the point where after 5+minutes, we had to ask the other server for boxes to pack up our meals. We did some packing and continued to sit there, right in plain view of the bar. The waiting continued and the other server finally return to take away our plates. Our brilliant server saw this and brought us our bill. I wished our tip could be a legit tip to not ignore your one other table.

If you&#39;re looking for delicious food, Chili&#39;s can usually be counted on to deliver. If you&#39;re looking for awesome, prompt service, definitely hit another location. Both times we&#39;ve been here, it&#39;s been like this and for no apparent reason. 3 stars are purely for my tacos. Try them. They&#39;re delicious."

Literally stood at the door for 10 minutes waiting for a host... no host came so i decided to go up to the bartender and ran into the manager on my way there and told him our party and a few others had been waiting for a while to be seated. He didn&#39;t care but did seat us. Our waitress never came... some other girl took over her table. The fried pickles were delicious. I ordered soup and a burger as well and noticed my soup spoon was dirty so i asked for a clean one. The waitress said &#34;we ran out of spoons, here&#39;s a plastic one&#34;. How on earth do you run out of silverware you make people eat with plasticware? My friend ordered a thousand island salad.. minutes later she comes back &#34;sorry we have no thousand island for our thousand island salad&#34; he ended up getting ranch. When my burger finally came out almost an hour after being seated... I HAD A STALE BUN!!!!!! Disgusting!!!! We paid on the little machine and left the waitress a $0.00 tip. NEVER EVER going back to this Chilis!!!"

Who ever was cooking knew what they were doing. You can now pay right at the table with out dealing with the cashier. If the machine runs out of paper you just tell your easier/waitress and they will give you a full receipt. As I said much as improved.

We couldn&#39;t decide where to go, but I really wanted a steak. The other half did not, so we chose Chili&#39;s to have some variety. We were seated right away, which always makes me happy on a Friday night. I decided to try one of their drink concoctions. I can&#39;t remember the name of it but it&#39;s; vodka, triple sec, lime wedges, muddled cherries and a splash of Sprite. It was rather tasty. We ordered chips and salsa to start. I really love their chips and salsa. The downside to ordering chips and salsa is they always give a small bowl of salsa and a giant mound of chips. Although this isn&#39;t just Chili&#39;s, it&#39;s most restaurants. I&#39;m a salsa hog. Me + salsa + sparingly shouldn&#39;t even be in the same sentence.

We started off with side salads. I am a ranch snob. It is my all time favorite dressing. Chili&#39;s ranch is rather delicious. For my main entree I ordered the 8oz Classic Sirloin with broccoli, loaded tatoes and garlic bread. I opted for the carne asada rub instead of the seasoned butter. It had a really nice flavor. Because of the amount of food I had already consumed, I decided to take most of my dinner home. I must say that made a tasty dinner the following day,  

To finish the meal we decided to share the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie. It is basically a chewy chocolate chip bar covered in ice cream, chocolate and caramel. Our waiter was great. He kept on top of drink refills and was very friendly.

The only down sides was our food came out a few minutes after we received our salads. So the table was really crammed for awhile. If you&#39;ve ever sat in their two person booth tables you would understand. They&#39;re very tiny and have no room. Shortly before we received our dessert a family with multiple children were seated next to us. That&#39;s where the noise level increased a great deal. In general the restaurant was pretty loud. Overall I enjoyed my meal and will definitely eat here again."

I had the chicken tortilla soup and it was very good, along with a house salad.  The veggies were fresh and plentiful.  Not just a pile of iceburg lettuce and that&#39;s it.  I didn&#39;t want a refill, but one was offered to me, which is nice. 

I also love their chips and salsa.  I pretty much order the chips every time I&#39;m there, because they are just so yummy. I also really like the chicken quesadilla salad. 

It&#39;s a big chain and this one is pretty much like all the others....what you would expect."

I was a line cook for Chili&#39;s for a year and ever since, I&#39;ve been hooked.  From personal experience, the food in the kitchen for the most part is extremely fresh and everything else is just shipped in frozen.  So much of the food prep is done every morning to ensure food is fresh and delicious!

This Chili&#39;s location is one of the worst I&#39;ve experienced.  When we walked in, I politely asked the hostess to seat us away from any families and little kids.  If that wasn&#39;t possible, we&#39;d just sit in the bar.  She said it was no problem and brought us one table away from 2 families with babies.  I was really irritated... every time one of those little brats screeched I wanted to strangle the hostess.  It was also around 9:30.  The dinner rush was over and the restaurant was not packed.  I can&#39;t see how this was a difficult request.

Chili&#39;s has a new special where 2 people can eat for $20 bucks.  Split an appetizer, each pick an entree&#39; and split a desert.  My boyfriend and I decided to try it.  Our appetizer of chips and queso was good.  Nothing bad, it was just as it should have been.  I realized half way through our appetizer that the waitress never asked me how I wanted my burger cooked.  So I was just hoping for the best.

Entree&#39; time... I had a bacon burger and my boyfriend had a buffalo chicken salad.  My burger was so over cooked that it was dry.  There was also no mayonnaise on the bun.  I requested a side of avocado ranch to dip my fries in, and it tasted like some lazy salad cook made a huge batch of it days ago so they wouldn&#39;t have to do it again for a few days.  It tasted old.  My fries tasted like they had been sitting in the window and then just dropped back in the fryer for a bit to make them seem fresh... but I know the difference.

Dessert was fine.  I can&#39;t imagine how you could screw up a pre-fabricated, frozen, pop in the microwave molten chocolate cake.  It was soooo good!  Our service was also very good.  This waitress looked scary as hell with her eyebrows shaved off and painted on about an inch above where they should have been, but she did a really good job... minus points for not asking me how I wanted my burger cooked.

I&#39;ve eaten at many Chili&#39;s locations and this one has made the bottom of my list.  I&#39;m temped to send an email to corporate to have them look into the failure that kitchen is obviously going through."

We were seated quickly.  A couple TVs but mostly soccer playing which is common for a Mexican Restaurant.  Very neat decor.

The chips and salsa came out fast as did the food.  Homemade tortillas were very tasty as was my shrimp dish.  The service faded a bit after what appeared to be a VIP showed up with his family.  Most of the wait staff focused on that table.  A different waiter than the one serving us cashed us out.

Overall one of the top Mexican Restaurants I&#39;ve experienced since living in Denver.  This place has been around since the 70&#39;s and I can understand why.  I look forward to returning soon."

The homemade chips are warm and perfectly salted.  The salsa is spicy and good.  I ordered the Albanil tacos...four tacos on corn tortillas, with grilled steak, potatoes, onions, and jalapeños. I added beans and rice, which were a nice balance got the tacos. The steak was wonderfully seasoned and tender. The onions and potatoes were mixed in and they were a nice accompaniment.  The jalapeños were HOT...it was a good burn though. No regrets! Ha!  The pina agua Fresca was so refreshing, served in a metal cup keeping it icy cold.  

The server was phenomenal...funny, attentive, friendly, and clearly enjoying his afternoon.  The prices were pretty good, I thought, for the amount of food we were served.  There is not a kid&#39;s menu but my daughter ordered off the a la carte menu.  She liked her steak taco so much, we ordered a second.  The interior has old looking wooden booths, which were comfortable. There is also a nice covered patio outside.  They could use another bathroom for women but I didn&#39;t have to wait long for a vacancy.

It&#39;s a family owned establishment and very unassuming.  

There are wooden booths throughout the restaurant and patrons seat themselves.  The servers are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  The food is delightful, not too salty or spicy and perfection at it&#39;s finest.  

Warm tortilla chips and a nice, smooth and spicy green salsa greets you while looking over the menu.  I ordered the Asada Tacos Plate which has 4 fully stuffed corn tortillas filled with steak.  The retried beans on the side melted in my mouth and were so smooth and creamy.  The rice was simple but delightful.  It was all served with a fresh medley of tomatoes, onions and jalapeños on the plate, which I topped the tacos with.  

My husband ordered the chicken burrito which was a tortilla stuffed with retried beans, rice and shredded chicken.  It was smothered in a delicious green chili and cheese and topped with sour cream and fresh guacamole.  It&#39;s the perfect bite and makes you want to devour it in one fell swoop, but control is a must here!  

Please check this place out and enjoy!"

Second is that the food lacked any life or flavor. It was good tasting but it didn&#39;t have that added wow favor you get gone good ol&#39; authentic Mexican food. It was missing something, like the restaurant was out of a key ingredient or seasoning. 
Finally, my margarita tasted like water. It too lacked that extra special taste. It was like water and tequila with a squeeze of lime, but mostly water.

They get two stars for service. Getting help was like pulling teeth, we had to ask for several items more than once. Don&#39;t go anytime near closing. I got a coffee which when I tried to get my ONE free refill on, was told by one person that the machine was broken and was told by another one that they had already turned it off for the night --so one of them lied to me. Still charged me the same amount, though. 

One guest at our table didn&#39;t get served her meal for at least 8 minutes after we had all been served ours. Four adults at the table, all ordered dishes with tortillas, they gave two warmers with two tortilla each in them.

I had the pork smothered in green chili sauce dish with their corn tortillas. It exceeded my expectations regarding flavor, the tenderness of the pork, and of course the spiciness of the sauce. 

This appears to be a neighborhood restaurant with a lot of regulars stopping by and ordering without looking at the menu. My kind of place for sure. The chips and salsa were OK, and I liked the heat from the salsa.  Lastly service was prompt and I liked the fact that I could watch sports on their big screen while dining solo...

First of all let&#39;s start off with the stale chips and the watered down salsa, gross! Then we paid seven dollars for the jumbo 24 ounce house margarita that tasted like it didn&#39;t even have a drop of alcohol in it. We were giving them the benefit of the doubt and were highly anticipating our tacos. We received tacos that had tortillas that weren&#39;t fried, our Carnitas weren&#39;t  even flash fried, and they were bone dry and bland. Also, they don&#39;t even give you salsa or limes for your tacos. The icing on the cake was when my husband found a little bug crawling around inside of his taco and they didn&#39;t even try and compensate us. Will definitely never go back here again.

We were helped in by a bus person who told us to set anywhere so we picked a table in the middle of the patio. The server took the table in front of us order and doing so it would have been really hard to miss us at the next table especially sense he was facing us the entire time. Then another couple came in from the back entrance and sat at the table directly behind us and before they were settled they had been brought chips salsa and water! This all was going on about 15 minutes so we decided to leave, they weren&#39;t that busy so that&#39;s not a good excuse, I was not happy and decided to tell the manager so I went back in and was told I&#39;ll be right with you while he was getting a phone number from the cute girl at the bar, he must have noticed the look on my face and immediately turned his attention to me at that point to which I told him what was going on and we were leaving.

It&#39;s on a fun street in the Lower Highlands Neighborhood and there is a bunch of fun stuff to do before/after your dinning experience. 

The salsa is AMAZING. Every time I go I have them package up some to go, just ask, it&#39;s worth it. That salsa comes out with chips, for free, which is a must for my go-to Mexican joint so this place doesn&#39;t disappoint. I&#39;ve been here three different times, I&#39;ve had three different entrees and I haven&#39;t been disappointed yet. 

The Carne a la Tampiquena is pretty solid, the beef is sliced very thin so you won&#39;t be able to get it at a particular temperature, but it has great flavor and of course comes with beans and rice which are both great. I also really liked the Camaron a la Mexicana, it&#39;s a shrimp dish and they were cooked perfectly. 

The best part again is that those are like two of the most expensive dishes at $11.00 each. Many of the entrees are in the $8-$10 range. The only thing that isn&#39;t in line withe the cheap food prices is the full priced beer which is like $5 I believe unless you come at happy hour. So don&#39;t come in to get drunk, I&#39;m sure there is a bar somewhere near by with cheaper liquor, but certainly come indulge on the solid authentic Mexican food."

As we both were  arguing over where we&#39;d have a late lunch, we decided to give this place a try.  We&#39;re so glad we did.

This is the most authentically Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve tried -- in Colorado.  The meat was perfectly marinated, seasoned, and extremely tender.  The beans and rice tasted like what I was raised on as a little girl.  The chili relleno is among the better ones I&#39;ve had, as well.  Even the salsa was genuinely hot, rather than the &#34;hot by Colorado standards&#34; blandness I&#39;ve come to expect.  The prices were great and we still had leftovers.  

What truly impressed both my friend and I was how well all of the staff worked together, always checking for refills, always making sure we had what we needed.  They really hustled at this restaurant, and we appreciated that.  We even had the chance to visit with one of the owners, who gave us a history of the place and who we thanked for all of the wonderful food and service.  If we lived in the area, we&#39;d be regulars there (and at the neighboring Rosales Mexican Bakery, which is also getting a 5-star review).

Beware the fiery green salsa - even for chile pepper freaks it was HOT (but tangy and tasty all the same).

That little hole in the wall joint that seemed to be hiding within the landscape of 32nd Avenue. Since then, it has expanded, gotten less hidden and developed a monstrosity of a growth on the front facade in the form of the restaurant&#39;s name.

That being said, the food and margs are good. But for some reason, the lack of the hole in the wall vibe has taken the flavor away. And the crowds of people make it less enjoyable because now it&#39;s just another stop on the journey of Mexican food in Denver. The disappointment is real, my friends. 

If you are looking for a good meal, I suggest a hole in the wall on Federal. If you are looking to fill your stomach, then I could recommend Patzcuaro&#39;s through the tears of another lost treasure."

However, nothing I&#39;ve ordered here really stands out at all.  It is all just ok.  And this is fine I suppose...until you factor in price.  The menu is overpriced for what they serve.  Plain and simple, no way around it.  $30 for two people at lunch, without drinks, getting borderline boring Mexican food in Denver - that&#39;s just too much.

As far as service goes, it is always very friendly, which I appreciate.  But you can end up waiting a very long time for things, especially the check.  I&#39;ve had to get up and go to the register to pay because I couldn&#39;t get the check in reasonable time.  Its hit or miss on service."

The patio area is really nice and I would definitely recommend sitting out there and having lunch on a nice day. The area where they are lacking in my opinion is flavor! None of their Chile sauces  (Green, Red) is even remotely spicy! Very bland and had me asking for Tapatio, which I don&#39;t really care for. The worst part is that I even asked for spicy Chile and they simply don&#39;t offer it. If this was New York, I would understand, however we live in Colorado! You can&#39;t walk ten feet out here without tripping over spicy, flavorful Red and Green Chilies! The portions are kind of small for the price and it seems like this place caters more to the upscale Highlands crowd, then to die hard Mexican food lovers  such as myself :) Still, I will continue to visit here from time to time as the patio area is a great hangout spot. Hotter Chile and bigger portions would make this place outstanding. I would suggest ordering the Carne a la Tampiquena or the Caldo de Res  as you get lot of food for the price.

You can get food just as good at tons and tons of places around Denver, and better at most too. The salsa was very meh in my opinion, and you could tell they tried to make the salsa hotter so people would purchase more drinks, at least that&#39;s how I felt.

I would leave 1 star but the food was decent for the most part. However, our service left a lot to be desired. When my girlfriend ordered her drink, she asked for something that was clear as day on their drink menu, but the waiter said they did not have it. When she asked what they had, he replied in a very annoyed tone &#34;Mexican Beers&#34;. So she just ordered a Corona. When the waiter came back he gave us our drinks and said &#34;Do You Know What You Want yet&#34; in a very rude tone. I don&#39;t know if he was just having a bad day, but if so, don&#39;t take it out on us man. We ordered our food, and that is the last time we saw our waiter. Someone else delivered the food. And no one came back to see if we needed refills or were doing alright, and we sat about 15 minutes, very noticeably done with our food, before I finally got up to ask for our bill. And oh by the way during this whole time, I waiter wasn&#39;t too busy either. He was pacing around the restaurant fixing the salt, pepper, and hot sauce placements on tables.

So yeah, food was garden variety &#34;new mexican&#34; that you can get anywhere in Denver, you can get better food at tons of places like La Loma, Tacos Jalisco, etc. And the service was crappy."

Salsa is tasty, fresh and has some legit heat. Tacos are all pretty good if unspectacular. Margaritas and Seafood entress are pretty good too.

There are so many of these around, there has to have a perfect combination of the following:
1) Great food (Entrees, chips/salsa)
2) Inexpensive
3) Great Margaritas

Patzcuaros has 2/3 of these in the bag. Their food was great (I had the Fajitas and my partner had the Carnitas). It was very reasonably priced. The staff did a good job as well. Their margaritas are GOOD, but not GREAT... and this is my only knock. The margs could be better. 

We will be coming here again, but I&#39;m not totally convinced this is a regular spot for me. It&#39;s also tough to be a regular when it&#39;s a pain to find a place to park (street parking), yet that isn&#39;t Patzcuaros fault. 

Overall, I give it a 4/5. It is definitely worth giving a visit.

(As a disclaimer, the only Mexican restaurant I&#39;d give a 5/5 would be Los Dos Potrillos, as it has all 3 components. La Loma would be close at a 4.5/5, but their margaritas are very expensive, but really good, and the food is incredible.)"

The small corn tortillas are made fresh daily in Patzcuaro&#39;s kitchen and served hot in sets of four for $8.  You&#39;re free to mix fillings - I recommend carnitas and/or the shredded chicken (not on the menu but just ask - it&#39;s the same filling they use in their burritos).  Guac is thick, creamy and fresh, and the margaritas are huge.  I&#39;ve also enjoyed their chicken enchiladas, smothered with green chile and cheese.

Great neighborhood, nice place.  Tuesday night, walked right in, not dead, but not busy.  Margaritas are large but not very strong - decent otherwise.  

Chips and salsa were served immediately.  I personally like chunky tomato salsa, but I&#39;m easy.  This, however, I didn&#39;t like.  It was smooth green salsa, which had a lot of kick to it.  I&#39;m not a huge spicy food person, but I can handle quite a bit, as long as it&#39;s spicy flavor, not just spicy for the sake of being spicy.  This was extremely bland, with a fire finish, and really didn&#39;t taste like anything.  

Both the drinks and food came out very quickly, as is common in Mexican restaurants, otherwise I&#39;d worry a little bit because it was so fast.

Chili Rellenos are generally my go-to when I eat Mexican, and they were okay, not much flavor.  I actually ate one and took the other for leftovers, and the next day you can taste the chili a little more, and the cheese wasn&#39;t so gooey.  But of course after the microwave, the texture is shot anyway.  Green chili, beans, and rice were all fairly flavorless (are you sensing the theme here?).  Meh.

My date&#39;s carnitas was apparently very good, and he seemed happier than I.

Also agree with another post I saw here about all the staff working the entire restaurant, instead of having sections.  Efficient, but we were asked the same things over and over in rapid succession."

Mexican seemed like a good decision for a gluten-free person. We hunted Patzcuaro&#39;s via Yelp. I knew this neighborhood had good Mexican, but I needed to pinpoint where.

We found easy parking across from Spuntino and quickly found a seat. Patzcuaro&#39;s staff was friendly and helpful. We started with a large helping of guacamole. It was creamy smooth with a touch of lime, I think. It was addictive. Fortunately, they kept the chips coming. Be aware that their basic salsa is slightly spicier than what you might consider medium.

I ordered the Carne a la Tampiquena which came with an enchilada (choice of wheat or corn tortilla), beans, some rice, and four strips of carne asada. The carne asada tastes great also with some lime and reheats well. I ate too much guacamole, but enjoyed what I could of my main entree. 

Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant. They accommodate gluten-free dietary restrictions, serve great chips, and feature good food."

Its definitely not the BEST.

Giving it a shot, I tried the place out with some family and all of us were &#34;meh&#34; about most things in the meal.  The chips and salsa of all things were a highlight.  The &#34;famous&#34; margaritas were ok, but again, nothing to write home about.  The enchiladas were nothing that I couldn&#39;t make at home.

For my bday, a couple of us got together for some dinner and drinks. Got a reservation on the patio, which was shielded thankfully from the rain that ensued later in the evening.  

Their margs are $6 each, HUGE, and STRONG, and light on the sweet and sour mix. 

First off, their salsas are SPICY. And we got an order of the chili cheese dip I have been hearing so much about to start off. WHOA! very spicy indeed. The waiter suggested the Carnitas platter so I went with that for my main entree. Everyone ordered something different so I was able to try the green chile platter, red chile enchilada and Matt&#39;s chicken fajitas.  

I was absolutely blown away by the red chile!! So much, that we ordered a side of it and it was eaten up in minutes.  I am a huge green chile lover. I don&#39;t normally like red chile so for me to say I loved it, must be good!!  In fact, my side of green chile basically went uneaten.  The waitstaff couldn&#39;t be more accommodating to us. 

And, for my bday, they brought us a huge sopapilla the table could share! This was the best way to end such an amazing meal.

We were very disappointed. Even my friends who had been coming here for a decade couldn&#39;t understand why the service and food was so poor.

I loved the old chandelier that hung from the ceiling, it gave the place a very rustic, antique feel. I ordered the Carnitas Michoacan and when I first got it didn&#39;t think it was that much food, until I started pulling the pork apart and was about half way finished with my meal and was full. In my opinion the pork was a little bit dry but I put some salsa on it and it was delicious. I&#39;m a fan of corn tortillas and love that this place makes the corn tortillas in house.

I went with a the wrap and added fresh jalapeno coming out at $8.39 and it was delicious!   In terms of volume, it was about 3/4 pound of meat topped with a reasonable portion of peppers and barbecue sauce on a big burrito and weighed in at about a pound.  

Brisket is the most difficult meat they have to smoke well and keep tender, so based on their prowess on this cut, I&#39;m looking forward to trying the pulled pork and ribs.

It&#39;s not the fastest food production for a food truck, so if you want more than a sandwich or two OR are in a hurry, call ahead and they can have your order ready to pickup.  

BRING CASH since they don&#39;t accept credit card.

It&#39;s out of the way, but worth the drive from downtown."

Like many fellow yelpers, I was getting my glass repaired at Absolute Auto Glass that&#39;s about a 3-5 minute walk from Mama&#39;s BBQ.  I was hungry so I headed down for some ribs. After walking around the moat that surrounds the Conoco, I saw the food truck. It smelled deeeelicious. 

However, they didn&#39;t have any ribs or regular sausage. Just pulled pork and polish franks. I got the pulled pork sandwich that came in a GIANT wheat hogie that was an absolute mess when I opened it. The pulled pork was 4 out of 5 - not too dry but the sandwich should have been wrapped and then I should have been given the sauce separately."

This little cart is on the side of a gas station and they open when the food is ready and they close when the foods all gone.  We got there right as they opened and unfortunately quite a few things weren&#39;t ready yet, but we were able to try the pulled pork sandwiches.  

It took some time for them to prep the meat and the sandwiches (10 minutes or so) - meanwhile the crowd formed.  It was very impressive to see what a loyal following this place has for the lunch rush.  Anyway, the food is outstanding - the meat is perfectly tender and juicy and the bread is a buttery complement to the meat.

Would highly recommend this spot and I hope that I get to try some ribs and brisket soon."

I got the brisket sandwich plate which comes with potato salad and beans for $8 + tax. The sandwich featured a food portion of meat and sauce on a hoagie roll. The beans and potato salad were good, but the meat is definitely the star.

That place is always packed.  And the people are nice and the food reminds me of comfort food. 

THIS one on the other hand is very small and quiet. Which is just fine with me.  It&#39;s got a bar,  the staff was really nice.  And the food was just as good as the other more popular location.  I had spinach crepes with hollandaise.

Unfortunately, it did not work out that way... They were very friendly, the menu was clear, and the prices were very reasonable, almost cheap which is rare for a breakfast place these days.  

We live close, so we wanted to drive over and give it a shot. When we pulled up there was a black chair sitting outside in front of one of the doors because evidently the door was broken... The &#34;now open&#34; sign that hung over the doors was falling down and filthy, and to be honest, when you pulled up and looked at the place it almost made you not want to go in. 

Inside was clean and looked newer.  The Decore was pretty underwhelming and rather blah. Which is no problem for me if the food is good. 

My wife had an omelette which was decent. I had bacon and over easy eggs with potatoes and pancakes. The potatoes were a little undercooked and a few of them were still crunchy, and they were WAY OVER salted!  

Another review said this.  But the pancakes that both my wife and I had, left you with a subtle taste of something burned in your mouth.  They weren&#39;t burned, and the first bite was great but after a couple seconds there was a strange after taste.  Subtle but there. 

What a great location!  With a few adjustments it seems like this place could be a gold mine. But the owners need to think about the quality breakfasts available these days around Denver.  

AS I LEFT I WAS THINKING:  Hoping for the best, but won&#39;t be back unless there are some improvements.  We live close enough I&#39;m sure we will hear about it."

We started with the Cinnamonster. What makes this little gem so yummy is the icing they put on top of it.. At first I was like Oh wow that&#39;s a lot of icing, but it&#39;s so light and tastes heavenly.. I got the two egg breakfast over easy with sourdough toast, eggs were cooked perfectly. Hubby got the Supreme omelette with pancakes.. He was very happy, he is a picky omelette eater too! Both dishes came with breakfast potatoes.  This will be a definite go to regular place.

3 visits ago, we sat at the very quite corner but the waitress came around often to check on us.  However, last two visits served by the same guy, it&#39;s been exactly the same.  Food gets dropped off...  and will not see him until u flag him down for the bill.

Their house margaritas are watery; tonight&#39;s meal tasted like it had freezer burn - clearly my chile relleno was frozen and deep fried. Everything just tasted off tonight. I think the best bet is to venture beyond the mexi-fare stuff like the tacos and burritos - they&#39;re not that good. Maybe try some of the other dishes. The pescado I saw delivered to the table next to us looked amazing. 
You will always get speedy service here. Sometimes it&#39;s actually too frenzied, as in, &#34;whoa, let me sit down before you ask my drink order, buddy.&#34; But it&#39;s reasonably priced and a good neighborhood spot with pretty much something for everyone."

Its a little run down and could use a refresh, but its...well, not bad. The tequila selection is huge.  You name it, they probably have it.  The food is a bit disappointing.   Its not bad but I expected better.  The fajitas could have been seasoned better, but the portions are fairly large and the food price is decent.   The tequila prices are a bit high, but most places won&#39;t carry the quality or selection of agave bliss that they do.

The service was a bit slow, but extremely friendly.   The dining room is showing its age, and while age is fantastic for tequila, its not so fantastic for restaurant carpet. 

This place is huge.  It has two sides, a restaurant side, and a bar side.  Each side could be a standalone business by itself.  If you want great tequila and average food, this place is gold.  Seriously,  do you go to a tequila bar for the food?"

The staff are kind and the food is delicious and prepared quickly. To be quite honest, the most important detail about a Mexican restaurant is their salsa and Casa Vallarta makes the best that I have ever eaten. Someday I will talk them into sharing the recipe with me. I visit it anytime we are in the Denver area.  Usually more than once."

Parking is a little tough sometimes with the construction of a McDonald&#39;s going on, but the food is delicious with prompt service.

I&#39;m a big fan of good pico and this place brings out a bowl of pico AND a nice, slightly spicy, red salsa with their complimentary chips.   I love their Carne Asada and that&#39;s my standard dish.   I know there&#39;s a lot more to their menu and everything I&#39;ve sampled from my friend&#39;s plates has been very good, but I just stick with my Asada."

Food is terrific...particularly the arroz con pollo, carne asada and their tacos al pastor.
Unique wings ....yep, wings, are pretty darn good too. We&#39;re big fans of the chips and unique cabbage based pico as well.
Best of all is the way Luis and Juan take care of us. We always sit at the bar for dinner and really enjoy the great energy. Games are on, ice cold beers are flowing and the tequila selection is top notch. They both know my liking for good tequila and are always introducing me to a new bottle....

No better casual Mexican around!"

Service was average for a Mexican restaurant. What I mean by this is that everything is very fast, but the wait staff are always in a rush and have no time to answer questions or make suggestions about the menu. It seems like they are just trying to get you in and out, not very friendly. I am a seeker of hot food, I love strong flavors, and lots of heat. Casa Vallarta seems to cater to the folks that can not handle any heat and like their food bland. I dumped hot sauce on my food, and ordered jalapenos (that never showed up). I had ordered a combination, because nothing on the menu really jumped out at me as something that would be satisfying, and the waiter treated me as if I was keeping him by asking for suggestions. The combo came with an enchilada (i chose chicken), a chile relleno (i ordered it crispy), and a taco (i ordered beef, got chicken). Save your money, there are too many good Mexican restaurants to waste it here."

We ordered chicken quesadillas &amp; a chicken chimichanga.  Quesadillas-- never seen it made with shredded chicken.   Again we&#39;re used to fajita beef or chicken not this shredded meat used frequently in Colorado.   Why shred the meat?  It neither looked or tasted like a quesadilla &amp; ive tried many in other states.  But again this seems to be the Colorado culture when it comes to Mexican food.    Hubby chimichanga tasted the same, a bunch of ingredients blended together but not for the purpose of its intent.    I was looking forward to a frozen strawberry margarita but it was full of chunks of broken/chipped ice.  I guess no frozen margarita machine or a Ninja blender to help smooth the ice.   Two stars for effort &amp; since we&#39;re from Texas.    The establishment was busy so someone thinks it has good food."

Including tip, you can walk out of here for $10 or less if you get a lunch special. Service has always been really excellent. Food seems to be pretty standard Mexican. 

The salsa is a little more watery than I prefer, only because it makes piling up the chip more messy, complicated, and impossible than it should be. But the excellent tomato &amp; cilantro taste makes stopping the chip feast oh so hard. The chips aren&#39;t my favorite, although I still can&#39;t put them down. 

The outdoor patio which faces Parker Road has a very nice view of Cherry Creek State Park, plenty of shade, and makes for a relaxing midday setting. 

And I almost forgot... free sopaipillas! They come topped with whipped cream and and a delicious strawberry sauce. Really great.

No trace of green chili in burrito. Meat burrito. It was ok and filled the stomach.

Wife had enchilada and tamale. Tamale tasted frozen. Rest was ok. Salsa was a watery and not much spice. 

Probably such a nice day why they even got two stars :)

Tacos get a 1/2 star. .. wings did not suck in the Wing aficionado Steve&#39;s opinion.  However. .. they did lose a bit of luster in the warmer tray and lacked the sacuiness of the order of wings from the menu that were delivered nearby.   They became a bit dried during the holding period.

After, consuming the express burrito, my stomach felt as if I were to give birth to not one, but eight babies!! This however was not a bad thing due to the incredibly delicious flavor of my meal. 
Receiving the check, I figured we&#39;d be stuck with a hefty bill, being that the two of us ate enough mexican food to kill a strong working donkey. But, to my surprise, the most expensive item on the check was my coronarita, a big ol&#39; Margarita with an upside-down corona bottle erecting out of my glass like titanic after its romantic date with the iceburg.

I read through the Yelp reviews and tried to lower my expectations.

We came at about 6pm and were seated immediately in the dining room. There were tons of large tables set up and so we could tell it was going to get busy. The bar was already packed and karaoke was starting. We were seated at a booth next to the entrance to the bar. I noticed the booth in front of ours had huge rips in the seat cushions and I can only imagine how comfortable that is to sit on.

Our server came over quickly and took our drink order. I had a house margarita and my husband had a beer. He was amazed at the cheap price and I think was instantly won over. Chips and two kinds of salsas were also brought over and were very good. One was a standard salsa and the other was kind of a pico, with cabbage in it.

I ordered the beef fajita burrito and my husband had the cheese enchilada platter. And I say platter as the plate that he was presented with was the size of a pizza pan. Ridiculous. My burrito had a mystery sauce over it that worried me that it was pork based. I couldn&#39;t find any presence of meat and so I hoped it was ok. My beef was large strips of steak and there were a couple that were pure gristle. Found that out after popping them in my mouth. A giant pool of oil also showed up under my burrito. The rice was very good, though the black beans had zippo seasoning. My husband was impressed with his meal and had no complaints. I saw spinach enchiladas and think I would be best to stay away from meat in the future.

We moved over to the bar area to listen to some karaoke and enjoy the happy hour specials after we had eaten. Happy hour goes until 7pm and even though we ordered prior to that, when we got our bill, our drinks were full price. Their margaritas are the strongest I&#39;ve had at a restaurant and are only $5. They also have a little bar of free food during happy hour and it comes with all kinds of signs, warning you not to be greedy.

Overall, service is very prompt and friendly here. Food wasn&#39;t stellar but the drinks are good and decently priced. At least come for the karaoke as there were some excellent singers."

I asked for ground beef and got stringy chewy shredded beef. Tried to enjoy drinks and friends.  What&#39;s with the bored DJ and the constant country music??? Karaoke could have been fun, but constantly interrupted by surly server. She actually jumped on me when I was leaving the restroom asking if I was ready to pay. We were a party of 9 and I don&#39;t know why she thought I was paying. I said I didn&#39;t know if anyone was ready to pay. Then she wanted to know if they wanted drinks. I don&#39;t know!  Go ask them! I am standing by the bathroom!  Back at our table, she continued to harass me about paying and handed me the check. I tossed it across the table. I AM NOT IN CHARGE OF THE TABLE!!!  WHY WON&#39;T SHE BACK OFF??? One of my friends paid with her credit card and the server gave ME the check to sign! Is she freaking special needs???? I guess she thought I was in charge because I&#39;m a little older. Freaking rude!! She wouldn&#39;t back off me. I will NEVER return to this place.

They have a decent happy hour.  HH is from 4:00pm - 7:00pm, Mon-Fri.  HH drinks includes $2.50 Domestic Drafts, Dos Equis and Well, and $3.50 basic Margaritas. They even put out some basic food during happy hour.  &#34;FREE Hot Wings &amp; Tacos with purchase of bar drinks!&#34; And they offer HH during Broncos Games!

The HH food consists of very plain hard shell taco fixin&#39;s (think shells, meat, cheese, and salsa) and some decently spiced wings (that disappear quickly, and only come out at the top of the hour).  And, they are slightly stingy with the food at the happy hour.  There is a sign warning people who are not sitting in the bar (and this excludes the patio) that they are not welcome to the food.  Another sign says 2 wings (or tacos) per happy hour drink purchased.

The waitress arrived to start our order and we asked what are the house specialties. She seemed annoyed at the question and said everything is good.  Again I asked what they are famous for. She said that everything was good and said she would come back when we had made our choices. The food was just ok. Nothing to right home about. 
After we finished our meal I ordered a desert. She brought us a mini size portion. When I questioned her about it she said it was free.  But on the menu it is a order item with a price for the desert. I told her she should have let me know so I could have made a choice on what I wanted. Needless to say, we decided to skip ordering anything else and checked out. 
Most diners don&#39;t read the menu as well as I typically do. So when the waitress does not inform you of your choices when there not on the menu, it can be frustrating."

Tonight I tried he spinach enchiladas ... The filling was cold and bland. The tortillas were barely warm.  The beans and rice were bland.  The stuffed jalapeños were bland.  I am wondering if they make assumptions and that I appeared to be a person who wanted bland??
Well I like spicy and I expect some flavor and spice in Mexican cuisine. Many times I do specify spicy just to make sure.

And I do expect my food to be served hot and fresh.  2 stars for those who appreciate cold and bland.  1 star for the rest of us...."

Typically there is a medium to small amount of people there. Staff was always very attentive and food was hot and great. However,  I tried going here on a Friday night for dinner. Around 9 pm. Half this place is a bar / half is a restaurant.  I was sat right next to the bar area for dinner which I enjoyed because I got to hear the live karaoke which was fun. I soon felt forgotten among the chaos of so much going on. Waitress brought my food (taco, enchilada, rellenos, served with rice and beans), and the first thing I grabbed to eat was my taco. It was soaking wet, the whole bottom was ripped. I couldn&#39;t even pick it up and it was the first thing I tried grabbing off my plate within minutes of getting our food. The rice was dry and bland. The beans, which are usually awesome tasted like garlic powder. My waitress asked how the food was as she was walking by and away. Hard to get a refill. Since I&#39;ve had such a good experience  normally I will stick to lunches here and avoid when it is obviously  overwhelmed. That is why I give 3 stars."

I remember the food being decent but it just isn&#39;t close to my house so we just never went.

It is my friends favorite Mexican Restaurant and it was her birthday so I made the trek.  We ordered a Carne Asada salad with a side of shredded chicken.  The chicken was a bit lacking in flavor for me (spices, people, spices) and the salad was nothing special.

The Carne Asada on the other hand was some of the best that I&#39;ve had in a very long time.  It was thin, seasoned well, and cooked perfectly.  The owner stopped by our table and explained that they had just gotten in that day.  It was very apparently!

The service was good.  We were waiting on one of our dinner mates and our waitress would check back periodically to see if there was anything we needed.  Once the 3rd person arrive our waitress was right there taking our order and the food came out very quickly.

1.  Seated at a dirty table.  Had to flag someone down to clean it.
2.  Salsa chips and water were put on our table without a greeting.
3.  Waited 10 minutes before our drink order was taken.  Drink order was wrong when it did arrive.
4.  Another 10 minutes before food order was taken.  Ordered a number 15 and spouse ordered a chicken sandwich.  I could not have my tostada as a guacamole tostada without a $3.00 upcharge.
5.   Waited nearly 30 minutes for meal to be delivered without any return visits from our waitress.  Finally, we were told the delay in delivery of our meal was due to the chicken sandwich as they take longer. 
6.  When the food was delivered my number 15 turned out to be a #5 and was cold.  A number 15 is an enchilada, taco, and tostada.  I received a tostada and enchilada.  The waitress did offer to bring a taco, but I passed not wishing to wait any longer.  The presentation of the food was not appetizing,  The rice was dry and the tostada soggy.  I ate very little.  The chicken sandwich that held up the show was flavorless.
7.  Prior to delivery of our meal, the hostess attempted to present a bill for food we had not ordered.  Mind you this was same hostess who seated us at a dirty table.  When we protested she told us this was the bill for our table.  She was told that she needed to clear this up with the waitress.
8.  We were brought free sopapillas as a peace offering.  We said no thanks, please bring us the check, paid the check, left and will not return."

I usually come for drinks, which are very fairly priced and pretty strong. Margaritas aren&#39;t the tastiest things in the world, the tequila is clearly not top shelf, but it&#39;s pretty decent and strong so you definitely get your money&#39;s worth.

Food here for a vegetarian leaves something to be desired. Not a ton of options and the ones that are on there are typically vegetable burrito with a red sauce of some kind. Didn&#39;t blow me away. Boyfriend got chicken enchiladas, they were standard if I remember correctly. The place itself is huge, the bar area is a little shabby but the have an awesome patio. Service is great, very prompt and if they like you, and they appreciate their regulars and show it.

Just because I was trying to get one of his customers to not drive home.

After some back and forth, seemed the staff had my back, but the &#34;owner&#34; wanted me to go outside to fight. By words of his own employees, said he was drunk, and they were removing him.

Excited to maybe find a good place close to our house. Super quick service - chips, salsa and water were on our table lighting fast. The waitstaff was also working very hard, running around from table to table.
We ordered margaritas having seen on the website that they were half-price during happy hour, however found out later that is only is in the bar. Thankfully they were strong (but didn&#39;t taste good - very margarita mix taste). 
Food came out really fast (too fast, really) and was not good. If you have a general standard for Mexican food, skip this place. It was bland, not spicy or flavorful at all, and the rice had a really weird flavor. Honestly the chips and salsa, the decent buzz from the yucky margarita, along with the fact that my husband and I shared an entree, and got cute miniature complimentary sopapillas at the end, were the only things that kept me from feeling really bummed about our dinner choice.

It&#39;s set up in two sections- a quiet dining area and a bar area with dining, televisions and music. We ordered some margaritas, taco salad, and flautas. The margaritas were moderately strong so I will give them a star for that action. The food was okay but the taco salad was more condiment, especially lettuce, than meat and the flautas were much bigger than what I am used to flautas being. They were also pretty bland. Their tortilla chips and salsas were okay. Nothing to rave about. 

The atmosphere was off. I mean the bar area is divided by a partial wall so it&#39;s like two sections. On the side nearest the bar, televisions and music were on. On the side farthest from the bar, there was karaoke. It just didn&#39;t mesh well. You would think they would have the radio music playing only when someone wasn&#39;t singing karaoke but between the radio music, karaoke music, and DJ music...it was an overload. Then, the fact that kids were running around in the bar area just messed up the vibe. How can you cut loose when there are families dining in the bar area? That was a big part of why we didn&#39;t stay longer.

Service was okay. It seemed like the servers worked  together in covering their tables but our server was a bit slow through the night to the point to where we considered walking out without  paying just to see if anyone would notice. Finally, someone notice we had been standing up for five minutes waiting to get our bill.

This is the kicker for me. My friend-girl gave me a birthday card w/gift card &amp; money inside, in an envelope during our gathering which we placed on one end of the table. We failed to grab it when we left after 9pm. I went by the next afternoon and caught up with the woman who waited on us who did not have any recollection of the envelope the table but indicated that she was actually working more in the quiet dining area and there were two guys helping out with the tables in the area we sat in. She said she would ask them and told me to call her later on. Well, I didn&#39;t get to call her  later on Saturday but I did go back by before noon on Sunday. The waitress stated that nobody had it. Now, yes the busser could have just picked it up and put it in his busser tray but he still has to empty out that tray so, even if the busser took it, the process isn&#39;t as absentminded as the waitress tried to make it seem. I know people leave stuff behind all the time. They pulled out credit cards and a bin of lost items supporting that. How is it that less than 24 hours after my item was left, no one, including the at least three people who waited on us, was aware of the envelope left on the table laying right by plates and glasses that were picked up from the table several times during our stay? It doesn&#39;t sound right.

That is the biggest deterrent for me. I would have been interested in trying their food again if it wasn&#39;t for that.

So, the margaritas get one star and the overall service, unrecovered item notwithstanding, gets one star."

Reminds me of what Forest Gump once said about boxed chocolate, so let me begin with the good. Every time I&#39;ve ordered the carne asada, it&#39;s been really good. Succulent, well-seasoned and fresh, but the sides are bland. Pico is alright apart from the fact that they don&#39;t seem to core their tomatoes, while the Salsa is also so-so, and certainly not what you&#39;d expect at an &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican joint. I would guess it&#39;s probably out of a can.

The chicken dishes are nothing special and fall into the category of getting what you pay for. After all, what can you really expect for $9 (tacos) or $12.95 (fajitas). 

Among the more disappointing dishes I&#39;ve tried were the Caldo de Camoron and Sopa De Tortillas. For the first I was hoping for something similar to a great ceviche I used to get in Tucson. This dish was a total disappointment, however, punctuated by a selection of raw camarones, with mud vein thrown in as a bonus. I was able to eat about 1/3 of this and threw the rest out. 

The sopa de tortillas was ordered on my most recent August visit for a weekday lunch. This is a dish I&#39;ve had from dozens of different places throughout the SW and Mexico, and I am sad to say it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The portion size was enormous, but lacked anything close to freshness. For a sopa such as this distinction of flavor is key, but the serving I had tasted like blended mush. The service, while usually passable, was totally non-existent on this visit, with the server disappearing for 30+ minuets after bringing the food to the table. No refills of either chips and salsa or soda, and I eventually had to just go to the register and pay the bill there. As a result of the inconsistency and poor value I don&#39;t see myself returning anytime soon."

I wasn&#39;t terribly hungry when I went to dinner Tuesday night.  I ordered a chicken enchilada and a chicken taco from the a la carte portion of the menu.  I didn&#39;t want any side items like rice and beans.   What I received tasted and appeared to be warmed shredded, canned chicken (and gobs of it) between a tortilla and a taco shell.  Sure there was some melted cheese and lettuce involved (no other accoutrements) but nothing could save this disastrous plate.  The chicken was absent any flavor except salt.  The taco shell was soggy, to the point it couldn&#39;t be picked up without falling apart.  I know other reviewers seemed to like the chips and salsa at this joint.  I can&#39;t even give that a thumbs up.  It was okay at best.  I would have been happier going to the grocery store and buying salsa from the shelf.  

I&#39;m struggling to think of something nice to say but nothing comes to mind.  I don&#39;t readily hand out one star ratings, either.  The food was really terrible."

Horrible!
The wontons were decent but that&#39;s about it, I could only take one bite of the shrimp and scallops, it was undercooked, swimming in wine, I mean like floating and it tasted like bad fish.
The beef fried rice was pretty bland but I ate it and gave my dog three prices of beef... Here&#39;s where the fun starts.... I was up sick all night just like my dog, it&#39;s 8:30 am and she&#39;s still eating grass.
I&#39;ve never had it come out both ends so bad in my life.
To sum it up, it tasted like crap and made me and my dog do the same."

The restaurant sits in an unassuming strip mall right off of Smoky Hill.  If you&#39;re not looking for it, you&#39;ll definitely miss it.  Good news though.  If you see Dunkin Donuts, its right behind it off of Pheasant Run.  There, I made it easy for you to find it.  Service is wonderful and food is awesome.

I ordered drunken noodles with beef as well as a hot and sour soup.  My buddy David ordered Mu Shu chicken, another great dish.  Everything came out hot.  Everything came out flavorful.  I didn&#39;t even need to tell them how spicy I wanted my dish.  Its like they read my mind.  I&#39;ve been thinking about this place since Sunday when I went.  I want to try more and excited to go back and see what else they have to offer!"

We receive menus from Formosa Garden and they&#39;ve delivered here for a few years. The problem is when we try to order online, it says we are out of the delivery area. The problem with this is when you call to order something most of the time the person on the other end doesn&#39;t speak English very well and I&#39;ve had a few screwed up orders. Sometimes rice comes with my meal but most of the time it doesn&#39;t. If they would correct this with their online ordering system, I will give them 4 stars again."

I ordered the lemongrass chicken. The dish smelled of lemongrass, which was pleasant, but lacked the flavor. The chicken to veggie ratio was about 1:5, which was actually better because the chicken had that weird texture that typically makes me stray from Chinese restaurants. The dish was also super oily, along with the Vietnamese egg rolls which were oily AND chewy. Flavor was decent. All in all, I won&#39;t
return to this restaurant."

The egg drop soup was bland and unimpressive. My husband enjoyed his Pad Thai with shrimp though he liked the Pad Thai better at Golden Phoenix. My cashew chicken was also a bit bland. The vegetables were cooked perfectly but the chicken was decidedly meh. 

The teriyaki chicken was nice if a bit sweet. We liked the crab cheese wantons most. 

All-in-all not a bad place to order from. The prices are reasonable and the good is decent."

But, I ordered a few times for delivery from another Chinese restaurant. Waited 45 minutes. I ordered from one a block from the house, it took 90 minutes.  So our search continued for good delivery Chinese.  I ordered online, 20 minutes the door bell rang.  Service 5 stars!!! 

The food, Chicken Fried Rice, Hunan Beef, and Chicken Drunken Noodles.  The chicken fried rice had great flavor and a nice mix of veggies without too much.  The Hunan Beef, we asked for extra spicy, it was perfect.  Great flavor to the beef and the mushrooms were perfect.  You could tell the vegetables were freshly cut and cooked in the sauce.  Was wonderful to have good Hunan Beef.   I&#39;m not a fan of Drunken noodles, but my gent is and said they were truly wonderful and had great flavor and were cooked perfectly.  I&#39;ll believe him!   Did I mention Crispy veggie rolls? Not greasy, not over cooked, perfect crunch and flavort too. 

WE will order again.  For service 5--For food, I want to try some other dishes and I will update!!! Right now I&#39;ll give it a 4.5--Though leaning close to that 5!"

The food at Teller&#39;s is definitely delicious and well-made. I am not going all out on this review simply because this will be the best dining experience of your life, but Teller&#39;s offers an enjoyment factor that is hard to garner these days.

Step into the restaurant and you&#39;ll see that the whole place is set up to transition from what would be a patio/outdoor seating into the bar and main dining area. with roll-up doors as the separators (ones that I have never seen actually separated) the restaurant feels open an comfortable. Approach the bar while you wait and you&#39;ll find the bartenders are friendly and accommodating, offering a great selection of local beers and spirits at a fair price. 

When you take your seat, a wait that usually isn&#39;t too long despite the packed house, you&#39;ll find all of the servers to be on point and sincerely caring about keeping you attended to and satisfied. Adding to the overall experience, you&#39;ll likely find weekly activities or even live music in the evenings. For a local bar and restaurant, Teller&#39;s is my go to out in Lakewood. And I&#39;ll continue that way given the positive feedback from the out-of-town family and friends that have joined me there."

The burger was spot on with some of the best fries. My fish and chips was equally as good with perfectly battered and flaky fish and those oh so good fries.

This place has gone downhill. We heard this from friends but didn&#39;t believe it until today. I paid $13 for one of the worst most tasteless salads. No dressing, dry leaves, and flavorless portobello on top they wasn&#39;t marinated in anything. The &#39;toys&#39; for your kids are dirty junk that would be cleaner in a day care. I took a pic of the domino set that was so sticky and caked in brown filth that it made it hard to see the characters on the dominos. Left over dirty games aren&#39;t fun to play with and touching such dirty things before eating isn&#39;t great either. 

Not that they really care. Our server was nonexistent and apathetic. 

Looks like the &#39;Kid friendly&#39; thing wore out and the staff are tired. Might be time for some changes. 

This place is such a gem from the covered patio to the fresh and seasonal food to the kid friendly atmosphere.

We went tonight and say in a comfy table on the patio. We were so surprised to see a full area with kids games, coloring books, crayons, dominos, and other keep-busy essentials that you can help yourself to. Really amazing, our girls loved it and so did we! Happy kids, happy meal  

We ordered the hummus plate and tater tots for apps. Both were fresh, hot, and flavorful with tons to share. The girls split a kids veggie burger which they happily subbed for a beef version. I had a spinach and peach salad (seasonal speciality) and my hubby had a veggie burger. Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious. 

Service was great too. Wait staff was hugging all the regulars that streamed in all night. 

Next time we&#39;ll hit up their kid&#39;s eat free night (Wednesday?) but we&#39;ll definitely be back."

We didn&#39;t have any drinks because we were still feelin a little looped from the show, but all the same, they have taps on taps on taps and I&#39;m sure you could find at least one local brew to tickle your fancy in this lovely little gem of a taproom.

We went with the basil chicken sandwich and the wings which were both solid choices. I enjoyed their wing sauce, the perfect blend of spicy and savory and the basil chicken sandwich was a nice step out of the ordinary as far as barfood is concerned. Definitely would like to swoop in soon to try a new brew!"

1. Complimentary valet because the parking lot is only large enough for 15 cars, at most.
2. Misters on their patio (thank god! It was 95 degrees today).
3. Lots of great draft beers and happy hour specials.
4. Beer boiled shrimp. Yes, yes, yes. 
5. $13 ahi steak burger. The ahi was perfect and 2&#34; thick. 
6. Bar service seemed a bit lacking, but I won&#39;t allow that to affect how great this place is. Bartenders were fairly busy in their defense."

He knew of my fondness for burgers and just wouldn&#39;t shut up about how great Teller&#39;s was, so I finally gave in and went. 

He was right. 

I ended up ordering The Classic with chicken and grilled onions with a side of sweet potato fries. Ordering chicken breasts in a restaurant can be risky...9 times out of 10, they wind up being dry. This one was PERFECTLY cooked. Moist and juicy and flavorful. The &#34;challah bun&#34; wasn&#39;t what I pictured, but it didn&#39;t detract from the meal in any way. The sweet potato fries were excellent. 

For dessert, I ordered the strawberry cheesecake, and while it was far from the best I&#39;ve ever had, it was yummy and capped the meal perfectly. 

I should add that everybody at the table enjoyed their meals as much as I did (rack of ribs and another burger), and the vanilla porter float got rave reviews from my boyfriend. Our waitress was fantastic, and if I had to think of a gripe, it would be that the parking lot is way too small. Yep. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got."

It was a packed house (usually a good sign.) My friends who live in the area like this place but I was not impressed. They have games for kids to play while waiting for their food. That was cool. The coffee was tasty and the server kept our mugs full. 
We were a table of 4 adults, 2 children. They brought 3 adults&#39; food out first, then an adult and child, making the youngest, a 6 year old, wait an additional 10 minutes for her food. The server must not be familiar with children; as that was a mean waiting game. 
I ordered the burrito; it was full of potatoes with very little flavor. My SO had the french toast, which was delicious. The fried chicken and waffles also looked pretty tasty.

Upon arriving, which was a little after 2pm, we were a little disappointed with the small parking lot. There is additional parking at the lot across the street but we assumed this was a small restaurant due to the parking situation. That was incorrect as Teller&#39;s was very spacious, with a great covered patio, which was where we sat.

Staff was friendly and our waitress recommended the $3 pint Mimosa instead of the $1 flute. Of course, we accepted. Pretty good beverage, lots of bubbles and perfect oj and champagne mix.

The brunch menu was pretty original. Instead of the standard bacon and eggs, the options were a lot more creative. I opted for the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict with cornbread while my boyfriend opted for the Bananas Foster Waffle with rum infused syrup. We shared both meals but decided the Pulled Pork was the better of the two. The pork was on point, great flavor and pulled apart with ease. Cornbread was moist and the egg was perfectly poached. The country potatoes on the side had a nice crunch and paired nicely. The waffle was yummy, although small. The bananas were rum soaked and the syrup was decadent but we could have used more of it on the waffle.

Overall, we had a delicious, low cost meal, with our bill rounding out around $20 pp after 2 pints of mimosas and a hearty breakfast. The happy hour menu (2-6:30pm everyday) also caught our eye, and we will be frequenting Teller&#39;s often after this first experience."

I got the special of the night - fried chicken - and it was fantastic! At the table we also had steak &amp; brussel sprouts- holy cow good, french dip, and a steam pot with crab, shrimp, and mussels. The steam pot was unbelievable. So good and SO inexpensive. We all had a meal with a drink and came in at or around $25. 

I saw off in the corner lots of board games which is awesome! It would be a great place to hang out, play some games, and drink good beer. If we are ever in the area again we will certainly be back!"

The servers were very friendly and accommodating right away and the food came out pretty quick. I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict which was delicious! The eggs and spinach were cooked just right and the hollandaise sauce was super tasty. I noticed they had a collection of board games for customers which is really neat. A group of older ladies at the table next to me were getting pretty riled up during their game of Yahtzee haha. Overall this is a definitely great place to stop for a weekend brunch.

The hostess and server were very good, making sure we were seated and taken care of. 

The food is average to above average. The meatloaf was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were.. Well, mashed potatoes.   The side of green beans was tasteless and felt like an afterthought to fill up the plate.  My wife had the trout with the same side dishes.   The fish was tasty but a bit on the dry side.

Prices are good and all in all a good experience.   We will go back for a second visit.   

Btw, we both ordered off the dinner menu but no bread or rolls were offered.   The server either forgot or they don&#39;t offer this basic item."

Really casual, laid back atmosphere with friendly, attentive service. When we got here at around 7 on a Sunday we were seated immediately. There was even a great band playing Avett Brothers covers among other songs (love!).

I started with the Colorado beer flight - really enjoyed all the beers on it except for Dale&#39;s Pale Ale (have had this before a lot and it&#39;s just not my jam). I had the Whiskey burger which I really enjoyed. The sauce on it was sweet but not in a cloying way, and the burger was prepared perfectly. I switched out the fries for the chipotle slaw which was a disappointment-  it didn&#39;t have much flavor and the slaw itself looked old.

My friend got the meatloaf which he said that he really enjoyed. He wasn&#39;t crazy about the green beans side though.

Overall, really liked the vibe at this place, I would go back, espcially to try their HH or Bloody Mary Bar at brunch."

The personality free waitress couldn&#39;t seem to be able to bring me a glass of water and the food was cold.  Last time I went in I nearly vomited on the cold, greasy under cooked sauteed brussel sprouts.

This place caters to the middle class overweight suburban biker types that toss their fat wives on the back of their Harley&#39;s and go to Teller&#39;s to show off their new leather jackets.

That and the fact that they serve it until 3 PM (I&#39;m not an early riser and I hate the crowds at brunch at 11. I&#39;m partial to the salmon benedict but I&#39;ve tried most of the items on the menu (it&#39;s not a huuuge selection) and they are all beyond amazing.

The happy hour at dinner goes until 6:30 and you can get PBR for $1.50. The burgers are very good, so are the fish and chips and the melted monk is the most interesting/delicious thing I&#39;ve ever had at a joint like this.

The restaurant had a homey feel to it and was pretty busy but we didn&#39;t have to wait for 4 people. What was really cool about this place is there is a little area by the bar where there are kids books, coloring books, crayons, games, etc that you can borrow for your kids. I had my toddler with us so I brought her over there to pick something out. The coloring book entertained her while we waited for the food. They have nice drink specials like $3 for Bloody Mary bar and they have a huge of hot sauces for the Bloody Mary. And also $3 for the larger sizes mimosa. I ordered the French toast, and the others got the steak and eggs and the breakfast burrito. My French toast was delicious and on challah bread with two pieces of bacon. And I also tried the breakfast burrito which was pretty large and had big chunks of bacon. The pork green chile was pretty good. And the steak and eggs which cost $17 was the best they&#39;ve ever had...ever, which is saying a lot. I don&#39;t really like steak so I didn&#39;t even try it. But I was thinking for that price for brunch it better be that good. The only thing I can say that isn&#39;t so great about this place is the food takes a little while and they don&#39;t have biscuits and gravy on the menu but otherwise everything including service was great and I would go back for the French toast."

Once was a comedy of errors (counted at least 5) on the service side which we shared with Chris, the manager, and he was very receptive to our feedback which we intentionally gave in-person.

Next visit was great.  Kelsi, our server, is/was awesome.

Last visit - ugh.  Our out-of-town guests both ordered the roasted chicken.  One was WAY under-cooked and had to be sent back.  That night we also opted to use the valet service.  BIG MISTAKE.  The attendant scraped the front bumper of our truck which we documented immediately when we discovered it the next day.  However the contracting company failed to take ownership as their &#34;valued&#34; employee would NEVER lie.  They should have seen him literally dancing in the parking lot - not sure if he&#39;d been smoking or drinking.  In hindsight, I should have video-taped his performance.

I have to go with a downgrade on  this review and not because of the food- A friend and I came for lunch today. We decided to split an order of fish &amp; chips. We also asked for a little extra tater sauce.  When I received the check we were charged an extra $1.50 ($1.00 to split and .50 cents for the tarter) Not a big deal but it&#39;s really the principle of nickel and diming your guests. I did mention it to the hostess on the way out and let her know I thought it was in extremely poor taste. She explained it was for extra fries? The last time I came I brought several guests for happy hour that had never heard of the place. I also noticed that when we had asked for just a few extra chips for the leftover hummus we were charged a $1 for that as well. So far I&#39;m into them for $2.50 for a plate, a condiment and a few chips? Not good for such high quality food and awesome place.  I feel sorry for the waitresses but it makes it appear it&#39;s their fault when it&#39;s not. Not sure I will be back to a Management teams that condones or enforces this practice."

The service was horrible - waitress MIA and not very friendly. The food was expensive, with little on the plate, and the flavors weren&#39;t that great. Hate to give bad reviews, but maybe this will help make things better."

Service and food were very good.  I had the grilled artichoke and the mussels.  Both very tasty.  My date had the special lasagna.  He liked it but wasn&#39;t blown away.  We&#39;ve decided to make this one of our regular watering holes.

I had the carnitas and bean burrito smothered with the green chile on the side ( I was worried it would be too spicy but it was perfect). My husband had the steak fajita burrito smothered and said he liked mine a little better. Someone next to us said they had the best breakfast burritos in Denver- if they are anywhere close to their lunch burritos than I don&#39;t doubt it.  Small space with some tables and a little order window- we came right before noon on a Friday and it filled up quick! 

Update 5/29 their breakfast burritos are just as good if not better than their lunch burritos. Get the ones with the green chile inside- makes for breakfast perfection"

This place was pretty good. The lady behind the counter is very nice.  When I asked if the chorizo was spicy, I can&#39;t do spicy, she offered to let me try a taste! For me it was spicy so that was awesome that she did that. 

I&#39;ve gone here twice now for our Thursday morning breakfast burritos and if it wasn&#39;t because it&#39;s kind of out of my way going to work I would probably go to this place every Thursday! The breakfast burritos are yummy!! Even the President of the company said they were really good, which was a HUGE win for me because if they weren&#39;t good I would have never lived that down!

The food is fresh and hot. The woman at the counter is very nice. We&#39;ve been twice now for take out. I&#39;ve gotten smothered burritos both times - one was asada and the other carnitas. They were both great. We also tried the smothered chiccarones. Delish. They are very generous with their portions. Though it&#39;s a small, modest place, the kitchen is super clean. Love it. I&#39;m curious to try their tacos. The green chili doesn&#39;t have chunks of pork, but it&#39;s still on point for what it is."

I had heard of Alameda Burrito and their amazing green chili, but never had a chance to grab one at their previous location. I ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  It was only $3.00, well-filled, and delicious.  

The restaurant is small so I would recommend getting take out rather than trying to eat in.  The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming.  I&#39;m glad to see a restaurant has filled this spot again and I wish them all the best. 

While I hate to be the first to give a non-five star review, I just can&#39;t justify five stars at this time.  With Tamales Moreno and Tamale Kitchen just across the street, I was looking for something extraordinary from Alameda Burrito, something to set it apart from my other breakfast burrito suppliers, but it did not.  It is still a good, solid restaurant and I will definitely return in the near future to try something from their dinner menu."

It has its own building now! The food continues to make me say MMMMMM every time I bite into one of those lovely, freshly made burritos. The other food is good too - I&#39;ve had quesadillas and tacos - but the burritos are the reason I keep coming. Both the breakfast and the lunch varieties are packed full of flavor, down to the seasoning in the beans. That&#39;s how you can tell that somebody knows how to cook - they season every layer! 
My new favorite is the chile relleno burrito. They put this perfectly crispy relleno in the middle of a burrito, and you bite into it and it&#39;s just amazing. The smothered is the way to go, but the handheld is tasty too, if you&#39;re in a hurry. I usually get my stuff to go, as the seating is a bit drafty next to the door. 
The lady that handles the orders makes me feel like I&#39;m family. It&#39;s weird to say that, but she has this way of making you feel like she&#39;s taking care of you like a mom.

Their convenience store side is a little pricey, and there isn&#39;t a huge selection, however their food is really good. I&#39;ve had both their southwest breakfast burrito, as well as a lunch sandwich and their chili.

The breakfast burrito was pretty good. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and they put a lot in it. The only thing was that the southwest burrito could use a little more of a kick, but it was my own fault for not getting it smothered. Their lunch sandwiches are good, they use Boar&#39;s Head meats and cheeses on them. I really like their chili though, it&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve had, but there&#39;s something about it that always makes me want more.

There were two gentlemen working and they were both super friendly. The gentleman in the deli (he may have been Max) told us about the specials and pointed out a few of their other options. 

I mentioned to said gentleman - (we&#39;ll call him Max) - that it reminded me of east coast style shops. Max - who has lived in Manhattan- replied that it was their own bodega in Denver. 

There were many interesting hot and cold grinder options, a soup of the day (broccoli cheese) a panini of the day (beef brisket I believe) and a pot roast and mashed potato dinner to go. You could also eat there as there were a few small tables in the corner as well as counter seating facing the street. 

Grab and go salads, black and white cookies and pastries were also available. There was produce, toiletries and other necessities and the store was very neat and clean. 

We chatted with Max, as he made my delicious turkey grinder on a Philly style roll, and he talked about how excited the neighborhood was that they were there - I can definitely see why.  Max&#39;s felt and tasted like home. 

Bonus when you check in you get 10% off your order so they show some Yelp love as well."

My coworker visited a few times before I did and definitely had me interested with his lunch choices. I have yet to try their lunches, but I&#39;ve had breakfast from there twice. The first time I ordered the country breakfast burrito. It was just the right amount of ingredients inside and very delicious as well. The second time I ordered the English muffin with eggs, bacon and cheese. The English muffin was toasted perfectly, and once again the perfect amount of ingredients were used. I spoke with Max and Dave and both of them were super friendly and informative about their products. I will definitely be frequenting Max Market for my soup and sandwich lunch.

The selection of items on the shelf are obviously limited (compared to a super market), but very comprehensive all at the same time in terms of what they cover.    Don&#39;t see something you know you&#39;ll buy often?  Let them know!  They seem to be very responsive!

Their deli/kitchen counter has some awesome meals made by (most of the time) Max himself or one of his staff.    The sandwiches are tasty, and made with some solid ingredients, the soups are out of this world.  They even carry Little Man Ice Cream. (and are next door to one of the most amazing dessert places in the city - the Inventing Room)

But one of the biggest perks for me is the coffee.... Max&#39;s brews Box Car beans and its f&#39;n fantastic.   Worth every penny.

We are very, very fortunate to have a place run with so much care, and attentiveness to what the customers want so close by.     This area of Denver was a bit of a food desert.  But with the new King Soopers opening a few blocks away for your big grocery runs, and now Max&#39;s for a quick errand, or a bite to eat... this is changing the face of the Ballpark. 

I hope all our neighbors stop by and give them a try, we need to support local establishments like this!"

The venue is deceptive. It looks small from the outside. The edge unit of a strip mall with people standing around waiting.....I had that sinking feeling in my stomach when I saw this site. However, my spirits were somewhat lifted when I walked inside. The place is much larger than it looks with multiple dining rooms and a covered patio. 

I also noticed there was a corn hole set outside if you wanted to kill time while waiting for your table. Also, you can see the reservation list from your phone when you sign in with the host so you can see how many people are before you which I thought was cool. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes on a Sunday at about noon.

There is a make your own bloody marry and mimosa table. Mimosas can be bottomless. The Irish coffee was sweetened with condensed milk, which is different and I enjoyed it. 

Although the place was packed and had a wait list, the place was well staffed. The bar tender was easy to flag down for orders and our waitress was prompt and attentive.

We all decided to share the food but made the mistake of ordering an appetizer and an entre for each of us. The portions here are huge! We started with the Fat Tire nachos which were great. One of my friends felt the bbq sauce was not necessary but still enjoyed the nachos. I thought they were good as they were. Varying opinions but the outcome was the same, fat tire nachos = good.

We shared the shrimp and grits, breakfast pizza and chicken and waffle. All were fantastic! Breakfast pizza could have probably been enough for all 3 of us by itself. It comes on a fluffy bread with lots of topings. The shrimp and grits were very well done with plenty of shrimp. The chicken and waffle comes with bacon and maple syrup. I made little waffle, syrup and bacon tacos out of them. That&#39;s an advanced move and don&#39;t try this at home unless you are a trained professional. The chicken was juicy as well. 

A fantastic experience and I will definitely be back!"

A few weeks ago I went here on a Sunday late morning for food and football.  I walked in and sat at a small table after asking where they would be showing the Broncos game.  He said that this was a Bills bar, cool, no problem.  I waited 15 minutes, at which time the server came over and told me I couldn&#39;t sit there and that I needed to move to the bar, even after I explained that I was going to be joined by 1-2 others in 20-30 minutes.  I told her no thanks, I&#39;ll go somewhere where my business is wanted, and walked out.

Today, I decided to try it again for lunch.  I sat at the bar this time.  A server got to me reasonably quickly.  Ordered pizza and it came and was good.  After requesting a box, I waited 30 minutes to get my check.  I spent an entire hour for what was supposed to be a quick lunch.  I feel that the service there was extremely slow, and on a workday, turn around time was far too long, I ended up taking a 90 minute lunch including driving time."

If you are in search of a good bloody mary bar this is it my friends. There are so many toppings and choices to make the bloody mary of your dreams that a section of the restaurant restaurant is dedicated to just that. This might make it hard to have just one. It is like a science experiment, pouring, testing, and sampling the ingredients to come up with a fool-proof tomato based beverage. Once you take a sip you will be singing U2 for the rest of the day. 

I prefer lots of horseradish and worcestershire, mixed with a little pickle juice and bloody mary mix from the local Real Dill. Top it off with a skewer of salami and cheese, dust the rim with some chili seasoning and a touch of celery salt and there you have it! This bloody mary will haunt your dreams until your next venture to Esters. 

Aside from the bloodys, the service is great, there is plenty of seating, and their patio is just the ticket! It is nice to have a go-to spot with delicious food in the neighborhood. I would say it is the newest and hippest location in the area. It is busy during brunch (mostly likely because of the bloody bar I rambled on about in the above paragraphs) but it is well worth the wait. It is also a great place to watch a game. They have plenty of seating and a huge projector in the back so you won&#39;t miss a beat. Their breakfast burrito comes two ways (veggie or chorizo) and both are amazing. They do not have a shortage of menu items so everyone is sure to find something they like. This cute little roost is easily one of my new favorites for a weekend breakfast. I can&#39;t wait to come back for dinner."

It&#39;s a great spot for families or large groups and they&#39;ve got tons of tv&#39;s so you don&#39;t have to miss out on your favorite games.

My husband found this spot after seeing all of the amazing reviews, so we knew we had to check it out.

The bar itself definitely bleeds Buffalo Bills, so one of the huge TVs is always reserved for that game each week and the other is reserved for the fans of Denver. Totally understandable. Anticipating a hard time getting a TV, we arrived 30 minutes early (which is what I would encourage non-Bills, -Broncos, and -Packers fans to do). Our early-bird-start got us a 40 inch TV and we were easily able to watch the game, which was great. 

In terms of the food, we were really impressed. We had the cheddar pretzel bites, which were delicious. My husband ordered the chorizo burrito and I had the berry salad. It was probably the best salad I&#39;ve had in an extremely long time. It came with goat cheese, blueberries, strawberries, candied pecans, basil, and was topped with a strawberry poppy seed vinaigrette. You can also add chicken or bacon. I definitely topped it off with the bacon, which made the salad absolutely perfect.

In addition to amazing food, we had incredible service. The place was packed and I never felt neglected by our server, Shelby. She even went so far as to bring me out some beer samples so I could better choose between a brown ale and a pumpkin beer......something that spoke volumes to me considering the insanity that was inside. I&#39;d happily sit in her station again.

Although I only ordered one beer while I was here, I was pretty impressed with their drink menu. They had quite the assortment of beer and wine. I also was super jealous of all of those enjoying the Mimosa ($11) and Bloody Mary ($7/$9 premium) bars.

Despite the incredible food, there were a few things that kept me from giving this place 5-stars. First, the dessert we ordered was not that good. We got the peach cobbler and it tasted a little burnt. Second, the Pumpkick beer I ordered, while tasty, was pretty warm. Delicious...but hard to fully enjoy given the temperature.

All-in-all, I was definitely really impressed with this place and will most certainly return next time we are in town."

Pizza, salads, sandwiches are always good staples for a pub. Their lunch special of a pizza and salad is a great value. The small pepperoni pizza was thin, perfectly cooked, and very tasty.

Especially when that someone is a longtime neighborhood resident.

The menu is fine-tuned seasonally and features fantastic thin crust pizzas, delicious sandwiches, and tasty salads.  Starters include nachos, wings, meatballs, and hummus and pita.  I would love to see a burger added to the menu but there&#39;s no grill in the kitchen, just a wood fired pizza oven.  A fryer was added to the mix when brunch service began and I believe the fried chicken on the brunch menu is the only fried item served at Esters.  Speaking of brunch, scrumptious choices abound.  Everything is made with love from scratch with fresh ingredients (it says so right on the menu) and you can most definitely taste the love. 

The bar menu is varied and extensive.  Beers rotate in and out with the seasons.  My go-to libation is the Infinite Monkey chardonnay but there are a good many more wines to sample.  I love the nod to the neighborhood with the Potenza Park cocktail - Tanteo jalapeno tequila, cucumber, lime and agave.  I feel like there has to be a story there because I don&#39;t think &#34;tequila&#34; when I see Potenza Park.  But it&#39;s a really good cocktail nonetheless.

The owners are huge Phish fans and if you are also then you&#39;ll recognize the band&#39;s song titles on the pizza menu.  Fee, Catapult, Ya Mar, Dog Faced Boy, My Sweet One, Fluffhead, and Lawn Boy are all excellent pie choices (with that amazingly light and crispy crust!).  [Sidebar:  My theory is that Esters is not only a beer reference but a reference to Esther, of one of Gamehendge&#39;s most beloved characters.]  Be sure to stop by during Couch Tour and catch Phish shows streamed on the big screens in the back room.

Paul and his team have created a warm and welcoming neighborhood hangout where the entire family will feel comfortable.  Kids eat free on Tuesdays and their parents know where to come on Wine Wednesday for half-price bottles of wine.  Watch a football game or a concert with your friends and neighbors.  Or sit on the cute patio that is both shaded from the sun and heated when it gets chilly.  This is the kind of place you might expect to see in a trendier neighborhood but, happily, it&#39;s right here in Virginia Village."

We started with the pork nachos and were blown away.  They were delicious!  The BBQ sauce was perfect, not too sweet or spicy.  The pork was juicy and the chips crispy.  

I got the steak sandwich and it was awesome too.  The bun was soft, the steak juicy, and the arugula fresh.

We will be back!"

The staff is amazing and very friendly. The menu changes Every few months with (what seems to be) seasonal specialties. We haven&#39;t had anything bad yet. The blueberry habanero wings are phenomenal and anything pork belly is good in my book. Unique drink mixes and great atmosphere.

Love it here!"

We have no kids and eat out 4-6 times a week for dinner. We came here almost 6 times in a 2 week period. Overall the experience went down hill on each visit. The first visit we were wowed and each visit getting progressively worse. There is always someone new behind the bar and if it&#39;s not Lydia the service is TERRIBLE. We prefer to sit at the bar but have even tried sitting at a table for better service and are always disappointed.  This past Saturday brunch will be our last visit. Terrible service at the bar even though it was almost empty. I Was watching a game it had a minute and a half left and they changed it and would not change it back for me. The food is pretty good although we have gotten cold food here on 2 different occasions. For them trying to be a &#34;neighborhood bar&#34; they fall far from that mark. We prefer Bull and Bush for a neighborhood bar we always get great service there. I think we have given them enough chances, Won&#39;t be back again"

I mean, it&#39;s in the neighborhood, so why not? Starting with critiques, the biggest negatives in my mind are that this place appears to always be extremely busy, parking can be very difficult (even on the street nearby), and because it is so busy it also tends to be very loud. These aren&#39;t criticisms of the pub itself, mind you, but they are factors that influence my personal experience. The fact that a place is busy and loud should not be taken as a negative. I certainly wouldn&#39;t hope that they became less busy in order that it could better meet my ideal. Therefore, this isn&#39;t a criticism, just a statement of the way things are. 

To the positives: the food. Esters does have a fairly extensive drink menu, but the real winner of this place is the delightful menu. Although I&#39;ve only been twice, I have not yet tasted anything that wasn&#39;t delicious. Their pizzas are top-notch: creative, well-prepared, and tasty. Another less obvious delight is the nachos on the starter menu - try them, then thank me. On both of my visits to Esters the service was also terrific. For as busy as this place is, the servers are friendly and attentive. 

I would, and have, recommend(ed) this establishment highly. Well done."

My sister lives nearby and invited me to dinner, so I didn&#39;t know much about the place and didn&#39;t know what to expect.  But what I experienced was amazing, both food and service.

1.  Awesome beer selection
2.  Amazing pizzas.... They have a pizza with prosciutto and fig on it and I&#39;m still thinking about how delicious the pizza was
3.  Fast and friendly service
4.  Didn&#39;t try it, put somebody in our group got the pork belly sandwich, and it looked amazing... I need to try that next time

I think that was too much BBQ sauce for one meal lol. So if you&#39;re getting the fat tire nachos (which you should), you shouldn&#39;t get the fee pizza, and try a different pizza instead so that you&#39;re getting more than BBQ flavors throughout the meal.

Upon entering, we were greeted by two pretty faces, and we were quickly ushered into the back room.  We could then tell the place was hip, ya know people hanging around drinking, laughing, and a nice spread out atmosphere with good music.  The back room is a great place to watch sports, very mellow, chill vibe.  Very new American, unique, almost felt like someone&#39;s house!

Our waiter was attentive, and quick to inform us of specials ($3 fat tire drafts).  
Water on the table immediately.  The FEE pizza was amazing, on point!  Unfortunately, the wings on this day were just burnt to a crisp, charred way beyond necessary!  We choked them down but only since we are easy going.  Oh, the tiramisu was without much flavor, tasted like mostly whipped cream.  For us, this could be a spot to come for just beer &amp; pizza.  4 stars i guess."

We have been here for both dinner and brunch and both are absolutely fantastic. I haven&#39;t had anything I didn&#39;t love and that I wanted more of.

I debated between 4- and 5-stars, mostly, I think, because 5-stars is a high standard that shouldn&#39;t be tossed around lightly. Here&#39;s what swayed me to 5 - in a word, it IS a legitimate 5 stars. Parking is limited and is really the only downside. Once parked and at the front door, every aspect of our experience was 5-stars for the remainder of the evening. 

The dining rooms and furnishings at Esters are modern and open, lighting is interesting and unique, and the atmosphere is lively and pleasant. They were busy when we arrived and getting busier (Saturday night), but didn&#39;t hesitate to seat us when only 3 of our party of 5 had arrived. Our wait person brought water and greeted us promptly and especially given how busy the restaurant was and the other tables she was serving, was amazingly attentive throughout our meal. 

And the food was simply terrific. We started with the Buffalo Wings (crispy, spicy and tangy - served with carrot and celery strips and ranch or blue cheese dressing - outstanding) and Fat Tire Nachos (braised pork, BBQ sauce, queso blanco, black beans, jalapenos, tomatos and sour cream). Then we moved on to the pizza - there are other options on the menu, but at its core, Esters is a pizza place. Pizzas have a thin crisp crust. We had one &#34;interesting&#34; pie - Dog Faced Boy (peppered pork belly, caramelized onions, boiled egg and arugula), and three more traditional pies - The Mikey (traditional pepperoni pizza), Catapult (sausage, peppers and caramelized onions) and Ya Mar (salami, ham, sausage and spicy red sauce). All were delicious. Value is very good, especially for the quality of the food. Wings were $8, nachos $10, and our pizzas $10, $13, $13 and $14 respectively for 12-inch pies. There are also many beers on tap, several wines, a number of signature cocktails and a large spirits menu with Colorado-made adult beverages highlighted.

The final defense of my 5-star review is that Esters is located on Holly just north of Evans. I live in Golden. Esters is neither close nor handy for me, but I will definitely be back. Probably more than occasionally. The drive just wouldn&#39;t be worth it for a merely mortal pizza pub. But Esters rises above the merely mortal. And it isn&#39;t just me - 165 of your other Yelp buddies have told you essentially the same thing. It&#39;s clear that I didn&#39;t just get lucky and catch them on a good night. Looks like pretty much every night is a good night at Esters. Bravo, Esters - keep up the great work."

They have bottomless mimosas and bloodys which is always a win. Again we had great service.
We share the chicken and waffles, a biscuit and gravy, and the chorizo burrito. 
The chorizo burrito was the winner for sure. Lots of cheese and veggies etc. The biscuit was a bit dry but the gravy was good. The chicken for the chicken and waffles was bone in which caught us off guard. That butter they put on the waffles though was amazing.
Better experience for sure."

FOOD
The server highly recommended the Shrimp &amp; Grits, as did the yelp reviews so I went for it.  While it had decent flavor and spice, it left much to be desired for the highest priced item on the menu.  The portion size was on the small side and the shrimp was also relatively small (U50s or maybe U40s) and only 6 were on the dish.  My guest was served half burned bacon and barely any gravy on his biscuit, however the server made it right and brought some more of each.

BEVERAGE
The blood orange mimosa was phenomenal - strong, just the way I like it, but also the right balance of sweet.  It&#39;s made with a blood orange liqueur, rather than just juice.  As for the self-serve unlimited mimosa bar, which my guest ordered - they aren&#39;t shy to bring you champagne refills (unlike many other brunch spots I have dined at), which was MUCH appreciated.  This probably attributes to the high ratings for the brunch reviews (alcohol always allows you have a better experience &#34;wink&#34;).  The price was also comparable to other spots at $14.  The self-serve bar is a nice concept but not executed well or maintained.  They had four juice containers and none of them were labelled so it was a guessing game (it would be a shame to add in a juice you didn&#39;t like or mix up a terrible combo) - I believe they were raspberry or pomegranate, lemonade (is what it tasted like &amp; didn&#39;t pair well with champagne), pineapple, and orange juices.  The berries ran out after my guests&#39;s first round (this was around 11am) and all that remained by the time we left (around 1230) was a little lemonade and some orange juice. 

SERVICE
Service was okay, but as well-organized and skilled at multi-tasking as our server was, it was impossible for her to provide exceptional/friendly/warm service as she had the entire back room (seemed like 40-50 covers) with minimal help from a busser and bartender.  As for the host staff, we were seated inside promptly upon arrival, but hostess seemed annoyed when I asked if there were tables available on the patio (which there were not - understandable - but an offer as to how long the wait would be would have been appreciated).  Also, it peeved me to watch the hostesses sprint, not even checking to see if their guests were keeping up, and then quickly run off after dropping the menus on the table, many time before the guests were even near the table.

My experience was about 2 Yelp stars, but giving them 3 because they have potential and a great menu (if executed properly)."

The meatballs were recommended and was very good. Our only complaint was that it was a little difficult to eat. The pork belly was nothing special, I was hoping it would be more tender but the black pepper aioli(?) on it was tasty.

Pros: the food was AMAZEballs. We ordered the wood-fired wings with habanero-blueberry sauce (OMG) and the pizza with pork belly strips, arugula, and a soft boiled egg (OMGOMGOMG). E had a grapefruit sour from Crooked Stave and then a La Folie...their beer list is really awesome! I like the $3 New Belgium pint night they do - it includes seasonals so I&#39;m going to try and go back to score some $3 Pumpkick pints! 

Cons: We were very much ignored when we arrived. It was unclear whether we should wait or seat ourselves (there was a hostess stand but no hostess) so after a bit of awkward hovering we sat ourselves at one of the big long pine tables right off the bar. After about five minutes, we also had to find our own menus - there was a waitress walking around but she and the bartender completely ignored is. Being in the service industry myself, it really irked me...I feel like the bartender of a restaurant has the power to set the mood, and it takes no time at all to at least greet a customer. Ten to fifteen minutes after arriving, we still hadn&#39;t been acknowledged and I was so hungry I considered leaving. In the end I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t - the waitress we had was ultimately great, and we loved the food - but the staff needed polishing. 

Also, I really wish the egg had been poached instead of soft boiled...it would have been easier to eat with the pizza!

Verdict: Loved the food. Hope the staff gets it together. That&#39;s the only reason I didn&#39;t give it five stars!"

I like how they give you a bottle of water so you can pour it at your own will. The chef walked around endlessly which I thought was very warming! I mean, who ever talks to the chef?! We did! 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and biscuits and gravy. The chicken is ON THE BONE, which I hate, but the crust was amazing. My waffle was extra crispy, which I kinda didn&#39;t like. Great syrup comes with it!

The biscuit and gravy was DELICIOUS! Buttery biscuit and hearty sausage gravy! Yum! I even took it home for leftovers- EVEN BETTER!"

We arrived round 9:15 and went to the rear nook where there were a few TVs and another bar.  We waited roughly 15minutes at which point my wife caught the attention of a waiter.  He said he would be right back and at first look he wanted to know what we wanted.  Where it was evident we had no drinks or food, this was a tad perplexing to us.

The pizza&#39;s are yummy and really well priced if you compare to Silvi&#39;s kitchen for the same size pie.  Great selection of beers, wish I had not been on the time clock, so will try a happy hour or a brunch another time.  The pork belly sandwich is yummy too, I tried a bite of that and it was served with a side salad. Service is a little slow, but was not bad, however wait staff could be a little more accommodating to the working lunch crowd."

Very trendy decor but comfortable, with a nice patio.  This is in a heavy residential area, so lots of young families already have discovered this place, and they do have a kids menu &amp; family night. This is predominately a pizza bar. 

Highlights:
Service was great, from hostess to our table server.
Lots of Colorado beer to choose from.  
The menu isn&#39;t very extensive or complicated but offers unique fare. 

Lowlight:
I had the Dog Faced Boy pork belly pizza which I sadly have to say was not very good. Presentation was great, but it was very bland.  

All the other food that went past us looked amazing though so I&#39;ll be back to try something else as everything else about this place was really great."

We picked this up last week while we were moving. It was truly great pizza and what I remember most is the crust. It reminded me of this David Chang article I just read on Wired. Read this: &#34;When a dish is perfectly seasoned, it will taste simultaneously like it has too much salt and too little salt. It is fully committed to being both at the same time.&#34; That was Esters pizza crust."

To start: bloody mary bar was great, lots of optional additions like bacon, peppers, olives, seasonings, etc. All of the bloody mary mix that was out was very spicy so I had to ask for regular tomato juice to tame mine down, which sort of worked.

We shared the Fat Tire Nachos and those were ohhhhh-soooo-gooood. Perfect combination of crunchy/spicy/creamy goodness.

I had the shrimp &amp; grits and thought is was just ok. Missing a texture element.  

My dad had the classic breakfast and it looked pretty basic.

My mom had the huevos rancheros and it looked different but she seemed to like it.

I&#39;ll be back for more nachos and to try out some other items off the menu. 

Friendly staff and great atmosphere."

Knew we were coming. The server didn&#39;t completely charge someone for their drinks and dint realize until after that person left so the owner made me and another coworker pay their tab but at the time claimed that our coworker walked out on their tab. Then continued to berate us for fowl language claiming they were trying to uphold a family image that we didn&#39;t fit in to. The food isn&#39;t that great either and the bartender doesn&#39;t know how to make anything beyond pouring beer. If you dont fit into their ideal customer box expect to get treated poorly.

One can feel comfortable in Colorado casual (aka yoga pant...ladies you know who ya is) or if you are stopping in after work in your suit n tie, you will feel like you are a part of the Ester community.  

Ester&#39;s is slightly tucked away but the closes intersection is Evans and Holly.  Be prepared to find that this place is larger than it appears.  

Wait staff - nice, friendly, prompt!  

Menu - not Cheesecake Factory huge but tastes equally as yummy and not as costly.  Husband enjoyed their hot wings and humus.  I got my grub on with the roasted vegetables salad!  Seriously, I was so busy eating this lovely marriage of flavor I forgot to talk to my girlfriend.  

If we had friends coming in town I would totally take them to Ester&#39;s.  Happy hours / will be spent here too."

I am so happy we have this place in our neighborhood.  It is so cute and the service is always fantastic, and even though it seems like there are all hipsters working they are friendly and sweet. 

They have cocktails for cheap!! 5-8 dollars for a yummy hand made cocktail!! That is a happy hour price at most places.  The drinks are yummy, too.  Regular cucumber collins, spiked lemonade and other herb infused cocktails.  The patio is perfect, I love the decor, like urban hipster country or something.

We have had the pizza, and it was yummy, handmade and crispy.  I will try the sandwiches at some point. 

Mostly I am thrilled to have one more NOT dive bar that is less than 2 miles from home."

The food is spot on, the vibe is super pleasant, and never once did it feel pretentious or seedy. 

Best part: it&#39;s a family bar! I know that sounds weird but amid all the football chaos, there were children everywhere enjoying the game! Doesn&#39;t feel watered down because of the kiddos either. Just an awesome place for everyone. No exceptions.

Opened this month (June 2015) and has an incredible vibe, outdoor patio, great drink list and incredible pizza and wings.  I looked for a website after my visit and found Denver architectural firm Roth Sheppard Architects did the beautiful redesign and interior work.  I tip my hat on a job very well done to the owner and design firm.  I posted a few photos on Yelp as that&#39;s what I do.

One thing I love is that they usually have La Folie on tap, so I know they know good beer. I sat down and had something from Former Future and was quite happy. In looking at their menu, it tells you that no matter what you&#39;re eating, they&#39;re cooking it in a wood-fired oven, which is always a good sign (and usually means you get your food fast). I got one of their pizzas, and my girlfriend got the pork nachos. We were both very happy with our food, the pizza was pretty big for being a specialty pizza, so I even had leftovers. The nachos were just about perfect, there were enough toppings that you weren&#39;t stuck with a bunch of chips at the end like most places. Our bartender was also very friendly.

Let&#39;s see the service was mediocre but not horrible. The atmosphere just felt dirty like the whole place needed a good scrubbing! The food.. The complimentary chips tasted homemade but probably a few days old .. This was a slow Wednesday evening mind you I get it ... the salsa was blazing hot but yummy, I ordered the shrimp trio and my hubs ordered the seafood soup both dishes were a nice presentation with a tasty rice and fresh fixings.. Lime, lettuce, salsa and tortillas etc.. a descent variety of hot sauce on the tables I would go back honestly on a busier weekend night and hope for fresh chips and a clean table"

We ordered 3 different tortas, one with lots of meat, one with egg and chorizo, and a kids one, very basic with ham and cheese, all were great. We also ordered the fruit salad with nuts, whipped cream, etc. also pretty good.  My only negatives are two things, that seemed to detour me from coming back.  1. parking sucks. limited parking.  2. seating sucks. no tables, so you have to sit counter style and for a family not very comfortable or private.  Next time, I will take my tortas to go!  Last note, you get the option of chipotle sauce (no idea why?) and jalapenos with every torta.  Order the jalapenos, they don&#39;t make the torta that much more spicy and definitely adds some flavor.  Or get them on the side and try it out in little quantities."

4 stars for friendliness of staff.
1 star for efficiency.   They are INCREDIBLY, MIND-BOGGLING slow.  

Do yourself a favor, find the menu, order ahead of time. Your order will be ready in about 40 minutes.  No joke.   Even if you&#39;re first in line with an empty lobby, you&#39;ll wait at least 20 minutes.  This isn&#39;t mallard or filet mignon... it&#39;s an f&#39;ing torta!  It&#39;s a great torta... probably the best around, but no one can figure out why they take so long.

It&#39;s become a weekend staple for us, especially after a late night. When your body craves a greasy disgusting hamburger, give it a Mexican torta, instead. It will thank you later...

Pros:
1. amazing food
2. once the food is ordered, it&#39;s quick to prepare
3. you can actually see the cooking station, and it is ALWAYS clean (not to mention fun to watch the &#34;Torteros&#34; do their thing!)

Cons:
1. the parking lot is... strange... just drive defensively and you&#39;ll be fine
2. a little difficult to spot, so watch for the other Mexican restaurant, and a auto garage
3. if you go there when it&#39;s busy, the place can get pretty crammed. It&#39;s not meant to be a sit-down place, although there is a solid amount of bar-stool seating. So, if you&#39;re going right at peak lunch time, plan a back-up in case you can&#39;t eat it there
4. the menu is in spanish for the most part... they do have small take-out menus in English by the register, so grab one of those an you&#39;ll be all good.

I always get the breaded skirt steak, and it has never failed me. I also like my tortas spicy, so when they ask me if I want chipotle sauce or peppers, I get both. It&#39;s authentic, fresh, well-made, and such a great price!"

It took them 40 minutes to prepare four tortas and when I expressed my dissatisfaction, the best excuse they provided was that the chicken tortas take longer to cook. People who ordered after I did got their food ahead of me. After watching the cooks switch tickets out of order, I believe they deliberately take longer to cook your food if you don&#39;t tip. This isn&#39;t a traditional sit down restaurant with a waitress, I don&#39;t believe it merits a tip. I paid $42 for 4 tortas and 2 drinks and walked out a disgruntled customer 40 minutes later."

The menu is on the wall and in spanish 1st, the english is below each item. We had my friend meet my hubby and I. they got the Chiva, its a mix of egg, pork, avocado, and few other things. I got the huérfago ( I think I may be butchering the name but its close) It was more meat without cheese. When ordering you will be asked if you want chipotle sauce on your, its not a lot and mild, so get it. We also got fruit drinks, I had the cantaloupe, Hubby - mango, friend - strawberry. All very good and refreshing. The food comes out fairly fast. they were very tasty but thought for the cost lacking inside in quantity. The cost was $7.99 per sandwich and $2.99 for the drinks. so for a place like this i would say its pricey. 
I just saw the pictures of the sandwiches, ours did not look near this full. 

The whole place stares at you for being white, We had one guy who just kept eyeballing us. We just ignored them and enjoyed our food. 

Now caution on the bathroom. it needs repairs and cleaning. 

So would I go back, maybe if I&#39;m in the hood and hungry as it was good and quick, just not as cheap as the folks on yelp tell you. I think I&#39;ve done better at a roach coach and had just as good for less."

The location is small clean bright with tvs playing soccer and telenovellas while Mexican music plays in the background. 
We ordered the Ingrata and espanola sandwiches. The bread is light and buttery and delicious and I definitely recommend getting the chipotle sauce on it. It adds just the right amount of heat and kind of makes the sandwich taste like a fancy sloppy Joe (and who wouldn&#39;t want that?)"

I share a tack room with TG and she accidentally locked me out thinking I had already left (keys to car and cell phone were in the tack room). This happened just as the biggest dust storm ever blew through the stables; so I had to wait in my horse&#39;s stall until I could even see to get to the phone. I finally got a hold of her and she said she was really not that far away. So, back she came and with half of her lunch. She said I had saved her from eating the whole thing. And then she offers me the remaining half of her sandwich. Since I was starving and we are friends, I said sure.

Oh yum. The torta was chicken, avocado, and jalapeno on this fabulous grilled bread. Although half a sandwich, it was a meal for me. I inhaled half of it at the stables and then brought the rest home to savor. I can tell you, there is no sugar coating on TG&#39;s reviews and she is dead on with her review of Las Tortugas. OMG, I cannot wait to go back and order one to my specification. And the husband will be giddy about the bacon offering.

I&#39;ve tried the Chiva, Colorada, and Hawaina, and they are all deliclious. The place is really small but that&#39;s okay. I like to sit along the cooks&#39; window and watch them cook my food. The menu is in Spanish, but luckily I vaguely remembered some words from my high school (and part of college) Spanish. They have paper to-go menus in English on the counter, so that may help you out A LOT. This place pretty much only serves tortas and juices. I want to try their fruit juices because I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re good but not sure which yet. Maybe pineapple, cantaloupe, or carrot...not sure if they have mixed fruits? All the employees there are super friendly. There&#39;s this one guy named Leo who is really nice and he said next time he&#39;ll make me his special so I&#39;ll have to go back for that soon! It costs under $8 for a torta but they are a pretty good size. I usually eat half and save the rest for later (which is just as good) or split with someone. Btw, they put avocado in all of the tortas i think! Also, when you order you get to choose jalapeno or chipotle sauce--I get chipotle because i&#39;m too wimpy and can&#39;t eat spicy. but you can try either or or both. i wish they had sopapillas or churros here but oh well."

You can&#39;t go wrong with any order - these tortas are made while you wait on a piping hot grill.  Delicious pork, ham, bacon, chicken - even breakfast tortas. The extra deliciousness comes from tons of cheese and a schmear of refried beans on the crispy grill-toasted bun.   Ask for extra jalapeos and they will gladly throw them on..!   These aren&#39;t tiny little tortas - you may feel guilty eating a whole one but it&#39;s definitely worth it.

Carly P and our boys decided to take advantage of the nice weather and sip on a few brews on the patio, this past Saturday. Although it was a little chilly, we enjoyed the fall weather by the fire. This time I tried an American Pale Ale, while Ben opted for the Pretzel lager (which was surprisingly good). This time I was able to try a few of their menu options, and so glad we did! The pretzel is HUGE and so tasty - perfect for sharing! Their fried pickles are beyond delicious and perfectly fried!

I&#39;ll state again how much I like the vibe of this place. Relaxed and chill is the best way to describe this place :) Although I don&#39;t have any kids, it&#39;s nice to find a kid friendly bar for whenever we decide to have a few of our own.

Everything from the food to the drinks to the service is great.

The food is pretty reasonably priced and there are some creative drinks that are also at an average price point.

The ambience here is pretty nice, just loud. There are rows and rows of long table benches for everyone to sit, chat, eat, and drink.

It gets pretty busy around 7p-8p, so come prepared to use your outside voices.

Overall, this is a cool little place to hang out with friends and family."

Arrived an hour before close on Monday night, so the place was not busy at all. Huge craft beer selection, but what I liked about it, is that even if it&#39;s a beer garden, they also served cocktails for the non-beer drinker like me!!!! Most beer gardens I go to with friends, I end up just sitting out and drinking water, but I love how Lowry&#39;s has about 5-6 cocktails to choose from and they even have about 4-6 different types of mules. Ample seating under &#34;indoor&#34; tent, or outside-more-open space tent lit up with nice garden string lights. Also, GREAT music, 90s playlist from new wave, freestyle, old skewl rap and pop.

Can I just say how AWESOME it is to have a spot out here in the East Denver/Aurora area that is NOT A CHAIN!!!  And the owners did an excellent job of truly planing the details of this place.

As far as the Lowry Beer Garden itself, they have many craft beers to choose from as well as the regular &#34;generic&#34; beer that you can get everywhere else. For those non-beer drinkers they do serve several types of cocktails as well.  There is seating both in an outside open area, or a more covered interior.  There is ample seating and great for big groups.  We were there on a Monday night, so it really wasn&#39;t super busy, which was perfect for us.  I recommend trying any of their special craft beers.

It was about 3pm and sunny spots were hard to come by since the patio faces east and has a massive hangar directly to the south that eats up most of the winter sun at a pretty early hour. Still, we found a spot at a long, communal table and enjoyed the rays that lasted almost exactly the length of one beer. 

E got a banana bread beer which was one of their bottled selections, it was weird but also pretty good! I opted for an Apricot Blonde from Dry Dock, which was on $3 special during March Madness games! That made it even more delicious :)

E ordered some wings, which were okay but pretty typical. The people sitting next to us had some delicious-looking burgers. The pretzel also looked good.

This place may not brew their own beer but they have a great selection both bottled/canned and on draft, and they serve good, traditional munchies. The location is closer to our apartment than most of my favorite breweries and it&#39;s nice to sit outside on their awesome patio and admire the huge aircraft on display outside the Wings Over the Rockies museum next door. I might wait until summer to go back, though...then the shady patio will be amazing and much-needed!"

They have a fabulous tap list with a broad range of options. I wish there were a few more sours on tap, but that&#39;s not really problematic. The way it&#39;s set up is there are three alcoves at the back of the beer garden for food orders, food pick-up, and drinks. The bartender was super fast, so there really wasn&#39;t much of a line. The servers circled the garden frequently and kept the place super clean. 

In terms of the garden itself, they had lots of great outdoor seating. The lighting was subtle yet sufficient. There was a great relaxing vibe with just the right amount of bustle for vibrancy. I was fortunate that they had live music that night. The Tito Malaga band was amazing!

They have a lot of food offerings for a reasonable price.  I tried the JC Boar Brat and an order of onion rings.  The onion rings were just your bar standard rings.

I wasn&#39;t incredibly impressed by the atmosphere, but the food and the beer did really stand out.  Being out in the suburbs, it has a more family atmosphere; there were a few kids around as well as a lot of large groups there for whatever special occasion.   That being said, it was hard to snag a spot  for even 2 people, and we even got some mean stares from other clientele apparently unwilling to share a portion of their large beer hall style table.  Major downside: vertical IDs not accepted, and my almost-24-year-old friend wasn&#39;t able to enjoy a beer with me.  The bartender was super nice, and helped me select a beer from the large list--all their drafts are locals, and they have many more available in can/bottle.  For dinner, I had a burger, they have many styles you can select from, and is was very good, surprisingly good.

I&#39;m all for kids being able to go wherever but it was an insane amount and they were pretty much unsupervised since the parents were enjoying a cold one. That aside, the food line was 15 people deep and beers are a tad overpriced. If I want an Apricot from Dry Dock, I&#39;m rather pay their prices and get free popcorn that go someone too crowded and overpriced. Props to them for thinking of a genius idea and planting it right in the middle of Lowry and next to the Wings over the Rockies Museum, it has to be a cash cow!

Most of the seating inside were long tables and benches kind of looked like a cafeteria. There are also heaters inside for those who get cold easily. I was pleasantly surprised that this place was packed for a Wednesday night! There were a lot of families with babies everywhere so it must be family friendly. 

They had a ton of drink choices and your typical bar food. I tried an apricot ale which was pretty good and a peach ale from lone tree that was in a can but was a bit bitter. My friends and I got a small fries $3 which was pretty typical. I liked their presentation of the food since it came in a paper box. Made it seem fancier than it really was.

The menu has some other interesting sausage options and an extensive beer menu.  

It also looks as though the neighborhood is great."

I went there for lunch and had (I forgot the name) but it egg, chili, and cheese and my choice of meat was ground chuck, cooked medium along with a side of fries. 

Starting off, it was a beautiful day and I regret not sitting on the patio... they have a killer patio with plenty of seating. Upon ordering the gentleman that helped my buddy and I was extremely courteous and patient while we ordered, cause I have never been there. 

As far as the food goes, I unfortunately have to say I wasn&#39;t satisfied, at all. Wait, let me rewind... the fries were pretty damn good. As far as the burger goes... it really didn&#39;t have much taste to it. It didn&#39;t seem like it was freshly patted out and put on a flat top, it tasted like an unseasoned burger that you get in bulk from Sam&#39;s Club. Didn&#39;t seem like they did anything to season the burger, it was like I had a meat patty with a lot of ingredients to cover up the taste (or lack thereof) of the ground chuck. I guess I am disappointed because the burgers are a highlight of the Beer Garden, it&#39;s not like I am going to a Chinese restaurant asking for a burger. My expectations were much higher, maybe that is my fault. 

One good thing I can say is I will give The Beer Garden another shot at proving themselves, maybe I just caught them on a bad day. Next time I am in the area, I will be sure to give it another college try. 

I would have given 2 stars, but the service was solid."

Now? I&#39;m a big fan! I suggest NOT staying away from the seared ahi tuna salad! It was so flavorful and the tuna was actually excellent!
In the evening, you can buy s&#39;mores fixings for 5 bucks and burn up your marshmallows in the fire pits out front!

The food is awesome - the elk sausage is my favorite. The pretzels are a must try as well, and are the tastiest I have ever had. There is just a hint of sweetness that makes them perfect.

The beer selection is solid - I have spent many hours just drinking there and enjoying the fellowship.

Service was friendly and prompt.  The space is awesome as well - open with a covered and uncovered area.  Had a good vibe too.

We had the pleasure of having our wedding reception at a combination of the Wings over the Rockies and the Beer Garden.  Josiah and Casey were amazing and wonderful to work with in getting the Beer Garden all set with food and drink for our large wedding guest list!  They also were able to help with providing great finger food next door at the Museum at the start of the reception.

All of our guests, from all parts of the world, loved the Beer Garden!   The food reflected Colorado, and also the local beers and drinks.  What made it super special was that all the food was prepared fresh, unlike any other wedding that the guests attended.  

The casual but very presentable venue at the Beer Garden made it very festive.  

As this is our one year anniversary, we are still getting compliments on our amazing reception, enabled by the Beer Garden and staff!

We went for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  It wasn&#39;t crowded at all, which was nice.  There is a very large patio with communal seating, as well as indoor space.  There is no table service (at least that I saw), so you walk up to the counter and place your order, and they give you a buzzer for when it&#39;s ready.

They were offering a lunch special - for $9.95 you could order any of their sausages, add whatever toppings you&#39;d like, fries and also a soda.  You could upgrade the drink to a beer (from a small list - disappointing) for $3 more.

I ordered the bacon cheddar brat with the &#34;J.C.&#34; for toppings (jalapeno cream cheese and carmelized onions).  The fries on the side were really good, and we also shared the fried pickles, which were delicious!  Our food didn&#39;t take long to be ready, which was great, since I was getting real hangry. My main criticism would be that the bun to sausage ratio was way off.....it was very hard to eat because the bun was so huge.  If they could fix that, it would be much better!

The cashier was generally friendly, but seemed kind of annoyed.  Perhaps she was having a bad day.  It was strange that the food and beer were 2 different steps, and also that they are not dog friendly.  This seems like the perfect place to hang out with your dog, but they don&#39;t allow that.

Overall, it was a great place.  The view of the Air and Space Museum was awesome, and they have plenty of seating.  Also a ping pong table and fire pits!"

Located next to the air museum, you are literally sitting near the huge airplane while enjoying dinner and beers.

With lights everywhere and outdoor seating, it&#39;s the perfect place to bring a group of friends and hang out.  For those who get chilly, no worries, there are plenty of fire pits and complimentary blankets around to keep you warm.  You can either sit at a table where a server brings you beer or you can order your own at the food/bar area. 

It&#39;s fast food style ordering of everything but the quality is great.

They have local brews as well as fun events like trivia night and Oktoberfest festivities (think live band and dancing)!  

The place usually clears up by 9 due to the young families that tend to come here and that&#39;s not a problem with me! 

Please order the dry dock pumpkin beer and the giant pretzel. I&#39;m addicted to you!"

The staff is wonderful, the food is delicious (and it comes out super quick) and they have a really great selection of beers on tap. The atmosphere is really nice and the fire pits were an added bonus once it got chilly out. However, my only complaint is that there were kids running around everywhere. I&#39;m not sure if Denver parents just can&#39;t read, but it clearly says Lowry BEER Garden on their sign, not Chuck E Cheese. Bring your kids somewhere more appropriate like the zoo, museum, go cart tracks... Not a beer garden. The staff is not running a daycare so you can go get drunk. If you are going to bring your child to the bar, at least make sure that they are being respectful and not running around like crazy."

We&#39;re here in December and they have their Christmas lights timed to the music....its a lovely touch.
OK, OK, food........The Bison braut was FANTASTIC!! They have a condiment bar that is very creative with some interesting choices.

BUT...We won&#39;t be going back.

Some friends and work were meeting there after work today, and my wife&#39;s art studio us pretty close to the Beer Garden.  I called and asked the person who answered the phone if they allowed dogs.  The young lady answering the phone said that you could have dogs, but only outside - and there was a special spot with grass and shade where they have water for the dogs.

When my wife showed up with two small dogs in tow, the employee working the entrance to the garden informed her that she could tie the dogs up by the tree outside, but the dogs couldn&#39;t come on the patio.

That chain of events sucked, but the situation was compounded by the extremely unprofessional manager on duty.  When I told him that one of his employees had told me that dogs were OK at the Garden he said &#34;My employees wouldn&#39;t have told you that.&#34;

From a customer perspective he was either calling me a liar, or he was being an arse - or both.  I don&#39;t know your name (and I did try to find you afterwards - where were you hiding?), but if you are that manager, you need to get a grip on your role in the customer service business, &#39;cause you some across as a complete arse.  It&#39;s not complicated:  don&#39;t call your customers liars, and don&#39;t be a dick."

When we had visitors from out of state - we said we had to take them to Lowry&#39;s.   Big Mistake!

We arrived earlier in the evening than the last time - about 430pm.  And it was like Daddy day care on steroids.   I don&#39;t mind kids - I have a few myself - and I don&#39;t mind families enjoying a night out - but when you have parents that let their kids run amuck, throw dirt and scream at the top of their lungs - I&#39;m out!

We had difficulty finding a table because one group had spread their kids&#39; stuff out over 3 tables - when they could have used 1.   The kids were running rampant and literally throwing dirt on other customers.   

The food was lack luster this go around - not sure if it was the ambiance of screaming children - or the cook was off that night.   

I realize that the parents are to blame - but Lowry&#39;s staff could do a better job of ensuring tables are cleared and ask parents to control their kids and condense their space.    It&#39;s an outdoor BEER Garden - not a play ground!

There&#39;s a large outdoor area with cute outdoor hanging lights. Seating is mostly large benches and tables but there are also smaller tables available. There is indoor seating as well but the outdoor area is prime. 

Outdoors there&#39;s also a couple of fireplaces and a ping pong table that kids mostly use. There is a great selection of beer and the menu items consists of hot dogs and bratwursts in different variations and combinations. 

Prices are kind of steep. My raspberry vodka lemonade was $6-7 and was unremarkable in taste.

My favorite beer from here is the passion fruit beer...it&#39;s a little sweet and sour, but I enjoy stuff like that.

Talk about a solid place for people to debrief from a long work week. I&#39;m all about this place when it comes time for some libations. The one and only thing that I don&#39;t like about LBG is the location. It&#39;s a bit hard to find because Lowry is confusing, so I would suggest using your Yelp map on your phone to find it. However, there&#39;s a big airplane right in front of it so if you find that landmark you&#39;re golden. 

The space is set up as both indoors and outdoors which is great for all kinds of people. They have long tables and short ones; high top tables and low top. Come with a group or just by yourself and there will be plenty of room for all. It&#39;s not uncommon to see work groups congregate here so just be aware that it can, at times, get loud and crowded. The beer line can be lengthy but they are quick and polite and ready to serve. Sometimes families show up so there are kiddos running around. But, at least you know their parents are cool if they are down to drink (or just really NEED a drink).

The staff is very prompt in service and totally friendly. It&#39;s an environment that is conducive with good times, great friends, and plenty of beer. Not that they only serve beer but that&#39;s a big chunk of their product. Most beers change so there are plenty of options for all kinds of tastes. I also enjoy the rotating cider that they have. Additionally, they also have food which is always a good thing cuz you don&#39;t wanna be too wasted at 6pm. I appreciate the option.

Overall, this is a very enjoyable spot which is a great place to hang out. I don&#39;t think I would spend an entire evening there but it&#39;s great for tossing back a few with co-workers. They even have a ping-pong table which just adds to the fun. Solid place with solid drinks that aren&#39;t too expensive. Stop in - have a few - enjoy."

Like fellow Yelper stated,  will be a great place to meet and chat away in warm evenings in great surrounding listning to the Journey. ..yeah that&#39;s what they are playing on this wintery day past prime lunch time.   Only few people in here inside the heated covered area, nicely warmed up.  Drinking cold IPA and listening to 80s tunes, how can I rate less than 5 stars?!

--$14.31 for a fancy burger and micro brew.     Hmmm.. it wasn&#39;t that fancy and didn&#39;t even come with fries.   I could  have done better.

This place has made itself markedly less welcome to families. We used to come here because it was one of the only places where we could relax and have a drink while the kiddos behaved like monkeys. Now the play area is gone, signs ask parents to keep their kids leashed (not unreasonable, honestly), and ping pong players have to be old enough to buy cigs. I was never a huge fan of the food, but who cares when it was so kid friendly? Now we have no reason to go here. 

I understand why people were confused and annoyed by the kids -- it&#39;s a beer garden after all. But it was a beer garden with a kids menu, a play area, and games. The message was &#34;bring your kids!&#34; Now the message is &#34;keep them home!&#34; So we will.

We ordered one beer, the fellow mis-poured. I noted for him to give us a sample and we would likely purchase that one sitting there. He walked away and helped someone else. Same thing with the food, just a little snooty at the counter, no suggestions. 

We do feel the food quality is good, but about 15% over the expected price. So, instead of mulitple beers, which is where they make their revenue, we just did the one. 

Our trips there will be when there is nothing else in area available, rather than seeking out the Beer Garder."

I come here before going to shows at the Soiled Dove rather than going to the Tavern. They have an extensive craft beer selection, which often leads to a long line at the bar as folks try to figure out which beer to select. 

I almost always get the elk brat. You definitely can&#39;t go wrong with this. My favorite thing on the menu, though, is the the fried pickles. The breading is perfect. It&#39;s almost like the skin on southern fried chicken. Mmmmmmm."

Always a great beer selection, the veggie burgers and fried pickles are amazing. The pretzels and salads are good if you want lighter fare.

It is loud and full during the warmer months. If you want a quiet environment with table side service and no kids running around, this is not the place for you. However,  if you want a fun family friendly environment with an amazing staff and shared seating so you can meet some new friends, def check it out!

I can understand the other reviewers who mentioned kids being a little bit of a nuance, just because it&#39;s such a large space and appealing to kiddos. I loved that there was food. I ordered a burger topped with feta, cucumber and tomato (Mediterranean stuff) and it was pretty good, a little bit over priced but it was convenient and fast.

Our favorites are the fried pickles, onion rings, southwestern salad with salmon and the buffalo burger with egg and chili.

The bartender was super nice and let me sample some of the beers. The dry dock apricot ale was so aromatic and fruity- perfect blend. 

They had fun games in the corner of the bar, we just chilled with our beers and played UNO. Shared Fried pickles with ranch dressing. They also have a condiment bar with cool mustards variations: berry mustard, apricot mustard etc

We both got a hamburger that was supposed to be 100% premium ground chuck, and it might have been, however it was in the shaped of one of the frozen burgers... that didn&#39;t bother me overly much though. What did bother me that was my burger was very under cooked to the point that it was cold on the inside so only about 1/4 of the burger got eaten. My husband&#39;s burger was cooked a little better, but was still cold on the inside. The atmosphere seemed good and it&#39;s definitely a unique little place.

Of course a 70-degree day in November certainly helped persuade my star rating to a well-deserved 5 stars...and why not it&#39;s out of this world.

You can sit outside on numerous picnic tables; play Ping-Pong, Foosball (yep, an outdoor Foosball table), there are ample gigantic space heaters, lights, canopies, and a flower garden. Or you can convene, drink and dine inside. There are numerous picnic tables and high-tops to choose from. Plus on nice days like today, it&#39;s completely open! That summarizes the garden part...

But, it is all about the beer. There are so many beers on tap, they rotate them in and out and you&#39;ll always find, Avery, Odell&#39;s, Copper Kettle, Breckinridge and Deschutes. They also have a massive bottle selection; the list is longer than Rapunzel&#39;s hair.

Now, throw in $6 Burgers, Brats and Dogs ($4 Jumbo Dog), salads, wings, street tacos, you&#39;ve got the makings of a great party. I had the Elk Jalapeño Cheddar brat. I&#39;m not sure what kind of bread/roll/non bun/ was used, but it was incredible. Almost like a crunchy Lobster roll thing happening there. It made the brat!"

Fine by me...I had no intention of drinking anyway.  I guess that means I&#39;m a second class citizen at Lowry&#39;s.

If you find yourself in Denver and want to really enjoy yourself and a lot I really great food....Lowry Beer Garden is the place that that you need to visit.  They have a wall of beer both in tap and in the bottle.  Unfortunately they have actually carry the &#34;big 3&#34; but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s because of some stupid contract with the beer suppliers.  

The have a great selection of food to go with your beverage of choice.  My two favorites are the super pretzel and the elk-jalapeño and cheddar brat. There just isn&#39;t anything better IMHO.

They have a different local brewery as the highlight beer of the month so pay attention to he Facebook page or sign up for their emails if you are waiting for one of the local brewery&#39;s to be selected.  

Of course Octoberfest is probably the best time of year to come for a drink, but then again there is NEVER a bad time to visit Lowry and drink!"

Love the interior/exterior setup which lends itself easily to big parties with a lot of available seating. Heat lamps outside make it comfortable for the spring/fall nights and the awnings make warm summer evenings very pleasant.

The food is excellent and reasonably priced, though not overly complicated. Burgers, fries, and brats to die for. The menu is set up similar to Biker Jims in Denver where you order a brat, a topping set and a side. They use buzzers to get your food to you, which is efficient and works quickly and easily (while avoiding the annoying announced number overhead which are so very easy to miss).

The beer selection is quite good with a number of taps that rotate often, offering a variety of brewers and beer styles appropriate to the season. On top of the taps there is an extensive bottle list which also is often changed up to bring in new and different breweries. They do an especially good job of keeping local breweries such as Great Divide and Dry Dock around and on tap.

They are also very family friendly with free ping pong outside and very inexpensive foosball (fun for adults too!), most times I have been here there are plenty of kids running around in the early evening hours. I&#39;m sure this is a positive for young adults with kids, others may mind this more, though I did not.

However this is a great spot to stop for a drink or a simple inexpensive dinner. Also perfect for meeting coworkers or large groups since no reservation is required and space is plentiful."

I&#39;m not usually quite so punctual with yelp reviews, but I can still taste gyro on my tongue, so I figure now is as good of a time as any. Afia Grill is a bit out of the way unless you live out Aurora way (as I do - my deepest condolences to others in this situation). It is tucked away in a mostly empty shopping center, not really visible from any real streets, and thus probably doesn&#39;t get the kind of attention that it deserves. 

The interior of the restaurant is about what you would expect - lots of hookahs and rugs, things that might make those of us who&#39;ve never been to the Middle East reminisce about a place we&#39;ve never been before. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted warmly. Afia Grill is an order at the counter type place, and the menu stretches across three flat screen TVs (without a great deal of order or design consideration, and was at least momentarily confusing). I opted for a Gyros Plate (White Guy, table for one!), which turned out to be a great choice. For only $6.99 I was given a plate piled high with rice (surprisingly delicious), salad, and gyros. The gyros were, without exaggeration, among the best that I&#39;ve ever had. They were tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned, clearly homemade - worth remembering. 

I will definitely be back, soon..."

On the back of our ad was a selection of what apparantly Americans like to eat, and the store has a different version of the ad of what their locals eat. We decided to get the Mendi, with the chicken and lamb for 2 people. When the owner brought it out, holy moly it was a ginormous silver platter to share. I especially liked the grilled chicken(dark meat part) which had good flavor seeped into the meat. Eating off a communal plate feels much more engaging with the people you&#39;re with. 

This is a great place to get to know Middle-Eastern food. The owner is really friendly and will tell you what each item is, making ordering food less daunting.

I really do not know what happened to Tarboosh.  I think someone took over it with a different owner and NOW named is as Afia Grill.  We went here after work on Saturday August 16th 2014.  Time was about 20:10hrs ish.

When we enter this establishment the Décor of this establishment looks the same as the previous Middle Eastern establishment that is used to be here.  From the Menu we opt to have the following items :

*  Lamb Mendi ($11.99)
*  Shawerma Plates ($11.99)
*  Samosas ($4.99)
*  3 Bottled Drinks each of ($1.49) 

From my conversations with one of the staffs, they are a Middle Eastern family running this establishment.  To which Country, I cannot recall.  Maybe next time, I should write down or NOTE TO SELF : Remember The Tiny Details...

At first, Hubs wanted to have Biryani.  But our server said, they RAN OUT OF Biryani that evening.  Ohh Well, hence Hubs opt to have the Lamb Mendi instead.

Decent Dinner, with reasonable pricing and portions.  However, I am NOT WOW with my order of Shawarma Plates coz the meat was too dry for my liking and they do not include the Pickles.  Yes, our order comes with Salad of some kind, Hummus and Tahini.

The Lamb Mendi comes with Saffron Rice, Lamb with Bones, Onions, Peppers, Chopped Potatoes and Fried Silvered Almonds and some sauce sprinkled with some herbs on it.

As for my order of Shawarma, it comes with Meat, and Rice sprinkled with the Potatoes and some herbs of some kind.  So Disappointing for this dish.  NOTE TO SELF : Next time DO NOT ORDER this Dish.  *SAD FACE INDEED*

Only after we eating our Dinner in the midst of it, we ask if our order comes with Pita Bread.  Then the server provide us the Pita Bread.

Hmmm... *BIG SIGH*

Even after that, comes our order of Appetizer aka Samosas, which perhaps might have &#34;Save&#34; The Day coz its comes out Piping hot from the Fryer.  It comes with 4 Samosas.  We left this establishment at about 21:00hrs ish.  

Take note this establishment IS IN The Village On The Park the same vicinity of, Tuesday Morning which is a couple steps away, TJ Maxx and ROSS.  Its in the Dayton Triangle Neighborhood in Aurora.  The Cross Streets is between S. Parker Road and E. Iliff Avenue.

Yes, they have potential in which I am hoping for to visit in the future coz there are other dishes in their extensive Menu that they provide.  Such items are Kabsa, Qoozi, Mensef, BoKhari and Koba to name a few.  We hope to return, and wish them well in their Business Endeavors and Future Undertakings.

I just don&#39;t know what this restaurant is &#34;going for&#34; exactly. It has a fancy, upscale feel with the decorations and some of the plating of the food, but then it has kind of a to go, quick lunch feel with the plastic cups they served the sauces in and the foil wrapping of the gyros. Kind of just felt like this was a bit of a weird place. 

Anyway, this place has never been busy when I&#39;ve walked by so I decided to go in and see if it was any good. 

Their tzatziki sauce was amazing and the caprese salad had the freshest mozzarella I&#39;ve ever had in my short life. Food came out very quickly too. I would definitely come back here again to try more of the menu."

Two others and myself ordered two of the falafel entrees, which was more than enough food for the three of us. They came with a Greek salad, rice, tahini and hummus for dipping, and six large chickpea patties. The falafel itself was incredible, some of the best I&#39;ve had in Denver. Very flavorful and perfectly crunchy on the outside. I also loved the rice, which was a surprise because I don&#39;t typically go for white rice, but this stuff was quite delicious and a wonderful compliment to the falafel. I&#39;m not a huge fan of tahini and this didn&#39;t particularly change my mind, but the hummus was crazy smooth- literally the consistency of butter. I have no idea how anyone could get that out grinding up cheapness, but that&#39;s beside the point. I&#39;m definitely going to be ordering from here again."

The hummus was delicious and very flavorful. The spanakopita was PERFECT, and I highly recommend it to everyone! The shawarma dish itself was also lovely. However, the shawarma here isn&#39;t like the usual Middle Eastern style shawarma I&#39;m used to eating (my husband is Arab/Turkish). The dish is marinated in a yummy curry-like sauce, complimented by a huge portion of perfectly seasoned basmati rice. To top it off, we ordered baklava to go, and, as expected, it was delicious."

It&#39;s hidden, never busy, and serves up some delicious Mediterranean grub.  My girlfriend still lives close, and so when we have a ladies night, this is a definite take-out order option.  It is fast and delicious.  

I&#39;m personally a fan of the gyros, but I have also tried the chicken.  My favorite part is the pitas with hummus and tzatziki.  I&#39;m a dipping gal--I love the dips.  Serving sizes are huge--I shared with friends, ate my fill, and I still had enough for lunch the next day.  Though I&#39;m not a huge fan of rice, I always find myself devouring the provided side of rice.

I can&#39;t say enough about the quality of their food.  Though I&#39;ve never sat down and eaten at the restaurant, the hostess is always welcoming and quick about exchanging food and payment when I stop by.  I hope they aren&#39;t going anywhere--because I keep this spot on my short list."

The first time was at lunch a couple of years ago with a group of Yelpers during the Cherry Creek Lunch Club&#39;s heyday.  I was set on having a salad, so I opted out of the lunch special, which was my first mistake.  The special comes with your choice of meat, basmati rice, house salad, and a fountain drink for $10.  The dishes my tablemates had in front of them looked great.  I ordered the Greek salad with chicken.  The chicken that came on the salad was not grilled, as one might expect.  Instead, heavily marinated chicken shawarma was dumped on top.  I mean, so much marinade that I was basically eating salad soup.  Not a very good first impression.

I decided to try Cafe Byblos again last night with my good friend Nicole W.  We had just gotten pedicures next door and Cafe Byblos was the perfect short walk in our flip flops on a soon-to-be-snowy evening.  We got a few small plates to share.  The fried calamari was perfectly round, overly breaded, and most certainly frozen.  The accompanying marina sauce was orange and bland.  The spanakopita was tasteless and filo was not at all light or flaky.  The marinated artichoke hearts were okay but the garlic sauce on top was too much.  I scraped most of it off but I still had garlic breath this morning.  The baba ghanouj was probably the best of the bunch but definitely not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  If you would like extra pita, that will be $1.00.

The less than professional waiter, clad in basketball shorts and sucking on a toothpick, kind of sealed the deal for me.  I won&#39;t be returning."

It&#39;s a pretty lax and easy going place, which works for some, but i like to know who runs it and who will seat me...

We decided to go with just some appetizers. BABA GHANOUJ, spinicopida, fried calamari and artichokes. All in all it was ok. baba was decent, but not super tasteful, spinicopida is not really my thing, the calamari was just fried...  and the artichokes had too much garlic sauce for us.

It&#39;s a decent size place, but i think it would make for better take out than eating in! 
I might come back and try the lunch experience!"

Preconceptions must have gotten the best of me, unfortunately. Even though Café Byblos is a much better looking restaurant, and the foods may be more authentic, the taste is not what I&#39;m used to. Take the hummus, it&#39;s very smooth, but just too &#34;lemony&#34; (didn&#39;t want to say &#34;sour&#34; to sound like it&#39;s gone bad, but...), same thing with the salads. If you happen to be super hungry like I was, bad news for you, all the acidity would make you even more starved, lol. 

Good thing our friends know how to order family style and we ended up having a lot of food. The grilled meats, I thought, were over-charred, especially the ground skewers, so dry that pieces were falling off the sticks and the only flavor profile I could discern was that of burnt. If that&#39;s the authentic flavor, then I&#39;m perfectly happy to go back to the juicier, less acidic, &#34;Americanized&#34; way. It says a lot when the first thing in front of me that was finished were the French Fries with ketchup. My miss, I know.

Just for comparison&#39;s sake, the Turkish coffee is excellent here and is brewed the Turkish way. A floral, strong shot of coffee lightly sweetened and served without cream. I&#39;d come back for just the coffee and perhaps dessert as we didn&#39;t get to try any this time."

The starters are very good. Their baba ganoush was delicious and it came with plenty of pita bread which was store bought/cold but fine. we also tried stuffed pita with lamb and beef, they were very good. Then ordered kebab meals which came with salads, hummus and rice. The meat was a bit dry (lamb) but the onions were very good. I wished they had more dipping sauces or more flavor for the lamb. They were very accommodating in replacing the rice with more salad for me and the portions were big."

Their Toum (almost like a garlic paste) is amazing.  It will give you bad breath all night but it is mighty tasty. If you need to scare off any vampires you know where to go. 

The dolmas are a great app choice as well.  They are drizzled with a creamy sauce and served cold. 

I ordered the gyros plate as my entree.  It had one side of chili paste and one side of taziki and came with the fluffiest basmati rice.  Delicious!

I will definitely be back here.  Great little neighborhood spot. If there prices were a bit lower I would probably be here once a week! Its a must try!"

Their obscure location is slowing down business because if they were situated anywhere else, their business would be rockin&#39;. Nevertheless, my friends and I constantly come back and it&#39;s one of our go to restaurants. 

The restaurant has ample space and is very clean. There are many street parking nearby so it&#39;s never been an issue. They also have a lot as well. The waiters are very friendly and try to have conversations with us. I like how there are a variety of tables available from traditional tables to couch areas where you can eat in a relaxing manner.

Not only is the food top notch quality mediterranean cuisine, they also give you a heaping portion (one plate lasts me two meals). My favorite is definitely the chicken kabob skewers which comes with a side of basmati rice which is so fragrant, and their special yogurt sauce as well as this delicious spicy sauce. I love pairing the different sauces with my meat and rice. It&#39;s an explosion of flavor and such a satisfying meal. Not to mention, they also serve you hummus and warm pita bread in addition to a house salad. It&#39;s so much food!! During another visit, i also tried the chicken shawarma which was very saucy and delicious and went so well with the rice. If you can eat more food, try some appetizers! I recommend the calamari or fried potato. Both are great appetizers especially if you have a group of people. I also tried the baklava which wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve tried. 

The reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#39;s always so empty and it lacks the exciting ambience of a restaurant. Otherwise the food is awesome and there is nothing to complain about there. This place deserves more customers so check it out!"

First of all, Colorado Public Radio has them as a sponsor for BOGO sandwiches, online and in their pamplet and the girl said they were no longer doing that. The site was recently updated so I felt like she didn&#39;t know what she was talking about.

Second, it&#39;s pretty weak when you&#39;re a restaurant and your best item is fries. My fiancé and I each ordered a gyro, one with fries, one with salad. The theme of our meal was wet. The salad was dripping with water, my gyro was cold and the pita broke apart because it was sopping wet. The gyro meat was tasty so I improvised and made a wet salad out of my wrap. 

It seems like it could be an awesome place but I just did not dig it. Yet another pass from me....."

She wasn&#39;t friendly at all and didnt welcome us at all since we were the only ones there.

The food: 
We ordered the Arayes. There were 4 pieces but two of them were burnt so we ate the other two. When we told the waitress to take it off she asked if we wanted something else and we told her no. She didn&#39;t apologize and said that it was not her fault. When we got the bill we found out that she didn&#39;t take the Arayes off.

My other friend got the chicken kabobs and couldn&#39;t stop talking about how perfectly the chicken was cooked. Maybe a few too many onions but good otherwise. I got veggie combo. The hummus is like butter (absolutely fabulous hummus!); the baba ghanouj had good texture; the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were mushy (I&#39;ve had better); the filo pie was nothing special; and the tabbouleh was mostly parsley but solid. Overall a great meal though - we all thought so and will all be back. The service was alright as well - water glasses were always full, and the waitress brought out boxes when she saw we were slowing down with lots of food left (huge portions)."

Even Renzio&#39;s (a chain restaurant) has more flavor in its tzatziki sauce.  Cafe Byblos was slow last Saturday.   I can see why it gets such high reviews as the atmosphere is welcoming and energetic.  Our waitress was super friendly and always smiled.  The meat in our gyros was flavorful and fresh.  Our drinks were rarely refilled until the only way to get our waitresses attention was to slurp the emptiness of my drink to get her attention.  Even a simple gesture of waving at her had no effect.  As I mentioned, I can see how this place gets great reviews.  However, our experience was a forgettable one."

Mum loves it, Dad eats anything put in front of him, and I do it while wishing I could plug my nose and block the taste.

Cafe Byblos changed me. It&#39;s officially billed as &#34;Lebanese - Mediterranean - Greek&#34; on Yelp, but I&#39;ll petition a change to &#34;Absolutely delicious - Delicious - Delicious.&#34;

Drinks are sodas or fruit juices - choose from mango, banana, strawberry, or mix all three! The mango is apparently fresh-made. Sounded great, but we opted not to get it tonight. For the alcoholic beverage drinkers, Cafe Byblos will be getting their alcohol license in two months so, for now, they&#39;re dry.

We started off with the garlic/yogurt dip and pita bread, fried calamari, artichoke hearts, and sauteed mushrooms. All finger/fork-lickin&#39; good. Side note: I hate anything oily, garlicky, or fried - much less all three - so this means a lot.

Entrees were Chicken Shish Kabob and Lamb Shank. The lamb came in a bowl the size of an Olympic swimming pool, and the chicken skewers and rice could easily be lunch and dinner tomorrow. The chicken was incredibly tender and flavourful. Yum!

The entrees come with a small plate of hummus, a side salad, and basmati rice. Again, all are fantastic. The side salad, something that is usually forgotten before you even swallow the first leaf - was actually incredibly good. I hate dressing, and this had a barely-detectable semi-dressing that was wonderful. It tasted so fresh and crisp. All of us were laughing at how we almost never touch these salads because they&#39;re so bland, but this one was truly lovely.

Portions are HUGE - easily 2-3 meals, maybe 4 for me - and the prices are incredibly reasonable considering this (I thought they were already, even before the plates landed on our table).

Run, don&#39;t walk. Come here and eat everything.




____________

Update: I took some of the Chicken Shish Kabobs home, and it was still delicious later -- both cold out of the fridge and heated up. Now, that is good food!"

Cafe Byblos doesn&#39;t skimp on its entrees.  A typical order comes with warm pitas, freshly made hummus (this stuff is like crack --- so much more creamy than what you get in the grocery store), salad, and gobs of meat and rice.  

I&#39;m not a big carb guy, so I usually order the greek salad with extra gyros.  It&#39;s piles of meat and vegetables and general deliciousness.  My girlfriend always orders the falafel platter, which I&#39;ve stolen food from on numerous occasions to my stomach&#39;s delight.  It&#39;s not too greasy and has a nice crisp to it (sign of quality falafel).  

The sauces are excellent as well.  The tzatizki is pretty standard, but their garlic paste is dynamite.  I&#39;ve asked what&#39;s in it; apparently it&#39;s just garlic, lemon juice, and spices.  Just be prepared to reek of garlic essence!  And their spicy red sauce has a great kick as well.

The decor in the restaurant is nice too --- pretty bright and there&#39;s some cool art.  Feels like a comfy cafe.  

All in all, a great, authentic Mediterranean spot in Denver."

So, I fully intend on returning to stuff my face with their dynamite dolmas and artichoke salad over lunch for the next few days. In fact, it&#39;s going to be hard to pull me away from this place. Maybe when I start smelling like a falafel it&#39;s time to pump the breaks. But until then - I&#39;m all over their delicious Mediterranean grub. 

The artichoke heart salad is fresh with plump artichoke hearts bursting with flavor accompanied with a certain sauce that I can&#39;t identify. I just know it has a zesty flavor that compliments the flavor of the artichoke heart perfectly. Snag that with a side of hummus and pita bread - and you&#39;re set. Unless you crave the meat: in that case I suggest you peruse the delicious looking gyros in the menu."

I ordered the Lamb Kabob (comes with basmati rice, hummus, pita, salad), and the Hubs ordered the Chicken Soltani (marinated chicken breast with a skewer of chicken kafta and grilled tomato, also comes with rice, hummus and salad).  This was some really tasty food and lots of it!  My only issue was that I ordered lamb, but got beef.  I was so busy eating and talking that it didn&#39;t dawn on me until I was almost finished eating.  Obviously, the beef was good.  I tasted my husband&#39;s marinated chicken and the kafta.  I really liked the flavor of the kafta, although it was a tad saltier than I like.  The marinated chicken was good, but the kafta was better.  It was a lot of meat and could have fed two people.

The restaurant itself seems like it could use a little more in the way of décor, but it was cute anyway.  We were there at lunchtime (noonish to 1 PM or so) and there were only two or three other tables occupied with diners.  I notice that other reviewers have commented on this.  It seems strange that a place that makes such yummy food wouldn&#39;t be packed all the time.  Maybe they still don&#39;t have a liquor license?

Saturday March 30th 2013.  18:00hrs EVENT.

A few weeks before that evening, I have called Café Byblos for reservation.  I arrived early so as to make sure things will run smoothly etc etc for the Evening Party.  I was at Byblos around 17:40hrs ish.

Café Byblos, THANK YOU.  Bringing 21 of my friends to dine in here its not an easy task.  Luckily, when I called for reservation, our table were ready for us.  The staffs who handled our BIG PARTY that evening of Saturday March 30th 2013, were indeed gracious, inviting and welcoming..

To prepare 22 items or more coz some of my friends order several appetizers, and preparing 22 Main Entrée for our group is definitely NOT easy.  Yet Café Byblos managed to handle it.  Kudos to the Chef, the kitchen crew and all the staffs.

Though the service was slightly slow that evening, coz there are also other Patrons dining in, who sat at the other side of the establishment, I can understand that.

There weren&#39;t enough Water Pitchers for the group, but at least everyone managed to get their water, and other beverages that evening.  These include several orders of Tea.  

From what I could recall correctly these were the items my friends ordered that evening :

Appetizers :
*  Falafel
*  Dolmades
*  Mediterranean Olives
*  Kibbi Aras
*  Filo Pies
*  Several orders of Calamari
*  Crispy Eggplants with Yogurt

Soups :
*  Lentil
*  Several orders of Lamb Tongue

While for their Main Entrees, if I could recall these were the items my friends ordered :

*  Several order of Lamb Shank
*  Several order of Mixed Kabob Grill
*  Falafel Sandwich
*  Byblos Combo
*  Veggie Combo
*  Shawarma
*  Shish Kabob


As for me, I ordered these items that evening :

*  Calamari ($6.00)
*  Gyros ($14.00)

and these items TO GO for Hubs :

*  Lamb Shank ($18.00)
*  Mixed Grilled Kabob ($18.00) of 1 Lamb Kabob, 1 Beef Kabob and 1 Beef Kafta 

One of my friend ordered the Home-made Baklava.

Some of my friends like the food they ordered, some do not.  So I can understand their sentiments.  As for me, the FOOD is 3.5 stars at BEST, coz I like my order of Calamari, and Gyros.  The Calamari comes with the Harissa (Spicy Red Salsa) mixed with Yogurt, that they called it as Marinara.  The Gyros are tender and flavorful.

But the qualms was in the packing of food TO GO.  YES, they were put in Biogradeable Disposable Boxes, but by the time, I reached home some of the food, sipped out so fast and make it slightly problematic and I have to transfer the leftover and TO GO food, in our own home containers.

Nevertheless, all in all though with slight hiccup with service, aka slow due to our BIG party, Café Byblos DID A GOOD JOB for our BIG group.  A BIG THANK YOU to the server by the name of Bethany too.  Left the establishment at 20:40hrs ish.  I don&#39;t mind returning when needed.

Parking is a little tight but I was pleasantly surprised to notice Café Byblos is right next door to my favorite Nail Salon (B Nails).  Place was quiet on the night we went and we sat in the front area.  We were feeling munchy so I think we were ordering more like tapas style so we could have a variety.  We tried the following:

Hummus - creamy and delicious
Pita - Not the best but it was a vessel for the hummus
Baba - Tasty
Garlic Dip - If you&#39;re a garlic lover this is a must try
Beef Shwarma - Tender and succulent beef, good rice, and a tingle worthy spicy red sauce (yummo (channeling my inner Rachel Ray, LOL)

Can&#39;t wait for this place to obtain their liquor license - what a combination that will be.  It will be the trifecta, service, quality food, and booze.  Count me in."

The standout that we all loved was the toum which is a garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil purée which we dipped pita bread into. Only word to describe it is &#34;wonderful.&#34; Entrees of lamb chops and gyros was also excellent. Service was amazing with a knowledgable staff.

I wanted something smaller so I ordered the eggplant app with Harissa and a bowl of lentil soup to go. 

The eggplant was terrible. It was slices cut thin with no breading or seasoning and then soaked aka deep fried in oil. It was so greasy that the sauce wouldn&#39;t even stick to it. Seriously gross. If I had eaten in the restaurant I would have sent it back. 

I approached the soup with trepidation but I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was actually quite good. Knowing what I know now I would have saved myself six bucks on a greasy mess and just gotten a bowl of delicious soup."

We LOVED Cafe Byblos. They were very accommodating for our large group. We ordered many appetizers (hummus, baba ganoush, calamari, mushrooms) all were delicious and nicely portioned. Everyone ordered an entree, again delicious. We especially loved that all the entrees come with a side salad and another helping of hummus. 

We were there on a stormy night and the power went out. The staff was incredibly accommodating, still bringing us food and setting candles on our table. It made for a great setting and we actually enjoyed it! Luckily the power came back on and we were able to get our entrees cooked. 

The service was a little slow, but we really didn&#39;t mind. We&#39;re there to hang out and enjoy each other&#39;s company.

Service was good, though there was only a single waitress for the entire restaurant so sometimes we didn&#39;t see her for a few minutes.

We each ordered a meal which comes with salad, humus, pita, and rice so there&#39;s a lot of food. We also ordered potatoes, mushrooms, garlic sauce and beef balls covered in cracked wheat. 2 of us got the chicken &#34;schwarma&#34; .

The mushrooms and potatoes weren&#39;t especially good. They brought us the garlic sauce but didn&#39;t bother telling us it also came with the individual meals, so we ended up without enough to kill a horse. The chicke schwarma was nothing like the authentic kind I&#39;ve had many times before (sliced off a rotating spit next to the heat source), and was dry and had a sauce that isn&#39;t supposed to be on chicken schwarma. I felt awful but I hardly ate any of it. The rice was worthless. 

The beef balls in cracked wheat was good. Also they don&#39;t serve alcohol."

I&#39;m from Brazil and been struggling for a while without knowing any mediterranean grill places around Denver... Then one snowy day I came across this place and found heaven on earth!

They have an awesome lunch special, reallly honest and includes a beverage. But their food is so delicious only a lunch special is not enough so I also ordered kibbi and hummus which were both the best I&#39;ve ever had.

The place was quiet since there were few diners,  so it was easy to have a conversation, but  I should have taken the lack of customers as a sign of what was to come. I ordered the falafal plate. The salad lacked flavor, falafals were hard and so dry I choked after one bite and had to quickly drink some water to wash it down. I couldn&#39;t have washed it down with wine since they have no liquor license. The hummus was ok, but Falafal King from the grocery store is better.

So glad that now there&#39;s also Shift Workspaces next to Waffle Brothers; this little block of Corona and 4th is happenin&#39;! Hot Yoga, B Nails, and more!

Cafe Byblos lunch special is definitely yummy and a good deal: your choice of entree with side salad and a TON of rice. Their rice here is SO tasty; I actually had a week&#39;s worth of rice from Byblos at home after my birthday back in January.

That&#39;s right: Byblos was so cool to cater the food to my birthday party this year. I held the party at Shift so it was an easy stroll across the street. All of my guests LOVED the food; however, there were still a lot of leftovers! So, I took them home and was set on meals for a few weeks.

If you go in for take-out, they&#39;re usually pretty fast with that. Dine-in, the timing varies according to the day. I came here once in the evening with some friends and we had ordered appetizers, etc. along with our meals. Every item we ordered came out in a timely manner.

MUST-TRY: Garlic dip. SO good, especially with pita bread. Garlic lovers rejoice!

Now, why only 4 stars and not 5? The prices bother me a bit, although I do know that that should not stop me from going to enjoy a meal at Byblos. However, would be nice if Byblos had a lunch-price menu so I&#39;m not paying the same price both for lunch and dinner. Also, would be nice too if some appetizers either a) had lower prices or b) had more quantity to each listing.

Just a suggestion though; other than the price part, I love Byblos and hope it will continue to stay in business!"

Upon entering, you&#39;re greeting with an open, bright and cheery place, what I would hope to expect if I was visiting a restaurant in the Mediterranean. 

I got the lunch special, which was salad, rice and my choice of lunch dish listed on the menu. I went with chicken shwarma and I was not disappointed. The salad was your standard house salad, but all the greens were fresh (you&#39;d be surprised how often they aren&#39;t). 

The highlight of everything was their (I believe) tahini sauce. If I could put that on everything, I would. That combined with the flavors of the shwarma and chicken made this lunch meal so yummy. 

It was the perfect amount of food for $10 and I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more of their lunch menu (and maybe even dinner!)."

This place USED to be good.  It was never great; the food was OK (very average Lebanese/Mediterranean) but the main waitress was amazing.  I live two blocks east of this restaurant and used to stop by for lunch twice a week when bringing my toddler home from the park.  The main benefits were that the place was very kid-friendly and the wait staff were always friendly and competent.  The new staff is still friendly but they have gotten my (simple) order wrong the last three times.  I said something today and they made a replacement order to go which, upon opening it, is also wrong.  I&#39;m not talking about a slight variation - completely wrong protein.  And I&#39;m just ordering off of the menu.  That plus the lettuce-heels in my salad make me question the value to say the least.

The waitress who seemed to make this place tick a year ago, Kate, doesn&#39;t appear to be around anymore and the waitress I&#39;ve had the past four times is nice but the food is wrong.  Not sure if that&#39;s her or the kitchen but I have reason to believe that a good hunk of it is a back-of-the-house problem for reasons that are too complex to go into here.  I suspect that Kate was policing the kitchen service (like a good waitress).  Now that she is gone, the standards have dropped.  Suffice it to say that in retrospect I think that this was a poor to moderate restaurant that had a single amazing server.

I was discussing this place with a close friend - the one who turned me onto it in the first place - recently and she told me about her last experience there.  She went in, ordered something off of the menu as she had 100x before but when it came our wrong and she asked them to fix the error the owner came out, refused to fix the problem and was really rude.  She will never go back and is red-faced just talking about the owner.  I&#39;m more philosophical - sad to lose the place but accepting the loss for what it is.

If you look through my reviews, I tend to only review good businesses.  It&#39;s kind of a personal policy since I think that putting kindness out there helps everybody while writing bad reviews may help others but it takes its emotional toll on me.  I loved this place a year ago but it has slid so far so fast that I&#39;m hoping that people stop going so that we can replace Byblos with a better restaurant.  The bar is set pretty low."

Biggest complaint is the atmosphere.  While the restaurant features Mediterranean colours and friendly efficient service, there&#39;s a lack of middle eastern character.  Worst was the BLARING TV in the dishroom, overpowering any background music.  I even asked the TV volume be turned down, but no such luck.

Interior - Colorful! Clean!  Relaxing! Inviting! Yummy! Delicious!

We were searching for Mediterranean food on Yelp! (but of course, where else do you look for restaurants, businesses!),and this restaurant came up. The reviews were good, it had opened fairly recently, and it was close!  I was so glad we decided to give it a try!

We ordered the small plate of falafel -5 or 6  fried chickpea patties served with tahini dip. I loved these! 

We also ordered a bowl of the Lentil soup - very good! The bowl was large enough to split between two people. For the entree, we ordered the Byblos Combo - $15, Hummus topped with chicken, and served with pita bread. WOW! This was excellent! With the entree, we also got humus, bread, and a salad. Lots of food! It truly was a large amount of food, so we took 1/4 of it home, and had it for lunch the next day, and it was still very good heated up (definitely a good sign!). 

Parking - small private lot

Service - good, not excellent, but as they had just recently opened, I&#39;m not marking them down for that. It will take some time to &#34;work out the kinks.&#34;

Recommendation - most definitely! We will go back, and can&#39;t wait to try more yummy food!"

I love hummus so much that pita is an afterthought and I&#39;d just as happily eat hummus with a spoon.  I kind of wish I had just filled myself up on Cafe Byblos&#39; delicious hummus because the rest of my meal was kinda disappointing.

I made the mistake of ordering a falafel sandwich with fries (I should have gone with rice - my bad).  The falafel was dry and very bland and the fries were greasy and flavorless.  Thankfully the server was on top of refilling my water because I had to take a few drinks after each bite to wash everything down, but I gave up halfway through and didn&#39;t finish the sandwich.

The husband liked his chicken shwarma and I enjoyed the bite I stole.  It, unlike the falafel, was very flavorful.  Given the state of his beard and hands post-sandwich, we probably would have benefited from a few more napkins on the table.

The price of our sandwiches with a side of rice/fries was very reasonable, so I&#39;ll definitely walk down the street to give these guys another try. I&#39;m just not in any hurry."

I helped design the layout over 25 years ago when it belonged to the ACLU. And the Byblos has done a good, if a little sterile, contemporary upgrade.

Love the manager. A very sweet and approachable gentleman. He told us they were in the process of getting their liquor license. But they&#39;re in a residential area, so the neighbors have been more interested in giving input to the process. Nonetheless, you can see where the bar will be (right where our old conference room was located:).

The food is your standard fare Middle Eastern menu. Standouts were the lamb and chicken kabobs. They were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and came with a wonderful tomato sauce. The hummus was four stars, as was the Greek salad, the rice, and the tabbouleh. Three stars was the pita (not made in-house and not tasty) and the baba ganoush. Unfortunately, the calamari appetizer was clearly from a pre-made bag and was over breaded. Tough and not good. But the house-made dipping sauce was very good.

And if the food was the only thing about Byblos we dealt with, it probably would have gotten at least 3 stars. But!
11 people in the restaurant. 11. A single man, a double date, and the six of us. Service was aloof at best. When our seventh joined for &#39;dessert&#39;, she wasn&#39;t even regarded, let alone asked if she wanted anything to drink or wanted dessert. I presented my Member Card from CPR (I see this is a thing now) to my server at the beginning as CPR suggests. No response, completely blank look. We get the check, and I again put the card in with our check to receive the discount. Check comes back the same, no explanation or anything. I ask the server, she says she will ask the owner. 
RUDEST encounter with a member of the service industry EVER. He comes over, not to the table, but by a fence sort of thing and bellows &#39;Someone needs to talk to me?&#39; Subtle. I walk over, not wanting to involve the entire table. He then proceeds to explain that he opened three years ago, that CPR courted him for a 6 month contract (impossible since member cards are year round) back then and he&#39;s NEVER seen one until me this very night. Really? So Tiffany N. on 6/29/15 must be mistaken, because he has NEVER seen a CPR Member Card before! *insert sarcasm here* Could have been handled differently to much better effect. If this is Greek diplomacy, it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re in so much trouble with the rest of Europe!
I can go to many many many many other places, and after that astonishingly rude behavior from the owner, the lack of any customer appreciation by the servers he employs, and really lackluster food (my gyro plate was literally 1/2 rice, a SPOONFUL of tzaziki, and about 4-6oz of meat. with chili garlic paste?), there are many more flavorful options for cheaper.

My daughter got the NY Steak which was cooked perfectly (med rare) and served with regular spaghetti and tomato sauce. The pan seared mushrooms were amazing, these had to be cooked on a high heat to keep all the flavor and not simmered or sautéed over lower heat that would let the flavor escape in water then burned off.  Definitely the only restaurant near DIA that is worth visiting!"

The ambiance is lovely overall. The menu is QUITE extensive and has pretty much anything to satisfy any Italian appetite. The other really impressive thing is the wine list. It&#39;s got everything from an off-the-shelf nothing to write home about Zinfandel to a delicious and satisfying Chianti. I only have 2 criticisms which I need to mention. The service is awful. It&#39;s not awful because they aren&#39;t attentive, it&#39;s awful because it&#39;s confusing. I had 5 different waiters. The other thing is the pizza was REALLY heavy on the cheese, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve cleaned the oven in a while. My crust was really burned. Don&#39;t let my review stop you.

Sadly, this was not an ideal choice.  The ambiance was &#34;unique&#34; which we had no problem with..old world Italian style with a Frank Sinatra movie clip playing in the back.

The food ordered (Gnocci in red sauce and the Mezzo combo) arrived in a timely manner as did the bread. 

The food itself was simply drowned in plain, canned tasting sauce.  Hard to locate the Gnocci.  I had asked for a sample of the white sauce was was told it was made to order so no sample was available. A little hard to believe based on the red sauce quantity and quality. 

So, sorry to scare you away but simply don&#39;t do it."

It&#39;s certainly OK to dine here if you like meatballs and Alfredo dishes. Who&#39;s this Alfredo anywa, Ik have yet to find an Italian restaurant in the States that actually tastes like the ones in Italy, so maybe it&#39;s just me.

He listed Dicicco&#39;s Italian restaurant and two others, but gave all three the dubious distinction of being aggressively mediocre. I wish I could say it was mediocre. 

We sat at the bar and we weren&#39;t acknowledged by the bartender until we had been there ten minutes. I knew I wasn&#39;t invisible because I could see myself in the mirror. I even waived at myself to be sure. She walked by us twice, and then on her third pass she finally said, &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t see you there.&#34;

I scanned the menu and was blown away by the dinner prices. Most of the entrees were higher than twenty dollars, which proves one thing: Dicicco&#39;s takes itself very seriously. (As did the painfully pretentious couple sitting near the bar who were on their way to Belize. They tried to order a traditional Italian dish I can only assume they looked up on Wikipedia that had the waitstaff puzzled, and loved their chianti). Remember the only information I had on this place at this point was that it was aggressively mediocre, so I decided to take it safe and order the lasagna and a house salad. My cousin got angelhair pasta. I&#39;m glad I only dropped twelve dollars on the lasagna because if I&#39;d paid twenty-plus dollars for something that bad, I would have been beside myself.

The salad, which incidentally didn&#39;t come with the meal ($3.50), was probably the best thing on the table, the bread was cold, the pasta greasy and and overcooked, the lasagna had an ocean of sauce, hardly any cheese, and it was severely overcooked. At one point, my cousin, who was halfway through his meal, turned to me and said, &#34;The worst thing about this meal is it&#39;s not even good enough to box up.&#34;

If the Olive Garden is a baseline of three stars, then I&#39;d have to give Dicicco&#39;s my first ever one star rating. It pains me to do it, but Dicicco&#39;s you earned it.

On the way out, I coughed, and the bartender said, &#34;I hope that cough doesn&#39;t turn into something.&#34; And then she winked at me. I could only assume from the context of the situation that this was her way of telling me that food poisoning was in my future."

I&#39;ve got to say I was somewhat disappointed in this restaurant. While the service was exceptional and the atmosphere was tasteful I was let down by the quality of the food. I ordered the Chicken Parm and quite frankly was a little hesitant at the $26.99 price for this dish but was assured I would not be disappointed. Well as much as I hate to say it  I was disappointed. The meal was served quickly and again the service was exceptional but the dish  just did not deliver. The portion was a half of a breast breaded, covered in the house tomato sauce and smothered in cheese, almost too much cheese. The taste was okay but for the price one would expect enough food to ensure a take home box, which was not the case. Included with this meal was a small portion of angle hair pasta and a veggie medley which was undercooked. Additionally there was a small cup of minestrone soup  which if ordered separately is $6.99! Way too much for the portion size. Maybe I&#39;m just too critical of Italian food I don&#39;t know but I was under-impressed with the quality of my dish. I do have to note that I was with two other people and both of them had good things to say about their food so maybe it was just the Chicken Parm."

First of all, the decor is breathtaking. The Fresno restaurants can&#39;t compare with the beauty of this restaurant in Denver. That being said, the food was the same as what my family loves about the Fresno Restaurants. 

I ordered the Scarface. Five stars. My husband ordered a combo of lasagna, spaghetti and ravioli. Large portions. The salad was fresh. The bread was warm and delicious. Our friend ordered a calzone and it was huge. 

We had a birthday and for this our birthday girl was served a yummy tiramisu, birthday song and all. All together it was a five star night and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves great Italian food. You will not be disappointed. Ask who did the artwork."

The funniest part was watching some other waiter pick up our order and deliver it to the table next to us....they were like &#34;we didn&#39;t order this&#34;....and their easier said , &#34;it&#39;s on the house&#34;. (hey owner- your incompetent staff just gave away $30 in wine.

But the BEST part was when our snooty server dropped off my bill (and I had to have her re-run it to take off the wine we never got). When she returned with the correct total she made the snide comment, &#34;there&#39;s always one table where everything goes wrong&#34; and put the check on the table.....we sat there for 10 minutes when she became really annoyed and asked, &#34;anything else?&#34;.....I said, &#34;yes, an ink pen to sign bill&#34;.....

How this place stays open is beyond me.

Please....for the sake of diners everywhere....please shut this place down."

The food is pretty decent. The minestrone was definitely fresh, with lots of vegetables and not too salty. The  gnocchi were well cooked and the sauce was also made of fresh ingredients, All vey well cooked and just warm as they need to: crunchy broccoli , savory mushrooms and fresh tomatoes.

I went into this place because it was across the street from my hotel.  The atmosphere was like something out of the 1940s.  Kitchy wallpaper and a decor that tried to lead you to believe you were in Italy.  There was a stage with a large screen above it and  a dance floor.  On the screen were videos of old singers-Frank Sinatra, etc.  At 6:30 pm, the 13-piece swing band came on and started playing live music!  They had a vocalist that was pretty good and the band wasn&#39;t horrible.  The dance floor started to get busy with older couples who really knew how to dance.  One of them were dressed in coordinated outfits-obviously groupies of days of old...they were north of 70 and were fun to watch.

But the food...not so great.  I had a meatball sandwich that was dry and tasteless.  Their red sauce was bland.  A house salad was a plate of lettuce with a pale tomato slice and a banana pepper.  The bread was great and plentiful.  The server was very attentive to me.

We were blown away (my clients and I), cuz when you first walk in the tiny bar looks like a place dreams go to die. We were super impressed when we made it into the main room. We thought we were being punked. 

The food choices were as extensive as they can get for an italian spot. We were very happy with everything from the bread, the soups, the chicken, the pizza (which says a lot, cuz i&#39;m from NY), and my clients loved the (optional) shredded cheese on everything.

basically romaine lettuce with chicken and durable slices of tomato (hard to cut with standard knife).  The lettuce is fresh but still retain much of the water from the rinsing. This dilutes what seemed like a decent dressing.  The garlic bread included was good.

I had to find somewhere to eat. 

I was in the mood for Italian, so I swung into DiCicco&#39;s. 

My waitress and the staff were very friendly. I informed her I&#39;d be hanging out for a while until my husband&#39;s flight got in, and she made no problem about my holding up her table for 3 hours. Luckily it wasn&#39;t packed.

The food wasn&#39;t bad. I had a pizza, some wine, and a dessert (which I don&#39;t think they make in house but I could be wrong). 

What really got me as strange was the huge projected videos they were playing of Roy Orbison, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis. At first I was really not sure how to feel about it, but over time I felt like I was watching a big tv show with a bunch of my unknown friends. I was there for hours, so I saw all of the videos from start to finish.

Had it not been pitch black when I&#39;d walked in, I might have found the no-windows thing a bit more off-putting, but since it was late anyway, I didn&#39;t really notice.

Atmosphere: The building is absolutely gigantic with three stories of tables and booths, therefore not exactly cozy (if cozy is your thing.) The decor is very cliche, faux Italian, but not in a completely offensive way. They play concerts on a huge wall with a projector, which is odd, but you get used to it and in spite of yourself begin to enjoy it. 

Service: We were seated right away which is not surprising due to the size of the place. A separate bread only server brought us bread and ice water right away. And then we waited... It took about 10 minutes for the actual server to show up (which was after I stopped another server to ask where my server was.) After he showed up, however, he was attentive enough. Pleasant enough, but not over friendly or informative. 

Food: Where to start? The bread was very good. I was disappointed that they brought butter instead of an olive oil/herb dipping sauce. The side salad had a tasty dressing, but was mostly lettuce. I ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs and my husband ordered a tortellini and alfredo dish. Both were very mediocre. However, my dish succeeded in satisfying my craving for Spaghetti and Meatballs. My husband was disappointed in his own dish and ended up sharing with me. 

SUMMARY: This is mediocre Italian food at great Italian food prices. This is the main issue I had with the place. If they cut they&#39;re prices by 50% then I would have been pleased with my mediocre food. I would have gotten what I paid for. 

Disclaimer: I went for dinner, and maybe there are great lunch specials of which I am not aware."

Loved that!! Bread was good but so wishing they had the olive oil dipping sauce that another yelper raved about. I should&#39;ve passed on the tiramisu. :(  The inside of the restaurant just has an awkward feeling. Maybe it&#39;s the multi levels or that there are no windows, or the giant projection screen."

Then it took another 10 min to get our drinks. Our entrées took about 45 min. It seemed like forever! During dinner we ordered another round of drinks which again took a while to receive, also while waiting for our sons soda to be refilled and being cluttered by empty glasses and plates. The food however,  was amazing! Perfect! Everyone enjoyed their meal. The owner was great and involved in everything. Great atmosphere and decor. My husband and I have been in the service industry for about 10+ years now and it would&#39;ve just  been nice to feel wanted by the server and for her to feel more into her job and guests rather then just an order taker.

- $7.95 lunch menu
- Military discount
- Accommodates groups
- Gigantic portions

The most surprising part about my visit wasn&#39;t that there was a Buck Hunter arcade or pool tables in the back with a stone waterfall, but instead it was the gigantic portions. 

Let&#39;s say you want some fried pickles, you&#39;d better be ready for a jar of while pickles that are deep fried. Not only that but the $7.95 lunch menu doesn&#39;t skimp on size either!

I ordered a pork loin sandwich and it was the size of two softballs stuffed in a bun. I had a major food baby at the end! The pork was crispy fried perfectly where nothing was soggy and every bite had some crisp.

Queso was sufficient for the chips provided and the fries we got with our sandwich.  Typically the queso vs chip ratio is totally wrong, not here.

We also got a mojito, it came out quick and was perfect.

For dinner we got the Italian press and the burrito.  The press is pretty much a pizza folded in half.  I&#39;m a fat kid and couldn&#39;t finish.  It was awesome.  The fries were perfect for the remaining queso.  

The burrito was filling and awesome.  The wife was in a happy food coma after we were done.

We ordered the sirloin steak and the beer battered fish and chips. Both items were very delicious. The fish and chips was definitely authentic in texture. The fish seemed fresh and the crust was flaky and golden just as t should be. That being said, it was lacking in salt and the fries had neither salt nor pepper. The sauce was probably the best I&#39;ve had since visiting England in August. 
The steak was a little bit overdone and that&#39;s why his review is three stars instead of four. The entire perimeter of the steak had that burnt taste but the middle was still good despite being a little dry. The service was good and the atmosphere was family oriented. For the price I would rather get a steak at Applebee&#39;s but I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to coming here again. It just didn&#39;t &#34;WOW&#34; me."

The atmosphere is outgoing but a bit too loud.  Some of the patrons on Monday night were extremely loud, over the game noise on TV.  I&#39;m not normally a complainer on other people&#39;s noise level but I believe it may be due to them finding it hard to have a conversation without screaming over the TV volume in the main dinning room.  Our waitresses have always been great and no complaints but hope they adjust the volume just a tad outside of the bar area.  We have gone on many occasions when we want to eat &#39;junk&#39; food so to speak. Tips- cheese sticks are HUGE, the potatoe skins are also a large portion so be ready.  The sliders with tots hit the spot though for our desire last time we went.  Nothing bad to say about the food we&#39;ve ordered just know it&#39;s what you go for - pub food."

Hostess and waitstaff were OK, though drinks were left empty a few too many times. Dining room was very crowded and packed and very loud.

The food really did not stand out here and if they weren&#39;t competing for the older crowd who also golfs at the golf course across the street but who does not want to eat at the course&#39;s restaurant they might be gone. The mall they are in seemed pretty vacant since it lost its&#39; Safeway anchor.

My burger was a solid meh. Not even the fries could save it.

Plenty of parking and a shuttle that runs from the far parts of the lot to the restaurant.

This place was pretty damn solid.  I was a little skeptical at first, cause generally my experience with bar food hasn&#39;t been that well, but this place was surprisingly great!  So we descended to this place around 10ish... They are located in a strip mall and a lot of the business around were closed down.  We were greeted right away and seated immediately.  The customer service was excellent.  Our waitress gave us some recommendations and was very friendly.  She was great at refilling our drinks and checked on us several times.  The manager or owner even stopped by to say hello and made sure everything was ok.  That&#39;s the type of customer service I would expect at a nice restaurant, but it was very accommodating to see from a bar and grill.  We ordered several dishes.  Of course biscuits and gravy, Huevos Rancheros, and the special which was carnitas with green chile.  The food was delicious and flavorful.  I didn&#39;t really enjoy the home fries though, I thought they were a little mushy and bland, but everything else was outstanding.  I wanted to order something different, but you know me, I&#39;m a sucker for biscuits and gravy and based off their reviews, I had to try them.  They weren&#39;t as good as Three little Griddles, but still very good and comparable to some of my favorites places in Phoenix.

Overall, another solid meal and excellent customer service.  I would highly recommend this place."

The green chili was super delicious and smothered the home fries and seasoned burger. It comes am with a single medium tortilla which you really need two so sop up the chili!

Benedict looked really good also and I was told it was flavorful and very good. I would have tried some but I would have popped if I had!

Our food was good, and they earned the two stars in this review for that. Our party of several people tried out sandwiches, a bean burrito, and a gyro among other things. 
Our server was kind, but she was either overworked or just didn&#39;t notice that we waited over 15 minutes to place our food order, then had to wait 30 minutes for our food. What really stunk is that people seated after us, and even shortly before our food finally came out got their food BEFORE us. Our waitress did make a comment about the kitchen being backed up, but no manager came by to apologize...just a courtesy that even chains would offer. 
 
In addition, I used this Yelp app to check in, but then my server, and then subsequently the manager denied me the ability to use the coupon here that Yelp offers. A comment was made that they don&#39;t combine coupons with happy hours, but the coupon here on yelp does not specify that. And there is nothing in the restaurant that states that either. Now, if you were a manager and a larger party came in, ordered drinks and apps and entrees, don&#39;t you THINK you would throw them a bone to keep their business?! Well, they didn&#39;t. And, the manager didn&#39;t have the customer service skills to come and speak with us about it either. Their loss.

This is hard to say in this day and age, especially when you don&#39;t really frequent chain restaurants that often. 
Here at the Parkway, the staff has always been friendly and attentive. The waitress (I wish I could remember her name) was pretty busy the entire time and had several tables she was working, but never left our table needing anything. 
As far as the food goes, I can&#39;t recall having anything that wasn&#39;t satisfying... but if you want your socks knocked off, just go ahead and order the shrimp mac and cheese or the lobster mac and cheese, I can pretty much GUARANTEE that you will be back again. Along with the mac and cheese, I&#39;ve had the wings... those are good too. Anything you get on the menu is going to have extremely large portions, so whatever amount it costs, don&#39;t complain, it is WELL worth it.

My biggest issue was we went to use the check in coupon and we were told we couldn&#39;t. The reason was we had a happy hour drink and that disqualifies us from using it. Even though we had bought more drinks that were not on happy hour and it doesn&#39;t say that on the coupon. This is called a bait and switch.

Being a weekend day, their menu was even larger as they offer breakfast items until about 2:00pm. 

My father and I both ordered sandwiches for lunch, and both were very tasty. My son ordered an omelet with home fries, and it was huge! He really enjoyed the omelet, and commented that he would like to come back to try other items from the menu. I should also mention that our service was outstanding, with the wait staff checking in frequently and our food delivered quickly. 

I definitely look forward to returning and trying different dishes."

His chicken fried steak was mostly inedible and my pork carnitas was stringy and bland, but the worst part of the whole experience was the way we felt once we got home.  I honestly thought I was going to die my stomach hurt so badly and this morning we are still both sick to our stomachs.  I don&#39;t know what was going on in the kitchen, our waitress was very apologetic stating that they were training a new cook . . . to do WHAT? poison people?

Although their breakfasts are awesome, tons of really good food, the fact that they don&#39;t open until 10 am on the weekends puts a damper on us eating here but rarely. Not a weekend goes by that we talk about going here for breakfast as a family but then remember they don&#39;t open till late and no one wants to wait the 2 to 3 hours to eat breakfast.

Parkway Bar and Grill can range from a straight-up sports bar with all of your deep-fried bar favorites to food that can rival fine dining.  Make sure you check out their daily specials and if you&#39;re around for a week-day lunch, they have a $7 menu that will fill you up right."

Looks wise, it&#39;s kind of small, quaint, got a sports bar/grill feel to it. Crowd is older 30&#39;s-50&#39;s for the most part. 
We ordered their Guinness battered mozzarella sticks, and they were phenomenal, homemade sauce was awesome, batter was inspiring. We also orders some drinks on happy hour, they do a buy one, get one for a dollar, which wasn&#39;t a bad deal and it went til 7 which was nice but the drinks were a little on the weak side. 
Biggest issue with the place? Overpriced. It&#39;s over in the Southlands area and they price their food accordingly. Queso dip was 11 bucks. We would have loved to try more but we didn&#39;t feel like spending 60 dollars on a dinner with a couple drinks. 
If the rest of their food is as good as the mozz sticks, it might just be worth the splurge."

The place is filled with TVs, a big bar and some pool tables.  The menu is diverse bar &amp; grill fare - fried chicken, to chile rellenos to a good ole burger.  We ordered queso (which tasted like cheeseburger mac to me) and chicken fried steak + fried chicken.  The portions were insanely huge!  HUGE pile of mashed potatoes, veggies and a giantic piece of fried meat.  The batter on the steak &amp; chicken was crisp and light so the flavor of the meat came out and you didn&#39;t have too much breading.    

As far as the food, it is good down home eats.  It fills you up.  The service was outstanding - friendly, attentive and was good about telling us the specials and getting us our happy hour drinks.  The app did come out only a couple minutes before the entrees so that sucked.  It was too much food at once!  Plus my veggies where dosed in salt!  I would go back in a minute though.  

It was a friendly neighborhood bar!"

We have been coming here for breakfast for years - it has always been a decent breakfast - not the best but not bad. Last time was mediocre, at best.  Today was just this side of nasty!  I ordered the Belgian Waffle that comes with home fries and your choice of meat.  The so called &#34;home fries&#34; tasted like they were leftover baked potatoes that had been tossed with a few green and red peppers and barely warmed in the microwave. They were GROSS!  My husband ordered potatoes and green chili....same disgusting home fries and a stingy portion of green chili.  Even the waffle was barely average, with frozen strawberries instead if the strawberries I was expecting. So disappointing. 
The waiter did try to make it better by comping our breakfast but seriously?  I don&#39;t think any more meals at Parkway are in our future.  It wasn&#39;t just us either....the table next to us was saying that the food quality has gone down.
It makes me wonder if Parkway has changed hands or if they are attempting some serious cost cutting.  Whatever the reason, I&#39;d say don&#39;t waste your time or your money!"

I ordered the Philly. Normally you would find tons of flavor through seasonings and peppers. Not on this Philly. The peppers and onions had no flavor. Almost as if they keep them in a container of water to quickly sauté them. The portion was huge, but who cares if you don&#39;t want to eat it. I could have drawn more flavor from the crayons my kids were drawing with then I got from their fries. 

My wife ordered chicken fried steak. Again, very bland and not worth the portion. Gravy typically has flavor. Parkways gravy is blah. Go ahead and try it and try not to have the reaction of, &#34;eh....&#34;

It&#39;s always worth a shot to try it. I hope others have better luck or child like pallets that don&#39;t appreciate flavor. On a plus, our server was very attentive and pleasant. I wish I remembered his name to give a shout out. Although I can&#39;t say we will be back, our server was good enough to almost make us try again. Sadly, Parkway is a real disappointment."

They had Halloween decorations up, I love Halloween decorations and Halloween in general. This place was packed too, so that&#39;s normally a good sign of a good place.  Anyway, after a bit of waiting, we were sat down and the waitress came by very promptly(she was great the whole night) and we ordered some Margaritas, DONT buy margaritas here! They suck. I need to stick by my old adage, only buy margaritas from mexican restaurants... 
Anyway, the food was very good, it almost made me forget about my drink, almost :)  I got the fish and chips.  The breading was amazing, light and crunchy at the same time, I wish I knew how they did it.  And, the french fries were seasoned just right.  My girlfriend got the greek/gyro pizza, and she said it was really good too.
So, come to this place for the food, and dont get the margaritas.

Also, if you&#39;re looking for a nice place to hook up with some middle aged men/women, this is your place.  I dont know why, but the clientele was a bit older, but if that&#39;s your cup of prunes, go at it! (slowly, though!)"

We got a coupon in the mail for them and realized they were only about 5 minutes from our house so decided to swing by on a Friday night after work. The sidewalk was full of golf carts, which we thought was weird, but I guess they&#39;re close enough to Saddle Rock that everyone just drives on down.

Their happy hour was a little weird and not explained very well, but essentially we each ordered a beer on tap for full price and then they give you a little dixie cup to go along with it and when you&#39;re ready for your next one you just wave the dixie cup in the air and get another beer for $1. 

We ordered an appetizer of the chips and queso and it was freaking HUGE! Probably could have just gotten by on that for dinner, but we both ordered. I got Chicken Fried Steak and the wife got Fried chicken. My son got chicken nuggets + fries. (Guess it was a chicken night.) The portions were freaking HUGE, again! I don&#39;t think a one of us ate more than half of our dinner, but that was all right as we got boxes and ate them all the next day.

The bar itself was pretty nice. There were pool tables in the corner and a fully stocked bar. It&#39;s relatively big inside even tho you can&#39;t tell it from the outside. They&#39;ve got big screen TV&#39;s and advertise free texax hold &#39;em tournaments. We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Not sure what was happening that day but I wasn&#39;t the only person in the place that had a poor experience. Like I said in my orginal review the regulars or locals are the bread and butter but my new face (money) was treated as such like &#34;he will not be back&#34; so pretty much one and done attitude and service.

I&#39;m not sure when I will be back but will try again at some point. 
Thanks for reaching out."

This place has about 15 tables in a dining room and about another 10 tall tables in a bar. They are also expanding to the next storefront and it looks to be a sports bar with a lot of big screen TV&#39;s.  They are gearing up for Tebow and the Bronco&#39;s next year.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with mashed potatoes and grilled corn on the cob.  Sister had the glazed salmon with rice and veggies.   The CFS was one of the best i&#39;ve had, but for $14, you expect it to be better than the average breakfast steak.  This CFS is a deep fried variety. It was thick and crispy battered with good seasoning in the batter.  The steak is tenderized just enough, but not too much to make it mushy.  You needed a knife to cut this steak which is a good thing.  The batter is like a tempura batter.  Not dense and crispy good.   The gravy is the basic white gravy.   Adding pepper to this gives it the needed seasoning.  The corn was money.  Sweet and it has some dashes of seasoning salt on it. Perfectly grilled.  

The Sister&#39;s salmon looked great. I had a piece of it and it was flakey and tender.  Not dry.  Not over cooked. The food was as good as a place you would expect to spend twice the money.  5 solid stars for the quality/cost ratio value and it&#39;s one of the best Chicken Fried Steaks i&#39;ve had and I&#39;ve had a lot."

I&#39;ve lived by Parkway for a year and, because my parents had two bad service/food experiences there, I have abstained from going in.  

I&#39;m not sure what happened with my parents a year ago but I found this place to have very good service, food, and drinks.  It&#39;s a sports bar with several golf video games (get some old school games!) a juke box, and flat screen T.V.&#39;s spilling out of every wall.  There is bar tables, seating at the bar, and a seated dining area. 

I had the chili rojo and it was filled with tender chunks of pork.  Very tasty and for $11.95?  Score.

The most impressive factor, though, was the fact that they carried a fairly unknown specialty vodka called &#34;Tito&#39;s&#34; which has a better taste than it&#39;s more expensive counterpart &#34;Chopin&#34; (both being gluten free).  How did they know?

I was glad to see that they offered breakfast on the weekends, and my daughter loved the pancakes.

Usually we get in a little early for dinner 5:30 to 6.  The bar always seems a little busy for happy hour, but dining is not too busy.  We really enjoy going to the local neighborhood bar for a quick dinner.  The waitress was nice nothing spectacular but quality.  She did offer the happy hour deal once I order a beer which was nice.  The food here is a little more up scale than typical fried bar food.  We have had the spin and artichoke dip, as well as mozzarella sticks for apps.  Both were very good and the spin dip came out with celery, carrots, and fresh bread which is a little different than the norm but a good change. Tried beef tips and gravy.  It was good but meat was more of a pot roast.  Also they have menu for daily specials of about 6 entrees and a couple deserts.  Not sure how often it changes but different options than the regular menu.  I went with seafood mac n cheese.  Tasty not a whole lot of seafood (crab,shrimp, scallops) but manageable for a bar.  A little heavy and rich, but should be expected from scratch mac n cheese.  Good joint for a quick dinner that&#39;s not the normal bar food."

It was his first time at Parkway, and my third. We both thought the bartender was friendly, the drinks priced okay, but I thought my vodka cranberries were super weak. In the past, I&#39;ve had rum and diet, which wasn&#39;t weak at all. Anyway - drinks were fine!

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. It was DELIGHTFUL. I had a bite of it and spent the rest of the meal trying to steal more bites of the mashed potatoes. I had the chile rellenos and they were yummy. The chiles-fried-inside-eggroll-wrapper variety you see fairly often in Denver. The green chile on top was good too; no complaints. 

When my sister and I ate there, she had a huge burrito which was full of ground beef - bleah! She liked it okay, but I&#39;m always disappointed to see hamburger passed off as Mexican food. The two of us shared some fried pickle spears as an appetizer, and those were good.

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll go back - this place also puts $10 off coupons in the local free magazines that come in the mail, so watch your mailbox if you&#39;re in Aurora."

We decide to dine in, on that faithful evening of Thursday March 21st 2013.  Time was about 20:50hrs ish.

Yes, you made your order thru the counter, and the staff will assists or prepare the food in front of you.  I opt for Barbocoa, with Cilantro-Lime Rice, Fajita Vegetables that consists of Green Bell Peppers and Onions, the Tomatillo-Red Chili Salsa aka SPICY HOT to my liking and Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa. ($6.65)  

While Hubs opt for the Steak Burrito, that comes with Flour Tortilla, Vegetarian Black Beans, Salsa, and Cheese. ($6.65).

Hubs also order the Large Quesadilla ($3.50) with Steak ($2.35) and a Small Soda ($1.60) while I opt for the Pineapple Orange Banana Nantucket Bottled Drink ($2.50).  The total cost of the Dinner with tax was $25.23.

Since I was SEMI-Full from the previous event, I opt for my Barbocoa Fajita Bowl TO GO, while have a little bite of the Large Steak Quesadilla.  I cannot deny that I like the Steak Quesadilla the BEST, though I so wish I could have more.  

I don&#39;t fancy the Barbocoa at all, maybe, due to the fact the shredded beef was slightly lacking in flavor and not to my liking.  

From their CHIPOTLE website, they mentioned that the Barbocoa is Spicy, Shredded Beef.  Which is slowly braised for hours in a blend of Chipotle Pepper Adobo, Cumin, Cloves, Garlic and Oregano until tender and moist.  The Barbocoa IS NOT SPICY at all.  Oh well.  *SIGH*  *SAD FACE*

Hubs like his order a lot, that he said he does not mind returning to Chipotle when needed.  As for me, I like the Cilantro Lime Rice, and the Rice alone reminds me of an establishment that starts with &#34;W&#34;...  I also like the Tomatillo-Red Chili Salsa that I opt for.  If without that Tomatillo Red Chili Salsa, I doubt I can finish my TO GO Order.

All in all its a 3 stars Dining experience here base on FOOD Alone, though I believe Hubs would give 3.5 stars for his Dinner.  The service was 3.5 to 4 stars at best, coz it was prompt, quick and fast.  The person who handle, and prepare our order was Miguel and the Cashier was Cesar.  

This establishment was kept clean and that includes the Ladies washroom that I need to use while I was there.  Before we order there are a few families having their dinner there and while we were there many more Patrons come in, either to Dine In or have their Food TO GO.

Some are great and some are not so great. I&#39;m lucky enough to have one of the best Chipotle&#39;s right down the street. The location is not that big, and during lunchtime it can be hard to get a table. 

The employees that work here are WONDERFUL. They actually know me by name and always give my husband and I a hard time when we come in (in a good way) or when I come alone they always ask where &#34;trouble&#34; is. I love them all. They are very kind, have great customer service skills, and don&#39;t skimp on the servings.

Couple of tips - You can order your food online and pick-up. You don&#39;t wait in line. Just walk up to the cash register and they hand you your bag (if you paid online). I do this 99.9% of the time. iPhone users have an online ordering app. The parking lot there sucks! They share it with a game store and Starbucks and it&#39;s usually filled. I find it easier to park next to the bus stop and walk an additional 10 steps to avoid the parking lot fiasco.

Favorite meal - Vegetarian burrito bowl, white rice with black beans, medium salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and guac with a side order of chips. They have amazing chips and I use them as my spoon. No utensils needed. It might be one of my favorite meals, ever!"

&#34;GREAT BURRITOS THAT ARE QUICK AND HEALTHY (AND QUITE HEFTY)&#34;

Food/Drink: 
I always get the burritos here and find they are a pretty good sized portion and very healthy.  I like the option of choosing between brown rice over white and also between different types of beans which adds variation.  They are more of a commercial Mexican restaurant so they do not carry the condiments which I like to include with my meal (which are the pickled onions, carrots, and jalapenos).

Service:
Service is always prompt and friendly.

I will have to share though that the last time I went to Chipotle&#39;s, I had a &#34;small&#34; situation with a simple request that I made with a cashier.  I asked her when paying for my food if there were any extra plates available and she directed me to the other side of the restaurant where the condiments were.  Upon getting there I noticed that there were none and so I had to go back and ask her AGAIN for one (which I found a little &#34;strange&#34;).  She then asked her coworker to hand her a plate (even though her coworker was busy helping someone else with their order) but she eventually walked over and grabbed a plate for me.

Atmosphere: 
It&#39;s clean here and I could definitely eat here again or in the dining area outside of the restaurant under the umbrellas.

Price
You pay about $6.70 something for a burrito (I&#39;ve found cheaper in other places but, they do give you a lot...)

Parking: 
Free parking in the shopping area but it can be sparse on a busy day when people are coming into Starbucks next door.

MY THOUGHTS?
This is a place I would come for a quick bite when I need to if I am ravishingly hungry and don&#39;t want to spend a lot of money but also want to eat healthy.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The Chicken Burrito is pretty good."

Chipotle is the standard for a decent fast food-ish burrito or other various Mexican food. 

When you go, you are given a choice of Chicken, Steak, Barbicoa, or Veggies to go into your burrito, salad, quesadilla, or bowl?

Next, you are given a choice of rice: Brown or White?

Beans: Black or Pinto? 

Salsas: Mild (pico-de-gallo), Corn, Hot, Green?

Cheese?

Sour Cream or Guacamole?

I have never had a terrible choice from Chipotle, especially this location. Lately, I have been ordering a chicken salad with extra chicken, black beans, a little bit of cheese, and the hot red salsa on the side! Yum!"

This is some of the nicest staff I&#39;ve encountered.  From the moment you walk in to when you are checking out, everyone is smiling, asking about your day, and they seem genuine too!  It&#39;s a mad house during the lunch rush, but they are so fast, and never miss a beat.  No one seems stressed or annoyed.  It is quite refreshing.

And I love that Chipotle shares the same feelings as I do about food and where it&#39;s coming from.  The website is great, you can see where everything comes from.  I even tried the pork carnitas, and I usually avoid meat at places like this.  They were so good! I trust that the pork is raised humanly and is hormone/antibiotic free.  I love that they have brown rice too! I think I&#39;ve found a regular lunch spot for sure.  This Chipolte has it all, quick efficient lines, super friendly staff, and morals about the food they are serving.  Sold.

Let me add my final thought-mini bowl! They really should have a half bowl on the menu!! And most of my office agrees.  Sometimes that big bowl is just too much!  We think we might petition for the mini bowl!"

Overall its a great place to grab a good burrito.  The only gripe I have with this place is the terribly small amount of parking they have.  The spots are tight and some are parallel parking only.  That&#39;s normally not a big deal, but the parallel spots are tight as well.  If I&#39;m driving my F-150, I&#39;ve got no chance paralleling in some of those spots.

I go to Chipotle perhaps 2-5 times a month and almost never run into problems. I know there is one lady who works some of the night shifts that can NOT wrap the burrito without it falling apart. But I take that to be an isolated incident. Otherwise, if it is your first time there, just go with a chicken burrito with black beans, mild salsa, sour cream and cheese. They also have student drinks for free with a valid student ID.

PROTIP: Save a quarter of the burrito and refrigerate. Microwave for 2 minutes and eat for breakfast. (Better with less sour cream and extra cheese)"

The good Chipotle restaurants shake the water out of the salsa before putting it on.  This one apparently doesn&#39;t consider the effect of salsa water on a soft tortilla.

I&#39;m obsessed with the deluxe smothered breakfast burrito (their green chili is to die for and perfectly spicy). We are always remembered at the Washington location by name (even after moving to Seattle 9 years ago and only being able to visit a couple times a year). It is literally the first place we go to after landing in Denver, and I pray this place never changes. I plan to be a life long patron.

**My only hesitation in giving 5 stars is the attitude of the gal who takes orders down at the location off of Sante Fe.

They tear at the most inopertune times and can really make a mess of a dencent shirt. Other than that they are amazing.

I&#39;ve had their lunch items and various other items and they are good too but the breakfast is what keeps me coming in the door.

This location is usually happeing due to all the industry in the area. They run like a well oiled machine but you can usually plan to wait 5 - 10 minuts for your order. The staff is friendly and they are extreamly accurate."

Probably my absolutely favorite smothered burrito is here.   I like Santiago&#39;s too but they arent consistant.  This place is consistant.. If you get HOT its HOT.  If you get 1/2 and 1/2 mild with a kick.

I always get the pork or the steak smothered burriot.  They fill the green chili to the top (unlike santiagos) And put cheese on the top (unlike santiagos unless you pay more)

The pork is cut into pieces and pre seasoned.   So good


Had my first one in months as we got our first snow today and this always warms the body up.



This location closes at 2pm  as they get alot of business for breakfast burriots for construction jobs.

They dont have sides here like rice or beans."

The tea came in a big bowl. It was very flavorful and creamy. The Unagi ramen was great. There was a good amount of Unagi. The noodles were cooked well. The broth was nice and wasn&#39;t too salty. 

From the street the outside of the restaurant looks like a warehouse but once you go inside it looks very nice. There are stone tables and tree stump stools. They provide a flat tray to put your belongings on while you eat. They have indoor and outdoor seating. There is plenty of parking. Too bad they don&#39;t allow you to split checks."

I am not just talking about not refilling the waters (1 star off) or taking forever to get the check (1 star off) -- because those things all happen, but about the restaurant staff actually being completely unreasonable.

1 star off: One of the last times we went here, we made a reservation for 6 people in my family, but 2 had to cancel at the last minute.  The hostess refused to seat us, and made the 4 of us wait in line with everyone else without reservations.  After 45 minutes, we were finally seated...but at a *6* people table!!!  Half of the restaurant was empty too.

1 star off: Today, I am in the area for a business trip and went to Domo.  First of all, the hostess tried to seat my group outside when all the tables and chairs were wet, without even offering to dry them.  So I politely asked if we can sit inside instead...because I did not want to sit on wet chairs obviously.  Then I explained that I am on a business trip and need to have split checks because my meal will be reimbursed...because it&#39;s unethical to try to reimburse others&#39; orders as a business expense obviously.  The staff refused to split the check whatsoever.  In fact, one of the staff members told me, &#34;If you don&#39;t like this policy, you can leave.&#34;  I asked to speak with the manager, and was not offered to speak with him/her, but was told again, &#34;We do not split checks, if you don&#39;t like this policy, you can leave.&#34;  Is this for real?  So I had no choice but to leave.

I was completely appalled by this rudeness.  I think the problem with the service at this restaurant is that all the staff are high school and college-aged kids.  They have absolutely no training in customer service but feel like they can exert power over you as if you have no other dining options.  There are tons of good sushi and ramen restaurants in Denver.  I do not understand why Domo has to make it so difficult for customers when something really simple on their part can make a tremendous positive impact on the customer&#39;s life.  Domo is like a government-run agency."

Wasn&#39;t too huge of a fan of this place if you didn&#39;t catch my drift with those first few sentences. The restaurant itself is pretty cool to be honest. Kinda looks like a museum as there&#39;s a ton to look at on the walls. It&#39;s like one of those really loud and brash diners with tons of flair on the walls, except Japanese styled. But the cool looks aren&#39;t enough to make up for the food.

I appreciated the small dishes that came out before our main dishes. Reminded me of the banchan you&#39;d get at a Korean restaurant. Some of these were okay, but other were kinda tasteless or too salty. The ramen I ordered is where it got bad in my opinion. Now I may be spoiled by California ramen, but the ramen here was so tasteless compared to what I&#39;m used to. The broth was closer to water than anything else. Meat had barely any flavor to it. Nobody reading this here is gonna get this reference, but the ramen tasted like the very generic ramen you get from one of those super touristy places in Japantown, San Francisco. Not a fan at all.

I also ordered an Unagi-don along with my meal and it was just okay. The unagi was very squishy and seemed like it was just coated with sauce just to compensate. Again, not a fan but at least this had flavor.

Probably not gonna make another visit here."

My party of 6 came to the restaurant for my boyfriends 30th birthday to celebrate. It&#39;s a big day since turning 30 is a big deal and I wanted to take him here because he loves Japanese ramen! The Japanese are known for their hospitality and great service and I didn&#39;t expect any less at this very traditional and authentic restaurant.

After our party was seated, we were literally ignored for almost 30 minutes. There were 6 of us but only 5 menus and 4 cups of water. It was almost impossible to flag a waiter down and we weren&#39;t even sure who our server was anyways to ask for assistance. When I finally got someone to pay attention to us, he was a trainee which is fine if he&#39;s slow or needs to ask for repetition, but he didn&#39;t even know what a Don was. My boyfriends mom ordered karage don which is chicken on top of egg and rice and he asked her if she wanted udon with it. Wtf?? Even if maybe you didn&#39;t memorize the menu, you should at least know what is in each dish if you&#39;re going to work in a Japanese restaurant. Then after that, our actual waiter came. He wasn&#39;t friendly, didn&#39;t smile, and had to come back and ask me for my entire order over again because I guess he messed it up the first time. 

The plus side is the food was good and the portions were great.

They also used to give refills on side dishes which apparently they don&#39;t anymore. Then when I asked if they do anything for birthdays, they said we don&#39;t serve any desserts. I mean that&#39;s fine but you could at least give a discount for birthdays or sing or something?!? The lack of enthusiasm is overwhelming and I don&#39;t think any of them even enjoy working here. 

My overall experience was that the food was good but service is terrible. And that is not acceptable for a restaurant that has won multiple awards and charges a hefty amount for noodles. It&#39;s not a fast food restaurant, come on. You&#39;re business will not flourish if you don&#39;t continuously try to improve and service is one place you can start on."

This enormous samurai compound is like stepping into rural Japan. Authentic decor in every nook and cranny, cool stone tables, and a relaxing garden outdoor dining area. Very cool place to bring out of town visitors or a date you are trying to impress. 

The menu is confusing. There are so many choices, combinations, and sides, unless you are an Iron Chef you have to either ask for help or just pretend you know what you are doing, pick something and hope it&#39;s good. 

With every dish, you get several mini appetizer things like roast pumpkin (hella good), miso paste (kind like hummus; very good), daikon radishes, and some things I was not adventurous to try. I ordered the gyoza which was delicious and comes with the best soy sauce I ever had!

I ordered pork ramen and the bowl is about the size of half a basketball and filled to the brim. Plenty of meat and noodles - the broth was good, the noodles were fresh, and the meat was solid. It also came with a side of chicken teriyaki, it was just ok. The sauce was a little sweet and tasted store bought. 

All in all we had a great experience and will definitely be going back to try new dishes! Domo arigato misto roboto!"

Not only is the food superb...the restaurant serves as a museum, garden and dojo! If you enjoy eating outside, I recommend grabbing a table in their beautifully landscaped Japanese garden. The atmosphere is relaxing, organic and very friendly. Come on an empty stomach, the serving sizes are really big! If you go in the winter, the garden will not be open but the hot ramen noodle soup with ginger tea will warm you right up! 

I always get the seafood ramen and maguro dunbori (fresh tuna over rice)."

The decorations are authentic and really create a true Japanese environment. And the back patio is incredibly gorgeous, full of plants and life, and even a waterfall. They even have little sun hats that you can wear to add to the authenticity. 

On their menu, they have a little story for each section. Whether the story be about where the dishes originated from or how they are created, they are all interesting and informative! It&#39;s a nice personalized touch from the owner. 

The food is also excellent. The Unagi Tamago from the appetizers was my favorite, mainly because I LOVE Unagi. The ramen is okay, but I loved udon. The noodles are thick and tasty. I believe they really take pride in their food because you cannot order udon to go since they even know the noodles get soggy and they wouldn&#39;t want to serve you poorly. 

The owner seems to really take pride in this beautiful restaurant he created with a wonderful atmosphere and incredible and authentic food. I would highly recommend everyone experience this place."

On a Wed at 7:30, there was a 30 minute wait, but I just walked around the area and it was all good.

I went with 4 simply because the overall experience was unique.  The restaurant itself is unlike any other I have been to in Denver ( couldn&#39;t tell you if it is authentic or just weird in a really great way). All the Ramen dishes are huge and they taste fantastic, truly your monies worth! All the sides that it comes with are also so delectable I could eat a few helpings of them. My personal favorite was the new Chicken Curry Ramen with the mini spicy maguro.

The reason for the star hesitation was that in order to be seated without waiting hours we had to share a table.  I love community style seating but when it is a very large, multi-group setting.  This was a square table with two parties awkwardly sat unable to make their own conversation comfortably. Our server was very persistent, making me feel oh so rushed. And when you see the menu you will understand that time is necessary. There are just about 1,000 options/combinations so I would highly recommend taking the waiting time you&#39;ll have by perusing the menu and looking up all the things you have never heard of!!"

The vibe at this restaurant is chill, exotic, quixotic, and somewhat cult-like a la Soup Man. This tone was set by the hostess at the front, a grandmotherly woman whose first question was whether anyone was vegetarian or gluten-free. &#34;Because we don&#39;t have anything for you.&#34;

As a party of 10, we were told to wait about 25 minutes. You can&#39;t order drinks while you sit in the waiting area, but you can sift through the massive menu and sip on tap yuzu water or ginger (yuzu) water. I did both. 

We wanted to sit outside because apparently there is sometimes people practicing dojo in the garden, but they couldn&#39;t fit all of us together so we settled for a table indoors, which barely fit all of us. Minutes later, we knew we made the right choice when people came hurrying indoors with the menu covering their heads. It had started raining. 

The menu is extensive, and every dish seems to come with 7 side dishes, so try not to order more than one thing. We ended up getting appetizers and a main dish for each person. It was plenty of food, plus leftovers. Some of us were eating furiously the whole time, but it looked like we barely made a dent in our noodles. I was craving salmon, so I got the salmon donburi. It came with a heaping pile of salmon, enough to feed three hungry mouths. The quality was just ok, nothing remarkable, but the sheer quantity will satisfy your direst salmon craving.

They took a long time to bring the donburi dishes, while the noodle dishes came out in rapid succession. The waitstaff seemed super busy and a little frazzled. I don&#39;t blame them, but it wasn&#39;t exactly easy to flag one of them down if we needed more water or wanted to know what became of our orders.

All in all, a great place for anyone craving a Japanese meal. Atmosphere is cool. Sakes are good. Quality of the food is OK."

First off, they don&#39;t take reservations. Luckily, I only had to wait 10 minutes for a party if 2, but I can imagine that they get quite busy on some nights. When we were called to our tables, we were asked whether we would be okay sharing a table. We said sure, and it ended up being fine. It wasn&#39;t really a communal eating type of table, but rather they sat us on opposite corners of another party of 2. So we each just did our own thing. I would have preferred a smaller table, but it didn&#39;t look like here were too many smaller tables to go around; there were lots of shared tables.

I really enjoyed my meal here. The side dishes are done really well, with lots of variety. Their pork stew side dish was especially good!! For main courses, we both got ramen. The bowl was huge and the amount of food was very sizeable. Their dashi broth was sooo delicious, as was their broth that had a bit of tomato paste in it and some amazing spices (can&#39;t recall the name anymore :( ...)Anyways, overall great meal. The only thing was I felt like they were rushing us...they were prompt to take our orders and such, but also brought us our checks within 15-20 minutes of us getting all our food, without us asking."

When you go here, you&#39;re stepping into a whole different world. Domo is a restaurant/folk art museum/aikido dojo/garden, and you&#39;ll know right away that you&#39;re not in Kansas anymore. There are warnings posted throughout the restaurant (with truly Japanese levels of politeness) warning you that if you&#39;re a strict vegetarian, don&#39;t eat gluten, or have kids that don&#39;t behave then your should dine elsewhere. The decor is straight out of feudal Japan, and the music is from the mid 80&#39;s.

For the uninitiated (me, for example) the menu can be a little intimIdating. Don&#39;t worry about it, you can&#39;t go wrong. The food is AMAZING! I tried a pork curry ramen with a teriyaki pork side, my wife had something that resembled sushi (sorta). The wait staff was very helpful with selecting the right dishes, but I&#39;m pretty sure that if you threw darts at the menu you&#39;d still leave happy and full. 

Think of this as a great place for special occasions or for dates... but only if you want it to be memorable. If you&#39;re looking for the same old thing, there are plenty of more boring places which will be happy to take your money."

After we were seated and looking over our menu, our server asked if we were ready. Then he continues on quite rudely, &#34;what do you want?&#34; As he moved onto everyone else, then landed on my fiancée, my fiancée did not know how to pronounce the entree so he pointed to it. Our waiter said &#34;what is that I can&#39;t see it?&#34;, obviously my fiancée didn&#39;t know how to pronounce it. 

Once our orders started coming, my order was put in wrong. I ordered the Unagi tamago don and I was brought the Unagi don. A different waiter then our server who took our order brought our food, kindly apologized and took the dish back to get it corrected. 

The food was pretty good, but the rice to Unagi ratio was off. I love rice but that was more rice than actual substance. The water tasted like iron...bleh. 

Our server only checked on us once and we ran out of water but never got a refill. Also, when we were checking out, we thought it would be faster to drop our check off at the front with the hostess. However, we still waited at least 30 mins for our bill to come back. We were not happy with the overall service and the service makes such a huge impact with my overall experience."
domo-restaurant-denver,Elisabeth C.,izNqkI081qOSFUNzXI4fdQ,"Denver, CO",1,1,0,196,4,gYESrKo5evNu3Ah9YMTYTg,4.0,2016-04-05,"I was, after reading the reviews here on Yelp, apprehensive about eating at Domo. From the negative reviews I&#39;d gleaned that the wait staff were unfriendly and unaccommodating, that the food was really not very good, and so on - I prepared myself for an unpleasant experience. Luckily, I didn&#39;t find that to be the case. 

Having lived/traveled extensively in Japan, I suppose I was more prepared for the menu than most - yes, it&#39;s totally haphazard and needs a more elegant redesign (Psst, Domo - I&#39;m a graphic designer, and I&#39;d be willing to do this gratis!), but I didn&#39;t find it a challenge to understand what the food was. 

What you&#39;re paying for here is clearly the ambiance - and it&#39;s honestly very lovely. It&#39;s authentic and legitimately feels like you&#39;re somewhere in Kyoto, rather than Denver. We walked in to the restaurant to the sounds of instrumental music from Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s &#39;Spirited Away&#39;, and the sun was beginning to set in the garden, so the experience was honestly pretty magical. We were seated in the garden and it was explained that it&#39;s difficult to move you once seated there - so the waitress definitely wanted to confirm we weren&#39;t going to change our minds - we didn&#39;t. 

We ordered food (our waitress did ask if we had questions on the menu) - I ordered a donburi and my friend ordered a beef and vegetable special over rice, and the food was good - it wasn&#39;t the best Japanese food I&#39;ve ever had in my life, but it certainly wasn&#39;t bad - it was good, it was authentic, and the side dishes were interesting and reflected various different, subtle tastes (which is pretty typical of Japanese food). Portion sizes were more than adequate (I could not finish mine and I&#39;d barely eaten all day). Everything seemed fresh and prepared with relative care. We also ordered a bottle of sake, which was pretty good and not prohibitively expensive at all. 

At the end of the meal we split the check 50/50 with no problems. Our waitress thanked us and we finished our sake and left. As we left she thanked us again. I&#39;d probably go back for lunch next time, but the ambiance of the garden is definitely really nice around sunset, and it was a little &#39;escape&#39; from Denver life.

I think a lot of negativity surrounding this place comes from a lack of understanding Japanese food to begin with - real Japanese food is very subtle and not heavily flavoured - don&#39;t go here expecting Japanese cuisine altered for an American palate. Sure, the wait staff should be more accommodating in explaining the food to customers, but educate yourself and figure out what things are if you plan on eating food here. Additionally, service standards in America and service standards in the rest of the world are very different - I found the service here no different than most places I ate at in Japan. 

This place isn&#39;t going to win any Michelin stars, but it is genuine Japanese food in a really lovely setting, go for the experience."

I&#39;m from Japan and I try to select a Japanese restaurant owned by Japanese people as I expect them to replicate every little detail of authentic Japanese food.  I was slightly sceptical because the name of the restaurant (DOMO) didn&#39;t sound like Japanese ownership (I developed a hunch over the years).  I was wrong.

I enjoyed their wankosushi (Trade Marked!).  Seems that many dishes come with seven small dishes of vegetables and meets.  The building includes a Japanese garden and an akikido dojo.  If I ever visit Denver, I will most definately visit Domo and try their good looking ramen.  I heard that the owner(s) came from northern part of Japan and are devoted to replicating authentic country food.  I am glad that I stopped by at Domo."

I really wish that were the case.  And moreover, I really wish I had that $50 or so dollars back in my bank account because this place was totally not worth it.  

The menu is totally overwhelming and as per usual, I asked the server for some assistance in making choices.  She did so without any enthusiasm whatsoever.  That should have been my first clue.  We started with the Domo Style Maguro Poke - the sauce was fine but the chunks of tuna that arrived on my plate were made slimy by it.  Not good when you&#39;re eating raw fish.  

The chicken katsu that we ordered was just off - how do you get katsu wrong?!?  And the curry ramen I ordered was okay, though the noodles were pretty weak not to mention the pieces of pork that came with...they were not at all flavorful.  Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled by the awesome ramen available here in town but I&#39;ve had ramen elsewhere that easily spanked this one. 

The worst part, though, was when the server came over (a new one because our original server disappeared to who knows where) she didn&#39;t even bother to inquire why we had barely touched our food.  A good server would have asked if there was something wrong.  This one didn&#39;t bat an eye.  Is that because she&#39;s used to people coming in and not touching their food?  Scary!  Or, they just don&#39;t care.  Sad!

Stay away, save your money, eat elsewhere.  That&#39;s my best advice."

Little paper fans are placed at each table for customers to fan themselves since it seemed like they didn&#39;t have any AC.

Hubby had the nabeyaki udon and I had the dashi shoyu ramen lunch.  Both came with 3 country side dishes and we added mini unagi donburis to the meal.  This is where the flavor/taste combination threw us off... both hubby&#39;s udon and my ramen had amazing broth and noodles were cooked perfectly!!! I mean udon noodles were the best my hubby had and the shoyu broth was spot on.  The problems were the toppings on the noodles... there was literally a fried egg on the nabeyaki udon...ok still... but it looked and tasted like a plastic egg.  If it was a soft boiled egg or even a perfectly fried egg that&#39;s soft &amp; fluffy, this would have been the best nabeyaki udon in Denver.  The shoyu ramen had thin slices of boiled pork which were dry eventhough it was in the broth... again... if this ramen came with some tender chashu, I would have marked it the best ramen in Denver.  Such a shame to waste such good broth/noodles with subpar toppings.  The side dishes were very yummy though and the donburis were pretty good... the vinegar seasoning on the rice was a tad strong.  Unsweetened iced green tea was amazing. 

 Service was just OK... pretty minimal... not great, not good, but not bad."

The goyza was great, the sake was warm, and the experience was unique. We weren&#39;t sure about the ramen because the menu is really confusing, at least for me. I thought they were saying the same thing over and over. Anyway, we asked our waitress for some help navigating the menu, basically what we got was the equivalent of &#34;food, ramen, hot.&#34; There just wasn&#39;t an answer. She was either not familiar with the menu or didn&#39;t understand it herself. We just jumped in and had the ramen. They have three or four different broths to choose from, again, not sure. I got the miso broth, my husband got the soy sauce broth. His was better by far. The ramen came with a bunch of side dishes, I liked half of them. All in all a unique experience, I&#39;d come back to try some of their other dishes but hopefully we will have someone more knowledgable."

It&#39;s a unique restaurant; I have never been in such a fascinating environment. Although Domo&#39;s is a fun place, their quality of food and service is the reason why I give it two stars. 

First off, there is a rule where you can not share an entree. A bit annoying if you want to share, knowing there are large portions. I never knew this &#34;rule&#34; until one of my friends told me about it. 

Second, the waiters seemed extremely uninterested. When I asked for recommendations, he pointed out two ramen dishes and just stood there for a solid couple of minutes. He just STOOD there, while I was trying to figure out what I wanted. He didn&#39;t bother to ask if I needed a couple of minutes. And yes, I am extremely picky and I am always the last person in the group to choose a dish but the waiter made it extremely uncomfortable for me. With pressure I just chose the ramen with beef (not sure what it&#39;s called but it had a clear broth).  My boyfriend got the rice bowl with unagi. Both dishes were good but nothing spectacular.

 I wouldn&#39;t come back, this place is just another average joe. Go spend your money elsewhere."

So on that note, let&#39;s dive in.

Domo was conceived with the intent of evoking the very traditional flavors the owner himself grew up with in the northwestern Japanese city of Akita - with a few twists here and there. The Nabemono (country-style stew) preparations are available with several different broths (including ones with miso and soymilk bases) and simply chock-full of your choice of pork, salmon, chicken or tofu. Although generally thought of as a more South Asian item, curry has in fact been popular in Japan for well over 100 years (it arrived with the British during the Meiji Era), and Domo&#39;s hearty version will go a long way towards explaining why - no matter which protein you pick. Another fun idea are the Tsukemen - bowls of ramen, soba or udon noodles served with a bowl of broth alongside to dip to your heart&#39;s content. Yes, even one visit to Domo will help illuminate the intriguingly yummy cuisine of this island nation.

But if you&#39;re seeking the unexpected, don&#39;t worry! They&#39;ve got you covered there too. For example, the Saba Nuggets take mackerel (much-loved back home) and offer it in the deep-fried, bite-sized fashion which American audiences enthuse over. It&#39;s a win-win situation! Along those lines, the Wanko-zushi is sure to become a favorite amongst Denver&#39;s seafood devotees. Available in three- or five-choice options, diners can avail themselves of a number of different types of pre-set fish (octopus, eel, shrimp, squid...), and sauce (horseradish, mustard, Kewpie mayonnaise, pickled plum...) permutations - you&#39;ll just have to keep going back to try them all. And if you&#39;ve got an appetite bigger than Texas, why not take advantage of the Gattsuri (feast) consisting of marinated spicy beef or pork over rice with three side dishes? Yup, that&#39;s Domo - where old and new tastes converge smashingly."

It was exquisite. The food is amazing and served the traditional way. The decor is amazing. You have to take a look at the gardens and shrine out back. The price tag is a bit high for a normal dinner, but considering the care and attention given to serving food that is just right, it&#39;s worth the price. Don&#39;t be fooled by the exterior, from Colfax it looks like a warehouse. It&#39;s an amazing experience. Way more than sushi, this is authentic Japanese cuisine! In fact there isn&#39;t a lot of sushi on the menu. But you get great noodles with broth that makes the whole dish exceptional. Sides are classic small bites that take you on a journey of flavors. So great."

Now, that may sound a bit weird to have my very first experience be at a Japanese restaurant but it came highly recommended by a colleague at work who is from Denver. He raved about the quality of the food and went on about the Buri bowls that I couldn&#39;t wait to check them out! And honestly, I&#39;m so glad I did! Although there was a long wait for lunch (30 minutes), the quality and portion of the foods made it all worth it.

My sister and I decided to start off with an appetizer because we were starving after the wait. We decided on the shrimp shumai (steamed dumplings) which were tasty. We both liked that they put a shrimp on top of each dumpling, however weren&#39;t sure how they got it to stay stuck on the top--it never rolled off. Either way, it was a good start to our meal. Now, I&#39;m a huge fan of sushi and decided against order any here because it just didn&#39;t seem right to not try the Donburi bowl. I ordered the unagi avocado don bowl which came with three side dishes (think banchan for Korean meals) and miso soup. The side dishes were alright, I&#39;m used to Korean side dishes and these seemed to be along the same concept but weren&#39;t anything to rave about. I&#39;d say the same for the miso soup, although it was interesting to have carrots in there; haven&#39;t had that before. The bowl itself looked beautiful, like a piece of edible art :) and the eel and avocado were so fresh! I loved it! The eel had a bit of crispness to it but not dry whatsoever. Paired with the sauce and avocado and rice, my tastebuds were in heaven! My only complaint is that I wish there were more eel, but given that it was a lunch entrée I understand not wanting to over do it. My sister ordered the chicken curry ramen and she really enjoyed it. I think the flavors could have been developed a bit more but that&#39;s just me. The few bites I tried were good, just seemed like the flavors were only in the broth and not the noodles or chicken. 

The service was subpar, maybe even below that. I&#39;m chalking it up to the health inspector being there or at least I believe he was a health inspector the way all the staff were trying to accommodate him so much and he walked in and out the kitchen with a note pad. Either way, we were just stuck in the corner of the dining area and delivered our food when it was ready. No one came to refill our waters or ask us how it all was which is really a shame. Hopefully this isn&#39;t the usual experience for people who dine here... but fair warning if I&#39;m wrong. 

Overall, I would return to Domo despite the wait and service, mainly because the food was phenomenal especially for the price. I haven&#39;t had a donburi bowl before and now I&#39;m craving it all the time!"

1) The atmosphere is very cool ,it has a traditional Japanese garden, making Domo a unique  authentic experience.  There are a few parking spots right in front of the restaurant and there&#39;s a big parking lot in the back. If you come here on Friday night or Saturday night  the restaurant fills up fast, you will have to wait for at least 30 to 45 minutes to be seated.
2) Portion is big. it&#39;s best if you go with a couple of people so you can all share and taste the different dishes. 
3) The food : Ramen is flavorful , but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best ramen-  I like their other cooked food much better. Really enjoy the side dishes.  Over all it is a decent place for Japanese country food."

And I must say that this was one of the biggest disappointments I&#39;ve ever experienced in ANY restaurant, never mind a Japanese restaurant with a name like &#34;Domo&#34; (meaning thank you) that invokes the Japanese etiquette of politeness, and its high importance placed on its culture of appreciation. 

I wanted to like this restaurant so much, and was so looking forward to trying it. It was extremely sad and disappointing that this meal at Domo Restaurant ended up being the most sub par out of all the food I tried in Denver, mostly due to the horrible service we received here by one especially rude Asian waiter, who assumed I didn&#39;t understand Japanese food. Does he not realize that there is 10x more legit Japanese restaurants in Toronto? With 100x better service, I might add. Also, does he not understand what &#34;Domo&#34; even means? He certainly did not embrace the Japanese culture and etiquette of appreciation or being polite. 

After posting my bad meal experience recently on Instagram, I found that I was not alone in receiving such bad service at this establishment. There was a complete lack of ownership on their part, in regards to all of the following issues I had to put up with:

1) For two different items I ordered (the salmon poke and the soba tsukemen that said a little spicy), I asked if both were very spicy and the exact spiciness level, and I was told these were both NOT spicy at all. It turned out to be EXTREMELY spicy, and he did not even say anything and just dropped the dish off at the far side of the table. 

2) The same waiter kept coming back to our table literally every 15 secs when we said we needed a few more mins to look over the menu; and he looked impatient and wanted to rush us to order (the restaurant was nearly empty with just 2 other small tables). 

3) I started by ordering additional side dishes to add-on to the main Ramen/noodle combos, and he immediately interrupted and quipped that each person must order their own entree as if to suggest we were being cheap and would be ordering only one item to share, when we didn&#39;t even finish listing our orders yet. 

4) I started complaining to my bf, and the waiter must&#39;ve overheard, and even started trash talking about us (loud enough for me to hear) to the rest of the kitchen staff. I was appalled and bewildered by this terrible service. Instead of taking ownership for his horrendous attitude, he just left the hostess to serve us for the rest of the time, without saying anything else. 

Nowadays, in this industry, customer experience is everything and service is an attitude of the heart. Despite looking like a cozy, traditional Japanese restaurant full of zen, it definitely did not have any &#34;heart&#34; or impart these important traditional or cultural values on its patrons.

They definitely need to step up their service, or this establishment will really get run into the ground by their horrible wait staff."

I&#39;m really here for the food. One star for the lazy bland food , weak cocktails, and sloooow and silent angry service. Really the service totally sucks here! I have been 4-5 times over the past 8 or so years. Always with friends that really enjoyed the &#34;country style&#34; Japanese food here back in the day. But for me it always is bland bland bland and I love Japanese food for FLAVOR.  This is crappy, lazy, bland food. They give Japanese food a band name. Friends from Japan that came with us thought everything they tried was awful. Not authentic as the chef may claim. 

The chefs really want you to eat the food their way but sheesh... I would just to be polite if you invited me to your house for dinner but when I have to pay for my meal, I prefer to enjoy it. Or at the very least speak my mind when it sucks!

All the staff I have encountered were always grumpy and seem annoyed that you are even there. No hello, no smiles, no information when they deliver the sides to the table and no water refills. Maybe they just hate their jobs because they avoid the unhappy customers and unhappy chefs.

If you dig bland food and crappy service this is your spot! If your looking for flavor, plan to order takeout elsewhere on your way home. I bet you even will get a thank you.

Our group all came to the same conclusion.... We will never be back."

I will say although the food is very well made it is not what everyone hypes it up to be. Not sure if it&#39;s because I&#39;m Asian and everyone thought I would just love eating ramen but this place was way over hyped when it comes to the actual food. To break it down the ramen it was phenomenal sadly it was the broth that really killed it, the broth tasted like water mixed with a hint of soy sauce, bland is putting it lightly. All Asians know it&#39;s that broth that makes the dish.

On the other hand the atmosphere is of another world, the moment you step inside it is as if you were to go back in time to 1800 Japan and walk into a pub.  The outside patio is simply breath taking and truly is one of the best patios in all of Denver.

Overall this place is very nice however if you&#39;re looking for some mouthwatering food, I would recommend looking elsewhere."

BEST authentic Japanese style ramen I&#39;ve ever had. The broth is amazing -- and the chicken is the most tender chicken I&#39;ve ever had.. I almost questioned if it was undercooked because it was so tender -- but it was just very well cooked, perfectly cooked chicken. Noodles have great texture.

Service is OK.. standard but nothing special, minus 1 star

Ambiance: 5 stars. Amazing! I love their Japanese garden in the backyard. The whole restaurant looks so authentic. I love the tables, I love all the décor.. it feels like you&#39;re in Japan.. not Denver! They have an actual Dojo here too.. looks like they hold some self defense classes.

We sat there for 30 minutes before having to get up and ask to have somebody take our order. Then the kid took our order and was a jackass and seemed like it was a large hassle for him to write our orders down on a post it note. Drinks and food came out in decent time so there is 1 of my 2 stars. As we were sitting there we noticed everybody that showed up got a warm greeting when we were seated in silence. Food was not much different than a $9 dish I could get somewhere else. We finished our meal and asked for a box for one of the dishes and had to ask a second time after seeing three other tables get their items boxed up and tied in a bag to take home. When we did get our box it was handed to us and they walked away.

I was pushing for a repeat visit to Sakura House, but as one of my friends had been to Domo and raved about it, we decided on that.  

What other reviews have noted is indeed fact; the instant you set foot in the restaurant, you are asked about any dietary restrictions. Initially, I thought maybe this was a conscientious way for the restaurant to cater to their customers&#39; requirements, but I later discovered that food allergies and or restrictions are not really catered to at Domo. If there is something you cannot or will not eat, you are not welcome at Domo.

Okie dokie.

The restaurant itself is lovely, and a vast departure from other traditional Japanese spots.  When a party enters, the chefs greet everyone with their standard &#34;Irasshaimase!&#34; which means &#34;welcome!&#34; in Japanese.  The tables are heavy and rustic wood, and the &#34;chairs&#34; are basically tree stumps.

The staff are courteous, but not overly warm, and certainly not accommodating to the tastes of Americans. and will state as much.

All three of us ordered the Dashi Shoyu Ramen, I got the pork and my friends got the chicken. 

The ramen bowls are huge, and are served with small plates of nibbles such as beans, bamboo shoots, etc.  My friend requested no egg in her soup, but I really wanted my egg, and was somewhat yucked out when it turned out to be a fried egg, not hard- or soft-boiled. It was completely rubberized, and inedible.

The broth was absolutely lovely, the meat was tender and the noodles were perfection.

I respect when any chef stands behind his dishes to the point that he wants them consumed in the manner prepared, but I still feel that salt and pepper should be provided when requested.   I did not want nor need either, but they should not be ILLEGAL.

Since we were running rather late to get back to the office, we didn&#39;t explore the garden or the museum.

Overall it was a very nice lunch, but the attitude left me with no desire to return."

I remembered that the initial wait to get seated on the patio took at least 45 min (having gone on a Friday; and on a Monday this most recent time).

The hostess was unfriendly.  She started out by asking if anyone had dietary or allergy restrictions.  Before we could even answer, she said &#34;we can&#39;t accommodate any of that.&#34;  By the time we got seated outside, it took 20 min for anyone to take our order.  They would not give us extra soy sauce, telling us &#34;what we gave you is all you need.&#34;  What??

We had a group of 6 and everyone had the same complaint about the food - everything tastes like fish.  Everything!  The pork that came in my soba noodle broth was discolored and full of fat.  I was so hungry and it was dark enough that I pretended I didn&#39;t see it so I could at least get something in my stomach.  

The service was terrible throughout the meal.  Until it was time for the check- then they were on the ball.  To top it off, this is the strange pamphlet they give you when you pay.

Save yourself the $$ and go somewhere else."

Bottomline: duh, it doesn&#39;t. 

Here in realistic expectations land, though, Domo&#39;s food is delicious and I have not been disappointed once by the taste or quality given the price. Besides, they have an absolutely GORGEOUS garden. If you get a chance to eat outside, absolutely take it! Peruse the garden, the museum and the impressive roster of charity works by the founder and Dojo master. Domo is a pretty unique experience that goes a little beyond just being a restaurant. Its great for a date or group get together. The country style small plates are tasty, and the spicy maguro mini donburi was suuuper good, too.

We enjoyed our noodle dishes and my table mates thought the pot stickers were the best they had ever had; not sure if I agree, but they were good. Noodles, to me, are a lunch thing, not for dinner, and if I had to do it again, I would choose a more traditional plate, like the pork katsu with curry sauce. 

Domo is also the Japanese version of the Soup Nazi, in their attitude toward condiments. I don&#39;t think that having no soy sauce available is authentic Japanese restaurant culture; I felt that we were on the verge of &#34;no soup for you!&#34; just for asking. My table mate was the George  character, and I was Jerry, telling him not to do it. But we survived.

Another weak spot is that there are about four or five menus, each with their own food group and format: one for beverages, one or more for noodles, one for meat cutlets, one for sushi, etc. As first timers, it was a challenge to figure out which style of meal we wanted, and then how to choose within that group. In other words, it was a hot mess and they could use a restaurant consultant to combine and simplify the format. 

One final note is that the service is not refined at all. Our server had to ask use what we ordered as she brought the food to the table, but of course we couldn&#39;t really answer because the names were Japanese. That added an unnecessary level of stress to that part of the meal service. They don&#39;t serve dessert or cocktails, so you basically march to their drummer, then leave (after taking a walk through the museum and grounds, which were very nice). I have to commend one of the servers for keeping our water mugs filled, but whoever thought of tin or aluminum or whatever that is as a water vessel probably thought it was trendy but it makes my teeth go haywire.

We want to go back sometime, and we will bring our own soy sauce and forks, and hopefully they won&#39;t make an issue of it."

The lighting is low and the ambiance is charming. Loved the decor!! We ate in the Japanese garden which was well manicured and very quaint. I was a little overwhelmed with the menu and it was my first time eating there so I just ordered some spicy ramen. Big bowl of pipping hot ramen. Delicious flavor. Love this place and I can&#39;t wait to try the rest of the menu. Their ramen must hit the spot on cold winter nights.

I&#39;m accustom to a short to long wait (depending on the day and time of visit) but have always been treated very well and received great service. Today the hostess was extremely rude and lied to our faces. When asked if we preferred to sit inside or outside, my wife and both responded &#34;outside.&#34; The hostess said &#34;there are no tables available outside&#34; and proceeded to sit us inside in the empty dining room, at the worst table, facing the wall. This despite the fact there were four tables available on the patio; furthermore, the couple that was seated immediately after us were seated on the patio. No patrons left between the time we were seated and the couple after us, dismissing my original thought that they didn&#39;t have enough staff to service all the tables on the patio. 

With service being such an important part of the dining experience, Domo is no longer an establishment I wish to frequent."

Raman at sushi den can be same or better. It&#39;s for Caucasians in Denver for attractions, but not necessary for authentic taste. I had better Raman at Tokyo airport then here, but for Denver probably not bad. If you read all the positive reviews it&#39;s not from Asians. Wonder why? Most Asians had good Raman taste in Asia and other states butter much less price. Family of 4 for Raman dinner for $87 with 1 beer is kind of stiff. Raman suppose to be cheap fast food in Asia, but not here at Dino. We could have steak for equivalent price for the family. Raman net cost is much cheaper then steak."

Food: The food was fantastic, and there&#39;s a great variety to choose from. I got Ramen and was not disappointed (though I was full)! The sake collection is decent, though not particularly impressive. (We got the unfilitered and found it a little underwhelming).

Decor: As a lot of people mentioned, the decor is rustic Japanese and the restaurant has a small museum attached (which is pretty cool). There is an indoor and outdoor seating option, and during summer months, I imagine the outside is pretty fantastic.

Service: Friendly without being overbearing, nothing to write home about, and nothing bad.  A little slow when they are busy, which seems to be most of the time."

Where do I start?

This restaurant REQUIRES each person to order an entrée. 

So I went here for my grandmother&#39;s birthday with a party of six. We ordered 3 appetizers and when it was time to order my boyfriend and I wanted to share an entrée as we were just not hungry enough for a big bowl of food each. The waitress told us we HAD to order one each yet she let my mom and grandmother share one. Hmmm. Ok?

I got the salmon over rice with the chilli sauce. It was good yet nothing grand. My boyfriend got the eel over rice and I swear I&#39;ve had better eel. There truly wasn&#39;t anything special about the eel. Don&#39;t get it.

I was disappointed. Given these meals were $20+, I expected more. 

To make matters worse, we literally had to SHOO AWAY FLIES THE WHOLE MEAL. FLIES WERE EVERYWHERE!! It completely ruined the dining experience. 

The service was horriblw. My goodness. How do u people hire ur servers? The lady who served me my meal nearly knocked my water over. When I asked for a to go box it took them so long to bring it. Also, for a $130 meal my leftovers should be boxed for me.

Sure the ambience is great but you experience it for a price - flies on your ridiculously expensive and mediocre meal.

Overpriced.
Swarm of flies.
Bad service.

Again, I wouldn&#39;t be going back."

I came here at around 7 on a Tuesday and it was not busy to the point where you had to wait but the tables were filled up. There is a karate school conjoined to the building so you must remember to go through the left side in order to find the entrance to the restaurant.

I really like the ambiance of the place because you&#39;re eating in what feels like a Japanese garden. The place is also darkly lit but nothing anyone can handle.

I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen with pork and it was quite flavorful. You also get little Japanese tapas before your meal and the portion size of the ramen... Was definitely made for someone with an appetite of a beast. You get what you pay for I suppose!

Also, the service. Not too bad. As you walk in the chefs are notified of your presence and they chorus in Japanese a warming &#34;hello&#34;, or at least what I believe them to be saying. Food came out in an orderly manner and the waitress was also helpful in terms of questions we had about the menu.

You&#39;ll probably be overwhelmed with the selection, between all the different noodle bowls (regular ramen, udon, or soba;  different broths; different preparations) rice bowls (donburri) and the sushi and the... I can&#39;t even remember. 

Twice now, I&#39;ve come here with a craving for ramen. Twice now, i&#39;ve rolled out all fat, happy, and satisfied. 

Lunch today was for a UYE. Along with eight other yelpers, I feasted. Three delicious side dishes (seaweed salad with sesame oil, a fish cake, and bamboo), and a huge bowl of ramen, with seaweed, pork, more bamboo, and the poached egg (extra $1). BTW, I got the spicy miso broth. I could not finish all the noodles, even though I really wanted to also get a side of a mini-donburri bowl. Total: $11.

It was a warm day and we stepped inside and immediately I noticed there was no AC. They don&#39;t take reservations, so we waited 20 minutes to be seated, which I didn&#39;t mind, but it was pretty stuffy in there. 

The lady who was the hostess just wasn&#39;t terribly friendly. We asked to sit outside since it was so hot inside. The gardens were pretty and serene. Unfortunately our meal was besieged with flies. We spent a good deal of time chasing them off the food. I had the beef sukiyaki noodles and my wife had the miso spicy pork ramen. My noodles were good. They brought several side dishes some of them were good, some I could have done without. 19 dollars I thought was steep for a bowl of noodles. Granted, the bowl was quite large. 

We couldn&#39;t finish our large bowl of noodles, so we were waiting for a server to box them up for us. The front desk lady set the bill on our table without even asking us if we were done. We asked to have the food boxed up, and she brought us Styrofoam containers and left them on the table. We tried to put them in the containers, but managed to dump a large portion on the table. Call me picky but for a dinner for two for 50 bucks, I would like to have someone box our leftovers for us. 

I was disappointed as I was expecting a great deal more. We much more enjoyed Osaka ramen downtown."

However, while the food is healthy the flavored are bland, very basic. We asked for soy I sauce but were told by our waiter that no condiments are allowed by the chef.

One very positive thing to consider is the generous nature of the ownership. They donate and help through work, by helping others less disadvantaged living locally and in places internationally"

I must say I can only comment on the wanko sushi menu because it&#39;s that good and whenever I go back I just can&#39;t get myself to order anything else!

Whenever I&#39;m out for sushi my typical go-tos are hamachi or any kind of tuna and any part of it really.  At Domo, you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of the fish options with the smelt roe/Japanese mayo or spiced avocado.  They&#39;re amazing!  And the small side dishes are a great complement to the meal.  With the decor and ambiance, it totally reminded me of eating at a similar venue in Japan!

The service was great! They&#39;re so thoughtful.  My friend didn&#39;t have a jacket and after we said we wanted to sit outside, my friend was asked if he had one available due to the dropping temperatures to ensure his comfort during our meal.  Also, when the hostess saw that I had a pretty big bag, she brought a round mat and put it on the ground next to my chair so that I wouldn&#39;t have to put my bag on the rocks! So sweet!

Never thought I would find a place like this in Denver.  So glad I did and I&#39;ll definitely be back during my next visit!"

My friends used to talk about this place all the time and what really won me over was the ambiance and decor. The ramen is really just average and even maybe below average. I had ramen both times I went and tried two different kinds and none left me satisfied when I left. The portions are huge though, but with that, if you don&#39;t eat fast enough, your noodles get too soggy. Both times I had a mini donburi accompanied with my meals, both times, different types of fish and both times I ended up not really eating it.

I do enjoy the lovely Japanese garden in the back and that they give traditional Japanese side dishes. It&#39;s a great cultural experience for those looking for one. I think next time I go, it will determine if I ever go again and maybe this time I&#39;ll opt for sushi or a meaty rice bowl. Maybe even curry."

Ordered/Ate outside in the garden. Beautiful but wicked hot... like seriously hawt. Choose your seats wisely. They do have sun hats to wear just in case. 
I had no idea how/what to order: so I asked the server to surprise me - OhMyDam. Pork ankake ramen. Just typing it makes my mouth water. I will name something in my immediate family after that dish (dog/fish/house/missus) it was that good. I sooo meant to take a photo but couldn&#39;t (too hawt!). Ramen, broth, meat, veggies.

It&#39;s a small museum that serves a wide variety of traditional Japanese cuisine and boasts a generous sake selection.

Eating food while sitting on a tree stump stool is not the most comfortable, but the food is worth it.  Their shumai is delicious and a great starter.  I ate two orders by myself.  For the meal, I decided to do the 3-course wanko sushi.  I chose masago ebi, tamari hamachi, and wasabi tako.  They each come on their own little dish with rice.  It also comes with a bunch of side dishes. Everything is well seasoned so you won&#39;t need any additional seasonings.  If you ask, you&#39;re not going to get any and everyone in the kitchen will laugh at you and call you baka!  Just kidding about the last part.  Maybe.

Seemed legit....However, yesterday&#39;s lunch will absolutely be my last time here. It was my going away party for work and we made reservations. We all arrived and were seated by a hostess with the mostess. She didn&#39;t welcome us, and outright told us to consider another restaurant if we have vegetarians or food allergies. We didn&#39;t have either,  but one member of our crew has a heart issue and can&#39;t have too much salt, we asked if there was anything on their menu that was low in sodium but she emphasized that &#34;we are very welcome to eat somewhere else&#34; .... so that was fun.  She scolded us a few more times about moving tables and generally made a happy event, one that became awkward, uncomfortable  and frustrating. She even isolated the person who made the reservation and said &#34;I told you&#34; and embarrassingly reprimanded him in front of our whole group. Food tasted fine, but it really wasn&#39;t worth the scolding... I&#39;m sorry, we aren&#39;t 4 years old, we&#39;re paying customers.

The front desk lady was not friendly, and scolded us for moving from one table over to another (next to each other outside because it was more shaded and there were bees by where I was sitting- and I am highly allergic!).  Sure ok, we should have told you but the table was open.  And she could have done it in a nicer manner and not that way to my guest who visited for the first time.

We order tempura which is &#34;deep fried&#34; for the kid but the food came out with wet eggs on top... Not what we expected.  We asked the waiter before we order what type of veggies will be deep fried and he never came back to us with the answer.  We sent the food back because the kid won&#39;t eat it, we didn&#39;t expect it to be free or anything, (which it wasn&#39;t, they didn&#39;t take it off or discounted it), but maybe someone to say oh sorry for the misunderstanding, instead they told us we should have read the description, ummm we did!

We had just come from visiting Red Rocks in the morning and seeing the Cartier exhibit so I was cold and hungry. We went by Uncle which was crowded and then headed to Domo. Domo was also crowded with a 40 minute wait, but I think it was totally worth it (although I never went to Uncle and only saw it from the outside).

(1) Parking - tons and tons of parking - just like Texas :)
(2) Domo is straight up pretty with the interior design and the back patio zen garden. We visited on December 27 so it was cold and covered with snow, but it looked really pretty.
(3) We get food and little sample plates - similar to eating at a Korean restaurant.
(4) Great history. Apparently, the owner teaches a form of martial arts and people travel all over to learn from him - how cool is that?! Super cool.

And, the entrees were pretty tasty too!

I got the spicy miso soup ramen with the unagi terriyaki don combination. I also got a matcha green tea with soy bean milk (homemade). Everything I ate/drank was the best!!! Ramen broth was very tasty (spicy but not too so I can keep eating). The Unagi don was a great compliment but keep in mind it is a small bowl like the size of your palm. Compared to Houston, I think the experience was much better with all of the history and the ambiance. I think the soup broth was better, but the noodles were alright. I enjoyed the small dishes that accompanied our meal. 

The only thing I would suggest is to add an egg in the ramen which is usually included without extra charge in Houston. Service was great and food came out quickly -- we stayed super late and I could tell they were annoyed, but still very polite."

After studying it for about 8 minutes I still could not figure out how it works. Time to stall so I ordered a chai tea. Grass, it tastes like grass. And it&#39;s orange. It&#39;s like orange grass. 

After getting some ordering help from the super kind waitress, the order was underway. We had a table of 8 and were told we couldn&#39;t split the check. No problem. Then 2 from our party were asked to leave because they weren&#39;t ordering an entree. It was a friends birthday and they are already. This is starting to go down hill. 

Round 1 comes family style. Nothing was memorable. Round 2 comes. Sashimi was great. The ramen was not. The noodles tasted like they were from a pack and the broth flavor was a let down. Across the board a let down. At this point I&#39;m getting thumbs down from everyone for picking out the place.

As an obsessive ramen eater, Domo has made my top 3 favorite ramen places in Denver. 

Their clear broth is bursting with flavor and umami and their noodles are always excellent. 

Sadly the restaurant is a bit rigid in their &#39;policies&#39;  towards vegetarians. They serve side dishes with all meals. The side dishes contain meat and they are unwilling to substitute or even not serve the dishes.

I ordered a ramen with vegetables but asked to have them hold the meat side dishes. I didn&#39;t really care if they served me something as an alternative I just didn&#39;t want the meat. The waitress said she couldn&#39;t make an exception and plopped down the meat dish in front of me anyway. 

A message to Domo ownership: Denver has a large and growing vegetarian population. Whether you like it or not you&#39;re going to attract vegetarians with your outstanding broths. A less hostile attitude towards vegetarians would go a long way."

The atmosphere is pretty cool and calming, the portions are huge. This place is best to go with multiple people because of all the small plates they give you. The gentleman at the host stand was really nice and friendly. My sever wasn&#39;t very helpful or friendly. 

I would totally go back and I just recommended others visit next week during their trip to Denver."

BUT, once you walk through the pretty and authentic entrance, you feel like you have been transported to Japan.  The decor is perfectly authentic like old Samurai days.
Indoor seating looked nice, but if the weather is nice, by all means, sit outside in the beautiful garden!!
The soothing sound of the small waterfall and ponds with overgrown beautiful trees!  The table umbrellas look like large Japanese paper umbrellas.  The ground is gravel like a real Japanese garden.  So peaceful.
Next, the service is wonderful and the food is amazing!!!  I had such a tough time deciding on what to order!  I wanted almost every menu item!!
The hot ramen looked great, but since it was on the warm side outside, I opted for the cold soba noodles!  Excellent and beautiful presentation!  First, they served me 7 small dishes of tasty nibbles.  I&#39;m a light eater and that could have easily been my meal.  My soba came with a choice of a small side bowl--lots of options.  I chose the vegetable curry on rice.
Oh my gosh....I enjoyed it sooo much!!  The beautiful, serene atmosphere, attentive service and delicious dinner!!  I was so happy!!  I had a glass of wine and a refreshing ginger tea as well.  No complaints whatsoever!  
I highly recommend DŌMO!  Look forward to going back!!!"

Decided to go yesterday for the first time. The outside of Domo looked very exciting and we were eager to try the food! 

When we walked in the first thing the hostess said (without greeting us or anything) was &#34;Is she a vegetarian&#34; pointing to my friend. We thought that was odd and were caught off guard. She is indeed a vegetarian and stated as such. The lady told us they do not accommodate strict vegetarians and had a sign explaining so. 

I was confused because I had reviewed the menu before going and there were many vegetarian dishes on the menu. I asked if they could make her stir fry with vegetables or a salad? And she said no. She continued to put her fingers in an &#34;X&#34; and shake them at us multiple times. Which was extremely rude and disrespectful. 

It was clear they did not want our business and we were forced to leave. 

This was completely unexpected.  #1, Japanese food is known for being vegetarian friendly so the fact that they weren&#39;t was more than confusing.  2nd, the broth was veggie based with pork and beef added to it. Why the cook couldn&#39;t cook vegetarian broth was beyond me? #3, taking the time to create a notice and bother customers as they walked in seems like more than a  hassle and bad customer service.

Why couldn&#39;t Domo just accommodate the vegetarian customers? Seems like they aren&#39;t in the business of making money and would rather discriminate against those who eat meat. 

Our whole party agreed that we felt like we were in a black/white segregation instead of trying to have a nice meal.

Would not go back. 

Warn your vegetarian friends!"

Everything from the wonderful Japanese Garden to the atmosphere and most importantly their food- I always leave feeling very satisfied. 

I will mention right away that coming to Domo during lunch is much less of a dent on your wallet then coming during Dinner. That being said lunch at Domo usually runs about $14/person. 

I have a couple faves: 
-Sansai Udon. Talk about a mountain of veggies piled on top of a good portion of slippery firm udon noodles soaked in the perfect dashi shoyu broth (soy sauce based broth). It&#39;s to die for. I love all the sides it typically comes with as well! 
-Spicy Maguro Don. If you&#39;re not feeling ramen and want something on a bed a rice you can&#39;t go wrong with this. Any fan of the Spicy Tuna Roll would be crazy not to get this. Image a bed of sticky rice with slices of spicy tuna and seaweed piled on top... There ya have it! Comes with a side of miso and a couple side dishes! 

If you&#39;re coming in the summer I must emphasize making an effort to try to get a table outside in the garden. It&#39;s incredible and if you&#39;re concerned about too much sun don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll even provide rice hat ;)"

After two appetizers and seven small plates of chefs choice that comes with the meal and the main, it was a ton of food.  The calamari is not fried so if you are expecting the frozen fried garbage, no, this is not a chain restaurant.  The calamari is pan cooked and fantastic.  Edamame was served cold with sea salt and was great too.  The seven small plates was so much food at once that all i remember was liking the fish cakes and the a pork dish.  My main was the pork curry ramen which came with a side of your choice, i had red tuna sashimi and it was all perfection.  Some reviews complained about no soy sauce and wasabi being offered and typically I find this pretentious but this chef nailed it and I like big flavors.  Interior is very cool.

The ambiance and decor is beautiful, but that&#39;s where the good experience stops. Our party of 4 wanted to move to a table for 4, and one waitress said that was OK. Another waitress came along and said a party after us was waiting for that table, so we had to go back to our original table (where we were cramped in one corner and unable to have a conversation). We saw a second table leave shortly after, so we asked to move there. The waitresses said alright, but a waiter comes along and says in an exasperated way that if we move again, we can&#39;t move anymore after that. We were appalled that he&#39;d take that tone with us considering it was not our fault that we were shunted from one table to another, and considering the exorbitant prices at this place. There is absolutely no reason to be rude to paying customers. 

Secondly, the food here is pathetic. There is nothing remotely delicious about it. The side dishes were edible but cold. Two of us ordered shoyu pork ramen, which was a disgrace to traditional Japanese fare. The broth tasted like seafood, nobody had any idea why. The teriyaki beef donburi I had was just awful. To top it off, they do not have any chilli powder or chili oil in store, so we didn&#39;t have any way to make the bland and tasteless food palatable. It was a huge disappointment as we were wanting warm ramen after a long day out. Would not eat here even if it was free. Oh well, you live, you learn. Just wish it wasn&#39;t such an expensive mistake. 

Btw, I gave this place 0 stars, but yelp insists I have to choose a star rating, so 1 star it is."

While visiting my brother, three of us stopped here for grub on a rainy day. We were seated after 20 minutes l, which isn&#39;t bad being from the Bay Area. 

We ordered the following:
- Sencha tea
- oolong tea
- Thai iced tea
- Garlic salt edamame
- Shrimp Shumai
- Chicken Gyoza
- Spicy Chicken Miso Ramen 
- Veggie Dashi Shoyu Ramen
- Pork Dashi Shoyu Ramen

Overall, I was not wowed food wise. The broth was too clear and not hearty enough for my taste. There wasn&#39;t my all time favorite soft boiled egg included. The Thai iced tea wasn&#39;t very sweet. There was NO spice to the spicy miso. 

The country sides were not described at ALL. It would have been nice to know what I was eating.

3 stars just for the decor, gardens, and little museum."

First, there&#39;s no hostess. We waited 25 minutes before being acknowledged and another 10 minutes to be seated. 

The guy who sat us was rude. Our server looked miserable, young and extremely unhappy being here.

I&#39;m giving DOMO 1 star just for their chicken dumplings. 

The shrimp dumplings were gross.

2 of us got the chicken ramen- average, nothing special.

And the others got the chicken udon and let&#39;s just say everyone took 2 bites of their food and let the rest go to waste.

A- because the service was awful, they really don&#39;t care about their customers.

And B- the food wasn&#39;t even hot.

Don&#39;t waste your time coming to this dump, it&#39;s weird on the outside it looks like a warehouse in a weird location. Service is the worse ever, everyone here is rude and unhappy. Not accommodating at all. Not even to our child, we simply asked them to warm their tofu. Is it really that much to ask for? Instead- they say &#34; it&#39;s not going to happen, just eat it&#34;.

When the staff arrived, he looked noticeably annoyed and was unpleasant, rather than an apology and a smile. Although I ordered my own dish, a friend hoped to share a main dish, which is not allowed. Yet again, this was rudely presented, rather than a friendly reminder about every attendee being required to order an entree.

The food was quite tasty, but did not make up for the lack of service that we experienced. I do not plan to come back."

Domo does a disservice to that reputation. The staff, specially and sadly the Japanese staff is rude beyond believe. I have been here several time because I love (should I say loved?) their back garden and some of the food. A few days ago I took a friend that was visiting town to have lunch here. We were &#34;greeted&#34; by an older  lady that warned us that if we had any food allergies or intolerances this was not the right place for us. They she walked us to a table outside and said &#34;choose the table right because I am not going to switch you later to another table if you change your mind&#34;. We perhaps should&#39;ve answered &#34;yes, siiiiiir!&#34;. While we walked through the dining room there were several restaurant policies posted on the walls...child behavior policy, no soy sauce on the table policy, no food substitutions policy, tips, do not eat the grapes, do not smoke, no checks...you got it, policy. &#34;Domo&#34; means &#34;thanks&#34; or  &#34;nice to meet you&#34;...but with all those rules and verbal and written warnings you frankly don&#39;t feel much of a warm welcome. The atmosphere outside is nice in the spring and the summer but I feel that the garden  and the museum have been neglected for quite sometime. The Koi pond that used to be clear and beautiful is now murky and gray. The poor Koi are swimming in that forgotten water which is a sad sight. Our servers, two young gentlemen, were actually quite nice and accommodating. The menu layout is complete madness. There is a menu, a submenu, menu additions, menu specials. They should teach a crash class before seating you on how to read this mess. The second that our food arrived we got surrounded by lots and lots of flies. We had to cover the food and our teas with our napkins. These must be super flies because they even bite us which for me it was a first time. The food was bland and way,way too sweet. They are particular about not serving soy sauce because it&#39;s not in the country Japanese tradition but they serve wilted greens with a raspberry with the Unagi Don, which is even less traditional. The Gattsuri Pork, the lunch special, was described as sliced pork and garlic with scallions and onions sautéed with a tomato chili taste. It was nothing like that. It was a barely lukewarm bowl of thin slices of tasteless and slimy pork with what seemed like eel glaze on top. Not good. We left it almost untouched. Also, I am aware that the country side dishes are small but there was barely anything on them...like they had run out of all the sides. This place is still very special and unique and there are lovely touches like hats, paper fans, a basket to place your purse,etc., and I would like for it to remain as a staple in Denver but for that to happen they need to start paying attention to the small details, specially with so many other options for lunch and dinner."

That&#39;s the fun part. The food here is just not very good. I had a taste of curry for the rest of my afternoon even though I got shoyu ramen. The ramen was overcooked and the broth was salty and meh. This is not the rendition of the food I grew up with in Japan. It&#39;s really a shame since if the food was decent then this place could be a great destination. I&#39;m also afraid people who try Japanese food for the first time here may think Japanese food is pretty mediocre. The other gripe I have is that they also don&#39;t answer their phone. I left two messages and no return calls. Restaurants that feel they&#39;re above phone calls need to re-evaluate their staffing or policies. They get away with all this because the facilities are pretty unique for Denver. If this place was in LA or NY they would not have a business.

I wanted to love Domo - really I did. This is my second time here and honestly, it&#39;s just not doing it for me. The atmosphere, while certainly unique and charming is showing it&#39;s wear and the seating is incredibly uncomfortable.

The food was average rustic traditional Japanese fare but at $17.50 for a bowl of ramen it&#39;s certainly not worth the money.

What really stood out was the service (or lack thereof). Our drink order was misplaced, no changes were allowed even when needing to accommodate a seafood allergy and when our food was finally delivered it was dropped off at the wrong table. This was only noticed after the patron in that seat had already begun eating it. The waitress that had been dropping the ball never returned and ever apologized which was even more disappointing.

Good Japanese is hard to find in Denver and while at one time Domo may have led the pack, those days are regrettably long gone.

Uncle will still top my list."

We were seated in the garden area, it took nearly 20 minutes for someone to take our food order - this was after we&#39;d ordered drinks and they came rather promptly.  We ate, we were asked how the meal was towards the end of our eating, then proceeded to sit there for another 20 minutes before receiving the check (which was dropped off without a word by an older woman)...  We weren&#39;t asked if we wanted boxes, which we clearly appeared to need.  Then waited ANOTHER 30 minutes before our check was even picked up by none other than the nice girl refilling water.

I have always had a fixation on Japanese architecture and art, and when I walked in, it was what I imagined sitting in a little country place there would be like. There were lots of authentic things on the walls, and we sat at thick, stone tables on tree stump stools. The entire atmosphere immediately made me feel like I was about to experience something real and not some sad attempt at authenticity. 
I had the pleasure of dining with my husband and 7 other Yelp friends, a lot of whom had tried Domo before and had recommended it highly. After being very confused about what was different about each noodle dish and what I should try, I decided to just pick something and be adventurous. I picked the Sukiyaki Beef Shoyu Ramen with a mini donburi of Unagi Teriyaki. I also had some very good ginger tea. 
The food came out steaming hot on trays for each person, with a giant bowl of ramen along with 3 small country side dishes. It was so pretty that I had a moment of not wanting to disturb it, but of course I had come here to eat! My first bite of the ramen with the beef and broth had me going &#34;oh yeh, this is the stuff&#34;. The teriyaki unagi was the best I&#39;ve ever had, because the teriyaki itself was so tasty, and the unagi was just melt-in-your-mouth butter-like. Also, the food was seasoned PERFECTLY; no need for sides of soy or salt or anything else. All over the table, there were satisfied noodle slurps and comments about the differing ramen bowls and the sides. I think each one of us left happy and full. 
I enjoyed the small &#34;museum&#34; they have, showcasing gorgeous sake bowls and other authentic items. I can&#39;t wait to visit again, this time during dinner, so that I can try the wanko sushi. Overall, the amount and quality of food, as well as the atmosphere and experience, make me want to go back already."

And this is only the second time I&#39;ve been there.  I suppose I should be happy, it&#39;s a *destination* restaurant, not some place to go time and time again.  But honestly - $17.50 for a bowl of ramen?  Three times the price at Kokoro and not twice as good.  Admittedly the ambiance is nice, but the stools you sit on, no long meals here.  We had six people - and they charged an 18% gratuity - for slow service.  18% on top of the amount with TAX included, which is really nearly a 20% gratuity.  I asked, and they said &#34;that&#39;s the way we always do it&#34;.  C&#39;mon - if the gratuity is included, it should be on the amount BEFORE tax, not AFTER tax.

We ordered a steak burrito and chicken salad bowl.   By decent I mean the meat seasoning was good but the meat was not hot it was lukewarm.  The restaurant should throw the meat on the grill before serving it, so that way the cheese at least melts.  Lastly, the burrito completely busted and fell apart after one bite. It was more of a burrito ball or square, instead of the usual rounded rectangle shape.  I am sure this can be fixed easily by using less rice and beans and more meat.  The amount of rice and beans this restaurant puts on burritos is excessive.  
Er oh and the restaurant appeared to be clean and we&#39;ll kept although I forgot to look for the sanitation grade.  In summation,  I may try this again under one condition.... the cook would have to put my meat on the grill so it is served hot.  But even so I definitely would not go out of my way for a taste."

I had a horrible experience there a few weeks ago. The lady I had take my order (Or didn&#39;t) couldn&#39;t speak English. Now, before everyone get their panties in a bunch let me explain. 

I wanted a quesadila and a burrito. This lady didn&#39;t understand a word I was saying and kept speaking to me in Spanish and I don&#39;t speak Spanish. She was getting my order all wrong and I was trying to kindly explain to her that she was making it incorrectly and I wanted something completely different than what she was putting together. After about 3 times she messed it up, I started to get flustered because I have zero clue what shes saying to me and I&#39;m insanely hungry at this point. It&#39;s also been a good 5-7 mins since she started taking my order. 

So a guy comes over to us- who I assume is a manager, and I explain to him whats happening and that I cannot understand what shes saying to me/ we have a communication barrier. He looks visibly annoyed at me and says this gem, &#34;THAT&#39;S WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU!!!&#34;. Whoa dude. Its not my fault I don&#39;t speak 2 languages ok???? I was disgusted by his behavior and I was speechless. He then proceeded to (literally) throw my food together and storm off. 

I think he could have handled it wayyyyyyy better and I will not be going back here. Why would I want to be treated like crap from some one I&#39;m paying to do something I can do myself???"

Especially if you are talking about fast food.  But Chipotle really does break the stereotype and this is one of my go to places for a tasty yet health conscious choice for lunch.  It just so happened that the Chipotle in the Havana Gardens area of Aurora is a very convenient choice.  Although very busy, this place has decent parking, easy accessibility and nice big windows where you can sit and enjoy your meal while watching the busy Havana traffic drive by.   I think the fact that I had a day off and no where in particular to go made my food taste even better.  Today I had a sofritos taco.  
Sofritos is a tofu they now serve as a veggie option.   Had a chipotle flavor added to it and I doubt you could tell you were not eating meet.  Not bad for you at all.  Of course you will definitely tell later on when you feel so much better, but now I&#39;m starting to preach so I&#39;ll stop here."

Been craving a burger as usual and decided to check this place out. Plenty of metered parking around the area.

The dining area is spacious and from the looks of it tons of other family with kids come to dine here as well. 

Now if you are looking for a basic burger, don&#39;t come here. The burger selections are gut busting, stroke inducing, and the definition of a &#34;gourmet burger&#34;. Think fried bacon as a topping of choice. 

I ended up getting the patty melt with tater tots. And Jesus. It was juicy, buttery, and gooey. Delicious. I honestly could have eaten just half of it and been full but I decided to indulge and ate the whole darn thing.

After we placed our food order, our server came over and notified us that the electricity had gone out and that they were working on it. 

We decided to wait and see. Time came and went a bit but as they started to nearly be turned away we got our order!

The wings were small but the sauce was tasty. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids and the regular hand cut fries. The burger was cooked to my liking albeit a little challenging to eat, even when cut in half. Had hoped for something a little spicier as the burger had three strips of jalapeño bacon on it. While I fully expected to be wowed, I was a little bit underwhelmed by the burger experience as it was hard to discern any one flavor. In short, it was a lot all at once. Next time I will probably order something a little simpler. 

The fries were fresh, simple, and well seasoned. I was a little disappointed in the beer selection. Would be nice to see a little more variety. 

The service was great. We sat at the bar and it would be a good place to catch a game. Lovely environment and a lot of natural light."

If so, then how come the fast food chain&#39;s burgers taste better? At least in the case of a good old Mushroom Swiss Burger vs. the gourmet joint&#39;s Bad Ass Burger, which, has the description of everything that&#39;d make an amazing creation (hello, you had me at buttermilk fried bacon!) Unfortunately it was dry (medium-well patty) and mealy (too much batter for the buttermilk fried bacon). I was ashamed for letting the prospect of something monstrous in size win over the original desire for the Sam I Am burger, and kept thinking how the runny yolk of the fried egg would moist up the sandwich! Good thing the sweet potato fries were awesome!

I wouldn&#39;t protest if they want to convert to a Salad Bar, lol, because we really really enjoyed the Asian Salad. It was big, refreshing, different (napa cabbage being one of the main ingredients), and satisfying, especially the peanut soy dressing. So good that I started feeling sorry for people who has peanut allergy.

It was pretty late and close to closing time but they were still super accommodating and we didn&#39;t feel rushed. I opted for the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got the burger with ham and egg with tater tots. Both were really, really good. In fact - this place could&#39;ve been a 5-star spot except that we asked for medium burgers and they wound up medium-well with very very little pink. Always makes me sad when that happens.

The mushrooms were well-cooked though, and had a nice truffle sauce to go with the bun.

The sweet potato fries and tater tots were awesome, though, and oh my god the sauces they came with were to die for. One of them tasted like bacon pulverized into mayo and I wanted to find a bottle of it to take home and put on everything I eat from now on. The other BBQ mayo was also good but I&#39;m not as much of a BBQ sauce person so. Prices were reasonable as well!

If you&#39;re a burger fan you should hit this place up, but the burger cooked-ness might be a bit inconsistent."

What!?!

&#34;Health Food Restaurant&#34;  . . . &#34;What does he mean?&#34; you ask in a contumacious snarl.

Well, hear me out. 

Went in for a bite during this paleo diet time of mine (already down 10:) and wondered what I was going to get when my honey said she wanted a burger.  Was pleasantly surprised when I saw a lettuce wrap burger offered on the menu. Ordered it up with a side of not fries, but fresh fruit. Had me a nice big glass of water for my drink.

Ya look at all those BD&#39;sBB pix of burgers on Yelp where they&#39;re topped with fried fry stuff all fried up and ya think that every burger&#39;s a couple of grand in calories. But not so. Stayed well within my self-imposed gluten/carb/fat limit. The biggest surprise?  The fruit cup. Remember how when you were little and at school they said &#34;fruit cup&#34; was on the menu. You knew it was this canned mixture of glup that was sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and always with too many things some adult would tell you were &#34;delicious cubes of pear.&#34;  Yeah right.  But the fruit side at BD&#39;sBB is truly wonderful. Burstingly fresh slices of strawberries, blue berries, pineapple, and melon (that tasted like melon, not like some generic vaguely fruit-like hard and tasteless something or other).

Couldn&#39;t have been more pleased, and the nice manager came over to say hi and make sure all was to our liking after the nice server had already checked back to make sure everything was peachy keen and hunky dory . . . and it was.

One of my drivers told me about Bad Daddy&#39;s, and that they have some mean burgers.  I saw they had multiple locations, so I decided to give the one in Cherry Creek a shot this early evening.

Finding it was fairly simple, and I was kind of surprised how empty the streets were given on a late Sunday afternoon.   I ended up parking right next to the building- even though it clearly was reserved parking for another place around.  I figured it being Sunday and the area being a ghost town, I didn&#39;t think they would mind me using their reserved parking for an hour or so.

We (my roomie and I) got seated immediately.  I liked how they had the outdoor patio, along with multiple garage doors that open up in front, and on the side as well.  It was actually a pretty nice afternoon out- the ones up front were open.

The inside, looked like any typical bar, with the TVs, the bar, and plenty of booth/table seating.  We got seated near the back right corner, which was ok with me.  I was handed a drink menu, and also a food menu.  I saw they had a house amber ale- which was the best value on the menu- @ $3 a pint, or $4 for 20/oz.  The next cheapest draft was Coors Light @4$ a pint.  

I saw some bbq chicken nachos I was hankering for as an app, so I ordered those, along with a tall boy of the house amber ale.  Then I decided to look over the menu more.  I liked how they had milkshakes, and all sorts of fun toppings for a burger.  They even had an option to make your own salad- which looked very tempting.  But I stuck with the custom burger.

The menu also had milkshakes, cocktails, seemingly strong margaritas (apparently a limit of 2 per customer), and all sorts of apps to choose from.

The nachos took a while, but finally came out.  I noticed immediately that those were not the BBQ chicken nachos, but instead had chili on them.  They were tasty, but not what I had ordered.  I put chili on my burger, and didn&#39;t want to eat it before hand as well.

The burgers then came out.  I was pretty excited.  I didn&#39;t want to go too overboard- since I knew the nachos would put a mark on my appetite.  You have the option of naming your custom burger, I decided to name mine &#34;disgusting.&#34;.  Even though, it was actually pretty tasty.

My roommate got a burger with 3 different types of bacon on it- I knew he was going to be hurting (I think he still is hours later).  He gave me a piece of his buttermilk fried bacon (you can add it to a burger for 3$)- it was tasty, but almost borderline overboard.  Even coming from me!  I bet that burger he ate had over 5000MG of sodium- not that I am saying mine didn&#39;t have a ridiculous amount either.

I got fries with my burger, which also came with a side of sauce- I am assuming the bad daddy&#39;s sauce.  It went well with the fries.

After eating, I was thinking about dessert- as they have pudding, brownies, and milkshakes, I think the food coma started to commence.  So, like penguins, we wobbled our way out.

I would probably come back to try something else but I will warn you, this place gets expensive, quick!  Custom burgers can get quite pricey- so make sure you don&#39;t waste your food!"

The service was astronomical though. This time, I was using the Dining Out Denver Passbook and it only works at the Cherry Creek location. I decided to try something different, so I ordered the pastrami Reuben burger. This is much different than my basic cheeseburger that I typically get. As we waited for our food to show up, a server was talking to a couple two tables over from us. She was still talking to them when we left. Our beers arrived and we sipped on them. Another couple walked in, were seated, ordered and received their food before we were even checked on.  We still haven&#39;t gotten our food. Our burgers arrived right before the couple next to us left after their meal. It seemed to me that the service at this location was a night and day difference from the DTC location.

The food arrived and immediately I was in love with my burger.  I love Reubens and this one was a pretty good one. The beer choices are always awesome.  (We usually just stop in at a Bad Daddys for a beer or two) The food is great, but a bit pricey. The service seems to vary depending on what location you are at.

Maybe it was a recommendation from a Yelper. But however it happened, this flavor combo is terrific. 

My family has also enjoyed their trips here. As is the norm with burger restaurants now, there are speciality burgers or you can build your own.  To tell the truth, I&#39;m not one to give a chain restaurant 5 stars. They usually lose something in the standardization.

I have been here twice and have been impressed both times. However, I would say I would pass on getting the deep fried bacon- which is breaded and overpowers the taste of the rest of the burger. The potato chips and fries are both really good as well. 
I honestly don&#39;t remember the service the first time meaning it was probably just average but the second time I went the waitress was really nice and friendly. 
The beer selection here is good and there house beer is only 3$ and actually really good even though I typically don&#39;t love ambers. 
The only real issue I have with this place is the price. One burger and one beer was 20$ which seems kind of high. However, since they are so good it wouldn&#39;t deter me to never come here again."

I&#39;ve tried the beef, turkey and chicken burgers now and they&#39;re all great! I love their ordering system. They have a pad of paper with all of the meat, bun and topping options, and you check the boxes for the ones you want. It&#39;s infinitely customizable, and they do the same thing for salads! I love the huge array of fixings that they offer for your burger or salad. I love that any dietary need and any taste can be accommodated, making them great for groups.

I don&#39;t usually do this, but I wanted to make a quick note on the service first. Wow, excellent! The hostesses were timely, ready and offered us a wonderful table. Thanks Bad Daddy&#39;s crew! The server was persistent, but in the best way. She would occasionally check on us and it wasn&#39;t an overwhelming amount of times.  

As I scoured the menu, I pinned my eyes on the on the burger I KNEW was perfect. Although I wanted to debate, my heart was set on the holy grail: Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. My goodness, I saw the menu description and almost suffered a mental heart attack. Jalapeno bacon, applewood smoked bacon, and bacon mayo hold hands with a juicy beef patty to create this feast for kings. 

The food came out in a timely matter and I swear I fell in love with my meal when I saw it. I ordered it with a side of Bad Daddy&#39;s crispy, flavorful tater tots. These had the perfect amount of seasoning salt, and complimented the main dish. But that burger, wow. That was one to remember! The patty was thick, freshly patted and was the perfect host to the bacon flavors that topped it. Although it was a bit salty, I swear I could hear trumpets of joy with every bite. The burger was literally one of the best I ever had: flavorful, exciting and scrumptious!  

This was an AWESOME experience! The burger was huge too and quite hard to finish... But I conquered that castle! Check out Bad Daddy&#39;s Burger Bar!"

Solid fried pickles. Me gusta big time. I could eat a lot more of these for dinner and just call it good. 

In efforts to &#34;go light,&#34; we decided to share a burger and entree salad; however that was shot to hell when we ordered probably the unhealthiest burger and salad on the menu. And don&#39;t forget the fried pickles. Oye. 

Anyway, two thumbs up for both the Bad Ass Burger and the Texican Salad. I had meant to ask for grilled instead of fried chicken on the salad, but oh well - it was delightful. We did end up sharing entrees as planned, and I couldn&#39;t keep my hands off the tater tots that came with the burger. Love me some tots! And their special sauce!

And big kudos to the servers and manager. They were attentive, visible and helpful in making recommendations in a way that I didn&#39;t expect. The manager for example suggested we take 2 of the fried bacon pieces off the burger or else it would be too big to eat, and lo and behold - he was exactly right. Yay Bad Daddy&#39;s!"

I&#39;m very picky about what I classify as a good burger. Just because the meat is juicy does not make it a good burger. &#34;Juicy&#34; usually indicates greasy and low grade meat. With this being a chain restaurant, I didn&#39;t have very high expectations. I WAS WRONG! 

I ordered the Bison burger with American cheese, an egg, and garlic aioli. The burger was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The bun also compliments the burger very well. The burger easily deserves 5 stars!

The only reason I didn&#39;t give 5 stars is because of the fries. They&#39;re good, but they were over-seasoned. The house sauce is pretty good for dipping fries."

Having no idea that a place known for it&#39;s deliciously juicy burgers would boast a by build-your-own salad menu, I was a really happy camper to have my greens up with all the good stuff. 

I&#39;m a toppings gal, so when an establishment just doesn&#39;t understand the importance of not only quantity, but quality of toppings - that can be a barometer for which I rate the place. So, five stars indeed, Bad Daddy&#39;s.

I&#39;ve always been a fan of Cherry Cricket, and to go to another burger joint so close to the Cricket?! But I did have a coupon I gotta use so sure, let&#39;s give it a try.

I gotta say, I was impressed. I went there one evening with my boyfriend. The first thing I liked: their house beer special. Big glass of beer for only $4 or so. We&#39;re having a great start. 

Their menu is pretty standard for a burger joint. Nice selections of appetizers, some standard and some fun burgers, and then there is a shake section... We&#39;ll get to the shakes later.

In case none of the burgers intrigue you, they also have a paper pad on the table for you to build your own burger or salad, which is what I did. I got a buffalo mushroom swiss burger, medium rare and my bf got their tuna burger sub buns with lettuce. 

After a little wait, the food came and man, the food was..... glorious. The burger looked so awesome, with tots on the side. It tasted just as good as it looks. The best part? The bottom bun wasn&#39;t super soaked with grease, it was still in bun form. I took a bite of my bf&#39;s tuna burger and it was just as good. Great balance of the wasabi sauce but not overpowering the nice piece of tuna. 

We were SO full after the meal but with that milkshake menu, we couldn&#39;t pass it up. We ordered their chunky elvis shake, and man, it&#39;s worth all chunkiness it&#39;s gonna cost you later.

Other little things that&#39;s helpful.... They have a roll of napkins at the table. Also great, their garage patio door. Service was pretty good, so is the seating arrangements. There are tons of tv&#39;s and space, so I would think it&#39;s a pretty good place to watch a game."

This place is devilish-ly good. Absolutely massive hamburgers, bowls of tots and sweet potato fries, cold, local beer and milkshakes. 

A coworker and I took it as a challenge to get to a first-name basis with the staff, and a &#39;regular&#39; menu order. As a couple others here have mentioned, the Sam I Am is what looks like a very strange burger. Something a hungover college kid with ADD put together. But it&#39;s delicious. Almost like an Eggs Benedict/Angus burger love child. My coworker and I bravely replaced the house-made pesto with peanut butter, and added bacon (because the burger and slab of hickory ham wasn&#39;t enough meat). 

The reason I said it was bad, and the reason for the 4-stars, is because of the excess. You can&#39;t stop eating, especially when the burger gets messy with all the sauces, so even Superman or Adam Richman would slip into a food coma. I have no problem with this happening for dinner, perfect way to not off into slumberland, but for a lunch meal, it can be a little much."

A buddy and I decided to give bad daddy&#39;s a go after the cherry cricket was overloaded with people.  Best decision we made all weekend!  We started off with the house made chips and a couple of beers (IPA and the imperial stout).  Chips were very good and the beers were great!  We sat at the bar and got to know the awesome bar tenders.  We began a discussion regarding bacon (everyone loves bacon,  I just love it more).  The kitchen manager overheard this and made us some root beer bacon lollipops (think super thick bacon on a stick).  I&#39;ve still got a headache from this because it blew my mind!  

We then decided to customize our own burgers.  This can get pricey, but it&#39;s soooooooooo good.  You name your burger when you order it.  My burger - bacon me crazy - was the &#34;bad ass&#34; patty (10oz) with grilled onions,  jalapeños,  and three different types of bacon - buttermilk fried bacon, Applewood smoked bacon,  and jalapeño bacon.  Imagine the best burger you&#39;ve ever had..... it&#39;s terrible compared to this burger.  My buddy created the &#34;balls deep&#34; burger that was virtually the same, but didn&#39;t have the Applewood smoked bacon however he did add a fried egg!
   
After my heart began beating again from my brief cardiac arrest, I had a few of the tots that came with my burger.  I didn&#39;t even come close to finishing these.   They were really good, but come on - if you finish this burger and the huge portion of tots, you might have a problem.  I definitely did not finish this burger, but fear not - all of the bacon was consumed!

The bar tenders joking asked if we wanted desert.  Since we already figured that this was game over for us, we asked if we could somehow get a desert with bacon in it.  This place aims to please,  so they conjured up the BACON SHAKE!  I had a chocolate bacon shake and my buddy had a vanilla-carmel bacon shake.  Get one.  Best bacon shake I&#39;ve ever had (yes, I&#39;ve had one another time).... and one of the better shakes (any flavor) that I&#39;ve ever had.  It sounds suspect, but it&#39;s incredible! 

This wasnt a cheap meal, but it was amazing!  Check out bad daddy&#39;s - incredible service and delicious food will not leave you disappointed!"

That said, my go-to salad choice is actually off the menu, called the Stella. It&#39;s greek-inspired deliciousness with pepperoncinics, chick peas, grilled chicken, feta, kalamata olives, and and a delicious dressing. 

The burgers are great and they have awesome topping choices, bun choices and sauces. One of my most favorite items on their menu is the tater tots. They are magical tots, I tell you. The sauce they send out with them is some sort of BBQ ranch mix that is addictive. 

My favorite drinks of choice are the Bad Betty and their House Bloody Mary. I get the Bloody with Tito&#39;s instead of their well vodka, which I think is Svedka. 

Definitely give it a try if you are in the mood some some American fare!"

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cultural/area difference, but I don&#39;t see how this place has so many reviews and is 4.5 stars.  Maybe we went on an off day?  I&#39;m not from Denver, so I&#39;m highly unlikely to give this place a 2nd try.

Menu: 5 stars
They had a big selection of burgers to choose from.  I like the &#34;Create Yours Own Burger&#34; option where you can check off what you want rather than rely on the waitstaff to scribble all your requests correctly.  They also have lots of great options to really make a unique burger.

Food: 3 stars
The final result was nothing more than average, and really, really greasy.  I&#39;m from Oklahoma where people take their burgers seriously, and this place was barley a cut above your typical chain restaurant like a Chili&#39;s.  The beef wasn&#39;t really seasoned in any special way, and the toppings were nothing more than just what they were (they were not seasoned or creative in any way).  The bun was mediocre and nothing special.  It didn&#39;t hold up to the grease pouring out of the burger and ended up soggy.  My burger was also overcooked.  I ordered it medium, and it was well done without any pink.  The fresh fries had potential, but there was way too much salt on mine.

Price: 1 stars
Our bill was $40 for two burgers with sides and 1 beer.  Are you kidding me?  I had to double check because I couldn&#39;t imagine it being that much.  I know food is more expensive here, but there are places back home where you can get a far superior, and healthier, burger, with fries, and a drink for less than $12, and that&#39;s on the expensive, fancier side.  $40 is rediculous for these average burgers.

Waitstaff: 3 stars
We had to track down our waitress once to ask for our drinks to be filled, but she was pleasant and able to answer questions about the menu.  The restaurant was not too busy when we went, likely winding down from the lunch rush, but it took close to 30 minutes to get our burgers.  Not acceptable for a burger!

Atmosphere: 3 stars
The music was really loud, but they did a good job of mixing up the decade of rock.  We went on a nice afternoon, so they had all the doors open, which made the restaurant more of an open air place, which was enjoyable.

Overall: 3 stars
Ehhh...Not impressed. Great options with potential, but the result was nothing spectacular, over cooked, way more greasy than it needed to be, and far too expensive.  I won&#39;t be going back."

Appetizer menu is pretty close to mini-meals.  Nachos, sliders...  At a burger restaurant, it just seems weird having this as a starter.  Then there&#39;s fries (okay?), and fried pickles.  A real appetizer, finally.  Got it.  Kind of soggy.  Alright then.

Good menu of burgers for just about any taste bud.  Burgers are juicy and tasty.  Fries aren&#39;t anything to remember, but there&#39;s a zesty dip that makes it stand out a little.

That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for this place.  A burger bar isn&#39;t going to be a place to hang out at night, so I guess I&#39;ll have to simply disagree with the raves here."

Decorated very similar to Gary Lee&#39;s over on S. Broadway- Bad Daddy&#39;s has a definite Rockabilly feel to it.
Service at the bar was prompt and very helpful.

We decided to get a couple beers and look over the appetizer options.
We ended up splitting off Pastrami Sliders, Daddy&#39;s Sliders and Backyard Chicken Nachos.
Both the sliders  were tops for depth of flavor. 

The Daddy&#39;s (beef) ones are a blend of ground chuck and brisket which gives so much more awesome than you&#39;d think for such a small portion size. 

The Pastrami was perfectly &#34;melt in your mouth&#34; tender and served with swiss cheese and dijon mustard.

The Backyard Chicken Nachos are a must eat! 
&#34;Tortilla chips topped with pulled BBQ
chicken, diced tomatoes, black beans, fresh pineapple, red onion, shredded cheddar, queso, spicy corn slaw and cilantro. Drizzled with ranch sour cream and BBQ sauce. &#34;-- from their menu description.  I&#39;d explain them as BBQ Pineapple pizza meets nachos. Delightfully odd mix of flavors.

Looking forward to returning and trying out their burgers sometime very soon!"

Mine was really good..Turkey burger with pepper jack, garlic mayo, parmesan spread and grilled onions.  To eliminate carbs and calories, I had a lettuce bun!  I would only recommend offering a leaner turkey option (for the health crazed) because I could tell my turkey burger was full fat."

Hey, remember that old Wendy&#39;s commercial where actress Clara Peller would angrily ask, &#34;Where&#39;s the beef?&#34;  I do, because I&#39;m a Gen Xer and the 80&#39;s rocked!  Heck, just look at the movie Guardians of the Galaxy.  It&#39;s chock-full of cool, hilarious 80&#39;s goodness, but I digress.  Bad Daddy&#39;s Burger Bar is the shiznit when it comes to hamburgers!  Their chicken is pretty amazing, too.  This place deserves every bit of laudation it gets!  Yeah....I use big words, too.  

If you find yourself inside of this marvelous restaurant, you have to try their famous &#34;Bad Ass Burger.&#34;  It&#39;s a 10 oz. custom blend beef patty with lettuce, tomatoes, buttermilk fried bacon, horseradish mayo, handmade American cheese and pickles on a brioche bun.  If you are a burger aficionado, you will be thoroughly impressed with the full-flavored taste sensation.  It&#39;s an extremely filling, enjoyable experience!

Bad Daddy&#39;s Burger Bar also has wonderful grilled chicken.  You can build your own burger around their 6 oz. fresh grilled chicken breasts.  I ordered one with 3 chicken breasts to which I dubbed, &#34;The Trifecta.&#34;

Oh, don&#39;t forget to try their house sauce with whatever you are having.  It is fantastic!!!

Burgers are a favorite of mine, probably because I like all the toppings I can add, it&#39;s the same reason I&#39;m crazy about salads, it&#39;s the toppings!  Bad Daddy&#39;s does not disappoint.  

On this afternoon we were feeling a bit crazy and went a little overboard with ordering.  

Buffalo Wings ($8) - Very solid wings with a good buffalo heat and cooked through while still remaining super juicy on the inside.  I was hoping for a little bit of a crispier skin but that&#39;s a small gripe.

Pittsburgher ($11) - This was a ginormous burger and had everything I wanted, American cheese, spicy garlic ketchup, lettuce, tomato, onion, and shoestring fries.  The beef patty is flavorful and the house made condiments are all delicious.  I thought the beef patty was a smidgen overcooked, I didn&#39;t mention it to the manager that came by since it was minor, but I hope the temperature improves on my future visit.  I couldn&#39;t finish the entire thing without exploding so I ended up leaving with a small to go box.

Bad Ass Burger ($13) - I didn&#39;t really try this but I did try a little bit of the buttermilk fried bacon and that&#39;s definitely something different.  Not my slice of bacon, I mean I love fried items but fried bacon in a batter is not my style, I prefer virgin bacon.  If you&#39;re starving, like walked across a desert and haven&#39;t eaten in five days, this is the burger for you.  

Tots - Hell ya!  Add some Bad Daddy sauce and I&#39;m good to go.  Take a look at the pic, I literally had a bowl of tots!

Sweet Potato Fries - Very tasty sweet potato fries, although I&#39;m more of a tots gal.

Housemade Bacon Mayo - Now that&#39;s an idea - and a genius one!

The atmosphere is fun, and they have small patio in the front that also wraps around the side of the building.  They are definitely catering to the families in the neighborhood and on the weekend you will be surrounded by children.

Here are a couple tidbits to help entice you to come, if the word &#34;burger&#34; wasn&#39;t enough:

-Did you know they served breakfast?  
-Burger prices include a choice of side
-Salads look amazing and you can create a large salad with 7 toppings for $9
-Ten different choices for cheese -wha?
-Shrimp burger anyone?  That sounds fun!

I had doubts about another burger joint in the Creek, how many can a neighborhood really have.  I now believe the Cricket and Bad Daddy&#39;s can coexist in the Creek together and will keep our tummy&#39;s full with tasty burgers for years to come."

  Jenni was great, kept our drinks (Pepsi and fresh-squeezed lemonade) full the whole time and was friendly and helpful as it was our first time in.  We also got a free sample of the snickers shake that was great! Thanks Bad Daddy&#39;s, we&#39;ll be back!"

Well, now I have to retrain my mind as this place easily rivals that other burger joint. 

We decided to conquer the Daddy&#39;s Nachos (on the recommendation our fantastic server Madison) and the Bad Ass Burger. The nachos were topped with their meat chilli and were really good. My only complaint would be that there weren&#39;t quite enough chips for all the delicious toppings. 

The Bad Ass Burger was truly bad ass! There is no way to eat this burger with dignity, so just roll up your sleaves, dump the savory and sweat mustard sauce and get ready to get on the treadmill to work off the million tasty, well-worth-it calories. Did I mention there is buttermilk fried bacon on this monstrous burger?!?!? 

The environment is loud and fun in this place so it is great for children. And the service was great all around.

Answered a legitimate issue with a patronizing tone. After reading the seemingly canned response, I rechecked with my friend who was with me that day. She agreed that managements response to the raw, dripping bloody burger I received was very rude and meant to shift blame. Wow. Well, I can see it probably won&#39;t matter to Bad Daddy&#39;s much, but you&#39;ve lost some good customers. With your attitude, I doubt we will be the only ones. Best of luck to you. 

Bad Daddy&#39;s disappointed me today. Mistakes can be made, and I am very understanding - especially since I worked as a server in restaurants for many years. However, one thing that is absolutely unacceptable to me is when a mistake is made in a restaurant and the management not only refuses to take responsibility for it - but they then shift the blame back on to the guest. This is what happened today. My two children and I were meeting my friend and her child for lunch. Unfortunately my friend had just been in a minor fender bender and came in late and pretty shaken up. She then had to go call her insurance, so I am sure we were not the easiest table to attend to today. However, once we got it sorted out, they pretty much completely ignored us. We ordered 3 kids meals, kids meals okay. I ordered a burger cooked medium in a lettuce wrap, and my friend ordered the chili. The restaurant was no longer packed. In fact, we were one of the few tables left, so we were surprised that the food took forever to arrive. When it did, my friend&#39;s chili was cold. She asked for them to heat it. I picked up my burger and blood ran down my hand, on my wrist and onto my dress. It was gross. Since the servers were avoiding our table, I called the manager. I said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but this burger just bled all over me.&#34; She seemed bewildered at why this was a problem. She then said she could have the kitchen cook it longer. With knitted eyebrows she said, &#34;Perhaps this time you want to order it Medium Well?&#34; Wow! How patronizing. As someone with a lot of experience with food, the only reason that the blood thing happened is because the burger was not cooked properly in the first place. I ordered it Medium, and medium means, just a tiny amount of pink in the middle. At no time, should a burger be so raw that it BLEEDS all over you. That&#39;s just unhealthy and unsanitary. And then trying to say it was my fault, that I just ordered the wrong temperature. That is just poor form. I was too upset to order anything else, and didn&#39;t get a chance to eat the rest of the day. My friend didn&#39;t finish her chili either. Then, one of the servers made excuses, trying to blame all the mishaps on his trainee. Where I come from, you never throw your trainee under the bus like that. They took the Burger and the Chili off of the bill - that was the least they could do. They also gave me a few coupons for some free stuff for &#34;next time&#34;. It was disheartening. We are not after free stuff. As local neighborhood people, we are after good food, efficient service, friendly atmosphere for our kids, and an establishment that takes responsibility for it&#39;s product. Listen, mistakes happen all the time. I make them, everyone makes them - it&#39;s just what happens. But when you make a mistake that is CLEARLY yours, put on your big girl pants and own it, apologize, and move on. DON&#39;T shift the blame. People are more wise than you think and we know what&#39;s really going on. I hope that Bad Daddy&#39;s can improve on this and continue to be a great neighborhood place."

I got the Asian salad and I guess I didn&#39;t read through the description on the menu very well since this  was a suggestion from the server, but there was a ton of peanuts on the salad and peanut dressing which I&#39;m allergic to peanuts (not extremely where I would go into shock if I are it). Luckily I got the dressing on the side so I picked a different dressing and I just had to pick out the million peanuts. The chicken was simple and
good enough. But there was a bunch of large strips of red peppers which should&#39;ve either been roasted or chopped smaller. I don&#39;t remember much else about this salad but obviously or was not memorable. The rest of my group got some kind of truffle fries, fried pickles, and the bad daddy burger which was monstrously huge and had buttermilk fried bacon and was served work tater tots. I don&#39;t think anyone with  a bad heart could&#39;ve eaten that burger. I need to come back and try something other than a salad like a burger and fries and then update my review. Hopefully they have a good turkey or chicken burger since I don&#39;t really like regular beef burgers.

While the restaurant was quite busy, we were quickly seated in the main restaurant area. The decor and layout were both very nice and we enjoyed the ambiance. We especially appreciated that while we were surrounded by tables with young kids, there was no point that we wished we were in the bar area instead.

The drink menu blew us away and both my beer-drinking husband and I found multiple choices we would like to try. He went with the house amber beer ($3) and I tried the blood orange margarita. Our drinks came out quickly and I was surprised how tiny my drink was. There couldn&#39;t have been more than 3/4cup worth of liquid. There wasn&#39;t much blood orange taste but the tequila was good and there was plenty. It was supposed to be $7 but we did notice later on that it was only rung in at $5.25 on the bill. I later tried the bad betty and that was more my style. It was also $7 and came in a pint glass with two huge slices of pink grapefruit. Delish!

For food, I had the pittsburgher burger with potato chips and my husband had a patty melt with chips. I ordered both of the dipping sauces as french onion and pimento cheese sounded delish. Our burgers arrived ~15 mins after ordering them and were perfectly cooked. I added some extra seasoning to my patty as it was a bit dull. But the garlic spicy ketchup is perfect and everything else was very good. My husband greatly enjoyed his patty melt. I preferred the french onion dip to the pimento and will stick with that in the future. We saw some of the salads come out and they were huge. Portions are not skimped on.

Overall we had a very nice visit and experienced very good service. While the restaurant was full, we were well attended to and never had an empty glass or plate hanging around. We&#39;ll definitely be back and love that there&#39;s now one in Southlands too!"

The menu is pretty big, but since it&#39;s really just different burger, salad, or non burger sandwich options with a &#39;create your own&#39; section, it wasn&#39;t overwhelming.

So, at this point of my review, I don&#39;t remember the specific burger I got. I think it was the Western since I usually seem to gravitate to bacon and cheese (who doesn&#39;t?) but I can&#39;t speak with certainty. The burger was good, but not going to lie....the thing I remember MOST about bad daddy&#39;s is all their available sauces you can use to dip stuff in!

Bad daddy&#39;s sauce, bbq sauce, garlic mayo, ranch, bbq ranch - just do it. Ask your server and get them. All the sauces we had available to us were delicious and totally heightened the taste of both fries, sweet potato fries and burgers alike."

We tried the fried pickles, the Mama ricotta burger, the badass burger, a margarita and the apricot beer.  These burgers were amazingly flavorful.  The waitress advised me the margarita had a ton of tequila in it, and she wasn&#39;t kidding.  

This experience was even better due to the the response that management took in the following situation.   My boyfriend ordered the burger medium rare but it was cooked medium well to well done.  Despite this, he still really liked the taste of the burger. When the waitress came by he mentioned the mistake in a joking manner, but highlighted that the burger was still amazing.

Not 1 minute later an ever younger waiter showed up and was so professional he should consider working at a fine dining restaurant with a little more training. Very impressed.

My son ordered a &#34;Badass Burger&#34; and my jaw dropped when they brought it out!  The Buttermilk fried bacon is gigantic!  We easily shared and also created a spinach salad with fruit and protein.  Delicious.  Had a 20 oz Heliocentric Hefeweizen.  Finished up by splitting a Cookies and Cream shake.  All of the above come highly recommended!  Patio is on the small side with a few 2 toppers but otherwise the finish out has a cool vibe.  Great bar with some decent micros and lots of garage doors that can roll up.

Picture TGIF without the personality or quality. Corporate decorations hang everywhere to give fake impression that it&#39;s a local hangout. The chicken wings are overly sweet and soggy, the burgers are over priced and the fries taste like thy are re-fried upon being served."

Unfortunately, since I consider myself to be a bit of a burger snob, I am generally disappointed. Not so at Bad Daddy&#39;s Burger Bar. And not only were the burgers (which we customized), sides and salads delicious, but the service was awesome. This is generally not a review I give often - seeing as my boyfriend is frequently lamenting my ordering style - questions, followed by indecisiveness and eventually a somewhat &#34;specialized&#34; order. I understand that most servers don&#39;t care what I want, know my appetite or share my palate. I just want what I want, people! And I want the opinion of the professional who serves the food all day too. 

Our server was a super helpful, happy and attentive guy. He answered my questions with a smile on his face and, fortunately, directed me to the &#34;custom&#34; burger order form. This made my bf happy, since the waiter didn&#39;t have to suffer my lengthy order. We enjoyed everything we ordered - particularly the chicken burger and chipotle mayo (both as a topping and a dipper). 

We played hangman while we waited and our waiter chuckled when he delivered our food because my boyfriend&#39;s puzzle read, &#34;Bobby Flay is a total douche&#34; (he had a personal encounter with him that was not too pleasant). Endeared the waiter to us even more.

Overall great experience."

Bad Daddy&#39;s fulfills that hankering whenever I visit. You can explore your inner burger artist by creating creating your own masterpiece from their extensive list of toppings, or you can order one of their concoctions right of the menu.

My favorites so far have been The Western Burger and, surprisingly, the Ahi Tuna Burger. The tuna was lightly seared and the peanut soy Asian slaw was delicious. 

When ordering you have a choice of deep fried delights as sides, but really there is only one choice. The TOTS! They are exactly what tots should be. Crispy on the outside and warm, potato goodness on the inside. Paired with Bad Daddy&#39;s special dipping sauce (chipotle ranch?), they are a meal unto themselves. 

The beer selection is also outstanding. It&#39;s a plus that offer a 20 oz. beer for those days where the regular size is not enough. Yummy cocktails too.

First it was easy to find parking but I went right before dinner around 4:30. You can build your own or order one of their many different options. Housemade chip were so yummy with French onion and pimento cheese dip. But the best thing about this place is the awesome service!! Lydia H. waited on us and was nothing short of great. She was knowledgeable and attentive but not overly attentive where it becomes irritating. So just for that this place gets a big 5 stars!!

He ordered the bacon lover before, and for started they forgot to put bacon on it, so they brought over a pile of bacon on a side plate. Even with the bacon he said it was good, but nothing to rav about, and not worth $12. 

My gluten free experience however was a messy yet very tasty one. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, lettuce wrapped, with bacon, pesto, and swiss cheese. It was a little messy, but it was one of the best burger/sandwiches I have had out in a long time. It came with a side of potato chips. 

I also ordered their strawberry down and dirty, which was rum, strawberries, and ginger beer. That was super tasty. 

So overall, good. I guess I would say go try it. Might not be your favorite place, but the food was good."

The other two were more of a fine dining experience and this was just a bit different in that it was a bit noisier and the seating more rustic. 

But... the food was AMAZING!  We started with the oysters, moved onto the chicken appetizer and squash appetizer. The flavors just exploded!  So distinct and different.

We shared the &#39;&#34;Nose to Tail&#34; main and the depth of flavors were so incredibly intense and delightful. The sausage had an incredible smokiness and the pork belly was smooth as silk. 

We finished with the butterscotch pot de creme. Again the depth was there. This chef knows how to put things together. And pork is the theme in each dish- except for the oysters. 

A must go to when in Denver."

The food and service is amazing. We went on Sunday night, they offer 50% off all bottles of wine (pretty nice deal). I was surprised it wasn&#39;t more crowded. Sunday night be a slow time for them, because it was the first time they had reservation on short notice, they are usually booked! 

We had the Nose to Tail and Gulf Snapper. Both entrees were phenomenal! Food came out hot, and in a timely manner, while the service was amazing. We had dessert as well, also wonderful. The sorbet (strawberry-mango) was THE BEST sorbet I have ever tasted. They make it in house, so much fresh fruit flavor. We also ordered Butterscotch Pot de Crème, another delicious dish, the peanut brittle has bacon bits in it, so good!!

The food is definitely better than &#34;A-OK&#34; but far from &#34;as good as it gets.&#34; It was a busy Saturday night, and it definitely showed.

Examples: I ordered their signature cocktail and was pretty sure I just got a glass of bourbon. Granted I do enjoy a &#34;bourbon-forward&#34; drink, but I wasn&#39;t getting much of anything else. I ordered a second cocktail and was treated to a completely different drink. The Royal Rooster was way overcooked, the honey was beyond caramelized to the point of bitterness. 

Highlights: From the charcuterie plate, the pork jowls and the venison rillette--wow! The green chili sausage was excellent. Nose to tail is a great dish (the pig ears were a great touch), but overall salt level was on the high side for the whole meal."

Think in-house cured ham stuffed cheddar cheese biscuits with red pepper jam, fairy tale eggplant (they&#39;re magical!), and freshly shucked oysters. But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself... 

We made our way to Old Major on a Friday night and it was pretty low key. We had our choice of inside or outside and couldn&#39;t resist the patio on a perfect summer night. Old Major offers a pretty extensive drink menu so I started with a cocktail then transitioned to some wine... Nothing to complain about there!

I was with family so had a very family style meal starting with the aforementioned dishes. My dad raved about the biscuits and I didn&#39;t think they were going to be as good as they were, but the ham was something else! We also had the &#34;Nose to Tail&#34; of smoked sausage, country rib, crispy ears, confit belly, lobster mushroom succotash grits, bourbon tomato glaze... You gotta try it! We also had some ribs that were off the charts. We couldn&#39;t end the meal without dessert and the peach crisp was just what the doctor ordered.

After reading several fantastic yelp reviews, we decided to try this place out for brunch. We came at 10:45 on a Sunday morning and they had an hour long wait! They offered seating at the bar with no wait, thank goodness! 

I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy, flavorful, and quite juicy. It came with two dipping sauces of gravy and syrup. I thought the gravy tasted a little *different*, so I asked the bartender and he told me they put pork broth in their gravy! He went on to explain that they base everything off their menu on pork, even their desserts are pork based! They butcher and cure their own meat in-house so they take pork VERY SERIOUSLY. 

Didn&#39;t try any drinks but I did watch the bartender create a FRESH SQUEEZED grapefruit mimosa concotion. You can tell they take their brunch drinking to another level!

We started out with the oyster of the day. They were fresh, small and shucked extremely well.

We tried the ham and biscuits on the recommendation of our server. Oh my, this was so good. Hubs wanted to get a mother order to take home. The game was sliced thin, moist and seasoned just right. The biscuit and jam could be a meal all on their own. 

We had a hard time deciding on an entree, but decided to split the 3 lb pork chop! It was so good. You could cut it with your fork and boy was it juicy. They served it with sea salt and some type of sauce. I did not feel like you needed either, but my better half enjoyed them. 

Last we enjoyed dessert. The butterscotch creme brûlée. Comes with this peanut brittle with bacon drippings in it and a shortbread cookie.....very nice finish.

The friends enjoyed the Pork breakfast Sandwich which was a towering evil thing, loaded with sausage, cheese, eggs- Just made my arteries hurt looking at it- but it looked delicious for sure.  Other friend hand the Butcher&#39;s breakfast, a plate loaded with all the breakfast things including a baseball-game sized breakfast sausage- yum!

Can only come here once a year if you&#39;re the average Joe because you&#39;ll certainly break the bank. Hence, the three dollar signs ($$$). But the high-quality food certainly lives up to its cost and the service is fantastic.

Five of my girlfriends and I came here for our annual Christmas dinner. After we exchanged our gifts, we got our first bottle of wine going. We decided to go big and order the most expensive thing on the menu: 2 Lb. Dry Aged Colorado Ribeye with house-made steak sauce. Wow it was incredible! Lucky we were able to share it between the six of us. It came with creamed spinach and kale and I chowed that down! We also ordered the lamb shank (but I&#39;m not big on lamb, so can&#39;t say much about that).

We each got our own Ham and Biscuits, which was a scrumptious combo of cheddar cheese biscuits, house smoked ham and red pepper jam. The manager also gave us an item that&#39;s on the house (and not on the menu). It was a tuna spread with cheese on a tortilla chip. That&#39;s the best way I can describe it but it was also very good. Another bottle of wine later, we paid the bill at $75 each. So definitely not cheap, but oh so worth it!"

The quality is top-notch, but the vibe is nice and relaxed. So many folks feel they have to go to &#34;white tablecloth&#34; places to find a great meal, but many of those places feel too fussy for my preferences. Old Major is the kind of place where you can swing by for happy hour with work clients, pre-game for an event with beers, or have an anniversary meal. It&#39;s just great for most anything.

The food is incredible. The house-made charcuterie is no joke. And the Royal Rooster lunch project, which features several versions of their incredible fried chicken sandwiches, is my absolute favorite lunch place in town right now. I go there with a group, order one of each sandwich, and we all split them up and share. I could eat there 3 times a week and not get tired of it."

I have known for some time that Old Major is cranking out fantastic cocktails and beverages, but I must say I was truly wooed by their scrumptious menu and alluring atmosphere! From the moment you walk in Old Major charms you with it&#39;s earthy, homey vibe. It&#39;s almost as if a southern Grandma greets you and says, &#34;Come on in, child, have a seat. Oh, and have some of the best biscuits of your life!&#34;

We made reservations on a Saturday night, and even though it was busy, our seating area was surprisingly calm with a fun view of the kitchen. The wait staff was knowledgable, helpful, and best of all observant. They worked together to deliver our food and we never had an empty water glass.

But let&#39;s get to the good stuff...the FOOD!! As so many people have said, the ham and biscuits is mind blowing, worthy of the word foodgasmic! Tender, flavorful ham is piled between flakey, homemade biscuits, and smeared in a jam that dare I say, I would bath in! I ordered fried chicken as my main dish. The breading was crisp and chicken was juicy, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was a life changing dish. My significant other, however, ordered Duck Au Vin, and the duck was so wonderfully cooked and perfectly seasoned, I almost stole the whole thing off his plate! To top it off our drinks were fantastic and I finished my meal with a champaign concoction called &#34;Swipe Right&#34; or &#34;The Right Swipe&#34; or something like that. Now, I have no idea if right swiping is the good swipe or the bad swipe, but, I would definitely recommend giving that delicate drink a second glance on the menu!"

We started with a few small plates
- Ham and Biscuits - These were my jam for sure! Sooooo good, highly recommend!
- Law&#39;s Pretzel Knots - These were alright, nothing special
- Asparagus Salad - This was good, I liked the burrata and mint pesto mixed with the asparagus

Main Dish
- Nose to Tail - green garlic sausage, confit belly, smoked rib, crispy ears, potato rosti, swiss chard, maitakes

This is something pig lovers dream of, it was amazing! It was a lot of food but because it was so good I wish there was more and more and more!

Overall, I&#39;d say Old Major is a 5 star restaurant and a good place to come when you&#39;re looking for an awesome (but fairly pricey) meal."

My first time in I didn&#39;t see a cocktail that piqued my interest, so the bartender made me one special based on what I liked!  Old Major has rich, delicious, meaty meals and the head chef and staff are wonderful.

It is a bit pricey, but the quality is well worth it. And if you&#39;re a little short on funds, splitting an appetizer, entree, and dessert should still fill you up.

The Ham and Cheddar Biscuit appetizer is a must try!"

Visiting my son in Denver and our first time here on a Friday night. Cool vibe, great service, amazing food. Started with oysters and the Old Major Charcuterie plate.

Recently, I read that is no longer the case so I figured it my chance to swoop in and see for myself if this place lives up to one of the top spots in Denver.

This isn&#39;t a very big place. When you walk in, there is the bar on the left with countless number of whiskey bottles and apparently some of the best bartenders in town. The dining room has a really intimate feel but the coolest feature might be the kitchen in the back where you could watch the chefs cook through the picture window. That really adds a lot to the character of this place.

I read in 5280 magazine that if there was one thing that should be ordered it was the ham &amp; biscuits. Once in a while I take the advice of an expert even if I&#39;m not the biggest fan of ham. Let&#39;s just say the ham alone was simply amazing... adding the biscuit and jam made it pretty unreal! I&#39;m so happy I read that and that we decided to go with it. 

We also had the fried chicken and duck au vin. The fried chicken was really good- nice flavor and juicy- perhaps two of the essential criteria for good chicken! The duck was, well, off the charts delicious. The closest thing I could compare it to is Peking duck I have had in Asia. The skin was crunchy and wonderful. The duck itself was just bursting with flavor. It was such a nice surprise and one of the culinary highlights of the year for me! There didn&#39;t need to be anything else but it came with duck sausage (also very good) and carrots, onions and Roman  gnocchi (which I never had but I was more than happy to try).

This is a really good spot for a date but also for small groups. The service (Caleb was our server) was fantastic - he was very good about paying attention to all the small details. All in all, it was just a great experience and probably one I wouldn&#39;t mind replaying again sometime in the future."

Before you read any further, know this, if you&#39;re looking to impress a foodie...bring them here!! This is the place where taste buds go to dream.

Upon arrival, the ambience of this place seemed extremely hip, we saw several people either in group parties or on dates. A range of dress styles from extremely fancy to casual jeans and sweater.

We ordered a Moscow Mule which was absolutely delightful. You asked the waitress to describe the goose breast and the seared steak.  The nice waitress said that the goose had a texture similar to meat, red meat, however she did not allude to the flavor. She also said the steak was a typical flavor steak. We decided to order both items.

Let me tell you now, the waitress truly and utterly undersold both the goose breast and the seared steak! When I tasted the goose breast, I nearly fell out of my chair and wanted to cry it was so delicious. I had never experienced anything like that in my life, I feel like I&#39;ve been waiting for that meal my entire life!! I feel that even though the waitress was very nice, she did the goose breast a major injustice by not explaining how amazing it was.

This seared steak was also much more amazing than the waitress led on!! I told her I wanted it medium rare, she told me I&#39;m a wanted medium as they cook the steaks a little more rare. I told her to stick with the medium rare and I&#39;m glad I did as I feel it was cooked absolutely perfect!! The seared gave an aspect of of crisp smokiness that I can&#39;t describe, but I can tell you my mouth is watering just writing this review. 

I really enjoyed the items that were paired with the goose breast however the side that came with the state could have used a little more of something, not quite sure... It was a beans salad of sorts which kind of made me feel meh

Ever since my visit to old major, I have been thinking about that gosh darn goose breast!! I don&#39;t live in Denver so it really makes me sad that I won&#39;t be back to old major for several months."

Their in-house charcuterie program is excellent, and definitely enhances the dining room. My favorite dish was a double-cut pork chop. The chef and cooks knew how to let the meat shine. They also demonstrated good skill with a silky foie gras soup. 

Old Major service is also quite good. The staff knows a lot about the food (and techniques), and that&#39;s not something you get often enough in Denver.

My one quibble with Old Major is their wine list. Personal opinion, but I think their wine program needs to include more bottles in the $40-$80 range. The expensive wines offered just don&#39;t seem to mesh with the rest of the Old Major experience."

Had some bites of the Korean Rooster (topped with kimchi--no surprise there), also delicious, but the fried chicken soaked up the juices from the kimchi so it wasn&#39;t as crunchy in the middle. The chicken sandwiches danced the line of being too salty but in my mind was still the perfect 10. 

Also ordered the fried pickles which were sliced as medallions (my preferred style cause wedges don&#39;t provide the proper pickle:batter ratio) and they were great too! Doesn&#39;t come with dip but ketchup and Sriracha was good enough.

Next time I&#39;m in town during their M-F, 11am-2pm Royal Rooster window, I&#39;m definitely having another sandwich."

The hubs and I came for Sunday brunch. We got there ten minutes after they opened so had no problem finding a table. 

The pork schnitzel was my choice with two over easy eggs added. The hubs got the butchers breakfast. My breakfast was perfect. The lemon hollandaise pulled everything together beautifully. The greens were seasoned well and the fresh peas reminded me of pulling peas out of my childhood garden. Totally crisp and fresh. And let&#39;s talk about the pork fat potatoes. Totally crisp and flavorful, I dare say these are the best breakfast potatoes I&#39;ve ever eaten. 

The butchers breakfast was simple in that it was ham, bacon and sausage with eggs and of course those unreal potatoes. Each component was carefully crafted and perfectly executed. 

The entire front of the house team was friendly, efficient and offered wonderful customer service. Our waitress was fantastic. We definitely want to come back for dinner."

Do you enjoy excellent food made from sustainable sources?  This is the place to go.  My friend and I went there to celebrate her promotion.  They greeted us with a glass of champagne to toast the special occasion.  Wow!

We ordered the biscuits and ham as an appetizer.  It was divine!  We both ordered the shrimp and grits.  According to the wait staff, the grits were made fresh from corn purchased from Grateful Bread (love this place, too).  The flavors of the grits, shrimp, confit tomatoes, and the creole gravy blended perfectly together. Then we moved on to dessert (how could we resist after everything else was so delicious?).  My friend had the butterscotch pot de creme (which I just had to try) and I had the whiskey &amp; chocolate.  Both desserts were a party in my mouth.  However, I really have to lean toward the butterscotch.  Yummy!  And I love chocolate so this was a surprise to me that I favored the butterscotch pot de creme more.

I just need to do a special shout out to our waiter, James.  He made great recommendations, was very attentive, and very friendly.  The other staff members who brought our food or came to check on us were just as friendly.  Seriously, they treated us like we were the only ones dining.

We decided to come in during their happy hour and boy am I happy we did! Usually during happy hour, dining staffs aren&#39;t as attentive because they are just trying to get through the chaotic rush but that wasn&#39;t the case here. Not only was our bartender/server, Jay, very attentive and accommodating, the chef even came out to see how everything tasted ( everything was delicious, as I am about to get too). We even ordered a pizza off the happy hour menu and when it was brought to the table, the server noticed the number of people (5) outnumbered the pieces of pizza (4). Minutes later, that same server came back with another pizza, free of charge, because he felt bad there wasn&#39;t enough slices. This example, truly demonstrates what exceptional service this establishment provided. 

We were going to try a couple of the offered cocktails but the Moscow mule was so good and refreshing, everyone drinking at the table ended up ordered about 3. 

Now to the important section, the food. We pretty much ordered everything on the happy hour menu so I&#39;ll touch on our favorites: 

-Pizza of the day, asparagus, pancetta, with cheese. I never thought of this combination  on pizza but the fresh saltiness of the pancetta blended perfectly with the thin slices of asparagus and cheese. This dish was so good, we ordered seconds! 

- Pretzel Rolls, is there any more I have to say? Perfectly baked rolls served with a delicious mustard butter. I am not a big mustard guy, so I asked what other options they have, they said pork butter and I was sold. Great substitute for all you mustard haters out there. 

- Seafood Fritter of the day was trout and it was delicious the doughiness of the fritter with the trout went great with a spicy mayo- like sauce it was paired with. 

We had heard that about the ham and biscuit and even waited until the dinner menu was available to try it. Warm buttery biscuit stacked with honey baked ham. The entree was so good  my mom exclaimed at one point,  &#34;THIS IS THE BEST BISCUIT I HAVE EVER HAD!&#34; 

If you aren&#39;t familiar with the Old Major, they are known for their fresh meats that they cure and produce in the restaurant. That being said, I decided to try their meat plate. Unfortunately, this was the one dish I didn&#39;t like as much but not because it was bad quality, actually quite the opposite. I am so used to processed meats, with added flavor, that my pallet was utterly confused with the fresh natural quality of some of the meats on the plate, such as homemade Bologna or the salami spread. To anyone else, with a more sophisticated pallet and understanding of a freshly procured meat, I would imagine, would have loved the plate. 

Side note: My step dad is Muslim, so he doesn&#39;t eat pork and the menu was very pork heavy. Although he was very satisfied with their non pork options, it&#39;s something to keep in mind in case you go with anyone in a similar situation. 

Lastly, everything was very well priced for happy hour; we took a gander at the dinner menu and although everything looked delicious, it did look like it was on the pricier side of things. Regardless, I would definitely go in to try the dinner menu because if the food and service is as great as my first time, I know I would enjoy the meal very much! 

All in all, this is a fine dining establishment and I would recommend it to anyone. Very pleased and can&#39;t wait to go back!"

The concept is terrific, but the execution was just okay. It certainly wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t enough to inspire me to come back.

The service was, as others have mentioned, lacking. Our server seemed bored and confused most of the night. I was hoping for a glass of wine once the entree finally arrived, but the server didn&#39;t return until we were almost done.  Only when the check was delivered did we see any sense of a personality.

On a positive note, the execution of the fried chicken was flawless. It was moist and crispy and the honey hot sauce was just the right balance to the saltiness of the breeding."

I had been running some errands in the area and thought it would be a perfect place to stop for a quick lunch with my boyfriend. The place was pretty empty when we first arrived as they had only been open for a few minutes. However, within about 20 minutes they were completely packed. 
We got the spicy chicken sandwich, the Korean chicken sandwich and some fries. Our food came out fast and hot. The chicken was so delicious and the sandwiches were perfect sizes. It was a good amount of food for us to share. The fries were hands down some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I could have eaten them for days. 
The service was great as everyone who works there is so friendly and helpful. The chef/owner was out greeting people and checking in on tables too, which was really nice. We were in and out of there pretty quickly, which is so great for a weekday lunch while at work, but didn&#39;t ever feel rushed at all. There was also tons of street parking and they have a parking lot on the side.
We can&#39;t wait to go back and try the other sandwiches as well as the Caesar salad. And I&#39;ll of course be eating more fries."

I&#39;m bringing up themes, and whether or not it was faithful to the book, etc., and he&#39;s wanting to enjoy it or not. Movies are that pure and simple for him. This is rad.

That&#39;s what I&#39;m like with food. So when she-beaux tells me the radicchio compliments the potato so nicely, I just make a Harry Potter spell joke, to which she responds in Malfoy&#39;s voice, &#34;That joke was ridiculous.&#34;

Anywho.

We came up on them hangar steaks, medium rare.  We agreed that we can&#39;t imagine what rare is if this was their medium rare, all pink and dripping with rarity. Not a criticism, hashtag just sayin&#39;.

It was the purest, most enjoyable meal, though, to get back to my original point. The portion is perfect, the flavor is perfect; everything was perfect.

My one beef was my first cocktail, Kneel to Zod (How could I go wrong, I thought?). It was basically a glass of ice with a splash of whiskey and grapefruit, so don&#39;t go there. I course-corrected with them Manhattans (up), though, cuz it&#39;s guaranteed you ain&#39;t goin&#39; wrong with them fools.

I think my husband&#39;s pork breakfast burger was exceptional, maybe the best sandwich in the city. I also really enjoyed my gardner&#39;s breakfast. I loved the slow pace. Did not disappoint, I only wish the patio was open."

I had been looking forward to giving it a try for some time and was certainly very pleased! As a meat lover how can you not enjoy a place that truly appreciates and takes care to prepare every part of the animal and make it delicious. ( Now I would never take a Vegetarian friend here, they may be mortified by the curating meat in the glass window!) Overall though through a full course meal every bite was spectacular, the service was great and the décor one that I find very cozy. Make sure to look up at what looks like small lit boxes above the bench but are actually really cool satellite maps! (It is little touches like this that catch my eye) 

I wish I could give them 4.5 stars but can&#39;t commit to 5 as there was just something missing for all the build up I had heard!"

My friends and I had a top-notch dining experience there a few nights ago. We started with the roasted oysters, and charcuterie plate with cheese. I paired my local fave, Infinite Monkey Theorem red wine with the apps and dinner. The smoked pork, pate, and copa were perfection. The oysters were huge and had a subtle smokey aroma that was a perfect counterpoint to the herbaceous sauce. 

For our main course, we splurged on the 3 lb. pork chop to share. The chop was the closest I&#39;ve gotten to the superior cuts we got back in Texas from our dear rancher friend, but it of course, superseded any restaurant chop any of us had ever experienced. The chop was so large it provided a variety of flavor profiles and textures - the most tender pieces were near the bone, and the sliver of fat on the chop was devilishly delicious. The chop was garnished with seasonal tastes of butternut squash puree, broccolini, and sweet potato. We ate all but one small piece...

The manager made a point to visit with our table between apps and the main course. I wish I remember his name - he was such a friendly and knowledgeable guy. I so appreciated his hospitality and willingness to give us some intel on the neighborhood and restaurant. Service from all was superb."

We didn&#39;t have a reservation and got a table within a few minutes. I think it does get very busy though so it&#39;s probably not a bad idea to make one just in case! We were two people with a baby in a stroller and they were very accommodating to us! I ordered the breakfast plate with house made sausage ham bacon eggs beans potatoes and tomatoes. It was tasty. But my husband ordered the chicken sandwich and that was absolutely delicious! I would totally get that next time! The fried chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly.

Yep we sat at a table for 4 near the bar.  Lighting was like being interrogated by a detective..as if ...  anyways....
So.. we had the ham biscuts, pretzel rolls, and for dinner the 3lb pork chop with winter veggies.. EXCELLENT. Sorry can&#39;t remember the cocktails .. that must mean it was good,  cuz we just keep ordering! I am sure when the weather is good the patio is awesome.  WE will be back."

Since a quick look at the menu will confirm this restaurant is a carnivore&#39;s delight, I got the charcuterie plate and split the ribeye with my companion. Their charcuterie is fabulous - the salami, lardo, and other-Italian-word-for-soprasetta-that-I-can&#39;t-remember especially stood out. The steak was easily one of the top two I&#39;ve ever had in my life.

The only con I can imagine is that they do ask you to pay for this level of quality. If that&#39;s not a barrier for you, and you like meat, I absolutely implore you to visit."

We&#39;re from out of state and saw their Ham and Biscuits on IG so we made it a priority to stop by and have them. I did all my research and that item was only available on their dinner menu which starts at 3pm according to their website. Well we got here at 3 and the very nice waitress told us nope but at 5:00. And the kitchen wouldn&#39;t do it. So we had the seafood fritters (good), oysters (good), but the pork burger was... gross (and I hate to use that term with food). It was super salty and greasy. I so was looking forward to this place. And it didn&#39;t help that our total (off a happy hour menu) was a little high. So Old Major, please specify your hours on the menus. It would have helped us a lot. Don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll be back again and Denver and we&#39;ll never know about your ham and biscuits."

1. Pretzels were great. Honey mustard sauce was awesome.

2. Ham and biscuits: 10/10. Good. Biscuits were the best another coworker rated 10/10....unfortunately yelp only has a 5/5 scale. One guy said one of the best things he&#39;s tried in his entire life.

3. Hamachi: yellowtail, rates mediocre.

4. Toe to tail: awesome, just like all the other ratings describing it.

5. Sausage plate w bacon cornbread: amazing. Cilantro in the beans made every flavor so vivid. The bacon cornbread served w it, he said life changing. It Made 4 of my other coworkers order it cuz it was so good.

6. Pancetta was salty, but isn&#39;t all pork. Delicious to say the least. Served w veggies.

7. I got the natural 10oz chicken. I got it without the barley (living my life low carb right now) but the veggies and the sauce tied it all together. It was amazing and cooked perfectly. Super juicy. Definitely recommend. 

Dessert: 
1:peach cobbler, not what was expected but good.

2:flan, burnt bacon strip w caramel popcorn. Reminds the of a s&#39;more but better. Out of this world. 

3. Homemade chocolate: it&#39;s gluten free and homemade. Delicious :) thanks James. Oh and the manager was outstanding. And the service was prompt and exceptional. 

Definitely recommend. For people that live here. And u out of towers better make a stop here at least once!"

Fried Chicken Appetizer is crispy, tender and juicy. Great sauce

Ham Biscuit sandwiches are super too

The rib eye (bring someone to share it with) is tender and flavorful.

The food was pretty good, but the service left a lot to be desired. After our first round of drinks for our party of 6, which by the way, took 10-15 minutes to prepare, the waiter virtually disappeared. Some of us had empty glasses in front of us for 10-15 minutes, before he returned reeking of cigarettes. That was about the pace of attendance to our table the entire evening. When he finally got around to taking our food order at 9:00 (we sat down at 7:15) he didn&#39;t write anything down, which is always s little disconcerting to me. Sure enough the entree my sister ordered was not submitted, so she had to sit there with nothing to eat for 10 minutes while they prepared her entree.

To its credit, the restaurant comped us dessert, but my expectations were not met in the service experience.

If it could get a more attentive staff, and larger portion sizes, this might be worth the expense, but I&#39;ll wait to hear that it has improved before I return."

My sweet love surprised me and took me here for my birthday dinner because he knew I had been wanting to try this place. He had made a reservation, and albeit we got there nearly 30 min early (ey, plans sometimes change) our table was not ready. Off to the bar for pre-dinner drinks, no problem at all. I had a red winter cocktail which was simply divine and what I would imagine winter to taste like in a little cocktail glass. 

Knowing that they cure their own meats here, I felt it was a MUST to try their charcuterie, and spoiled bday gal I was, we tried it. It was nothing less than delicious. Their salami was my favorite and heavily highlighted the fennel flavors, which was magnificent!  

All the servers seemed to know it was my birthday, so they were nice enough to wish me a good one. And they also sent us glasses of sparking white wine for the occasion. I felt so special, nice touch. :) 

My love ordered the nose to tail plate- I had a taste of course. It was so good, with that sweetly savory sunday gravy on top of that creamy polenta! 

I had the trout on top of lentils and potatoes. SO GOOD. Seared to perfection and bursting with buttery, herby flavor. Totally recommend it, yes definitely worth trying. 

And lastly, they sent me home with a little bag of housemade toffee with salted cocoa nibs (I already had a homemade birthday cake waiting for me at home). 

Such a nice experience. Awesome, attentive service. Wonderful food and beautifully cured meats. If you need to treat yourself, this would be the perfect place to go."

Went there with my SO and we ordered the 3 LB pork chop with a side of Chinese broccoli with XO sauce and it was incredible. Also got the charcuterie plate which was insanely good. The only down side was that we waited about an hour for the pork chop but it was so good that as soon as we dug in we forgot about the wait. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and had amazing fat on it as well. We were ravenous and couldn&#39;t finish it so we took it home to enjoy later. Will definitely be back but will order more apps while waiting for our pork chop.

My girlfriend and I ordered a few dishes and the bill came out to well over $150.  And, sadly enough, we were still hungry after it was all said and done.  Never in my life have I spent so much money on food and still had to go eat a second dinner afterwards.

When I dined here they offered us tasty pretzel rolls but it seemed like it was such a big deal to get another one (our waitress gave us additional pretzel rolls but implied that she wasn&#39;t supposed to do that).  I don&#39;t understand how a restaurant that charges $30 for an entree with small portions can be so stingy in giving their patrons additional pretzel rolls that probably cost them less than $0.50 to make.

The restaurant is a little pretentious with their decor and ordering a drink off an Ipad but I think it&#39;s a little tacky.  

I will admit that the few bites of food I did have were tasty, but not so much that I would be itching to go back."

When I got up to check to see what the new wait time might be after 45 minutes, i watched as the hostess sat a couple of two who walked in. I asked the couple if they had a reservation. Maybe that was too forward of me. Anyways the couple both tell me no, no reservation, they just walked in. So I ask the hostess if there is seating for my couple of two now then. She says that couple has a reservation. I told her I asked them and they told me they had no reservation. She outright shrugs and accepts she just lied to my face. One quick glance shows 5+ open 2 tops. We are immediately and easily seated, after having to wait 45 mins and ask for help on an empty night. Not good enough for a 30$ a plate restaurant. After further thought, 1 star, *decent* food and drink did not nearly make up for such poor, and actually outright dishonest, service. If the restaurant simply does not care whatsoever, what to do? Wait almost an hour and be treated like an after thought. Guess I&#39;m just not into paying more for less."

Despite the glaring rays we opted to sit outside, off of the bar area. Old Major is a cute establishment with good food and sexy employees dressed up in vintage vests but gosh darn! They could do better if they managed the bar area and patio better! The poor bar tender served that entire section with the help of a nice girl refilling our water glasses.

Pros:
Chicken and sauce in Chicken &amp; Waffles were PHENOMENAL
Burger, eggs, and ham biscuits were delicious
Bacon was amazing
Smartly dressed staff in trendy vests
Nice patio area with umbrellas

Cons:
Waffle in Chicken &amp; Waffles was boring buttermilk
Two of my berries had weird looking white stuff on them
They didn&#39;t have enough wait staff in bar and patio area

I believe that Old Major has the recipe for a winning restaurant. It&#39;s definitely a trendy but community joint. The staff seemed to recognize regulars and spoke familiarly. They just have a few loose strings to tie that will move it from good to great!"

I finally got the opportunity to go to celebrate my birthday with my husband for Sunday brunch.

We were one of the first ones in the door at 9:30 on Sunday morning. Got a beautiful table outside under the umbrellas and settled in for a feast.

Drinks: (Yes, we were drinking at 9:30am on a Sunday morning, don&#39;t judge!)

Me: THREE SHIPS TO THE WIND-Bacardi 8, triple sec, pineapple, sparkling wine, whipped cream ~ Very good, easy to digest for brunch

Him: PÉTILLANT SUREAU- St. Germain, Spring 44 gin, sparkling wine, apple bitters, grapefruit, lemon ~ Also very good, I preferred this drink over the other one, as did my husband

Then we moved onto Bottomless Mimosas - I enjoyed the blood orange Mimosa over the others however my husband really enjoyed the cranberry. They are bottomless and the waitress NEVER let us get too low on our drink!

Appetizer: OLD MAJOR CHARCUTERIE PLATE -- daily selection of cured meats ~ Greatness. Nothing over the top, no cheese to get in the way and a simple piece of perfectly toasted bread to spread the pate on... It was really great and an amazing way to sample what Old Major is known for!

Pork fat french fries: They are good... nothing that I felt was amazing, but good.

Entrees:
 FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES -- Sriracha honey ~ This had me going at both ends. First off: The Sriracha honey will be stolen and occur in my home from now on... it is amazing. The waffle is lack luster, not overly crispy or flavorful, needs more depth. The fried chicken is sooooooo good. Seriously! Get this if only for the chicken!!

STEAK AND EGGS -- 8 oz. Aspen Ridge coulotte steak with chimichurri, two eggs any style and country potatoes ~ Very good.. the steak is melt in your mouth tender and cooked to perfection. The rest of the meal is good, however it is really ALL about the steak!

Dessert:

MILK &#39;N COOKIES -- 5- classic chocolate chip, Morning Fresh milk ~ I will stab someone with my fork for another taste of these. Soft, gooey, melt all over your hand as you eat them type cookie. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. The simplicity is divine.

MAPLE BACON CRÈME CARAMEL -- maple bacon custard, Denver Bacon Co. candied bacon, bourbon caramel corn ~ Very tasty, the bourbon caramel corn and bacon make this dish!

LOVE the waitstaff. The bartender is dressed in bowties and vests, love that style and makes it WAY easy on the eyes... 
Our waitress was so helpful, funny and easy to talk to. There is not an air of pretentiousness or arrogance. 
The hostess was by far my favorite person in the place. She got my name and remembered it the whole 2 hours we were there. She was also easy to talk to, had a FUNNY story about handling rude customers and was so easy to be around. I adored her!

We visited there July 13, 2014... it was a great beginning to a date day with my husband!"

We came here last Thursday to celebrate my birthday and had a great time. The atmosphere was great-- lively but not crazy loud-- and we appreciated how friendly and helpful our waiter and all other staff were. Sometimes at restaurants like this, the staff can seem a bit pretentious, but this was not the case at Old Major at all.

I&#39;ll go through each dish we got...
We started with the charcuterie plate (added the cheese) and the fried chicken. We felt we needed to order the charcuterie, since that&#39;s what they&#39;re known for (they make their own) and we weren&#39;t disappointed. We enjoyed everything on the plate. The fried chicken, though, was amazing! So juicy and delicious, and the gravy it came with was great too.

For our entrees, we got the lamb shank and &#34;nose to tail&#34; and shared both. The nose to tail was really interesting, and we enjoyed being able to try many different pork preparations. The pork belly was particularly delicious, and we also really liked the pigs ears. The lamb shank was incredible-- so flavorful and tender. It was also a huge portion-- we had enough to eat the next two days for lunch. So, so good.

Finally, dessert. This was probably our least favorite course (not to say it wasn&#39;t good, but compared to two standout previous courses it was hard to compete). We ended up getting the smoked chocolate dessert, and it was honestly just a little too smoky for our taste. We still enjoyed it (and finished it) though. We also received two complimentary glasses of sparkling rose, which was a really thoughtful touch.

We&#39;ll definitely be back often! We want to move to this neighborhood for many reasons, but now a new reason is so that we can walk to Old Major.... hahaha"

This is what every restaurant&#39;s level of service aspires to be, and that doesn&#39;t even cover the food!

The dishes were well-paced, and the small plates were just the right portions. Very flavorful and satisfying! We very much enjoyed the venison bourguignon, fried chicken, and nose to tail plates. I was at first worried that people in our group wouldn&#39;t be able to find something they like given it was so meat-centric and bit more creative than the average menu, but everyone found something they enjoyed.

I came here by myself and tried the infamous Ham and Biscuits as well as a raw yellowtail dish, both of which were quite good though not particularly life changing. What this restaurant excels at is providing a hip, enjoyable, and vibrant atmosphere.

I know I ordered very few dishes but I felt like the Ham and Biscuits was a good way to test the waters. It was very good but didn&#39;t blow me away. Although it is made in house, the ham is more of a thin and oily cold-cut style than a thicker and drier country ham style. I prefer the latter but that is of course personal. 

The fish dish was not very good and tasted a little off but it was stupid of me to order this in the middle of Denver when there were much better options on the menu.

Anyway, this place has a really cool atmosphere and, along with pretty remarkable service, will definitely provide an enjoyable night to anyone who stops by. I am a fan."

However, I was turned off quite a bit by the server placing orders for food (and calling it out across the bar whilst doing so) for his three friends who were at the bar despite another patron at the bar and I being denied food just minutes before. That time of day (approximately 3pm when I arrived) is apparently the kitchen down time between brunch and dinner service, which I understand and appreciate for the sake of the kitchen staff. It was highly unprofessional to do what he did and I&#39;d certainly have a serious discussion with the server (at the very least) for doing that in front of two other patrons.

I may give their food a shot, as that was the purpose of going to the restaurant in the first place, but it will take some time after that experience. Three stars are for the bartenders who did a good job of being courteous and making a fine old fashioned but minus one for the unprofessional actions of the server."

The Sunday Funday cocktail was a dream! So delicious! Refreshing, smooth, and utilized several of my favorite drinks. And the food, oh the food. My friend had the country fried chicken and waffles and was more than satisfied with leftovers to take home. I got the strata and gravy, and let me tell you what, it was perfect. The potatoes were perfectly crispy and amazing, the sausage was by far the best I&#39;ve had at a restaurant, and the strata was the most delicious combination of flavors I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

Here we have a place that: mixes outstanding cocktails + cures their own meat in-house + has a truly exceptional happy hour. What we have is a real winner, y&#39;all. 

But good luck getting a table. It will take your deepest, most tactile ninja skills to score one of the few bar area seats (you have to be seated here to get HH prices). 

The drinks: The $5 happy hour cocktails are almost too good to be true. Do yourself a favor and have another since they&#39;re so cheap. The Paloma and Blood Orange Bee&#39;s Knees were both refreshing and light. HH is also $2 off draft beer--and they have some good choice. 

The food: we loved it all, and at such great prices, we tried a lot. The oysters were top-notch. The pizza of the day was so yummy! Pork fat fries are a must! Kimchi pork burger was decadent. And of course, the charcuterie plate featuring their house-cured meats....you cannot go wrong.

In the last year, it has taken a dive away from the finer points that made it one of my favorites. 

The restaurant recently made the haughty decision to no longer serve the complementary pretzel rolls and instead place them on the menu for $2.50/ea. As if that wasn&#39;t a slap in the face enough, the pair of ham biscuits went from $8 to $12! The menu has been condensed such that there is no affordable way for a middle class patron to feed themselves, with entrees starting at $28. Oh maybe that&#39;s too harsh...you can spend less and share nibbles on the small plates that suck your wallet dry more slowly. While you&#39;re busting the bank, you could of course split the $75 or $100 options they guide you toward as you sweat out your options (if you can understand what they are given the elitist vocabulary on the menu). Price gouging aside, the beef bourguignon and sides of roasted veggies and creamed spinach were over-salted and sub par. The fried chicken was okay and the ham biscuits were meh...good, but not worth the 50% price increase whatsoever! 

I will never return to this restaurant primarily due to the elitist trend it is riding. The servers and staff are now weird, unfriendly, and arrogant. If this is proper hipster, then great,  but it will never last if anyone stops to think about why they are spending hundreds of dollars on a mediocre meal because it&#39;s trendy and flattering to one&#39;s ego. Management is taking advantage of its clientele and I would almost let that pass if the food was still as good. 

Let&#39;s review: 
1) Excessive salt does not improve flavor. (I write this while chugging water) 
2) Raise prices 50% in less than a year and people are bound to get pissed off.
3) An atmosphere of arrogance and unfriendliness turns people away.

To anyone reading this review- If you want to enjoy a nice meal out and spend your hard earned money a bit more liberally than usual, there are too many excellent restaurants in Denver that will impress you. I regret to inform you that as of December 2015, you missed your window at Old Major."

Definitely a place that is centered around meat but they do it so amazingly well! They bring in fresh pigs every week and butcher them in house themselves and the quality of the meat is unmatched. The charcuterie and the ham and cheddar biscuits are to die for and, surprisingly for a meat heavy restaurant, the dessert was the best I have ever had(butterscotch pot de crime topped with crispy pork skin, you serious Clark?!). The staff was absolutely phenomenal, very friendly and they have great recommendations.I have been to several restaurants that have had sub par staff but you will find none of that here.

Expectations of service and product being the highest possible as they have almost the most expensive menu in the city.  Sadly none of my expectations were met (outside of the cocktails).  When one feels wronged they want to unload...I&#39;ll spare you, and explain why I am telling all that Old Major has &#34;jumped the shark&#34; as almost all good restaurants do one day.  For the owners this all happened on Thursday Nov 5th around 6PMish

1) The staff rudely tried to stick us in the worst possible table--restaurant was empty when we arrived, and never even reached half capacity by the time we left.  Temps were already frigid inside and we were to be placed by the door?

2) Service mildly attentive and not very good.  Had to track her down for my drinks

3) Girlfriend ordered the Alaskan Rockfish...warmish. more like room temperature, very oily, over cooked (where does it say blackened on the menu?)  and entirely too salty. 

4) I ordered the Lamb...hardly enough sauce to put on but more than 4 bites, also not hot

I am not over the top with my assessment as the meal did tab out at $165 for two.  Even for Denver...this was simply bad, and bordered on atrocious when one considers the pricepoint"

I order the chicken and waffles - the waffles were tasty and the chicken perfectly crispy, I also really loved their maple syrup. One of my friends ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy - this was a bit different than what was expected, the gravy came over a not very fluffy biscuit and the sausage patties on the side. The sausage was good, but I would have much preferred the traditional preparation of this dish. Hubby and other friend both ordered the butcher&#39;s breakfast, which was good, but both commented that the overall plate was a bit too salty - but I don&#39;t know if you can expect anything else with cured meats.

The Duck was tough and poorly presented. The service was rushed because we came in around 9:30, and it felt like the the food was rushed as well. God forbid anyone want a decent meal in Denver after 9 pm lol. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but definitely not worth the price and not worth a 4 star rating.

The place is small but not really very cramped.  My lady and I arrived early but they went ahead and sat us so we could begin drooling over menu.  By the time the rest of us showed up I had plenty of time to choose.  I went with the fried chicken and waffles and these were amazing.  Instead of syrup it was served with a sriracha honey concoction that was a perfect compliment tot the dish.  Jess had the ham and biscuits, also very much worth it.  I didn&#39;t really pay much attention to what anyone else ordered as I was too busy stuffing my face, but everybody was happy.

Options for mimosa included a cranberry and a blood orange.  I went with the latter.  The initial taste was powerful, but as I worked my way through the first glass I enjoyed it more and more, so I stuck with that.

But I love Old Major, I want to believe in the continued greatness of this establishment more than anything. I absolutely adore Justin Brunson and think he is so talented, but I was pretty disappointed the last time I went to Old Major, and haven&#39;t been back since.

I really liked the decor and ambiance--lots of rough-hewn wooden surfaces with a modern/old timey vibe. You know what I mean. We sat at a table in the bar area and ordered some of their specialty cocktails, along with an order of calamari, which was like the fanciest calamari ever! Not all breaded and fried, but just cooked and tossed amidst some frisee and micro greens and whatnot. Our cocktails were good and strong--I had some kind of a lemon/citrus thing that came with one of those striped paper straws. I forget what the other people had but I think we all agreed that the drinks were pretty stiff. The food and drinks weren&#39;t cheap, but we felt the quality didn&#39;t make the prices too outlandish. The service was very nice too, and my friends and I had a fun time.

Everything here is pretty darn fantastic. 

We started with the mushrooms and grits. It was quite creamy and delightful. There were a couple different types of mushrooms that helped give the dish a few layers. I think it would benefit from some green onion or cilantro but it&#39;s pretty great.

Next we opted for the mussels but they weren&#39;t good at all- maybe we got a bad batch. It had nothing to do with the broth or how they were cooked, they were just bad mussels. So we sent those back and got smoked sausage with brussels sprouts. The sausage was so fresh. It definitely could have used more brussels sprouts, IMO. The cherry demi-glace did not add anything for me- it was a bit sweet. Great dish overall, though.

We finished with the Nose to Tail because- it&#39;s what you have to do there! It&#39;s definitely large enough to split between two people (especially if you snarf down two appetizers like we did!). They were nice enough to put the pig ears and pierogis on the side to keep it gluten free for me. The rest of the plate included pork belly, pork rib, smoked ham, and a bratwurst. Though the obvious choice for the favorite part is the pork belly, everything was REALLY good. Hubs thought the brat was a bit gamey- just so FRESH- but I found it incredibly delicious. The rib was amazing- all the meat was unbelievably tender- and the surprise for me was the smoked ham. I&#39;m not typically a ham fan, but it was so good.

I do wish there were a few more wines by the glass but I had the Infinite Monkey Theorum Merlot and it actually paired well with everything, so I suppose that&#39;s all you really need anyway. 

It&#39;s definitely not the destination for someone seeking a balanced meal, but if you&#39;re looking to pork out and praise the swine, you&#39;ve found the right place!"

We were starving and had not eaten anything the entire day! I called in to make sure they were serving, and when we got there, we were quickly ushered to a corner seat. The front of house staffer remembered that I called, so that was a nice touch.

We ordered:

1) Pretzels: Awesome! Honey mustard was nice, wouldn&#39;t have minded more kick to the sauce.

2) Smoked Mussel Flatbread: It was nice. I enjoyed it, but it wasn&#39;t anything to shout about. The mussels were a little on the bland side and could have used more flavor.

3) Fried Chicken: This blew our minds away. Having eaten some of the best fried chicken in hip joints in DC, I wasn&#39;t expecting anyone to exceed my expectation. This one did. The meat was moist and the coating was crunchy and spiced right. My significant other and I &#39;fought&#39; for the last scraps. Astounding. Order this.

4) Walleye: We shared this main, since we got a bunch of small plates. Without asking, the server brought us sharing plates and they chopped the fish up so that we would each have our own portions. What amazing service! The walleye was very pleasant, and we both enjoyed that.

5) Dessert: We ordered a special that was not on the menu. It had chocolate ice cream, graham crackers, home made marshmallow and a piece of chocolate (either Hershey&#39;s or something else). This was so-so. Graham crackers did not come through as nice for us, but the ice cream was great, and so was the marshmallow.

Service was really good- especially when they took initiatives to split up our main course for us. Our server was really friendly!

Overall: Yes, I would come back for more. Was it pricey? Yes, it was on the high side, but for the fried chicken- it was worth a visit more."

--Their happy hour burger deal is my favorite in town--a cheeseburger or veggie burger, fries, and a beer for $7 from 10 pm to close! You can&#39;t beat the quality for the price. 

--I&#39;m a sucker for anything midcentury, and their decor knocks it out of the park. Arched lamps, leather booths, vintage barware, and an old school letterboard menu all add to the throwback vibe. 

--The crispy brussels sprouts with green goddess dressing. Oh my god. So good.

I&#39;ve heard good things so, I made it a point to eat here while I was in Denver. A 17-minute walk from my hotel to here, we had to wait for a table. Lots of people usually is a good sign.

We were here on a Sunday so, they only had their brunch menu. I was told to try their gravy fries - supposedly the best fries in Denver. Good thing is that they serve gravy fries all day everyday.

Deviled Eggs:
Nothing special here. They&#39;re your basic deviled eggs - the kind your co-worker brings to a potluck. 3/5

Green Chili Cheeseburger:
The beef patty was tasty and perfectly cooked. Your classic cheeseburger with a mild kick to it because of the green chili. 4/5

Chicago Dog:
Hot dog on a bun with a side of potato chips. Again, nothing special. 3/5

Gravy Fries:
The biggest disappointment. This is supposed to be the best thing on their menu. Think of a poutine but 10 times saltier because of the gravy they use. It was hard to finish even by 3 people. 1/5

I arrived with another co-worker without making reservations and we were able to get a table on the outside patio.

We both started off with drinks, I went with the Blood &amp; Sand which consisted of Pig&#39;s Nose Blended Scotch, Carpano Antica, Vermouth, Leopoldo Tart Cherry Liqueur, orange juice, and Regan&#39;s Orange Bitters. It was quite taste it is something I would recommend trying. We decided to start off and split an order of Steubie Snacks, which are something really unique and almost a must try just for the sheer genius  behind them. Basically Steubie Snacks are tiny pieces of braised pork shoulder which are deep fired and then dredged in power sugar, it really is a unique taste but not something that I would order a second time. For my entrée I went with the Tri-Tip Steak, which was served with a chimichurri butter and fries, the steak was alright but a little tough and the fries were an odd combination, as I would have rather had a more traditional side instead. My co-worker went with the Trout Amandine which was served with Almonds, parsley potatoes, green beans. I will admit that this entrée looked much better than mine.

Overall the experience here was good, however the waitress was rather confused when it came time for the bill. We asked for separate checks, and to have the liquor separate from the entrees. This was a difficult concept for her to produce three receipts for the table, which resulted in her having to print up the receipts a third time. Overall she was friendly buy clearly frustrated with me. The food and atmosphere here was good, and I would like to return for their chicken pot pie, which is only available one night during the week.

Chicken: 2.5 stars as it was reminiscent of Shake n Bake. French onion soup: 3 stars if you like salty. Clam chowder: 3 stars if you like salty. 

Now the fries. Kitchen staff brought out a serving of extremely mushy, old, nasty fries. Our server Ryan agreed that &#34;Those don&#39;t look very good&#34; and was able to bring out a fresh order within a few minutes.

Comfortable and clean.
Food was pretty average. Been here twice had the philly and a French dip. Both times the meat and aujou were fairly flavorless. The horseradish sauce was great, better than expected. 
A bit over priced for what you get, but given the location it&#39;s not bad.
Average overall"
steubens-food-service-denver,Lauric T.,CTSTSOpnJP7qmMq18SfKXA,"San Diego, CA",1,1,0,101,69,1rZIfPEEtqqsJxt9jLh0jQ,4.0,2016-06-13,"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out on Saturday night before we would head back to San Diego the following morning.  We arrived and walked in to the bar entrance, but were quickly directed to the front entrance, where the hostess greeted us and asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  We chose outside to escape the stuffiness and warmth of June, and she walked out to seat us, and promptly noticed that there were no glasses set up for us, and quickly grabbed some for us.

We looked over the menu, and I decided on the fried chicken, while my girlfriend decided to go with an order of garlic green beans, along with a strawberry milkshake, and we also split an order of the Brussels sprouts. Our food was brought out to us, and was quite good.  Nothing blew me away, but everything was solid.  I enjoyed the sprouts although the green beans were a little too sour, or pickled for my taste.  My fried chicken consisted of half a chicken along with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and a bowl of gravy.  My girlfriend really enjoyed the milkshake, finding a real strong fresh strawberry flavor, rather than that ice cream artificial Nesquik flavor, saying it felt like a mix of a smoothie and a milk shake.  She also enjoyed the biscuit saying that it felt like a mix of a regular biscuit and cornbread.

The service was excellent,  It was a tad slow, although they were packed, but they were super  awesome and one of the biggest highlights of this place.  They offered to package up our left overs, and bagged it up for us.  They even put our extra milkshake in a cup for us.  We also asked for plastic utensils so we could finish eating in our hotel, which they kindly provided.  There was also some mix up since we asked both the host and our waiter, but as our waiter brought our bagged food noticed that we didn&#39;t have additional green goddess sauce, and got us a small cup of some to take with with us.

Great place with decent food and amazing service, definitely one of the most accommodating highlights of our trip."

The hostess had no problem rearranging our tables so that we could sit together. No fuss, no hassle. 

Food was wonderful here as always last night. Delicious home style American food you can count on. My boyfriend&#39;s pot roast was delectable. Almost melted in your mouth, it was so good. My Cobb salad was arranged beautifully and didn&#39;t even need dressing. French fries were also well seasoned and crisp.

Number one rule of a breakfast- Don&#39;t screw up the eggs! This seems like a simply concept, but apparently one that Steuben&#39;s couldn&#39;t get right this morning. 

We were the second people to be seated on this Sunday morning and got our order in promptly. I had the &#34;Joe&#39;s breakfast&#34; two eggs, hash browns, toast, breakfast meat of your choice ($10). I ordered eggs over medium with bacon. Over medium -- eggs cooked on both sides; the yolk is cooked through but soft and near liquid at the center. 

What I got was uncooked EGG WHITES and yokes spilling all over the plate when I cut into them. Yuck! Mind you our order was the second to be placed for the morning so not likely the cooks were slammed by any means. My server apologized and took the plate back to be redone.  What came back was basically the same eggs now scrabbled (see photo). I sighed and starred at my plate in disbelief and was quite frankly was too hungry at that point to send it back...again. 

The staff clearly scrapped the undercooked eggs onto the grill and back onto a new plate rather than starting with new eggs. Additionally the bacon was clearly made well in advance and reheated which made it super greasy and hard. Not crunchy awesomeness, just hard. Not good at all. We also ordered a side of gravy which just lacked much flavor at all. 

My friend ordered the &#34;Uptown egg sandwich&#34;- focaccia, basil pesto, 2 eggs, ricotta, fruit ($9) which he said was &#34;ok&#34;. Overall the meal wasn&#39;t bad per say, it was just VERY ordinary tasting as a whole (plus not cooked to order) especially for pricing out at $32 for two meals, coffee and a side of gravy. 

Side note: our server was both friendly and prompt. Thank you. 

Sorry Steuben but I know you guys can do better than this. I just hope management will let the fine cooks there to maybe slow down a bit and get it right...the first time."

Rad, modern diner concept. Serving American comfort foods, that are executed flawlessly.

With nearly 2k reviews, I can&#39;t add much except, 4 stars because it&#39;s just not meant to be a 5 star establishment. Somewhere between divey and modern, but definitely proud about it."

Their go-to is their veggie burger which has no life nor true character, as far as I&#39;m concerned. I keep trying it for some reason, but it just falls apart and has no meaty love when you take a bite. May as well use your spoon, or put it in a wrap of some sort and give it another name. The fries are good. 

Ambiance they have. It&#39;s cozy and friendly. If you&#39;re wanting a mixed drink, the bar staff is well versed and does everything with a genuine smile."

We brought family here for a causal dinner before they return to WI.  Let me tell you that it was the perfect place for that from the retro decor, classic comfort food, drinks and the stellar service provided by the charming Jenna!  We were quickly seated on the heated patio since we didn&#39;t have a preference.  Loved how you get a cool breeze outside but still staying warm underneath the heating lamp.  It was quite crowded here even on a Wednesday night, which is a good sign!

FOOD &amp; DRINKS: we ordered an old-fashioned and chocolate malt shake for drinks. The bartender accidentally made a vanilla one so we got both flavors for free - yay!  This was probably the most sinfully delicious shake I&#39;ve ever tasted!  By the way, quite a few of their beers are around $3-$4 which is rare these days.  For food, we had the fish &amp; chips special, falafel sandwich as the herb roasted chicken.  It&#39;s definitely worth the $15 with the generous portions of cod you get.  This was really close to the fish &amp; chips I had in London!  Now for the falafel sandwich, I was impressed that they actually make the falafel balls in house instead of serving pre-made one!  It made a huge difference in texture and flavor!  The chicken was super tender and all the roasted veggies made this entree a satisfying one!  By the way, you have to try their clam chowder if you&#39;re fan of it!

SERVICE: from the moment we sat down, our waitress, Jenna was so attentive and helpful in ensuring an excellent dining experience!  She is no doubt a pro!  She was very personable and down to earth.  You feel right at home!

All in all, I would absolutely come back again to Steuben&#39;s for their amazing food, reasonable price and attentive service!  I have to come here for their happy hour in the future!"

Service was just okay and the food was below average.

Fish and chips special was soggy. 

They have changed a bunch of their sauces up that are not very good.  B2 sauce and the sauce with the Brussel sprouts.

My hamburger bun was stale.

The heavens were smiling down.

Negatives:
  -  They only had room for 11.
  -  It took almost an hour to get our food.
  -  The food was expensive for what it was.
  -  The food, by and large, was terrible.  My impression is that Steuben&#39;s does a couple of items really well (bacon?) and beyond that they go &#34;meh, they probably won&#39;t come back anyway.&#34;  There are no vegetarian options worth eating.  The salads are wilted iceberg lettuce and gallons of canned dressing.  The veggie burger is God-awful.  Generally there are no non-meat omelet options.

Monte Cristo - Cheddar, Swiss, Ham, Turkey, Raspberry Jam

Butterscotch Pudding

Felt by many to be a modern classic, the expansive dining space, patio and bar located not far from downtown, Steuben&#39;s Food Service was selected for brunch on Saturday in part due to the menu, but also as a result of location, the late morning having been spent touring a few local churches after a memorable visit to the Kirkland Museum of Fine and Decorative Art.

Taking an oldschool look at the &#34;Dining Counter&#34; or Café concept of the 1950&#39;s, those unaware likely to assume the restaurant has been slinging breakfast plates as far back as their grandparents&#39; days, Steuben&#39;s Food Service has actually only been open since 2007, but carving out a cult following through classics invigorated by quality ingredients the menu is not for lack of options, most of it offered all-day with specials sprinkled in for variety.

Large and boisterous, the former auto garage&#39;s patio seating necessitating a 30+ minute wait due to the unseasonably warm February day, it was inside near the back that I was seated and with everything from family meals to a baby shower taking place the scene was both busy and joyful, a pleasant young server at times flexed to other sections, but still maintain his cool and never missing a beat.

Opting to dine in courses, the Restaurant Week menu featuring Steuben&#39;s Lobster Roll admittedly tempting, four a la carte plates were instead selected with a small bowl of &#34;Steubie Snacks&#34; soon to arrive, each small bit of crisp Pork Belly rolled in Powdered Sugar with tangy aioli in a sidecar, the sauce highly praised by some while I personally found it distracting and unnecessary.

Unable to resist a few more signatures, the Chicken and Waffles at an adjacent table easily large enough to share, it was after a short delay that a duo of entrees arrived and with the French Toast still steaming, thus in need of cooling, attention was turned to the traditional *Fried* Monte Cristo with two cheeses plus both meats fully accounted for, each crisp bite giving way to melty insides that were made all the more delicious by a slathering of raspberry jam.

At this point risking the roof of my mouth on French Toast, the room temperature real Maple Syrup actually caramelizing to the edges of cast iron still too hot to touch, suffice it to say that any minor injury is easily forgiven in the setting of fluffy egg bread rich with custard beneath a scoop of Granola and Fresh Berries, the portion almost too much for one and definitely something worth sharing in the presence of more diners in order to sample a wider range of Steuben&#39;s diversity.

Tempted by desserts, though admittedly a bit full with sizable samplings from Four Friends Kitchen and Mercantile Dining &amp; Provisions already under my belt, it was on the suggestion of my server that bites were invested in Butterscotch Pudding served Sundae-style, each smooth bite a blend of sweet and salty beneath forgivingly light whipped cream that helps to make this one of the best puddings in a city that features many."

My go-to is the Monte Cristo but I think their fried chicken is good too. What really stood out to me last time I was there, their desserts.

This restaurant will stick with me in my thoughts and dreams for some time to come. It&#39;s already like a high school...really enjoyable while it was happening, but becoming better and better as I have time away from it.

We were visiting Denver and staying near 17th and Grant. Yelp suggested Steuben&#39;s, so we decided to give it a try. The food was just amazing. The menu has lots of popular choices, but we ended up going with the herb chicken plate and the mac/cheese with bacon. We also started out with a beer and glass of wine.

As far as the beer menu goes, I was very excited to find the graham cracker porter on the menu. My wife had a glass of white wine and was happy with it as well. While they do not have an extensive beer menu, there are more than enough choices to satisfy your proclivity. 

Onto the food.. I started with the french onion soup. Very good. A unique flavor twist, but great cheese and onion flavor to the soup. One of the better French onions I&#39;ve had.

From there, we dove into the main courses. The mac and cheese was so incredible I feel like I have had a moment of awakening. The cheeses used were unlike any version of this I have ever had. So creamy and tasty was the dish that I could not stop raving about it while I ate it. Having the option to add bacon was just icing on the cake..or bacon on the mac in this case. My wife had the herb chicken, which was also splendid. I tried someone, and was very happy with the flavor as well as the complementary vegetables. It is not your average baked chicken. The spices and cooking style made it taste better than any other similar chicken I tried.

At the end of the day, we tried multiple places in Denver on our trip, but no places affected my thoughts and memories like Steuben&#39;s. I can&#39;t wait to come back to Denver so I can eat here again."

The chicken can satisfy a fried chicken craving, and the cheesesteak is excellent.  And the Steubie snacks are uniquely tasty-even my kids liked them. I also like the bento style kids meals with the soft serve to keep them occupied while I enjoy my meal. But the environment just tops off the experience.

Retro, original, super fun.  It is definitely an experience.  I have had cocktails here several times, and the drinks are great. 

We went for brunch and came just about at ten and It was not crowded.  I have been wanting to go with my family for a really really long time and wanted to get the chicken and waffles. So we did.  My daughters got the skillet french toast and biscuits and gravy and Mr man the breakfast burrito.  

Ever since I saw Mildred Pierce I have wanted to try every order of chicken and waffles, and I have had them, all over the city. It&#39;s so dumb, once I have a romantic idea about food or a drink I just cannot let it go.  It&#39;s crazy.. anyway...  Steuben&#39;s chicken &amp; waffle was good, but really not 17.00 good. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the gravy on the side was a nice touch and the waffles were good, but it was not anything particularly memorable.  The one thing that was memorable was that the chicken was very homemade tasting and looking.  I appreciated that about the chicken, down home yum.  The waffle was plain jane.  While I appreciate that Steuben&#39;s sticks to a good ol&#39; plain recipe I do feel like there should be one thing that makes it special.  I think I would have liked it a ton more if it came our hot, it came out warm and it was cold 1/2 way through the meal. 

After a bit my husband and daughter asked to get theirs warmed up, (the waitress told us to watch for the hot plate but we touched it and it was not even warm) and they sent out 2 whole new meals.  This was great, but I found out how much of a difference dishes served HOT are.. my husbands breakfast burrito went from ok/kinda good to REALLY good.  But we all were already on the downward spin so it kinda made it a bit disappointing because now we knew what we missed.   I think the chicken might have been REALLY good served hot.     The biscuits and gravy were a bit bland and the biscuits were dry and grainy somehow. 

I am coming back, the french toast was lovely beautiful  and yummy.  I hope its hot!!"

Now for the important review, the bathroom. 

Alright, call me new school, call me disrespectful of the classics, call me whatever you want, but an old school urinal where the bottom drain is located in between my feet is not okay. Pro tip: don&#39;t wear your new Yeezy&#39;s here if you don&#39;t want piss in the netting. 

Next we have the atmosphere. There was a nice scented candle burning which really added a nice smell and a touch of home to the overall setting. It complimented the sink nicely. Also, there was a very modern art style chandelier in the restroom. This is something I don&#39;t see often. It made me feel slightly regal. However, the soap was built in to the sink, I felt a bit like I was in too public of a restroom there, thank god for that scented candle and the modern chandelier. 

Here&#39;s the big kicker and the second reason why this men&#39;s room got three stars. They were out of paper towels. Classic bathroom mistake. I had to wipe my hands dry on my gap chinos. Believe me, gap pants do not do well in water. 4/5."

Waitress stopped in to greet us at the table then left us to decide on the menu. It took her way too long to come back to take a drink order. Over 5 mins later I believe. 
Ordered drinks,apps and entrees at once. 
Drinks arrived quick. I ordered the Steuben lime Rickey which was refreshing n tasty. 
We ordered the mac n cheese, Brussels sprouts for apps. The Brussels sprouts were tasty but after awhile it just tasted the Brussels chips from being so fryed. The mac n cheese was very cheesy, bland and no crusty top.  Both apps were average nothing great. 

For the main course I ordered the meat loaf expecting home cooking but far from it. 
Whether it&#39;s a mid west thing but the meat loaf came to the table in a reddish gravy that just didn&#39;t fulfill my expectation of moms home made meat loaf.  I am use to seeing meat loaf in a rich brown gravy. The presentation of the meatloaf looked unappetizing. I had a bite of it and it just was something very different.  Would not consider this meatloaf in my review. It was sweet and the meatloaf had no texture. The so-called gravy was just strange. 
My friend had the roasted chicken which also looked in appealing when it arrived. The chicken had  no color to it. Looked very pale and drenched in the sauce. As for taste, it was bland. No flavored infused in the roasted chicken at all.  The veggies were fresh but some under cooked. 
Overall my expectation of this place was disappointing.

Post-driving back from Aspen

Pre-red eye flight back to Tampa

We did quite a bit of research on the long drive from Aspen, and Steuben&#39;s seemed to be our best bet. It&#39;s probably the coolest diner you&#39;ll ever visit. And their late hours could not have been more clutch for us, considering that many of the nearby businesses were already closed, late on a Sunday night.

Because we are sheep, my fiance and I ordered the lobster roll, and the fried chicken - two of the most Yelped about items. I know lobster rolls in Denver in December probably aren&#39;t ideal, but it&#39;s physically painful for me to NOT order the lobster roll when it&#39;s on a menu. It was probably as good as it gets when you&#39;re 2,000+ miles away from New England. The, then girlfriend, now fiance enjoyed her chicken and biscuit much to the same tune.

I love the style of Steuben&#39;s. It feels like a diner in 1967. My word-association with Steuben&#39;s is Miller Lite. I think about those throwback cans and old school commercials from a simpler time, and I think about Steuben&#39;s. 

We&#39;d definitely visit again!"

My dinner date this night is on a no/low-carb meal plan, and I knew many dishes on the Steuben&#39;s menu would be able to accommodate his restrictions.

Now I&#39;m going to sound like a terrible person.

I am passionate, to a fault, about Steuben&#39;s gravy fries. I order them every single time I go, and while I know I&#39;ll never finish the whole plate there, left-over gravy fries make an awesome midnight snack.

So, despite the fact that my date couldn&#39;t touch the fries, I ordered them. (I did ask him ahead of time if it would bother him, and he assured me that it wouldn&#39;t).

Awesome, as usual!

Since I put a large dent in the fries, we decided to split an entrée. We ordered the Trout Amandine. To our surprise, it arrived on two plates! Our wonderful server had the kitchen divide the entrée for us. 

The fish was perfectly cooked, delicate, yet tasty. It seemed to be missing any &#34;amandine&#34; flavor, but it was scrumptious nevertheless. It arrived with a side of potatoes and green beans.

The staff at Steuben&#39;s are stellar. They always go one step above the traditional scope of service here. I&#39;ve never had an unpleasant experience.

The atmosphere is fun and conducive to big groups, families and a general good time. It&#39;s probably not a spot I&#39;d ever recommend for a romantic evening out. My only issue is the acoustics are such that it gets quite loud in the dining room and it can be difficult to easily carry on a conversation; but that being said, I&#39;ll add that I do have some mid-grade hearing loss, so it may not be the issue for the general population that it is for me.

Steuben&#39;s will always be my favorite local spot for dinner!"

However, what pushed this from a four to a five star review was our waiter Sean (Shawn?). I&#39;ve worked in various client services roles for my whole life, and this was a top 5 customer service experience for me.

I ordered devilled eggs (skip this) and cheese and gravy fries for appetizer and Etoufee.  The etoufee was flavorful and just the perfect size.

Not realizing that they could run out of their special we took our time to order. We ordered a chicken pot pie and some Mac and cheese. Our server, Gaby, quickly ran to the kitchen saying &#34;oh no wait one second I think we have one left&#34; she was one second too late and came back with some sad news. She then saw our reaction to not being able to order the chicken pot pie and said &#34;hold on let me see what I can do!&#34; She ran back to kitchen and sweet talked the chef into serving an &#34;ugly&#34; looking pot pie (only because a piece of crust had fallen off) for us! Our waitress and the manager came out to make sure it was ok that we would get an &#34;ugly looking&#34;&#39;pot pie but that the taste would be the same!

Yes, I am a green chile cheese fry addict (I swear, I have been trying to go to the support meetings, but I just can&#39;t kick my habits), but the gravy fries are a whole other species of fry.

Thin cuts of potatoey goodness (thin fries are my favorite) smothered in tons of brown, tasty, warm gravy, and drenched in delicious white cheese that parties together in my mouth, oozes down to my stomach, and makes me melt in my chair, all the way to the ground.  It ain&#39;t poutine (another species of fry that I hope never becomes endangered.  I would risk going to jail if they outlawed poutine.  And green chile cheese fries.  And gravy fries.  Crap, where was I going with this?  I told you, I&#39;m an addict.  Leave me alone), but it hits the spot.  Oh so hard.  And good.

And when I&#39;m feeling like a real hipster in its true form, I crack myself open a can of PBR at happy hour and soak in the sun on the fabulous patio.  Or inside the cozy dining room.  Doesn&#39;t quite matter to me.

Other things that you can&#39;t go wrong with: The herb roasted chicken (it&#39;s like a whole chicken on your plate, minus the head and all the gross parts) served with mashed taters and veggies, the mac and cheese (I love me some mac and cheese with a thick gooey creamy sauce), and the pot roast (just like Mama used to make).

Comfort food with a Colorado twist.  The wait can be a little long at times, but it&#39;s worth it.  Great for a date night, dinner with friends, or catching up with the relatives from out of town.

Ugh, gravy fries.  Why do you haunt me so.  I got a fever, and the only prescription is Steuben&#39;s gravy fries.  Someone help!"

Biker Jim&#39;s - as its been told and will be told from generation to generation - was once a hot dog cart that roamed the streets of Downtown Denver, specifically 16th Street Mall. As the hot dog cart business began to flourish, he then opened the Biker Jim&#39;s restaurant. 

You order at the counter from a menu with a variety of meat - Elk, wild boar, beef, pork, bison, veal, rattlesnake - while in stock. Then you choose your toppings of choice - caramelized onions, cream cheese - as well as your side of choice - French fries, fried pickles, etc. 

Best part: they have a toppings bar where you can find onions, yellow mustard, deli mustard, craft ketchup, jalapeños, large slices of pickles - TOPPINGS GALORE! (That&#39;s all I can remember lol I&#39;m quite sure there&#39;s more options)

I also really like the Sonoran topping - it  definitely has a kick with the jalapeños.  

The sides are delicious too!  I recently tried the roasted cauliflower which was well cooked and had a nice tahini sauce on top.  It also came with a side salad.  The fried mac and cheese are the best though - little blocks that crispy on the outside and filled with hot gooey mac and cheese on the inside.  I would totally order both sides again.

Jim puts together some very interesting flavors in the sausage grinder.  I have had the jalapeño elk before and today I had the rattlesnake pheasant with the conspiracy topping (bleu cheese, lemon aoli, red onion bacon marmalade, and french fried onions).  I mean ... c&#39;mon... just being able to tell people you had rattlesnake for lunch is worth the trip.

But Jim doesn&#39;t sleep on the toppings.  Chili with a overtone of venegar.  Lemon aoili with a sweet tang, a tomato curry jam at the condiment station.  Every ingredient and topping is considered with care.

Top it off with Boylan Bottling fountain soda and you have an amazing experience.  Check it out."

I don&#39;t know, something about a place that serves reindeer, veal, boar, elk, rattlesnake, and duck, all in glorious sausage form, just seems like heaven. It&#39;s a selection akin to Noah&#39;s Ark, except you get to eat the animals.

Naturally a place that has such a cornucopia of diverse, tube-shaped foods brings with it an inevitable after-birth: the decision on what to eat. Not living in Denver it was extremely tough, as there were several I wanted to try but we had dinner reservations, sadly. 

So I opted for the Elk Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage with El Diablo toppings and was not disappointed. I really like how they are flame grilled almost right in front of you, all on a doughy-but-not-too-big bun and with the sauces they offer, really makes each order unique.

Needless to say, I really liked Biker Jim&#39;s and I will definitely be back to have some fun with their awesome lineup of sausages and sides."

Around lunchtime on Friday, I set out to find the truck on 16th. I searched and searched to no avail until I realized there was a storefront also not too far away.

I walked over, ordered, and my food was ready shortly thereafter.

Biker Jim&#39;s seems to be known for their crazy meats (reindeer, elk, veal, wild boar, among others), but I took the basic route and selected the all beef dog wrapped in bacon with the &#34;international topping&#34; -- wasabi, caramelized apples, and white cheddar. I added a side of fried mac and cheese for good measure.

Holy WOW. By far, and I&#39;m not exaggerating, this was the best hot dog of my life. Meaty, crunchy, and dressed perfectly. I ate every last bite, which meant I struggled with the fried mac.

I really enjoyed sitting at one of their curbside tables and stayed for quite a bit of time.

I do wish Yelp would like us give 1/2 a star, because they are really a 4 1/2 star joint - but I just can&#39;t give that 5th star to them.

They offer a unique blend of different &#34;dogs&#34;, with everything from snake to regular old beef. Every one I&#39;ve tried is good, but there is nothing I&#39;ve ever tried that I&#39;ve just been like &#34;this is the best dog I&#39;ve ever had&#34;. Honestly, I think they&#39;ve down played the flavors of the unique meats a bit to make them more &#34;standard&#34; tasting - which is why I can&#39;t give the 5th star.

They have a pretty unique offerings of toppings, which is what I think really set&#39;s them a part, and why I think many people give them 5 stars. However for me, it&#39;s more about the dog itself than the toppings.

Either way, they are really good, and are worth the time and money. So I very much recommend them, just don&#39;t expect to really taste something unique from the dog&#39;s themselves."

Choose a dog, any dog, but be prepared to spend a long time doing it because their options are ridiculous! I found myself torn between the Alaskan Reindeer, Wild Boar and the Pheasant. Not even anything crazy, but I could tell based on the ingredients I couldn&#39;t go wrong. To be honest, after I ordered I completely forgot what I got. What I do remember, was that we all got something different and loved them! 

Your side options are equally ridiculous with fried mac n cheese, deep fried pickles and their tahini cauliflower. All delicious. I specifically ordered the Mac because, let&#39;s be real, I can&#39;t say no to it! And it definitely did not disappoint.

I went with the elk jalapeño cheddar dog, and my table got fried mac &#39;n cheese, deep fried pickles, and charred tahini cauliflower to split. When my dog was ready, I topped it with a little mustard, but it really didn&#39;t need anything extra because it was bursting with juicy flavor. It was huge but I couldn&#39;t help but finish every bite. I will warn those that aren&#39;t into spicy that this dog definitely packed a kick. I assume if you order something with jalapeño in the title, you&#39;re ok with that.

Of course, I had to try the sides. The fried mac &#39;n cheese is what dreams are made of. The cauliflower was also surprisingly addicting. I also LOVED that they had whole pickle spears as part of their topping bar. Can this be a regular thing?

If you&#39;re looking for just regular toppings such as mustard, ketchup, relish and kraut, those are all serve yourself in the dining area. There are also a couple of burger choices on the menu, as well as a kids&#39; size dog and milk shakes. Great choice for lunch!"

My friend recommended this place which is pretty similar but it was in the middle of all the breweries so we decided to stop here. I got the Alaskan Reindeer sausage and it was soooo good. It was super buttery and flavorful. The bread was nicely toasted. I also liked that they have a toppings bar (pickles, jalapeños, sauerkraut and others). Food came out pretty quick.

This is NOT your typical &#34;hot dog place&#34;!!
I am blubbering and falling over my words....
Beef hot dogs are the MOST plebian, MOST ordinary dog on their menu!  Come here for the world&#39;s MOST DELICIOUS Elk, Boar, Rattlesnake, Reindeer, Pheasant, Duck...and VEGAN dogs!!  Everything is absolutely amazing! The flavors are out of this world!! And the way they dress them up... can you believe a Cordon Blue dog? A dog with avocado purée, tomato cream cheese, caramelized onions &amp; bacon??!
And if you&#39;re not into meat, their vegan dog or the grilled cauliflower salad (OMG!!) will send you home on a cloud!!
Not to mention the drop-dead delicious Chipotle brownie ice cream sandwich...big enough for 4 (and believe me, I am NOT the kind of person who usually wants to share my ice cream!).

This place is open till 3AM on the weekends....and it&#39;s packed!

The Alaskan reindeer brat goes really well with El Diablo sauce which consist of green chile salsa smoked bacon Siracjhi mayo. The wild boar with cranberries is also great all around and taste great with the house made tomato curry sauce or at least tasted homemade. The side of baked beans with peppers pairs nicely with tasty sausages or brats don&#39;t really care what they call em but I call them delicious.

I went with the classic toppings, and it went very well with the hot dog. 

I also got the fries, and it was very crispy and fresh. It was seasoned very well. So, kudos to Biker Jim&#39;s crew for their great food. 

I really like their unusual meat selection. Jack-A-Lope? Riendeer? Elk? I mean what else do you want. I wanted to try more of their hot dogs, but had to try other places out that day, and I was very short on time. 

The interior is very spacious, and they also have an outside seating. The service is very friendly and fast. I will definitely come back whenever I am in Denver to try their different kinds of meats."

Biker Jim&#39;s knows what they&#39;re doing when it comes to the fancy hot dog game. Hot dogs are normally just plain jane ketchup and mustard kinda dealios but Biker Jim&#39;s turns the dial up to 11 and offers up a hot dog experience that can&#39;t be matched elsewhere.

My hot dog was so good. I opted for the Southwest Buffalo dog with the Classic toppings. I admit, I was kinda skeptical of the Classic style because cream cheese just seems so weird on a hot dog, but man was I wrong. It was genuinely a perfect combo. The sweetness of the cream cheese balanced out the slight spice kick of the Buffalo dog and created this perfect hot dog harmony zen. So good. 

I love their variety in menu meats though. I mean, who knows what&#39;s in a typical hot dog anyways, so why not go to the extreme and get Rattlesnake or Reindeer or even the super mysterious Vegan? So much to choose from and I want to try them all.

This is one of those restaurants that you take your friends to if they&#39;re visiting you from out of state. It&#39;s got all that local feel to it and it offers what really seems like a legit Colorado experience. Definitely one of those must have places."

Seriously though, Biker Jim thank you for your soft touch and pure unadulterated satisfaction that happened while I was here, never once did I feel uncomfortable or stuffed. Well, maybe just a tad stuffed. 

The hot dogs are main star here, but the sides could easily share the same billing on the menu. I mean shit; Fried Mac &#39;n Cheese, Baked Beans, Hand Cut Potato Chips, Deep Fried Pickles, and for the meat-free weirdo&#39;s, Charred Tahini Cauliflower. I was able to try every single one of those sides and they are all amazing. I was here with a large group so I was able to snack off everyone&#39;s basket, but If you roll solo or duo, you must get the fried mac n&#39; cheese and pickles. Sharing is caring. 

That list above is enough to get me to eat here, but let&#39;s not forget those hot juicy dogs. I went with the Elk Jalapeno Cheddar sausage and it was filled with pure majestic wildlife flavor with just a touch of Wisconsin laden happiness. I topped it with Biker Jim&#39;s classic fixings, cream cheese and caramelized onions. The spicy dog and caramelized onions were a perfect pairing and cream cheese brought everything together nicely.  Bookmark this place right now!

That said, by the name alone this place had also upped my expectations and I was jonesing for one of the best hot dogs of my life. So did biker Jim&#39;s deliver? 

Heck yes, it did!

You pick your dog, and then you pick your topping. They&#39;ve got dogs ranging all the way from beef, &#34;the perfect all American hot dog,&#34; to freaking Jack-A-Lope. Are you kidding me? Is this legitimately a rabbit/antelope blend? (Biker Jim, if you&#39;re reading this, I really want to know!) &#34;That sounds disgusting, I&#39;m a vegan!&#34;, you say... No worries - Biker Jim&#39;s has got plant based dogs for all you vegematics. Likewise, if the concept of veganism scares the crap out of you, there&#39;s a Rattlesnake and Pheasant dog with your name on it. 

I went with the Elk and Jalepeno dog, (you heard me - Elk and mother#$*%ing jalepeno, son,) topped with &#34;The Coney&#34; - rich, meaty, not too spicy New Jersey style chili with diced onions and yellow mustard. It was a redneck carnival ride with mass appeal to pro-local sustainable-aholic hipsters... in my mouth!

Do yourself a favour and cruise through the photos. Yes, the dogs taste as good as they look. Admittedly, half eaten hotdogs don&#39;t take the most flattering photos, but I hope you can see through the mess and decipher just how damn good that must taste. Trust me, friends, it does. It does taste that damn good.

Huge thanks to Bike Jim who came by to say hi to us. It was a huge pleasure to eat at your restaurant and admire your hot dogs, girls, and motorcycles photo wall. You added a wonderful heaping helping of quirk to my Denver trip that week, and to your city on the daily. Thanks again!"

 I went on a Saturday that their was a Rockies game. Expecting a long line there wasn&#39;t much of one. 

I got the jalapeño elk dog adding some great toppings. If you like a small little kick I recommend this! 

The hot dog had the perfect snap when biting into  it, again perfect spice blend and overall one of the best hotdogs I&#39;ve eaten.

To start the menu is quite overwhelming, with over a dozen of great choices its hard to pick only one. So I chose a classic; The Elk Jalapeno Cheddar,  no exaggeration this was the best hot dog I have ever had in my entire life!! Sadly I ordered it to go and was late to the game otherwise after the first bite I would have turned around and ordered 3 more! (If I knew the Rockies were gonna lose I would have just stayed and ate hot dogs all night)

The restaurant also has a great atmosphere, definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and drink with friends. Do yourself a favor and stop by sometime! Definitely better than watching the Rockies lose."

It&#39;s hard to choose which one you want to try, but you make your choice of sausage ($6.50 for most) and you can add different toppings ($1.25 addl) as well, so it would take a long time to try all the combinations!  This brick and mortar store is no frill décor, but spacious and clean.

We ended up with the Duck Cilantro with &#34;The International&#34; topping (wasabi aioli, carmelized apples, and shaved Irish cheddar) and the Jack-A-Lope with &#34;Biker Jim&#39;s Classic&#34; topping (cream cheese and caramelized onions).  The duck cilantro was awesome and the topping made it even better, despite the fact that I&#39;m not a huge wasabi fan.  I could eat this dog every day!  Jack-A-Lope was a bit too spicy for my liking, but the Biker Jim&#39;s classic toppings were great and would make even a regular dog tasty!

We also had an order of fried mac and cheese, 6 logs of cheesy goodness that were a little smaller than a Twinkie.  Breaded and fried mac and cheese?  Yes please!  Bonus points for cool fountain soda- unique flavors, a nice variety from your normal Coke/Pepsi/Sprite."

I went for the reindeer dog with apples, cheese and wasabi aioli and my guy got the elk jalapeno-cheddar sausage with cream cheese and onions on top. We also ordered a side of the mac and cheese bites.

When our order came out there were fries with our dogs. The guy behind the counter says &#34;We had extra fries so you get fries too.&#34; Well, if you insist! 

The first thing I noticed about the dogs was their size - they are big! They are big sausages, on a big roll with lots of toppings. The second was the taste - so good! The meat itself was very flavorful and the toppings complimented it nicely. The bun was also nice and soft. I was expecting a little more kick from the wasabi aioli but it was very mild. Not a bad thing IMO, but if you want spicy you might be bummed out. But speaking of spicy, the elk sausage did have a kick to it. You could definitely taste the jalapenos. 

The mac and cheese bites were yummy fried cheesy goodness. Everything you expect from fried mac and cheese.

I couldn&#39;t quite finish my whole dog (I told you they were big) but we both left with full bellies and smiles on our faces."

- Fair prices
- Friendly staff
- Pop soda with extra fizz
- About $10pp

If you want to save a few bucks or just want a naked dog, you can! Get a plain dog and add your own toppings by the Coke machine.

I wanted something exotic but close to beef so I ordered the Southwest Buffalo dog with Coney Island topping ($7.75). It was packed with the meaty full bodied flavor you would expect from any good Coney Island dog. They really pack on the toppings!

My wife was a little less adventurous and picked up an All beef dog with Sonora topping ($6.25). She was really happy with the fresh veggies, which were super refreshing on a hot day.

Just because I can, the Deep fried macaroni and cheese ($2) was next up. A small comes with three twinkie sized pieces. They had a perfectly toasted exterior and creamy interior that will make you drool by the memory.

I look forward to coming back and trying the different meats. It&#39;s a great value just a few blocks from Coors Field and makes a great pre-game meal."

Their fried Mac and cheese has perfected moistness, but could stand a bit more seasoning. The cauliflower side was weak, sadly, very little cauliflower, tasty dipping sides, but limp, blackened cauliflower, and not enough of it.

If Bourdain ate it, so was I. Biker Jim&#39;s on Larimer is the brick-and-mortar version of this popularized Denver street cart eatery originally stationed around the 16th Street Mall. The concept is interesting and the prices are kept low. For $6.50, why the hell not try something new for the price of a ballpark dog? 

Just like you can customize a pizza or burrito these days, you pick a sausage, choose a topping, and add a side. I was intrigued by the variety of meat choices, but wanting to maximize the flavors, I went for the rattlesnake &amp; pheasant. I topped it off with the popular desert topping and added on some fried mac &#39;n cheese. I also tried some of my friend&#39;s duck cilantro and southwest buffalo. All of the meats had the same texture, but the flavors were subtly different. I liked mine the best as the rattlesnake &amp; pheasant had a slightly sweet finish with the addition of the Malaysian curry jam. If you were to choose a side, get the fried mac &#39;n cheese. These come in sticks and were perfectly fried and gooey on the inside. The charred tahini cauliflower was also a new dish I&#39;ve never tried.

It&#39;s somewhat surprising, but refreshing to come to a place expecting sausages, but with a brand new twist of flavors. I loved the multitude of flavor combinations and drawing inspirations from different cuisines. I&#39;ll need multiple return visits to cross off all the exotic meats off my list."

So here&#39;s how it works --

1. Choose meat
2. Choose toppings 

As simple as this sounds, their dogs (why does this sound so weird? But you know what I mean) are no where near simple. They are hearty, meaty and full of flavor! 

I got the elk jalapeno topped with el diablo (green chile salsa, sriracha lime mayo, bacon bits). My boyfriend got the reindeer topped with the conspiracy (bleu cheese, bacon red onion marmalade, lemon aioli and french fried onions). Both came hot, fresh, juicy and finger-licking delicious!

Think that&#39;s pressing my luck? Then buckle up: the last time I was there, I got to eat luch with Biker Jim himself. You may swoon now.

We came here in a big group, and they&#39;re built to handle the lunch rush. We jumped in line, and then ordered, and filled drinks, and then waited patiently for what was only a few minutes until they handed us tons and tons of dogs.

I went with the pheasant because if you have a chance to get pheasant, you just do it, duh. I liked the lighter take than a traditional pork sausage and it wasn&#39;t gamey or greasy. I went naked, but you can get any of a slew of toppings on them. 

We also went sides crazy with stuff like fied mac &#39;n cheese, chips, fried pickles (my fave), baked beans, and some sort of cauliflower that was surprisingly great. If you&#39;re meat free, you&#39;re still going to find plenty to eat. If you&#39;re fried food free, you&#39;ll probably steer clear of these sides.

Super great lunch. As a dude who grinds meat to make his own gourmet sausages at home, I&#39;ve got nothing but mad love for what you&#39;re pulling off here.

The service was quick and friendly, and the portions were definitely fairly priced. They were accommodating (I asked for less onions on my dog and they were happy to do that for me), and the atmosphere was relaxed, comfortable, and unique.

Be warned about the fried mac and cheese bites: they are RICH. We ordered a full size (6 pieces) because we thought the half size (3 pieces) wouldn&#39;t be enough for us, and combined with our dogs, we barely made it through 3 pieces. 

Great food, fair prices, friendly service, unique atmosphere. Definitely a place to check out for a great lunch in Denver!"

Its a casual spot without any frills. You take a look at the menu boards, order, &amp; wait for your order to be called. There are self serve condiments near the soda fountain machine (that carries a soda brand made with real sugar cane, not artificial sweeteners) like shredded cheese, hot sauce, &amp; sauerkraut to name a few. 

Their specialty is exotic meats. Alaska reindeer, elk jalapeño cheddar, rattlesnake and pheasant,  wild boar, German veal, buffalo, &amp; a few more. Once you choose the type of meat you choose the toppings. One interesting selection of topping that stood out was the desert: harissa roasted cactus, malysian curry jam scallions,  cilantro, &amp; onions two ways.

I played it safe for fear of overpowering my Alaskan reindeer. I chose the biker jim&#39;s classic: cream cheese and lots of caramelized onions. I know it may seem like an odd combination but the board had the word classic in it, so I figured it&#39;s a popular choice. 

The meat was tender, moist, flavorful, &amp; lean.  The cream cheese and caramelized onion were a combination that complimented it well without stealing the spotlight &amp; the bun was fresh and fluffy. I contemplated the condiments at the soda fountain but decided against it. The combination was simple and tasty as it was. I was a little disappointed the rattlesnake and pheasant weren&#39;t available that day,  but I&#39;ll be back!"

Joking with a friend that a hot dog at Coors&#39; Field would not be a part of my Stadium Series experience, it was instead to Biker Jim&#39;s that a brisk walk from LoDo would detour and although perhaps not as &#39;craft&#39; or creative as Chicago&#39;s dearly departed &#34;Hot Doug&#39;s&#34; there is little doubt that the foremost purveyor of Artisan encased meats in Denver is turning out a top tier product made from some truly unique stuff.

Originally fashioned as a food cart, Jim Pittenger&#39;s former career oddly enough that of a Repo Man, Biker Jim&#39;s now features several locations throughout town and with the Larimer Street brick and mortar location easily the most convenient it was nonetheless that our arrival was met by almost no wait, a total of two dogs and a side selected naked despite several condiments available both for free and for purchase.

Charging a base price of $6.50 per &#34;dog,&#34; perhaps more pricey than a traditional cart but a veritable steal when accounting for the ingredients...let alone the typical cost of a Ballpark Frank...Biker Jim&#39;s interior is spacious and loud with sounds bouncing off high ceilings, yet the moment your number is called to come up and grab your order any distraction becomes secondary to the flavors, each of several options grilled atop a toasty bun with flavors suited to those both daring and meek.

Largely focused on game, meats both domestic and distanced ground to craft each bite, tasting began with the exceedingly lean farm raised Alaskan Reindeer with a clean, grassy flavor stuffed inside a snappy casing while the combination of rattlesnake and pheasant offered far more funk and sapor, the familial fowl predominantly what my tastebuds detected, though I cannot purport any previous experience with snake from which to make a judgement of its contributions.

Opting against dessert as the options were limited in the setting of a day that had already trended quite sweet, it was instead a sizable side of Fried Macaroni and Cheese that was shared by the table, each bite a perfect balance of creamy and crisp without any residual oil, a rare feat making this particular version of the bar food favorite one of the very best around."

We showed up several minutes before closing, but the employees were ready to go and very willing to serve us! We got our order in minutes (Wild Boar with one of their toppings suggestions... I wish I could remember what it was called). IT WAS SO GOOD! We would&#39;ve gotten three more if we weren&#39;t going to eat brekky right after.

My first time thank god was really awesome. That was their cart. And that was the smoky Alaskan Reindeer. That was good! Ever since then I crave their offerings. 

So last night post yelp CMYE the four of us headed out. I ordered the Wild Boar ( Wild Bore). In their own words they described this choice as Apricots and cranberries and smoky. I like anything smoky so to me it was a no brainer and went for it. With Biker Jim&#39;s classic topping minus the onions. It was the smallest dog in the grill. I can excuse the size as long as it&#39;s tasty. You don&#39;t have to have the girth to have a happy night:) Well it wasn&#39;t tasty. It just laid there and bored the hell out of my taste buds. Tasteless and small? Two of the things that almost killed my night if not for the awesome company we had. Sad night indeed. So based on that I&#39;d avoid the Wild Boar for the lack of even the basic pop in the dog when you bite on it. Wild taste factor: ZERO. BOAR(iNG).

While in line I had a small conversation with a group of girls and one of them suggested the Fried Mac n Cheese. She swore by it. I ended up ordering it. Half order 3. Full 6. I think it was a hit more than the Wild Boar (Bore). 

I find no fault with the staff. They&#39;re an amazing bunch. More power dudes!

You can choose to sit in or like us we chose to enjoy whatever&#39;s left of summer and sat outside. 

I&#39;m still a fan of Biker&#39;s Jim. Next time I will definitely stay away from the Boring Wild Boar."

I&#39;m not vegan, but my brother is vegan so I keep my eyes open for vegan friendly places. This is definitely one of those places. Most of the sides are vegan (and not for an extra charge).

They had 2-3 hot dog varieties that were vegan as well, and I wasn&#39;t brave enough to try any of the specialty meats like rattlesnake and whatever else. It probably seemed lame, but I got an all-beef hot dog with no toppings.

Okay, I&#39;ll be honest. I&#39;m from Chicago, but I hate mustard and onions and most all the toppings that go on a Chicago style hot dog. I am constantly judged and hated in Chicago for these things. Not really, but I live in secret.

So I was excited to dump ketchup on my all-beef dog without judging eyes watching me. The hot dog is huge and cooked really well. The bread it comes on is of the higher quality, like hearty Italian bread.

For my side, I went with the fried mac-n-cheese. I wasn&#39;t feeling too great this day probably due to elevation sickness. I was only in Denver for three days, but I took it to-go and ate it later.

Let me just say, I&#39;ve had a lot of places with the fried mac-n-cheese bites. This places HANDS-DOWN made it the best. THE BEST. Only things I liked was the soda fountain contained better quality soda/pop than your usual pepsi or coke products. I got a water as I usually do, but I liked that option.

My food was great, the service was normal, and this place really has unique and great options to chose from. I&#39;ll definitely be back next time I visit Denver!"

I had the spicy vegan sausage, and only topped it with the normal toppings- ketchup, mustard, etc. The portions are huge, which is definitely a plus. The fries were delicious, and my boyfriend and i completely finished our portion. The sausage was okay, you could definitely tell it was homemade, which is always a plus.

I&#39;m a vegetarian, so usually the fake hot dogs I get served up are rubbery soy dongles that taste like salt plus whatever condiment used to mask the salt. Not so at Biker Jim&#39;s. There are two choices for vegan dogs -- herby and spicy -- and both are great, but the spicy is out of this world. The texture is rich and each bite is flavorful, without any need for condiment masks, although the locally made ketchup and mustard is pretty great.

Then there&#39;s the toppings, which are exciting, creative, and fun. I went with the Sonoran, then the Desert, both of which are packed with flavor and combine ingredients I&#39;d never imagined on a hot dog. Harissa roasted cactus? Malaysian curry jam? Sign me up. The sides I tried were the salad -- actually very good -- and the charred tahini salad -- out of this freaking world.

UH OH HOT DOG!! You got that uh oh right, uh oh I might eat more hot dogs here than I will in my entire life. With a menu filled with exotic meats, I literally wanted to try them all.

The elk was classic and the reindeer was Sonoran style. We also got a side of fried mac&amp;cheese because I was curious of this divine tasting novelty.

Verdict? Elk was too dry and the cream cheese made the dog too sickening to eat another bite. The reindeer on the other hand was the total opposite, plump and juicy. The veggies and beans worked well together. The fried mac&amp;cheese reminded me of mozzarella sticks but better. 

Biker Jim took hotdogs to a whole &#39;nother level. The awkward part of this whole experience was the car ride to the hotel when my friend asked me if they used real elk&amp;reindeer in their dogs. UH OH HOTDOG, She looked like she was going to throw up when I said yes......

I got the German Veal Coney Style, and some fries.  They also had a special of a shot and a PBR for $3.  SOLD.  Duh, sold.  Shot was actually Jim Beam, which while not the best whiskey by any means, isn&#39;t rot gut poison...at least to this guy.

Dog was huge!  Tasty, hot enough I had to give it a couple minutes to cool down, and flavorful.  Coney Style comes with chili that was perfect for a hot dog.  Spicy and flavorful, and hit the spot for an evening of raising my BAC.  Fries were hot and tasty as well.

This review is long overdue... like crazy, super, insanely long overdue. 

Biker Jim&#39;s is greatness. You&#39;ll probably ingest the meat of a certain animal or two for the first time ever here. Ever indulge on reindeer? Rattlesnake? Wild boar? Pheasant? Yeah, you can enjoy those things in hot dog form at Jim&#39;s.

I visited Biker Jim&#39;s twice, about 6 months apart, and my biggest mistake was unintentionally ordering the exact same thing both times:

The Alaskan Reindeer with Biker Jim&#39;s Classic toppings, and the Wild Boar with The International toppings.

The good news? Both times, both dogs were absolute perfection. Next time though... I go with two new selections. I swear, my double ordering was an innocent mistake. For my 2nd visit, I was banking on a long line buying me some time to research, but there was no line at all! That led to the need to make a split second decision, which ended up as a delicious duplicate.

I first experienced Biker Jim&#39;s at their food truck parked outside a political rally. I was hooked by the cream cheese and caramelized onions. 

They have elevation ketchup which is awesome too. I make a point to go to biker Jim&#39;s every time I come back to Denver."

I don&#39;t understand the high ratings after my experience.  The dogs/bat dog(brat) were small and scantily topped, especially for the money. I was expecting something large and abundantly topped - like I&#39;d need a fork to finish.  Not the case.  There were three employees there, two of which could not have cared less.  I ordered iced tea, got a cup and the tea was empty, and I felt like I was putting out the employee to fill it up. If you&#39;re visiting Denver, don&#39;t waste a meal here.

Updated: after this review Jim (as in biker Jim) contacted me through Yelp and was sincerely concerned and I was impressed.  He offered to make it right in any way.  I will give them another try because my above experience looks like an anomaly and his level of care for me as a customer was impressive and deserves a second chance."

(Look for green umbrellas and blue chairs). This place will satisfy your hot dog needs. You can go with a traditional style hot dog or you can mix it up with some of the unique flavors and styles they offer. I personally went with the Wild Boar hot dog which came with grilled onions, cream cheese, mustard, and sriracha. It was awesome, had unique flavor, and was quite filling. The hot dog was nicely grilled and has a great juicy flavor when you bite into it. The flavors range from sweet to spicy to smoky to even vegan. This stand does not mess around. Each hot dog is cooked and prepared in about 3 minutes. So even though there was a bit of a line, there was very minimal wait time. All hot dogs are $6 and if you a get the combo it is $7.50 for the dog, a drink, and chips. Totally worth it! Love me a good hot dog."

My friend got the Alaskan Reindeer dog and topped it with The Conspiracy which was bleu cheese, french fried onion, and bacon marmalade. This was not a good combo to go with and the taste felt very off. I think they slightly overcooked the hot dog because it felt a little dry. I got the Southwest Buffalo dog (chipotle, green chile, cumin) and topped it with The Biker Jim&#39;s Classic which is just cream cheese and caramelized onion. This was actually a much better combo but nothing great. Again, slightly dry and a little overcooked. Granted, I&#39;m not much of hot dog person either so I feel like the fancier the combination, the weirder it would taste. Plus, for the price you pay for a hot dog ($6.50) with a topping ($1.25), it is just not good enough to justify the price. The hot dogs are not that big as well so you can&#39;t justify it with sheer volume either.  Customer service is good though."

They provide tons of condiments too.  Don&#39;t forget to ask at the counter for some extra horse radish.  

The fried mac and cheese side was amazing too. Don&#39;t forget to order that.   The venue looked pretty spacious. Honestly, we didn&#39;t have to order to-go, but we didn&#39;t know and we lived close by so we just went with it.

It&#39;s a loud, small, but warm and inviting place. Not much room between tables. Total seating for about 40 people. Add four for the bar and some seats on the covered patio. 

Thomas did a good job with some menu suggestions. Brought some garlic knots.  Warm &amp; soft. Lots of garlic. First reaction: addicting. 

We ordered 1/2 of the Ziti and 1/2 of the Chicken piccata. Portion size is plenty for two people. 

Both served piping hot.  The Ziti was rich and meaty.  A slice of sausage in every other bite. Good thick sauce. Well flavored. 

The piccata had a good flavor, but the chicken was over-cooked. We told our server who immediately placed a replacement order. 

Unfortunately that meant a bit of a wait. 

The re-order was cooked just right. Kudos to Thomas for his attention. Rich flavor, light on the asparagus and heavy on the capers. I&#39;d prefer it the other way around but enjoyable nonetheless.  

I&#39;ve yet to find a &#34;perfect&#34; restaurant.  You&#39;ll occasionally run into problems or mistakes. The key is how well they handle the mistakes.   

Thomas made sure the re-fire was to my liking. A second person (chef perhaps) also checked in to apologize and make sure the meal was acceptable. 

It&#39;s a family place and not a chain. That&#39;s a plus in my book. The food tastes fresh and it seemed to be cooked by someone who cares. 

Dessert:   Pumpkin spice panacotta. Hey. Tomorrow is Halloween so why not?  Very mild and smooth.  

We&#39;ll probably stop by again.  See what else is worth a taste."

We chatted with the server, saying we were visiting and wanted her recommendation. She kindly brought us a basket full of freshly baked garlic knots - on the house as a welcome gesture! There were so many choices on the menu but we ended up ordering a tomato based pasta and traditional bolognese. The tomato pasta as so fresh and excellent. Bolognese wasn&#39;t bad, but I wasn&#39;t too thrilled.

Our waiter, Reed, offered us a complimentary order of their homemade garlic knots, which were great. He engaged with our kids each time he stopped by talking BFG and they absolutely loved it too.  When you go, ask for him...

ARANCINIS - $8
Three flash-fried risotto balls filled w/ cheese &amp; peas. Creamy sauce. Salty and the middle part was lukewarm, not hot. Disappointed.

LASAGNA - $10 (half)
Half portion looked small but it was plenty. Fresh sheet pasta layered w/ ricotta cheese and their beef/pork mixture topped w/ bechamel sauce. Very good.

On the one hand, they&#39;ve got a very high Yelp rating in a part of town where that tends to be difficult to do. On the other hand, the owners seem to react rather vitriolically at times to Yelpers who gave a low rating.  I am quite afraid of confrontation, so that kept me away for a long time, despite bookmarking the restaurant.

Then there was a Groupon deal.  I gotta try them now, don&#39;t I?

Fortunately, it was a positive experience.  The place was not exactly what I expected.  I was expecting a fairly large space, but Cranelli&#39;s was actually on the smaller side, like a cafe.  The other thing that surprised me about Cranelli&#39;s is how family oriented it was.  I was expecting sort of a quiet, intimate setting when I saw from outside that it was smaller than expected, but once I stepped inside, the place was HOPPING for a Monday night - just a few open tables here and there, several 6-10 tops seated, and loud like a sports bar inside from all the people eating and making merry.  There were also several people celebrating a birthday that evening, which quickly became apparent as the servers make a big deal about making sure the whole restaurant joined in singing &#34;Happy Birthday.&#34;

Now then, let&#39;s talk about the food.  I wavered between 4 and 5 stars on this one.  The food was  good.  Really good.  It just wasn&#39;t really my bag.  I prefer a more &#34;fancy pants&#34; Italian cafe experience where there are staples with modern twists.  Cranelli&#39;s offerings, by contrast, are very traditional.  It&#39;s what I&#39;d call &#34;comfort food Italian&#34; - spaghetti, lasagna, etc.  However, this was probably some of the best pasta of this kind I&#39;ve had. So I decided to give Cranelli&#39;s that coveted fifth star; just because it&#39;s not for me doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not great.  I tried a couple half-sized pastas - diavolo and eggplant parmigiana.  Both were great.  I&#39;ll not sure what they put in the eggplant dish, but it tasted herby and fresh instead of weighed down by the heavy breading and marinara sauce as so often the case.  As for the diavolo... I had intended to eat half of each dish and take the rest home, but I ended up eating all of this dish at once.   Oh, I also tried the famous garlic knots.   Pretty darn good, I must say (though not all that different than other garlic knots I&#39;ve had). 

So overall, even though Cranelli&#39;s is outside of my wheelhouse when it comes to Italian cuisine, they are probably one of the best in the comfort food category in Denver.

A note to the owners: keep in mind that you might be scaring away potential customers by attacking negative reviews on Yelp.  I almost wrote off your excellent restaurant because of this. I understand the impulse, but it&#39;s really a turn off to see a company attacking its customers in a public forum (even if it&#39;s deserved on occasion)."

Good el dente noodles. Good chunkiness of the tomatoes in the sauce. Added marinara and I enjoyed it lots more. I had it with shrimp and thought it a good compliment to the sauce.

The pizza crust is thin and baker evenly. Good sauce to cheese ratio. Not the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had but a contender for top ten for sure. 

The puff pastry dessert with vanilla ice cream scoops were yummy. The puff pastry could have been fresher but the sprinkled chocolate powder really elevated the texture for me.

Approaching the restaurant, I missed it at first and turned around to get in the parking lot.  I will describe how the term &#34;hidden gem&#34; came to be as Cranelli&#39;s was slightly hidden.

We walked through the new covered and heated patio area, presumably for a few tables, standing room and to keep the winter air distant from the main front doors, which led directly into the dining room.  

The restaurant was busy and I later learned it is always full with reservations, only being able to seat about 10-15 tables.  We were greeted by the owner Lasinda and seated at the 4 top bar rather than being told to wait or leave.  Trisha helped us get drinks and order food. 

We got a fantastic bottle of wine from Argentina and being the first time, garlic knots were provided on the house.  The garlic knots are amazing, fresh, and addicting. 

We also ordered the Arancini&#39;s to share. I learned the Arancini&#39;s flavor changes from time to time, normally every month. The Arancini&#39;s were absolutely delicious and a bacon/jam flavor. 

We ordered a side salad with blue cheese to share, which came out more unique than your basic everyday side salad.  It seemed to have a little more character and uniqueness.  It was a fantastic side salad. 

I ordered the pepperoni and salami Stromboli which was fantastic. Trisha came out and added some spicy sauce to the plate, which I really liked.  I forgot the name of this sauce already.   

I wish I would have had more room in my stomach at this point to try the cream puffs or sweet knots. But there is always a next time.  

I was told the restaurant does a private wine and tapa or tastings every few months with the purchase of a ticket. This intrigues me, similar to private closed door dinners in South America.  

I wish more restaurants followed a local feel, quality food, and great service business model.  I wish I knew about Cranelli&#39;s three years ago when they opened.  I will definitely be recommending this restaurant, and will also be taking the wife back.  I love going to local small businesses in Denver, not your local big box chain. 

Furthermore, Cranelli&#39;s is a gem, a hidden gem."

After a disappointing lunch (also another highly yelped place) earlier this day, we came here for dinner with cautious expectations. We were immediately blown away by our waiter Bob&#39;s friendly demeanor and excellent service! He gave us complimentary garlic knots (maybe because we said we found them on Yelp? Maybe because we are visiting in town?) They were so delicious, my hubby ate 4 of the 6. (I personally thought they were a little salty, but I tend to think that in general) I loved the half Baked Ziti (sauce was amazing) and the side of meatballs--not too salty at all. Just perfect. Hubby got the half Eggplant Parmesan--also good (but I thought a little on the tart side). 
The food was delicious and prices were so worth it! Best place we&#39;ve been to in Colorado yet! And Bob is a real charmer. Highly recommended!"

Cranelli&#39;s is a bustling place during the weekend.  Crowds fill the small dining space, friends getting together, couples on a date and every other reason in between.  Everyone is greeted warmly by the owners like they are part of the family, one big extended family drinking and dining together.

Cranelli&#39;s has a wonderful wine list, I really enjoy their Cabernet Sauvignon.  I&#39;ve tried multiple dishes from their menu and each one feels like it&#39;s being made by an Italian Grandmother feeding the ones she loves.  The garlic knots pack a powerful garlic punch and pair perfectly with their marinara sauce.  The antipasto is a nice way to start when dining with a group.  All the pasta dishes are delicious and a large portion of them are offered in half portions.  I&#39;m partial to the chicken parmesan, chicken piccata and the tomato basil.  The eggplant rollatini is a little heavy for my taste, although still delicious.  

Cranelli&#39;s is easily the gem of Lone Tree and will keep me coming back time and time again for some excellent Italian."

The staff was warm, friendly, and inviting. And the food was amazing. We shared the Baked Zitti and the Diablo, and both were to die for. My wife and I are gluten free and they had so many options for us to chose from. More than most Italian restaurants we&#39;ve been to in Denver. 

Lasinda (owner) was an amazing host and sweet as can be. She and her family were definitely the cherry&#39;s on top on our whole experience. Thanks for making our 15th anniversary dinner a very memorable one! We will be back for sure."

After my husband visited Cranelli&#39;s two days in a row during his last trip to Lone Tree, I told him I must try it next time we were in the area. As a former Chicagoan, he is very picky about Italian food and I knew if he loved it, I would too!

We went yesterday for lunch and let me tell you, I&#39;m now looking for reasons to return to Denver so that we can also come back here. 

First, the location. It&#39;s cute and intimate, and they have an awesome patio. We sat indoors for lunch yesterday as it was still a little cool outside. It&#39;s open air and has a fun energy. The parking isn&#39;t easy but the food more than makes up for it. 

The food - wow! The garlic knots are delish! We chowed down on them and could&#39;ve eaten more but knew we shouldn&#39;t! They were served hot, buttery and garlicky. Just the way we like &#39;em!

I ordered the Chicken Genovese. I frequently make homemade pesto, and am usually not happy with a restaurant&#39;s version. But the pesto here is perfect! They let me substitute mushrooms for sundried tomatoes, which I don&#39;t like. My only regret with this dish is that I ordered a half portion. I had a little left over to take home (it was amazing when reheated) and I wished I had more!

My husband ordered the Spaghetti Marinara with Meatballs. The marinara is yummy. I don&#39;t frequently eat marinara sauce but could have eaten this on its own. The meatball was savory and had good flavor. 

The cream puffs. Holy cannoli (or holy cream puff?)! They are homemade at a local Sicilian bakery and I&#39;ve never had a lighter, fluffier, tastier cream puff. They serve it with ice cream, dusted with cocoa powder and chocolate sauce. Luckily there were 2 cream puffs and 2 scoops of ice cream, otherwise my husband and I might have had an epic battle!

Lastly, we were so impressed with our server and everyone in the restaurant. Lasinda, the owner, stopped by our table to chat and she was so friendly and hospitable. Her husband heard me ordering my pasta without the sundrieds, and asked what else I would like in its place. Our waitress was friendly, prompt with refills and food, and made great suggestions. You can tell the owners and the entire staff, take great pride in their restaurant. And they should! We will definitely be back."

It&#39;s an intimate place, despite being in an apartment complex! Lasinda is great, they always make you feel welcome and comfortable (especially when it gets cramped due to space limitations)! We now just need them to expand. :)

Great Italian, craveable Stromboli&#39;s! My toddler is in love with their marinara! Garlic knots are delicious and nice to see its offered as a check-in offer here. BOGO Happy hour specials on wine, although $-off specials would be appreciated off their decent blends instead (Hint, Cranellis!)."

I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve lived in the area for years and never knew about this place. I travel a lot for work and always look for local Italian places. I am stunned and overjoyed that I have found one of the best on my own back yard!!! Definitely check them out whether you live near or are just visiting.

Ate here for the first time tonight and everything was delicious, especially the lasagna! Garlic knots were the bomb too. Make a reservation as it is very small and was packed on a Thursday night. The parking lot isn&#39;t the best but don&#39;t let that deter you. Make sure you come for happy hour which ends at 6:30 Monday thru Friday (check website just in case) - $5 glass of house wine is Buy One Get One. WHAT?!

It really is like being with family on Sunday afternoon. Enjoyed the sausage and Pepper appetizer immensely. My husband stuck with the lasagna which, even at a half portion, is more than enough for one sitting. We ended our meal with a delicious cannoli. To be honest, it is the service here and the friendliness of both the owners and the waitstaff that makes it a pleasure to come here for dinner. It&#39;s hard not to leave without a smile. they have a sign in the dining room that says &#34;be the kind of happy that when people look at you they are happy too&#34; or something to that effect which embodies this whole restaurant!"

I was truly disappointed overall.  Our waitress was tolerant at best, atmosphere was VERY loud, food was just ok.

We get seated, wait 10 min before a waitress comes to our table and she greets us with &#34;Hi are you ready?&#34;  My eggplant parm was mostly cheese and the spaghetti sauce tasted like sour tomato sauce.  The lasagna was pretty much all ricotta cheese.  My water glass was empty most of the visit.

The reviews were spot on. Garlic knots were great!  We had Chicken Piccata and Chicken Marsala. 

Chicken Piccata had strong citrus flavor to it that was excellent!  Right amount of capers, asparagus, pasta and chicken and was a very good selection. 

Chicken Marsala was even better. I enjoy Marsala and prepare it myself but it does not compare to what they make here. Really really enjoyed the Marsala and would come back just for more of it. 

We sat outside on a gorgeous day and everything was casual. Certainly will be back here again."

Everyone at the restaurant made a special stop at our table to genuinely welcome us and truly make us feel part of their family.

Service was indifferent at best.  When we had the waitress&#39; attention she was patronizing - everything we asked about was &#34;the best&#34;.  

As an appetizer, we were treated to their &#34;garlic knots&#34; with a marinara dip, they were outstanding. The caprese salad was fresh and tasteful, if not a bit overloaded with balsamic vinegar.  

I tried 1/2 Bolognaise and 1/2 Aglio e Olio.  In both cases the spaghetti under the sauce and topping was somewhat dry, perhaps, because of the size of our group, and maybe being held &#39;at temperature&#39; before serving. The bolognese with bechemel is supposed to be a &#34;signature&#34; dish.  I found it a little sweet and somewhat bland for my taste.  My wife loved it, so I think my taste preference for &#39;tangy&#39; shades my opinion of this dish.  The  Aglio e Olio with tomatoes and sausage had good flavor.  The sausage was outstanding, the dish could have used a bit more oil and garlic. There are some who like, even prefer, &#34;northern Italian&#34; flavors, and perhaps this would appeal to them.

Unfortunately, there&#39;s precious little parking, most of our party had to park across a busy street. The dining room was a little stuffy, but it was a warm evening and the sun was merciless beating in on the front windows.  The management did their best to keep it under control with the window shades.

Cranelli&#39;s is not my favorite place for Italian, but if you like a &#34;sweeter&#34; Italian taste, you may find it good."

Cute restaurant, excellent service, good food and fair prices.  The menu was filled with classics. The marinara sauce was excellent - excellent! Garlic knots just what you&#39;d want them to be. My chicken pesto cream dish was good, with sliced grilled chicken. Husband had eggplant rollatini. They have a full bar and specials. Restaurant is small and it was fairly full at noon on a Saturday. 

Two particular comments: service was really great, friendly, and kept us apprised of how our order was progressing. The eggplant rollatini was taking a while - she offered to bring us something to tide us over. We felt truly welcome the whole time.  Extra points for being cool about our coupon - it got us to try out this restaurant. We&#39;ll be back!

Second comment: I love sauce, but there was a bit too much cream sauce on the pastas. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, please don&#39;t start skimping ... Just ... Back off a little bit. Like, use 80% of current volume - it will still be copious but not drippy. We&#39;ll order with a request to go light on the cream sauces next time."

We love this place like you would love your grandma&#39;s cooking. My husband&#39;s family enjoyed it for the first time over Christmas and spend at least four times in the last three months there. Unfortunately, Matt was diagnosed with Acute Leukemia and we had to skip out on the fun. While we spent 38 days in the hospital, my mother in law brought us Cranelli&#39;s to the hospital several times.

Not that I don&#39;t love it, but life gets busy and being a foodie I like to try different cuisines. On a whim I met my hubby after work for an early supper and there was plenty of open seating. (It&#39;s from 6PM on that reservations are recommended). Be sure to say hi to The Bob-father!! 

A heavenly glass of house wine awaited me as the hubbs beat me to the restaurant. Appetizer of Italian poppers was decent, and pretty cheesy. (Needed red peppers to make them awesome.) Then the entrée selection of Diablo with shrimp served on fettuccine for him, the eggplant rollatini for me. 

Here&#39;s the bad part: our server screwed up my hubbs order as his dish came out on spaghetti noodles and wasn&#39;t piping hot. Mine was over-cooked eggplant rolls with nary any marinara and a side of spaghetti noodles with a bland béchamel sauce.  My plate seemed like it sat under the warming lights for too long as the béchamel had coagulated with the noodles and the entire dish wasn&#39;t hot. :-( 

Our server Alli was WAY too vociferous about telling personal stories: her cat at Christmas breaks ornaments, she doesn&#39;t like gnocchi because of its texture, her family is from Poland and she hates sauerkraut (makes her gag), her sister and she stuffed blankets under the doorways to block the smell, she had a hangover after Christmas, what day do people stop saying happy new year...Blah blah blah blah. DON&#39;T CARE. I actually love gnocchi and I love sauerkraut too. Stop talking about yourself so dang much and dwelling at tables for so long. Not just ours but other people&#39;s as well! Very annoying. 

I&#39;m not going to beat up the girl, but she needs much better training as a server. Here&#39;s a tip: we&#39;re here to enjoy the food, not hear about your life nor be entertained by you. 

The redeeming factors include replacing the Diablo spaghetti with fettuccine like we originally asked (should be served on that noodle all the time as the wide noodle surface provides a better palate for that sauce) AND it was piping hot!! :-) No way to fix over-cooked eggplant but I smothered it and the bland béchamel noodles with their fabulous marinara. Much better, but I won&#39;t order that dish ever again. 

Overall, good food but overly zealous servers. There&#39;s a fine line between attentiveness and being annoying which a few of the younger servers are oblivious of. I look forward to better service with anticipation because this place really is darling. The owners appear to care wholeheartedly as well."

I was skeptical because of its location (a tiny store front in an apartment building). The service was very good and the overall vibe was very welcoming and home-y. 

At the suggestion of many other Yelp reviews I had the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. It was amazing! Not heavy and bland, but very flavorful and a great portion. The chicken was fresh and grilled, while the mushrooms were firm. The sauce... More of a bechamel sauce with the spices of an Alfredo. It was DIVINE! 

My husband had the Diablo with chicken, which was spicy and very tasty. Great kids menu and they have kids cups with a lid and straws (this is a plus for parents). 

We came here after our kids&#39; soccer game on a Saturday and called in a take out order the next Week because we had to share with our family when they were over. Our take out order consisted of the
-Chicken Picatta-- AMAZING!!! Very flavorful and excellent. We will definitely get this again. 
- Lasagna- nice size portion, I&#39;m not a big lasagna lover, but it was good. 
- Bolognese- meh. I&#39;m not a fan of this anyways, but everyone else liked it.

Such an awesome place and we can&#39;t wait to go back."

Really well-rendered pasta dishes in a busy little spot in a some kind of strip mall. She wasn&#39;t there on the day I was but I understand the owners are typically on site and saying hello to everyone. It&#39;s so rare to find that these days.

We just never expected this nor experienced this level of friendly service before. As for the food it was spot on. Everything was fresh and tasty, maybe because their menu was semi-limited. I think that&#39;s how they keep such good quality control. The best part is something they don&#39;t even need to do. They offer an option to buy half portions of all their entrees. This avoids allot of waste which in my opinion our country needs to stop. Especially considering half the world needs food to survive. I commend this restaurant for offering this benefit as well. 

We ordered garlic knot, Alfredo, Sriracha pasta and few other items. All great. You won&#39;t be disappointed unless you want seafood. I didn&#39;t see much of seafood items on the menu except for a shrimp option in their pastas. I really can&#39;t find anything negative to say about this place."

Incredibly friendly and happy employees and owners greet you when you arrive and it continues throughout the meal.  Nice start to the meal with the garlic knots, then we had the Arancinis, which I would highly recommend. My wife had the Eggplant Parm and I went with the Chicken Piccata.  Both were piping hot, full of flavor and my Piccata was not short on garlic, which if you like Italian food - you&#39;ll appreciate!  We both ordered half orders, which was plenty of food, but if you want leftovers, go with the full order.  Very reasonable prices and a wonderful, friendly and casual atmosphere.

We had a range of meals, mostly pastas, the people having the Chicken Alfredo said theirs was a bit salty too. The others were fine. 
Service was good, but we&#39;d asked to see the dessert menu, which he bought over, and then bought the bill without asking if we wanted dessert...good thing we decided against it."

Very fresh tasting pasta and when they have a singer performing the experience can be lots of fun.

Saw 326 reviews @ 4 1/2 stars...for an Italian restaurant and decided it was a must try.  Pasta is my fave food of all time and yet quite frankly my home cooked Italian food is better than most restaurants.  Just haven&#39;t really found any place that brought pasta to the next level.  The place was PACKED but thankfully there was a table for 2 just waiting for us.  Italian poppers - delish.  Free garlic knots with Yelp check-in - awesome and delish.  Chicken Genovese was so flavorful - always a fan of sundried tomatoes. And my husbands classic fave - Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo did not disappoint either.  I typically find Alfredo sauces to be bland but his had great flavor and not too heavy.  Great friendly service as well.  Only negative - It&#39;s an hour away from me :(

So my fiancé is a professional chef who has worked and started several 5 star restaurants and works at one of the most popular restaurants in Denver right now.  Her description in her own words:

&#34;This is one of the best meals I have ever had.&#34; 

You can imagine my relief because sometimes it&#39;s very hard to find a place to eat out that she will wholeheartedly find at least good. It&#39;s not a bad thing that she is like that, it just makes it harder for me to pick a good spot. 

So we arrived and had a reservation and were seated within a few minutes. We were greeted quickly by our server, nice guy don&#39;t remember his name. Drinks came quickly, salads came quickly.  We ordered shrimp Diablo and chicken geneovese. Both came out piping hot and absolutely delicious.  Price was reasonable and we were given garlic knots and a special pack of truffles.  My future wife also said that the tiramisu was done exactly how it is supposed to be and was excellent. 

So it was a fantastic visit and my fiancé has deemed Cranellis our new place.  I can&#39;t wait to try some of the other dishes, soon."

I&#39;ve been meaning to check this place out for months; I finally made it over and I was pissed at myself.  Why the $@?! did I not visit this place sooner, it was outstanding in every department.  The service, the food, the atmosphere and the value were just simply awesome.  

This place is small, but that is what makes it special.  The staff here is either related to the owners or they just really love working for them.  I just really love when the staff is genuinely interested in my experience and satisfaction. On my initial visit with Janet O., we were served by, as Janet described him, mellow, cute and a professional, and without hesitation I agree.  On my second visit he wasn&#39;t working (sigh), but I learned that his sister works there as well, how cool is that.  I also met the owner Lasinda; she is one cool lady.  She remembered Janet when I mentioned her, which is exactly what a family like service is all about, noticing your customers and their needs. My waitress during the second visit was on par with the first; she was super attentive and very friendly.  

The restaurant is situated in a luxury apartment complex, making parking very convenient.  The interior is simple and inviting.  One review actually complained about that, are you $&amp;@? kidding me!  The place can be a bit cramped, but that&#39;s nothing one should complain about, if anything it makes the experience more personable and intimate.  Want space, go to the S&#39;hole called Olive Garden.   Sorry about my rant, but apparently I have fallen in love with this place.  

Service and food must complement each other for an ultimate meal.  I think it&#39;s pretty clear from the reviews that this place has both under control.  The food is simply delicious, screams quality and tender love.  I had the Lasagna both the first and second visits.  Why?  Because it was out of this world!!!  Most lasagnas I&#39;ve had are usually over cooked, theirs is sublime with the pasta firm, the meat and sauce flavorful and the cheese very stringy without oil separation indicating high quality ingredients.  Always go for the full portion, because you will be yearning for more. The Italian Fries were also a great start, and the Italian poppers deserve a standing ovation.  The Almond Cannoli was a perfect ending to a five star meal.

The Yelp rating of 4.5 stars is by no means hype, it&#39;s definitely deserving and the few reviews with low rating are simply outliers just like the people that wrote them.  If you live in the apartment complex, you are one lucky tenant with 10% off daily and 25% off on Tuesdays.  Go and indulge in one fine Italian meal.

I&#39;m passionate about fine cuisines and the people that make them a reality.  Guess where I&#39;m going for dinner my first night back in Denver?"

I&#39;m an Italian food snob from Chicago, and pleasantly surprised to find the place owned by a south side guy named Bobby Crane.  
Waiter/part owner Bib provided fab service and started us with garlic knots. Unique because they were abundant (gave us a second order quickly) and cooked perfectly, served warm with a great marinara sauce. 
Great house red wine for $5. 
All pasta made fresh in house. 
Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and noodles cooked well. Wish there was a little more sauce to mop with the garlic knots, but will request it next time since everyone is made to order. 
Chicken Marsala was absolutely delish. Seasoned well, pasta cooked perfectly.....
No chance for dessert this trip.  
So many things to try on the menu! 
All the great reviews on here are warranted and we will b back!!"

Cranelli&#39;s seats next door to a PILATES studio. Right smack in the middle of nice looking apartments. Roughly 0.2 miles to the left of The Element hotel. 

We walked in to a very cozy place. About three high chairs to the right as you walk in. Tables fill the whole room. Warm inside while the air is crisp and snow flakes are beginning to fall outside.

Our waiter was a really cool mellow dude. Funny, cute, knowledgeable of the dishes and most of all truly very happy to serve his customers. 

We ordered the lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and shared an Italian French fries and an almond cannoli. Washed down with a prosecco called Lunetta. 

On the house was the Garlick knots. You must have this with your pasta. It&#39;s amazing as well. 

Amazing meal. Although they don&#39;t make their own fresh pasta everything else is made in house. One thing that comes to mind is the beschamel sauce that&#39;s made in house like the fettuccine sauce. 

Awesome wine. Great tasting food. And very engaging staff. Hard not to be a fan."

I really wanted to like this place as we go out eat couple of times a week and Italian is one of our favorites. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewers that the service and food are lacking on many levels. Service - we had a waitress who took a very long time (12 minutes after being seated) to take our order for drinks (soda for the kids and wine for the adults).  We also ordered appetizers. While she brought the drinks promptly, it took another 15 minutes for her to bring our garlic knots and 2 salads. Then our food was sitting there while she went to get plates and utensils. She disappeared again and we had to flag down another person to ask for water. She never even asked if we wanted water to begin with.  Food - Caesar salad was good and garlic knots were excellent!! The bus boy cleared our dirty plates and we sat around for another 10 minutes waiting for our waitress.  We ordered lasagna, Marsala chicken, Alfredo fettuccini. Lasagna - above average, the cheese on top wasn&#39;t even melted, very little meat. I think it would have been a good dish if there wasn&#39;t so much solid cheese.  Marsala chicken was average. The sauce was very watery, the chicken was cut into strips and dry. The fettuccini Alfredo was good.  Sauce was not too thin and not too thick and had a good taste. We added a meatball which turned out to be more of ground beef chunks than a meatball.  Tiramisu was not good. Hard as a brick, still frozen. We have eaten at 50+ Italian restaurants all over the country and have reviewed almost all of them. Would like to give Cranelli&#39;s another try to see maybe we had just had an incompetent or less than enthusiastic waitress this night and also try other dishes."

I ordered Caesar Salad as a starter, a half-order of Lasagna, and Tiramisu for dessert, for pick-up. In the roughly 5 minutes that I spent in the restaurant, waiting for my order, I spoke with three members of the staff (host, waitress, and bartender), all of who were very amiable and genuine. I was even offered a complimentary fountain drink while I sat waiting at the bar.

The Caesar salad came with less than I expected it would, but the lettuce was fresh and green, not at all wilted or yellow, and the dressing was a good combination of creamy and tangy with a perfect smooth, yet not thick, consistency.

The lasagna was quite the contrary in regard to amount, with the half portion proving to be quite a good size piece. This was, quite possibly, some of the best lasagna I have ever tasted. The flavors were excellent, the sauce superbly seasoned, with fresh basil most notable. While at first I thought there was far too much sauce, with a deep moat having formed around the rectangle of pasta and filling, it ended up being the perfect amount. The ratio of ingredients was optimal as well, low noodle content provided a marvelous consistency.

The consistency of the tiramisu was also very good, with the cake saturated, yet not terribly soggy. However, the light flavor left it almost bland, and that would be my one and only criticism."

The owner makes a point of greeting everyone, apprising them of when they&#39;ll be seated, checking in during the meal then wishing all a hearty good bye.  Her staff also have the same approach to customer service and they work hard!!  The busboy dishwasher guy was a champ but everyone else was pretty hoppin&#39; too.

The food was good but some things better than others. The caesar salad was a bowl of meh. Packaged croutons were disappointing when the rest of the rest of the food was obviously prepared with care.  The plates coming out of the kitchen all looked, ya know, good enough to eat. 
My entrée was a half chicken marsala which was very nice.  It had asparagus and mushrooms, a hint of sweetness from the wine and al dente pasta. Word to the wise: a half order is still a a lot of food!

We started out with the Garlic knots as an appetizer... Now let me say this... I&#39;d come here just for their garlic knots and marinara.... It was incredible! Buttery, soft and fresh out of the oven (hot!!). I could&#39;ve ordered another round if I didn&#39;t have 1 stomach.

Moving forward with our dinner --
I ordered the Chicken Piccata - absolutely divine! The lemon:butter:caper ratio was perfect. Unlike most Italian restaurants, my dish wasn&#39;t swimming in butter.  
My bf ordered The Diablo - He loved it!! A wonderfully spicy red sauce pasta filled with lots of goodies (garlic, bell peppers, onion, spinach) + chicken (grilled to perfection).

Our server, Nikki, was truly a pleasure. Even though the restaurant was buzzing with activity, she was incredibly attentive and beyond wonderful. Not only was she always smiling, our water glasses never sat empty on the table.

I am thrilled to have stumbled upon this little gem and cannot wait to comeback!"

The chicken was cooked incredibly perfectly and had great flavor! The sauce is good but not great. I do wish the chicken, which was perfectly crispy on top, was not laid on top of the pasta and sauce because it ruined the crunchiness of the bottom of the chicken. The garlic knots to begin the meal were also great. Service is really great here without being overbearing. They do a great job and this is evident across all the staff across the restaurant. One area I would like to see a bit of improvement, maybe, is with the wine list. One of the lesser expensive reds was 4.50 to 6$ if you were to buy it in the store. That seems a bit &#34;cheapy&#34; to serve in the restaurant. Enjoyable experience again and I would surely tell others to come by!"

We went in on a Saturday night with a party of 8 (we had booked a reservation earlier in the day). The restaurant is pretty small and hoppin so I definitely recommend getting a reservation! 

Since it was our first visit they brought us out some complementary garlic knots. Yum!!

They had a happy hour going on (happy hour on a weekend evening -- yes please!). The happy hour was buy-one-get-one on house wine and spirits. 

My husband and I split a full size pasta dish and a side salad. Other people at our table got pizza, a sandwich and other pasta dishes. Everyone was really happy with their meal!"

We had a reservation for 8:15 and once we entered the restaurant we realized that was never going to happen.  The space is not very big, but they definitely do the most with what they have.  We were seated at 8:40, which if we had not had a reservation would have been fine, but if we have a reservation anything more than a 10-15 minute delay is not really acceptable.  Don&#39;t accept reservations if you&#39;d can&#39;t stick to them.

Our waitress was very nice, but forgetful.  She forgot my drink when I ordered it, not really that big of a deal, she brought it 5 minutes later, but she also forgot marinara sauce with my entree which was a big deal because it meant my food became cold as my dining companion was able to eat.  In fact she came over to check how everything was and when I asked for marinara sauce again she gave me an excuse about how they moved the sauce and she couldn&#39;t find it.  The thing is they have an open kitchen and I saw her hang out and chat without really looking for anything.  Just tell me you forgot, don&#39;t lie to me.  She was very nice and seemed genuinely sorry for the mistake, but the point was moot as my dinner was cold by that point.

The food was ok.  We got the garlic knots.  The bread was fresh and hot, but had no real garlic flavor.  Maybe we just came on an off day?  I got the eggplant rollatini.  There was no flavor except for cheese.  I love cheese, but I need more flavor than that.  My friend got the chicken genovese which was very good.  I will probably never go again, but if i were to go I would get the chicken genovese.

This place is in a hidden corner and am I incredibly happy to have gone here on date night.

Its been a long time since I have enjoyed food where each bite was better than the last. The place is small, however I feel this adds to the home vibe not to mention I saw all walks of life from full families to couples at the bar and individuals looking to eat and run.

We have been ordering take out (not drive through) and the convenient take out waiting area is awesome.

I love me some BBQ, and Jim &amp; Nick&#39;s does not disappoint--I mean, ever! It is consistently ridiculously and wonderfully good. 

I usually order the brisket plate or sandwich because you can never go wrong with slow-cooked, meaty, BBQ goodness. But today, I chose the prime-rib which is only offered on Fridays &amp; Saturday&#39;s. The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium perfection. The collard greens and Mac &amp;Cheese (which happen to be my choice of sides every time I come) were absolutely delectable. Although I skipped out on the side of cheesy bread that comes with every meal, trust me when I tell you--DON&#39;T. They are the perfect combination of salty, cheeses, with a hint of sweet, and if you have no self control, you will probably fill up on the bread and just have to take your meal home--I know, tragic. 

My dinner cost $23 but most of the dishes at Jim &#39;n Nick&#39;s cost $12-$15; so, unless you&#39;re feeling fancy like me, you will be pleased with the prices on the menu.

This restaurant has such a cute, feel-good, family ambience to it, and the servers are all bubbly &amp; sweet- you will keep coming back once you try it for the first time."

This time they were dry and burnt on the sides. They had the sauce on them and then had been cooked too long.... that kind of thing. Oh well so much for Jim and Nick&#39;s for me. Spending good money on BBQ it needs to be good, as I am from Kansas City! ;)"

We made a few phone calls and it turns out that the kid was misinformed. So after a confusing 10 minutes or so, we sat at the bar and had two large beers, came to over $12 before tip! I was glad then that dinner was provided by the chiro. 

The food was alright, but something was funky with the collard greens, too much vinegar or something. Not very nice. We had a selection of meat, not sure exactly what everything was but everything I ate was pretty good. The cheesy muffin things were really good too."

Hubs does spare ribs brisket and hot links. I am sad that they no longer have creamed spinach because nobody does it as good as they used to. Mac n cheese is always a solid go to but nothing compared to that spinach they used to have. Ohh and those tiny delicious biscuits... Omg yum.

This Sat. We came in and seated in the back. I have a service dog,  seems when we are seated place so far back that even the staff forget. That I&#39;m use to. When I sat down the both seat moved complete of the frame. I stated to the manager about the booth. They didn&#39;t even ask if we would like to move. Finally moved to another booth. What was sad is they placed a young family set there. The food was off. After they complain also they moved. No one puta s something on that booth. If I would have fallen, I be rich as hell. Seems management doesn&#39;t care. They used to be a great restaurant. Are they corporation or a franchise. 
I&#39;m sure they would fix the staff and broken seat. I would not be going back."

We asked the waitress how much brisket came with the family meal.  She went to the back to check and came back to tell us it came with 1 lb.  since we are a family of 4 and were hungry we decided to get an extra 1 lb of brisket.  So that&#39;s 2 lb total brisket which came out to $53 and change.  When we got home we inspected our box of brisket and noticed immediately it didn&#39;t feel like 2 lb.  We broke out the digital kitchen scale and to our great disappointment it weighed just over 18 oz.  That&#39;s about 14 oz less than what we paid for!  So a word of advice - avoid this place, or at the very least make them weigh your order in front of you to ensure you get what you&#39;ve paid for.  

Update: we went back the next day and talked to the manager.  I explained the situation and she apologized and offered to give us a pound of brisket.  She verified it was a full pound and we confirmed it when we got home.  The brisket was much better than what we had the previous night as well....moist, juicy and a great smoky flavor."

Surprisingly it was pretty delicious. I ordered the loaded baked potato. It was cooked to perfection. I&#39;ve never had a baked potato cooked all the way through that was so moist and buttery, too irbid with sour cream, chives, cheese and brisket.... It was amazing. I drizzled some of their original BBQ sauce on it and it made it perfect. My BF got the 3 meat plate and everything was good. They gave him a lot of sausage but seemed a little stingy on the pulled pork and ribs. We found out they ran out of ribs so they brought him more (spare ribs) it was a little salty but still good nonetheless. I liked the baby back ribs sweet and tangy. His meal came with 2 sides, so he ordered mac and cheese and southern collard greens. They were both just ok. More cheese would have been great and maybe some smoked turkey or hammocks would have made the collards more &#34;southern&#34;. The little corn bread biscuits were DELICIOUS!!!

Our server, Alberto, was very unattentitve to our needs, because we are a younger couple he probably thought that we were in high school and hadnt worked in food service for 3 years of both of our lives so he probably didnt expect a tip. He came and greeted us kind of quickly but then it took him almost ten minutes to get our drinks after he asked us what we ordered to drink twice, then he kept talking to another server the whole time and we watched him put our order in almost 10 minutes after we had told him it. Then when they bring out the food (not even Alberto another server ran it for him.) My girlfriends mac and cheese was a gross hard brick of pasta, so we asked them to remake it and the difference was so gross i had to take a picture. Mind you all of this was at 3 in the afternoon and the store was not busy at all."

The service was lackluster considering there were more servers than tables of people. I expected more. In fact, my water was not refilled once the entire time we were there and it was empty beginning halfway through our meal. 
The food was just ok and EXTREMELY overpriced for what you get. Not worth the price in my opinion. I have had much better BBQ for much less money many times before. The only item I would say knocked it out of the park were the biscuits."

My eyes were bigger than my stomach (which is totally easy here because everything looks delicious, but the food is so filling!) so I got one of the combo plates to try everything and ended up taking more than half of it home with me (awesome lunch the next day though!). The brisket is killer, as are the ribs. The sides are delicious too, I recommend the mac &#39;n cheese. We do a lot of smoking at home, so usually I just make this stuff on my own. But it&#39;s really nice to not have to wait hours upon hours to get your brisket! 

The waitress was awesome. She was super sweet and knew the menu inside and out. Love it! And it&#39;s close by my house, so makes a great date night dinner when we need to get home to the babysitter fast!

Oh, and did I mention they have a drive thru! How awesome is that? Super easy to grab dinner on the way home."

What restaurant closes down their fryers 30 minutes before they close, especially one that service so much fried food.

I used to come here often but then the food and service went down hill so I have not been in some time. I can tell you Management is not paying attention in this restaurant. 

I spent over an hour here on Sunday sitting at the bar and had to listen to servers complain about how slow it was over and over. Then a server (white girl, heavy set with glasses) proceeded to complain to the bartender about all of her customers, they didn&#39;t tip, she had a large table and the guy paying asked for a military discount for the entire bill and then she only got tipped on the discount. Then a Hispanic server walked  by the bar and said wow $3.00 referring to his tip.

The food is still well below average. Fatty, cold, blah.

I finally saw the Manager after about an hour. T-shirt hanging out looked like he had just woken up in a daze.

Jim and Nicks what is going on, just a bad day? I think not. Its a bad culture.

My sister thought she might have even put a rush order in with the kitchen for our entrees. The pork on a bun sandwich is great and really hit the spot.

My wife was never even ask if she wanted a refill and i only received one because i put my empty glass at the end if the table. I ask for ketchup for my catfish....never received it. Overall service was just horrible considering having to send back cold food and then he apologized and took off 10% for that mishap which turned out to be less than the cost of 1 of those cold side dishes that we sent back....what a joke.

I&#39;ve been going there off and on for six years.  Sometimes they are a grand slam and other times a strike-out.  Lately, it&#39;s all strike-outs.  Some of the reasons for the strike-outs are poorly trained staff, bad service, cold food, small portions, pricey, fatty ribs, and dry brisket.  I have to admit their Collar Greens, Mac and Cheese, and Pies are out of this world.  However, everything else is below average.

Did he have too much downtime between visits?  Yes!  There were lots of minutes that passed by during each visit...he may have been busy so i don&#39;t dock too many points for that.  On the food service side...they tried to bring the food out and just set it in front of us without knowing where the food went...i call this a food auction...once again not a big deal but annoying.  

Food; BBQ was ok.  The brisket was great actually!  The chicken was a little dry and the pulled pork lacked flavor as it only tasted like vinegar. The ribs were some of the worst i&#39;ve had...so the brisket really pulled it through.  The coleslaw and potato salad were ok but once again nothing to brag about.  My son ordered a burger (which i hate because we are at a BBQ place) that was out of this world!  Best thing on the menu as we tried lots of things between myself, my wife and our three kids.  The cheddar biscuits were an awesome freebie!  my daughter just told me she didn&#39;t like the food...she ordered chicken tenders.  She said the mac n cheese was too bland and mushy...ewww.  Like i said though all in all everything was mediocre...some good some great and some very bad.  

Price; way too high.  For my family to spend over $100 for a dinner out (without adult drinks) is way too much for so so food.  BBQ is supposed to be cheap and delicious...this place was expensive and so so.  I won&#39;t hurry back but might have to give it another try in the future."

Two out of three times had a sub-par experience. My wife really wanted some banana pudding but when it came it was 80% whipped cream.

Took the wait staff over twenty minutes to correct the $4 dish of whipped cream.

The third time we ordered food to go. We ran some errands after ordering. I asked where to pick up the food and was referred to a server who was on the phone taking an order.

After waiting a few minutes another server asked if she could help. I told her the name of the order, as well as the fact that we brought our own containers for the food.
I also asked to make sure we had some of the bread they give out in our order.

The same server came back again &amp; asked what name the order was under. Really?
So she walked away and finally returned with our food.

The server who was supposed to help me was still on the phone with the same customer. Not sure why he did not put the person on hold to serve the person there, or at least call another server over to help. He only took an interest in me when I was leaving to make sure I paid, which we did earlier when we dropped off our personal containers.

The only complaint I have (and it&#39;s a minor one), is that when the server comes to take your order, he/she won&#39;t let you order until they&#39;ve finished giving you a lengthy commercial about what a great BBQ restaurant they are.

I&#39;d much prefer it if they just shut up and let the service and the food speak for themselves.

The service we received at Jim N Nicks was so exceptional that I just had to make a special note of it.  The manager took such a personal interest in our dining experience, that it seemed much more like an independently owned restaurant than the chain that it is.  

We were in a group of 11-12 people, trying to unwind after a hard day of business meetings - and to hear so many positive comments from my coworkers, about the service was highly unusual.  Apparently I wasn&#39;t the only one who was impressed.

Bottom line up front...if you are military or support the military community, take your business elsewhere.
My family and I have eaten at Jim n Nick&#39;s a number of times.  We recently placed a large &#34;to-go&#34; that was over $100.  Upon pick-up, I showed my military ID, as they have always made it clear they appreciated my service and honored their military discount.  As I went to pay, I noticed my discount was a grand $3.  Yup...$3 off an order over $100.  When I asked to speak to the manager, she repeated the same line as the cashier.  Because it was a &#34;to-go&#34; order, Jim n Nick&#39;s will only give the military discount on certain plates.
To follow-up, I called back and asked to speak with the General Manager (Sarah).  I was told she was not there and they could not tell me when she would be available.  The duty manager (Brittany) told me that my best bet was to just keep calling back because they did not have the next weeks schedule out.
Additionally, I sent an email through the Jim n Nick&#39;s website explaining the situation.  After a couple weeks, I have yet to hear back."

Our drink order was promptly taken and 2 of the 3 drinks were quickly delivered. We waited 10 minutes for the third drink and another 5 for our biscuits. When we got our food it looked thrown on the plate and was cold. It&#39;s obvious that the drive thru is the priority at this location because wait time and quality there is always excellent. Never got refills on the iced tea or biscuits, and the staff stayed huddled in groups away from diners.

First negative- all of their broths except the vegetarian have pork in them- so if you are not a pork eater like us- you must get the vegetarian which for some reason is $2 more. 
So I got my order for pick up. The broth was actually delicious and it had cabbage and mushrooms in it. I got mine with chicken- my husband got vegetarian.
Couple things: 
stingy with the noodles
Egg was not included and was extra ( what kind of ramen....) 
It was actually pretty tasty but very strange for ramen- for my chicken they actually gave me chicken breast- I have never had ramen like this- it was a- ok but really nothing great."

When weeks passed, oh my lord, we decided to just dine in. The front was so cute because it reminds me of Tokyo&#39;s way of marketing to their people. Fake food everywhere in the window! I&#39;m fascinated by play food, display food, it&#39;s so cute! 

Jade was possibly the sweetest girl we had ever to serve us. She was definitely a very sweet girl, and attended us quick, quick, quick! 

The food on the menu looked impressive, and I wanted one of everything. I&#39;m a Gyouza guru and always choose that as an appetizer + something unique from their menu. Jade brought us out the Hiyayakko (Tofu Salad) which indeed was made perfectly. It even went well with Gyouza sauce. The Gyouza itself was very spicy and my mouth burn from happiness. I sure do enjoy spicy food. 

No sushi of course, mostly hot bowls of soup, bowls of chicken, beef, eggs, etc., which by the way : Miso Soup was free and complimentary with us. I appreciated that. 
For the main entree: Teriyaki Bowl (The chicken, white rice and veggies) , and Katsu Don Bowl (Pork Cutleg, Veggies, condiments) but the Katsu Don Bowl was very sour because of Pork Cutleg. I ended up not enjoying the strong taste and switched it off to my buddy. 

I took the Teriyaki Bowl and the chicken was phenomenal with minimal Teriyaki sauce, which I&#39;d like an extra cup of! Can&#39;t get enough! The only problem was the vegetables were very cold, and didn&#39;t come fresh. The carrots flavor was way off and the rest.... well? I thought a to-go box would be ideal at this point. We enjoyed the choices of dessert: Mocchi is always a classic of my choice, and we tried the Panna Cotta with Ma. It was similar to a yogurt with cream. Not my most favorite outcome of this dessert-- I personally very much enjoyed the two flavors of green tea and strawberry Mocchi! I enjoy that they always drizzle it with chocolate, whipped cream and strawberries !!!"

The first time I came here I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the ramen! We had to come back the next week! The Japanese fried chicken is absolutely delicious as well!

That being said, I think Katsu&#39;s take on Ramen was pretty darn good.

Boy and I did the lunch combo - mine was the spicy chicken soup with the pork bowl and gyoza; his was the Shoyu soup with fried rice and gyoza.  A very good value for the price, neither of us finished our meals so there were leftovers to be had.  I was not expecting the GIANT bowl of soup with the combo deal. 

The gyoza was okay.  A little on the bland side and tended to fall apart when picking them up, but fine. Ditto Boy&#39;s fried rice.  Not the best, no the worst.   I LOVED the braised pork bowl.  So simple, yet so good: just slices of pork topped with a little mayo sitting atop a bowl of white rice and caramelized onions.  Next time we go to Katsu, I&#39;m just getting a couple of the pork bowls, I think.

My soup was pretty to look at a tasted fine, but just wasn&#39;t for me.  I did like how spicy it was, but I really disliked that there were bean sprouts mixed into the noodles making them unexpectedly crunchy (I always eat the bean sprouts separately at Pho places, keeping them out of the soup).  I preferred the Boy&#39;s soup, which had a richer, more flavorful broth and a better combination of flavors.

For not being a Ramen fan, I did like Katsu Ramen and I would be happy to go again.   Probably not for the Ramen, though."

We went on a weekday afternoon (1:30-2:00ish) and it was surprisingly packed. Luckily, it didn&#39;t take very long to get a table, about 15 minutes. 

Our server was very kind. We could see that she was pretty busy. Still managed to provide great service. 

We ordered the spicy chicken ramen, shoyu ramen, and teriyaki veggie bowl. Our bowls came out at different times, with the teriyaki bowl the first to come out. It was about another 10 minutes before we received the ramen bowls. I really dislike when restaurants do that. It&#39;s pretty awkward for the person that does receive their plate; you want to eat it while it&#39;s hot, but you don&#39;t want to be rude. The teriyaki bowl wasn&#39;t very good. The vegetables were over steamed, resulting in extremely mushy bok choy and carrots. The rest of the dish is pretty standard. 

The spicy chicken ramen was extremely oily and not spicy as at all-- something that other yelpers have said and worth repeating. I thought maybe I could spice it up with table sauces, but the sauce on the table would either make it saltier or oilier as a consequence. Really wish they would place sriracha or some other condiment on the table. I know that would make this less authentic, but at this point, the restaurant could certainly use some improvements even if it means less authenticity. Another thing is the ground chicken in the ramen is not very good. I would definitely order any other ramen bowl but this one. 

The shoyu ramen was probably the best dish on the table, but still 3 stars at best. It was pretty bland and unremarkable. But compared to the other dishes, this bowl was actually edible."

Simple menu, big bowls, rich soup, and in my mind the right kind of ramen noodles. This place works! But perhaps they could improve on the presentation a little bit, or even just slightly re-arrange some ingredients in the bowls (I gotta say, the pictures are not the most flattering of ramen noodle bowls). The half an egg thing annoyed me, should be two halves, come on!

I wish they had a better drink list, and their &#34;wait list&#34; was very silly; we weren&#39;t sure what to do, but I guess you just sign your name on the list?

I ordered the lunch special, which included Gyoza, Spicy Chicken Ramen and a Beef Bowl. My wife ordered the Chicken Teriyaki &amp;Vegetable Bowl. First of all, the portions were absolutely huge. We could have split the lunch special easily and been full. As it was, we took home half of the Chicken Teriyaki and almost all of the Beef Bowl. Leftovers for dinner!

The Ramen was phenomenal. Noodles cooked perfectly, a very tasty broth, ground chicken and a nice chili oil base. Delicious!  The Beef Bowl was tasty, and even better after adding a little chili oil. The Gyoza were perfect and the dipping sauce was just right. 

The Teriyaki Chicken Bowl was delicious, with huge chunks of chicken and lots of Bok Choy and Broccoli. The teriyaki sauce was a bit on the thin side but extremely tasty and gave perfect flavor to the dish. 

We will definitely be back. Next time perhaps for dinner."

I ordered the combo with veggies ramen, dumplings and fried rice. To be honest, the veggies ramen was a big disappointment. The broth did not have much flavor. The veggies were a couple slices of tomato, a few shreds red pepper, some bean sprouts. some Chinese vegetables and a few leaves of spring green salad which immediately wilted when it met the hot broth. For Japanese veggies ramen it should have bamboo shoots, seaweeds and some corn. The ramen noodle itself was cooked just right and it had good texture, the dumplings and fried rice were okay. The gyoza sauce was to salty. I would suggest to use the white vinegar instead."

Their Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen is pretty delicious. It&#39;s sooo full of flavor! But it is kind of oily/greasy... so I don&#39;t think I would order this again.. I also tried the miso ramen that my brother ordered and it was pretty delicious too!

The food was amazing. The chilled ramen was so nutty and the pork was very well cooked. Same goes for the noodles. The noodles were chewy (in a good way) and the tonkotsu broth was very deep and flavorful.  

Service was great. The servers were willing to explain the items on the menu thoroughly and weren&#39;t annoyed with our questions. 

The decorations were so cool and the Japanese shows/commercials kept us busy as we waited. The food came out relatively quick.

It&#39;s a small restaurant but the aura is cheery and casual. I&#39;ve tried nearly everything on the menu at this point and can&#39;t find much to complain about - from the noodles to the broth to the meat to the appetizers, it&#39;s all delicious (just a warning - the spicy chicken ramen is VERY spicy). The portions are more than satisfactory and if want to take some home for later they provide great sturdy plastic containers to do. The prices are great - I usually spend about $10-16 and every time I&#39;ve been, the service has been quick and friendly. 

Just a few notes - the menu is very small and there is only one vegetarian option (but the veggie ramen is so delicious and satisfying this is hardly a complaint). It can also be pretty crowded around busy times and there may be a wait time. 

If you&#39;ve never tried authentic ramen before but are willing to give it a go, give this place a try. If you are already addicted to that satisfying soup dish, this is quickly going to become one of your new favourite joints."

The wait wasn&#39;t too bad for a Friday evening. My friends and I waited around ten minutes for a party of six at 6:30pm.

I ordered the Veggie Miso Ramen ($10.45) and thought it was really tasty! It was peppery, but flavorful, a bit oily, but refreshing! There were lots of vegetables (bok choy, bean sprouts, grilled tomatoes) and lots of noodles. I got through about half before I raised my flag to surrender. (I did have Chipotle three hours before, so that may have contributed to my premature surrender.)

My sister got the Spicy Chicken Ramen, which she did not enjoy at at all. The broth was not spicy or flavorful, but very oily! The chicken was also ground up and it looked kind of gross -- wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

One of my friends got the Shoyu Ramen and a Katsu don on the side (he likes to eat ... A lot.) All I remember is that he really really enjoyed the Katsu don.

The place itself is small, but the interior design is very clean and modern.

The service was pretty good, considering how busy the place was. Our waiter came by within reasonable time to get everything out.

My only complaint about this place was the timing of the delivery of the food. 2/6 got their food (katsu curry) ten minutes after ordering, 3/6 then got their ramens (w/meat) ten minutes after the other two, and I got mine ten minutes after the three. I&#39;d like to think that they put extra TLC into preparing mine.

The crowds come in waves, so it&#39;s hard to tell how long you&#39;ll be waiting, but don&#39;t fret -- it goes by faster than you think! Just don&#39;t get the Spicy Chicken Ramen. :-)"

Sorry (not sorry?) to all those who fawn over Uncle, but Katsu is better: the ramen here is smooth, broth is packed with flavor but not overly salty, and hey, you even get a naruto in your ramen. The pork was buttery-tasting in a good way and mmm the portion is just right, if not a little big, but that&#39;s all for a better price than what you&#39;d get at Uncle.

Ryan K. and I dined at Katsu on a Wednesday evening, around 6pm. No wait, fast service! Katsu is situated in one of the many shopping plazas in this part of Aurora: I seem to remember a different shop here before, since I recognized the English Teacup shop next to Katsu. I LOVE the plastic food displays out in front of Katsu: so so reminiscent of my time in Tokyo! 

You have your choice of seating: two booths in the front windows, high-top tables in the center, and regular tables on the sides. They have two televisions going: one with English/American channels and the other broadcasting a Japanese channel. Top 40s music plays in the background amidst the fun decor of souvenirs/memorabilia from Japan.

We had excellent service with several staff members helping us out throughout the night. The menu is relatively simple, with your choice of appetizers, ramen, or rice dishes. There&#39;s even a children&#39;s menu, which is nice. Prices were reasonable, with ramen bowls ranging from $9.25 to $9.85; there was also a chilled ramen bowl, which I&#39;m sure will be good in the hotter summer months.

Ryan K. had the tonkotsu shoyu ramen and I had the shoyu ramen. So delicious! The noodles are slippery smooth and slurpable. As I mentioned above, the pork was buttery and flavorful, along with the broth. Super filling meal. They also served a small plate of kimchi to us before the meal, which I thought was a nice extra touch to the experience.

Next time we&#39;re in Aurora, we&#39;ll be back!"

Story of why it&#39;s only a 2 star review.  I saw the ramen options of different broth and I elected to go with the pork broth.  This is where I assume all the ramen was the same because the only description was just different types of broth with meat.  When I got my pork ramen, the soup was good however the noodles was wheat noodle.  So at this point I&#39;m wondering why I got wheat noodle in my ramen.  When I bought it up to the server and asked him why didn&#39;t I get ramen in my ramen.  He pointed at the banner behind the cash counter and told me the style of noodle they use because of that banner.  Ok, at this point the banner behind the counter is all written in Japanese.  I&#39;m not sure if he was just assuming that everyone knew how to read Japanese when they go in the restaurant and how that they use wheat noodle because of that style.  
At this point you think I&#39;m this jerk complaining about my noodle soup.  I&#39;m wasn&#39;t upset or irate to him.  I just told him as a customer you had this under ramen, the restaurant&#39;s name has ramen, and I was expecting raman when I came in.  I asked if I could get the same thing with ramen. (I only took one bite, so I wasn&#39;t trying to get 2 bowls for free)  He gave me an attitude and it was such a big deal to make another one or just take out the wheat noodle and replace it with ramen noodles.   

With the bad service I wouldn&#39;t come back even when the soup was decent.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other ramen places I can go.  I would had gave it one star but the soup base was pretty decent and I had to give it credit for it.

Pros: soup, price

Cons: service, bad menu"

Nice and cozy without feeling cramped. It is small so you may have to wait during peak hours.

If you order a combo be prepared, its a lot of food.  They did a great job of pacing my meal and bringing out the courses.  I started with the Curry beef. Wow, excellent not too much curry spice not too much meat, really well prepared. 

While one would think getting ramen right wouldn&#39;t be too hard alot of places get it wrong.  This was excellent and again a huge portion. All the ingredients tasted fresh. Flavors complimented each other and just the right amount/ratio of noodles to the meat, and other ingredients.

The meat inside the gyoza was incredibly dry but was seasoned fine. I got the shoyu tonkotsu ramen and was very bland in taste. I had to add a lot of chili oil and salt to make it taste ok...my mom ordered the regular tonkotsu and the soup tasted just fine. The gyudon with the meal was ok.

Gyudon:
The only thing nice that I can say about it is that they gave a good portion of beef...and the rice was good. I posted a photo that showed my gyudon. All the rice was drenched in the sauce. It was like eating congee (rice porridge). I had to ask for more rice to balance the saltiness of the sauce. Actually I had to &#34;order&#34; it because they wouldn&#39;t give me extra rice for the gyudon congee they served me. As for the beef, it was microwaved. You know how I can tell? Half of it was cold and the other half was dried out to the point of jerky. One half wasn&#39;t even the same color as the other half. The gyudon came with miso soup. It was 30 degrees out so a nice soup would warm me up. I was excited for the soup. Too bad it was cold...I had to ask them to warm it up. What?! On top of all that, I drove home and had diarrhea. I paid $22 for this &#34;experience.&#34; I will never ever EVER go there again. BTW I&#39;ve typed this entire review while still in the bathroom...yeah.

TL;DR Poorly microwaved beef: half cold, half jerky. Cold soup, had to ask for a reheat. Too much sauce. Too little rice. Asked for more rice, had to pay $1.50 for it. Went home, had diarrhea. At least that was free."

Was about the consistency of gravy and tasted just as greasy. I had amazing ramen in New York and was looking forward to having some out here. The positive reviews pulled me in but I was very disappointed. The place was busy though so maybe some people like it? Just not for me.

And I will be sure to return if I have a craving for ramen. I went a little after the opening craze, but there was still a wait and a decent amount of people. The service was pretty quick and I felt well attended to despite the large amount of people.

On my visit, I had the tofu app (hiyayakko). It was just soft tofu with a soy sauce and ginger. It was very simple. But, I like tofu a lot. So, it was perfect for me. If you aren&#39;t a fan of cold tofu and ginger, I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting this. I also sampled the tuna salad. The seared tuna was pretty good. But, there weren&#39;t that many pieces of it (which is to be expected). But, the price for the tuna salad is a little steep for the quantity of protein received.

The actual ramen of this place was pretty average. The egg was a little too well done for the ramen. I would prefer a more soft boiled egg. I sampled a few soup bases for the different ramen options. Some of the soup bases were better than others. I had the tonkatsu shoyu and I was fairly pleased with that. But, the miso broth was not very well made in my opinion.

There are only a few other options for ramen dining in Denver. But, the price of Katsu Ramen is better suited for a casual dinner than places such as Domo. When visiting, I think it is important to note that you are paying for what you get. Katsu ramen is fairly inexpensive compared to other ramen places. So, don&#39;t expect the quality to match somewhere like Domo."

Especially after Oshima Ramen disappeared, a decent ramen place close to my house was in order. :) 

Gyoza was pretty good and so was tuna tataki. The the ramen came. I went with 2 friends and we all ordered different ramen. I had the spicy chicken ramen, my friends each had a miso ramen and shoyu based ramen. I wasn&#39;t impressed with mine- it was too thick and wasn&#39;t even spicy after I mixed in a big spoon full of the chili oil. The miso ramen didn&#39;t really taste like miso-it tasted like dwenjang, the korean soy bean paste that&#39;s thicker and stronger in taste. The shoyu ramen broth tasted like the udon at sushi katsu. 

It&#39;s still decent for a quick ramen stop in this area but not somewhere I would make a plan to go. Still like sushi katsu better."

Our order:
Pork Gyoza
Tonkatsu Ramen
Spicy Chicken Tan Tan Ramen
Mango and Strawberry Mochi

First, the Gyoza was a disappointment. They looked good with a nice browned/pan-fried bottom, but they were very soft and and limp when you picked them up with chopsticks. Flavor was ok but it seemed like there wasn&#39;t enough binder/egg in the filling and the ground pork just fell apart very easily. 

Now for the ramen. The tonkatsu ramen had a great broth and the noodles were very good. Was glad to see there was a soft boiled egg and fish cake as well. The spicy tan tan ramen was good as well. Had a kick with the spicy broth. The ramen noodles in the tan tan are thicker and more traditional ramen noodles while the tonkatsu were thinner egg noodles. Both were very good.

Lastly, the Mochi is nothing different than what you can get at whole foods or trader joes. A little expensive for two pieces of Mochi and cut into quarters. 

Overall, the ramen was good as well as the service. Katsu Ramen is a nice welcome since Oshima Ramen closed about a year ago. Only one wish, that they add tsukemen (dipping ramen) ramen to the menu. Regardless, we&#39;ll be back for more."

First of all: Deja Vue! I don&#39;t wanna be all like: &#34;every strip mall in Aurora looks the same&#34; but for half a second I thought Katsu Ramen had taken the place of Sushi Katsu. Turns out it actually just looks almost exactly the same.
The plastic replicas of the food on the wall as you walk in is perfection. Sorry but I&#39;m not sorry that I love menus with pictures of the food and a plastic replica of the food?! Even better!
Don&#39;t be surprised. The deal where you can get ramen, gyoza and a side for 14.00 is ONLY FOR LUNCH. Boo.
We ordered gyoza to start with and dannnnnnng they are good. So gingery.
I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and (let me preface this by saying I always add a ton of sauces and spices to pho and ramen at restaurants and) I DIDN&#39;T HAVE TO ADD ANYTHING! So flavorful!
My friend ordered some fried rice too and it was actually kind of gross. Too eggy.

The atmosphere is on-point. If you&#39;re an anime fan, it&#39;s especially excellent. You can read some manga they have and sip some ramune too.

It was topped with scallions, chopped chicken, bean sprouts, a boiled egg (perfectly cooked) and one of those colorful slices of tofu (I think it&#39;s tofu). The noodles were cooked to perfection, with the appropriate bouncy texture.

The portion was large! Plenty to take some home (they provided those nice quart-size catering containers).

The folks from Sushi Katsu have opened a ramen-ya which has been getting quite a bit of attention as of late - in fact, if you don&#39;t get there right when they open, you&#39;ll be waiting a while to eat! And here&#39;s why.

The chef himself is from the southern city of Osaka but the ramen styles in fact skip all over the country, from a miso base popular on the northern island of Hokkaido (make sure you order it with corn for the full effect), to the pork-boney Tonkotsu (not to be confused with Tonkatsu which is the closest thing Japanese cuisine has to Schnitzel) from Kyushu in the far southwest. You can even try a Chinese-influenced ramen dish, the chili-dappled Tantanmen, which does indeed have its origins in the spicy Sichuan specialty called Dan Dan Mian. If you&#39;re just not quite in the mood for ramen, they also have curried beef with potatoes and carrots, or pork and eggs over rice, or teriyaki chicken... and before too long you&#39;ll be able to do a combo (one ramen dish, one non-ramen dish, and a plate of juicy pork dumplings (Gyoza)).

&#34;OK, that all sounds great&#34;, you opine, &#34;but why did you race through the food descriptions, and what is the rest of your review going to be about?&#34;. That&#39;s a really good question. Since Katsu Ramen aims to be an authentic ramen-ya, it&#39;s probably not a bad idea to review some Japanese dining etiquette. Yes, it&#39;s totally acceptable to slurp your soup! Not only does this cool things off, but it also indicates enjoyment. No, don&#39;t stick your chopsticks straight up in your rice bowl, or pass food to another person with your chopsticks - these mimic actions performed at funeral ceremonies. Yes, please eat everything you&#39;ve been given - wastefulness is considered extremely rude in Japan. Most importantly, never, ever, げっぷ at the table. (Admittedly, げっぷ is better than おなら, but do you really want to be known as &#34;that customer&#34;?)"

It&#39;s a small place;   Two high-top community tables that seat 8 and then eight to ten four-top tables along the walls.  There really isn&#39;t a hostess area, however the servers that are furiously running around serving people their food have eagle eyes and meet you pretty quickly.  

With it being the third day since they opened we thought it would be a good idea to arrive early or 11:30ish for lunch.  When we got there were only two seats available in the whole place and were seated right away. 

HOT TIP - They open at 11 am, if you don&#39;t want to wait, get there when they open.

On Doug&#39;s recommendation we ordered Kara age (fried chicken).  It was served with a spicy dipping sauce.  Some of the best fried chicken I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Great crispness and fantastic flavor of spices in the breading.  

I opted for the Spicy Chicken.  It didn&#39;t start out very spicy however, by the time we were leaving my lips were tingling.

We finally got to try it for lunch and it was very good. I had a Tonkotsu ramen and she had the Spicy Chicken ramen and we split an order of their Fried Chicken app  (karaage). Just the weekend before I had eaten at Tokio which is another ramen spot but in the Ballpark neighborhood. Check out that review if your noodle brained like me.
The Tokotsu broth was a little on the sweet side and not very &#34;sticky&#34; but had good flavor. I drained my bowl which says it all. The noodles had a decent bite to them. The charsiu was nicely cooked as was the shoyu tamago (soy sauce marinated boiled egg) and it came with cooked moyashi (bean sprouts) and negi (green onions) that were a nice addition to the bowl when added in.
I think my favorite thing I ate that day though was the karage which is like the deluxe Japanese version of Chicken McNuggets. The pieces were very large here but as a result the thigh meat inside was moist and tender.

I think it&#39;s undeniable that ramen is a favorite food amongst, well, just about everybody. Even if it&#39;s top ramen or Cup Noodle, people can&#39;t help but indulge in its satisfying, comforting &amp; convenient allure. It&#39;s filling enough to be a dinner, fast enough to be a lunch &amp; let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s a great midnight or morning hangover picker upper. The ramen trend has been around but is picking up pace here in Denver. I have no complaints as ramen contains many items I look for in a meal: carbohydrates, protein, soup &amp; vegetables. Now that you understand how dear ramen is to me, I present to you my verdict (oh wait I think that&#39;s already present in the star rating.....):

Katsu ramen&#39;s as good as ramen in Denver gets!

I&#39;ve definitely had my fair share of ramen in places like SoCal &amp; SF/Bay area so I feel as though I knew exactly what to expect from a good ramen shop. What Katsu Ramen did right:

1. noodles tasted fresh/slippery/a little oily (which I like) &amp; soft without disintegrating or turning into mush
2. portion size- the proportion of broth to soup was just right. I was able to finish my bowl &amp; soup &amp; feel absolutely satisfied. I was neither too full nor hungry still (I also didn&#39;t order any appetizers)
3. ambience: this place is modern &amp; hip. The walls have horizontal block wooden boards, you&#39;ll find some vintage japanese art on the walls along with some caligraphy &amp; a random corner with a ton of Naruto stuff. They all don&#39;t go together but I guess the theme is &#34;Japanese&#34; &amp; they threw in anything that related
4. attentive service: despite being busy, our waitress was still able to check in on us multiple times to see if we were doing ok. She brought our bill promptly and took our order @ the right time. She even asked guests outside if they signed in to make sure that we weren&#39;t confused. However, she messed up a bit when she asked us if we were doing ok 3 seconds after asking us the same question. I think she forgot what table she was at 
5. plastic/wax food displays in the front of the store: I absolutely love plastic food displays!!! There&#39;s no better way to decide what you want to eat than to see a 3D replica of your food. And you cannot be a jerk &amp; not appreciate the craftsmanship in the Japanese food art scene. Seriously, go YouTube it if you haven&#39;t already. 
6. menus with pictures: as if the plastic displays weren&#39;t enough to show you what you&#39;d be ordering 
7. fair prices 
8. murky/thick/savory broth: I don&#39;t think murky&#39;s generally used positively but for a ramen broth I use it as an indication that the broth is packed with flavor 
9. marinated soft boiled egg
10. cool bowls

What I thought they could improve on:
1. they didn&#39;t serve the combos that day &amp; they didn&#39;t give a reason why - this was disappointing because the combos looked great! They come with ramen, a side bowl of katsu don or fried rice &amp; 1 appetizer (I think) 
2. the spicy chicken ramen (that I ordered) wasn&#39;t spicy enough; but I think you can probably ask them to kick it up a notch 
3. chicken in the spicy chicken ramen display didn&#39;t match what I got in my bowl. The wax art showed a giant piece of fried chicken but what I actually got was minced meat. 
4. my friend came two days before @7PM &amp; they sadly ran out of soup-disappointment! 
5. soup spoons are cool looking but are impractical. It&#39;s hard to get to the end of your bowl of soup without dipping your fingers into the bowl to get it. Either that or you have to tilt the bowl. The soup spoons are flat from the bottom to the handle. They look like the variety that are used as a serving vessel for small bites or palette cleansers. 

Other than those setbacks, I&#39;d say the place is pretty great. Expect a wait if you&#39;re going soon after the date of this review. It&#39;s new so there&#39;s still a ton of buzz &amp; interest. I&#39;m looking forward to frequenting this spot during a time that&#39;s less busy."

Gyoza- was a bit greasy and not rolled as tight as thry should be but the filling was tasty and flavorful.
Shoyu ramen- broth was good and hot. I love the egg!
Tonkatsu ramem- broth was even better and pork tender. 
Service was overall good as well. Food was just a little greasier than I would like hence 4 stars but I would go back."

The place was already 90% full when we got there. We entered and waited for someone to seat us and right away, it was evident that this was not going to be a good experience.  We tried to wave at several waiters or look for a host to seat us, but to no avail. We thought maybe we were supposed to seat ourselves, so we sat at the last open table in the restaurant. Apparently, we were wrong as other people who came in after us were greeted right away and told to write their name down to wait. 

From there, we waited 15 minutes for someone to even stop by to check on us. A lady finally came by and gave us a slip of paper on which we wrote our order. A separate waitress with a tray of water glasses took our drink order. We ordered the tuna tataki, fried chicken and we both got the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. Shortly after they finally took our order slip, they brought us some korean pickles (spicy bean sprouts and spicy green onions). I don&#39;t eat spicy food, but my husband liked them. It took another 15 minutes after that to get our tuna tataki, which was good, but at $12.95, it was a bit pricey. It took another 15 minutes after that to get our fried chicken which was also good. It looked like it was supposed to come with some sort of seasoned salt to flavor the chicken, but only came with a pinch of it, so was not helpful. 

It took another 20 minutes to get our ramen after that. I&#39;m not sure if they were trying to pace it to our eating speed or if it really takes 45 minutes to make a bowl of ramen. When it came out, we were disappointed to find that it did not contain ramen noodles, but store bought asian egg noodles. They were very thin, not chewy and did not hold onto the soup flavor very well. I&#39;ve looked at the photos of other customers and I think maybe they ran out of ramen noodles as we got something different. The broth flavor was rather bland. I think maybe they&#39;ve already started watering down their broth since they&#39;ve been running out of stock every day. The pork in the ramen was very tough and dry. The egg and vegetables in the broth were very good. 

While we were eating, the waitress dropped off our check without a word, so we didn&#39;t bother getting dessert.

Overall, it was kind of disappointing. I hope that next time we try it, they&#39;ll actually have ramen noodles and maybe a little more service. As far as I can tell, there were several people in uniform there today, but only 1 waitress, which is probably why the service was not very good."

The pork was surprisingly tender and pretty tasty. Buy they didn&#39;t have any of the combo meals nor katsu bowls or dishes available, so our choices were severely limited. Apparently they had run out. The beef bowl was less than what it probably should have been for the cost.

Will give it another try to see if the experience is different."

The broth is the most important part, and most restaurants don&#39;t even try my favorite, the tonkatsu.

Ramen Katsu had delicious tonkatsu broth, generous portions, and great service considering this was their second day. 

This was really more like 4.5 stars, but I&#39;m confident in a few weeks they&#39;ll be in the groove and consistently hitting it out of the park. 

For those complaining about &#34;plain&#34; broth, don&#39;t order miso! Miso ramen is the most bland, classically, and won&#39;t satisfy Western cravings for salt/spice."

The service and the wait was a bit slow but that clearly a given on how busy it was. The marketing for the restaurant was well done and I would definitely say the hype of a new ramen place in Colorado was totally worth the hour wait!!!  

We started off with the Fried Chicken &#34;Karage&#34; and it was beautifully fried and lightly season, the sauce that came with it was a spicy aioli, it was paired wonderfully.

The second starter we got was the Gyoza, it was okay and had room for improvement. The skin of the dumpling wasn&#39;t properly sealed and fell apart when we lifted it up with chopsticks. But I understand the pressure of making hundreds to thousands of dumpling to prepare for the dinner rush. So when they settle down after a month, Im sure the dumpling will be better.

Our entrees was were the Japanese Fried Rice, the Tonkatsu Ramen, and the Spicy Chicken Ramen.

The meat in the Tonkatsu was well cooked and melted in your mouth. The broth was well flavored and a bit buttery. The thin noodles was a great combination. (I prefer thin wavey noodles to a thick ramen noodle) 

The Spicy Ramen had a good kick to it, and had a very similar taste to Korean Kimchee (pickled vegetables). The soft boiled egg was nice after soaking in the spicy broth. 
Both ramen came in traditional Japanese ramen bowls and it really add to the experience.

Lastly the Fried Rice was over peppered and over powered the rice but the pickled radish was a nice touch to it. 

The atmosphere was nice, and was nicely decorated, the collection of Inyusha mangas and the One Piece Luffy figure entertained me for a while.

After reading some of the other reviews of Katsu Ramen, those people didn&#39;t give any credit to Katsu Ramen and I hope they come back and change their reviews.

Overall, I would rate Katsu Ramen a 8.5/10, with the potential of a full 10/10 and is probably the best Ramen place in Colorado. Hopefully next time, they will have their liquor license because a Japanese beer would be amazing with ramen. Next time, I will try the Tonkatsu Don and the Shoyu Ramen."

A strange, unappetizing flavor, and not one i&#39;ll try again.  The gyoza were all right--the best thing in my order.  They are accurately described by Sarah H. in her review.  And Akira A. was right about the aura and service, both of which were fine.  But the food itself was nothing to return for.  Our server was very attentive and courteous, and I liked her.  The green tea flavored ice cream was all right, but nowhere near as good as I&#39;ve had elsewhere.   Disappointing overall."

I usually order take-out from this place to beat the crowd. However, for the first time, I dined in and brought a Ramen virgin with me. We ordered the Korean fried chicken, Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, and the Teriyaki Rice Chicken bowl. The service was very friendly and the food was brought out in a timely manner. For about $10 a bowl, compared to paying the Uncle, $15, the taste was okay. I wish there was more broth given to me in the ramen, it reminded me of eating an Asian spaghetti. It had a thicker miso consistency to it. But it was okay. The teriyaki chicken bowl was similar to chicken adobo (a Filipino dish), with lots of chicken fat and skin. However, the amount of boiled vegetables in the bowl helps make up for the feel of your heart-clogging. As for the fried chicken, it was dryer, and tasted as if an older oil was used to fry it. The sauce was unoriginal with the siracha-mayo dipping sauce. However, it wasn&#39;t super greasy, which was a plus. 

It was ironic that the server had mentioned that I came here a lot and asked what dish I liked?  I asked her which dish SHE liked and she responded with a, &#34;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve seriously never eaten here.&#34; Overall, the crowd has died down, the service is good (please be understanding when it&#39;s busy), and there&#39;s not a lot of ramen places in Aurora, I think there&#39;s none. I&#39;d still hit this place up on cold day."

Despite coming on the weekend, it was not too full, and the seats and tables are far enough apart that it probably wouldn&#39;t matter if it was. The decor of the place is really nice, with lots of traditional Japanese prints as well as anime posters and magazine covers on the walls. The staff was very nice and attentive throughout as well.

My father had a Shoyu Ramen and I had a Tonkatsu Ramen. We both found the broth great, and the meat deliciously tender. There was a nice portion of meat, and the slices were nice and thick. The different ingredients in the soups were used generously. Both orders came out piping hot and took long to cool, which is great.

The price of our meal was not too bad either, especially given the large size of the orders. I noticed that the beer is pretty expensive here though, which could maybe be a problem in the future (though we didn&#39;t order any on this visit).

I would certainly come here again! Happy to finally see an actual ramen restaurant in Colorado! They&#39;re certainly hard to come by here."

Once seated, the waitress drops off a menu and a paper to mark your order. I was sad that they are not serving combo meal at this time.  Wanted to try combo B: choice of ramen, gyoza, and beef rice bowl. They&#39;re probably too busy to make them at the moment. 

I ordered the shoyu ramen and the fried chicken. 
The fried chicken is a must try. It&#39;s crispy and delicous. The ramen was decent. The soft boiled egg was smaller than expected and fell apart easily. The broth was a bit bland. You can get chili powder per request but what I needed was some garlic paste. 

I gave this place 3 stars because food was decent and service was not up to par.

The staff seem very busy and unorganized- always going back n forth to the kitchen, asking if we got every thing, and since we sat near the cashier we can hear one waitress telling another girl she took her table. It&#39;s quite entertaining to see the chaos of a new restaurant. Service is slow and they&#39;re lots of shouting. Besides the 2 guys I see in the kitchen the rest of the staff are females. 

Maybe I will come back to try their rice bowl and desserts. Hopefully, they will be able to perfect their ramen in the future."

Within a week of its opening, many of my friends have already tried the place and told me it&#39;s the most legitimate japanese ramen place in Colorado. I couldn&#39;t wait to try it. 

I came with a party of 8 and had to wait 20-30 minutes before being seated. The outside appearance of the restaurant is very welcoming. They had window displays on both sides of the door of the kinds of food they serve. What a tantalizing way to lure you to stay while you wait outside to be seated. I was disappointed they didn&#39;t serve their combos which I would have loved to try. We were finally seated but our group was split into two tables of 4 which is fine. The interior decorations of the restaurant were very adorable. They had giant wall decorations of cartoon ramen, and japanese wood blocks with kanji on it. There is limited seating hence the long wait and if their popularity continues, they should consider expanding. 

I ordered the spicy chicken ramen as well as the karage as appetizer. The karage came within 5 minutes and they were these big pieces of fried chicken with a mayo/sriracha like dipping sauce. I thought it was delicious and the chicken was very juicy. However, after that, our table waited over 20 minutes just for the ramen to come. The ramen came in a very large bowl and had a very decent portion size. I was expecting fried karage chicken in my noodle but it was actually ground chicken which I didn&#39;t like as much. The broth looked delicious and I appreciated that they put extra spicy paste in the broth so people could season to their level of spiciness. I thought it wasn&#39;t spicy enough so I added more chili oil that was in a jar on the table. I personally thought my broth was way too sweet. The noodles themselves were good. My friends got the soyu and miso broth and they both thought they were too salty. Also the soyu noodles said it would come with chicken but we were trying to figure out where the chicken was. 

Despite the broth that is too sweet, I would come back at a slower time when there is no wait. Or if they offered to go services, I would get that. Definitely one of the best Japanese ramen places Colorado has to offer."

We ordered Edamame, Tan Tan Ramen (spicy chicken) and red bean and mango mochi. Edamame was steamed and salted just right! The soup was hot, mildly spicy, and flavorful with fresh and crispy bokchoy. The mochi was yummy and well presented!

The service was just fine however, even though they had a full house.

I loved it so much, I ate there multiple times on each of my trips. I have now tried a few places here in Denver to compare to. This time, I tried Katsu Ramen. They were voted best ramen in Denver by Westwood magazine. I figured I had to check them out and see just how good they are. I ordered the miso ramen and Brian got the shoyu ramen bowl.  To start off, we got their gyoza to share.  The gyoza arrived at the table and we both went to grab one.  They crumbled in our chopsticks. By crumbled, I mean completely fell apart.  They were extremely under cooked and mushy. I was not a fan at all. The ramen bowls arrived and looked fantastic. The presentation was beautiful. I grabbed my first bite and it tasted pretty good. A bit bland when comparing it to island ramen, but still had some good taste to it.  Brian&#39;s bowl on the other hand, was just plain gross. It almost had too many flavors that were overpowering each other. We tried adding some soy sauce and sriracha to it, but nothing could make this bowl taste good.

The location is a bit off the beaten path and that makes it even better. Tucked into a nice little neighborhood, this eclectic restaurant delivers in a big way. To say the food is exceptional is an understatement. I had the fried chicken biscuit and it was out of this world. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the biscuit was light and flakey and the gravy was the perfect flavor to bring it all together. 

This place is obviously like church to some people because I heard everyone talking about their weekly pilgramicdge. It totally makes sense.

Definitely get the blood orange mimosa. Don&#39;t miss this treat.

My only complaint was the service which was a bit slow and my waitress had to be hunted down every time I needed a coffee refill which got a bit annoying after a bit.

That&#39;s not an understatement. Prior to visiting Denver, I had researched restaurants to try and every list showed The Root Down as a place you must try! My friend made a reservation and we went for dinner.

Parking was kind of hard there, so we took an Uber to help mitigate that nuisance. I&#39;m not actually sure there is parking there, except in the street. The neighborhood is a really nice area - The Highland - full of cute houses.

We were seated immediately and brought water. Their drink menu all sounded good, but we both settled for their Don Draper - old fashioned. It was delicious and actually quite strong. I liked it a lot!

For dinner my friend and I split several things on the menu:
* Vegan smoked corn chowder (served chilled)
* Carrot &amp; Thai Red Curry soup (served hot)
* Veggie burger sliders w/ sweet potato fries
* Sweet corn risotto
* Chocolate bomb dessert

Everything was SO delicious. The soups were amazing. I was surprised how much I enjoyed each of them. The sliders were good (two came with the order) but a little expensive for what we got ($14 for two mini burgers and some fries). The sweet corn risotto stole the show, though. It was hands down one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten. Even though we were full we did get that dessert which was so rich and had intense chocolate flavor.

Overall our dining experience was fantastic. Our server was really friendly, checked in on us frequently (although when the risotto didn&#39;t show up we&#39;re sure he forgot to put that order in, but they were quick to make it for us so it made up for it!) and our plates were cleared so our table wasn&#39;t cluttered. The space is very cool and although dark, the bar lit up the place. The windows and doors to the patio were wide open so a lovely breeze was coming in and you get a fantastic view of the Denver skyline from inside. I will definitely have to come back here if I&#39;m ever in the Denver area again!"

The food is good, the atmosphere is pretty hipster and trendy, it&#39;s generally busy like all the time. But the price is sort of ridiculous (apparently no one else cares about this because there&#39;s ALWAYS a crowd here, WTF?). I guess it&#39;s one of those quality over quantity places? 

Food: For dinner, shared apreas with the BF. Got the lamb sliders while the BF got the steelhead trout. Lamb burger was OK, nothing special. As for the steelhead trout, you might as well be ordering salmon (maybe it&#39;ll be cheaper?) because IT LITERALLY LOOKS AND TASTES JUST LIKE SALMON. BF + I were actually pretty confused and had to confirm with the waiter who laughed at us and said he got that question quite often. 

For brunch, I got the steak + eggs and the BF got huevos rancheros eggs benny. BF + I felt SUPER jipped in terms of the amount of meat we got. I barely got any steak and he got two TINY pieces of pork belly. I&#39;m sorry, did I just pay $15+ per plate for a vegetarian dish? Apparently!

Pricing: GTFO. 

Service: Can&#39;t complain. 

I don&#39;t mean to hate because the quality of food is good but this place is way over hyped."

The vibe is stellar the moment that you walk in. We were greeted by a smile and super friendly hostess. We did not have a reservation (which I recommend doing) so we sat in the bar at a high tip.  Service was on-point and the food was even better (if that&#39;s possible). GET THE LAMB RACK!

F O O D
We started with the beet salad and sweet potato fries. You absolutely have to get the beet salad.  Amazing flavors. 

For dinner, we shared the arepas and the rack of lamb. People. The lamb was SO GOOD I considered booking a reservation for the next night while I was still at the restaurant. 

Dessert was also delicious, we had the banana crème brûlée pie, a coffee and their house made chai latte.

We didn&#39;t drink that night but I heard good things about their drink, &#34;Black Dress.&#34;

* Diver scallops.
* Short ribs.

The food tasted more unique rather then delicious. The entire table felt somewhat unsatisfied. Portion sizes are rather small for the price you pay. 

We ordered:
Spinach gnocchi, rack of lamb, roasted Kashmiri chicken, mushroom soup, kids mac n&#39; cheese, Banana &#34;Creme Brulee&#34; Pie and chocolate bombe.
 
We all agreed that the deserts were the best from what we had. It was tasty, but not out of this world. Rating them about a 3.8/5.
The second best would be the Kashmiri chicken - rating 3.5/5. The kids Mac n cheese tasted &#34;funny&#34; to the child at our table, so he didn&#39;t end up eating it. Rack of lamb was average 3/5. The rest of the dishes were just too &#34;interesting&#34; for our tastes. The mushroom soup and spinach gnocchi were the least favored dishes. A couple of people in my group had digestive issues after our dinner, if you know what I mean. 

On a more positive note, one of the hostesses was friendly. We had a group of people and they told us the wait would be an hour and a half. After talking to one of the ladies, she said we could all squeeze into a booth. The decor of the restaurant was cool. Vintage phones hanging on a wall, paintings, a large screen playing old movie clips, and a nice patio."

I made a reservation for 12:15 and arrived about 10 minutes early - we were seated promptly on the patio. The place is a bit tight, however we managed and wasn&#39;t a huge deal. 

I got the blood orange mimosa and my boyfriend got the bloody mary. The blood mary was delicious and I wished I had gotten that instead. The food was also pretty good...I didn&#39;t love everything we got, however a couple items I&#39;ll definitely be back for next time I&#39;m in town. Me and him shared the vegetarian sliders (comes with sweet potato fries and a spicy mustard on the side), a small banana bread French toast, and the breakfast burrito with soyrizo. 

The vegetarian sliders were both of our favorites. It was so flavorful and absolutely delicious with the spicy mustard smeared on. I would definitely try this (vegetarian or not!). The small banana bread French toast was the perfect size, for each of us to get half a French toast piece. It was good, however nothing special. It tasted exactly like banana bread. Would try it if you&#39;re big on banana bread. The breakfast burrito was my least favorite - it tasted very basic and have tasted pretty much the same burrito at other restaurants. I do appreciate they substitute the chorizo with soyrizo (which was good) and that they are so vegetarian friendly! 

Definitely recommend this brunch place for vegetarians and for those looking for a bottomless brunch place! :)"

Brunch here has been on the must try list for a while, so when I did realize we could make a reso, and not give up 1-2 hours just waiting for a table, I got on it.  We scored a table on the patio, for one of the last great weekends of the year.  It was a great patio with nice views of downtown.  The interior is also really cool, too.

The food was a mix of ok to really good...  The chicken and biscuit was the winner at the table.  So unique!!  The biscuit was flaky and chicken fried to perfection.  The kale salad was also a nice complement to an otherwise heavy meal.

The lamb burger sounded so good... but, unfortunately, it was so heavily spiced (with way too much garlic) that it tasted like Mexican chorizo, not lamb.  But, it was cooked well and the bun was perfect.  Maybe it just wasn&#39;t what I was expecting... a little disappointing.  

The sweet potato fries really sucked.  The iced tea was awesome.

We had a great brunch.  The atmosphere was perfect and there are many other great sounding menu items.  We&#39;ll be back to try some of the other offerings."

The place was hopping when I got here on a Thursday night about 8:30 or so. Glad I was dining alone, snatched a seat at the bar no problem, if I was waiting for a table it would have been a while. 

Anyway, the bartender was shaking up something that looked great so I switched from my normal IPA&#39;s and ordered a Beet Down, a gin and beet juice taste of heaven. 

The mushroom tart had caramelized onions, cheese, arugula, and amazing duck confit. Can&#39;t forget it was topped with apple sauce and finished with an unbelievable champagne balsamic reduction.

The lamb sliders may have had the best flavor of any meat I have ever had. Deliciously done, med rare, harisa and delicious sweet potato fries. My goodness that was amazing. 

Great conversations with patrons and employees, definitely one of the highlights of my trip."

Oh yes oh yes the deliciousness that is Root Down. They epitomize the idea of farm to table and locally sourced ingredients.  And what is even more amazing is this is reflected in their menu that does change with the season.  

I&#39;ve had the joy of eating here during the winter and now the summer. Both times I felt myself savoring the meal as slow as possible to make it last. 

I&#39;ve had the pork tenderloin which is unbelievable- GET IT. The short ribs were tender and equally delicious.  But for me the dish of the night the star of the show was the Spinach Gnocchi.  Holy goodness I can&#39;t even describe it just GET IT and thank me later!!

Root Down has a rustic look that fits with their deep &#34;rooted&#34; farm to table ideals, basically if it&#39;s not in season, they don&#39;t have it. Which may sound weird to some of you, but that&#39;s how nature works, fruits and veggies shouldn&#39;t always be in season, hence the term &#34;seasonal flavors&#34;. Sadly the only thing nowadays that the masses equate to &#34;seasonal flavors&#34; is a Pumpkin Spice Latte from Starbucks. 

So I was here with a large group and we tried probably half of the dinner menu, so I won&#39;t go into everything, I&#39;ll just list all of the items sampled, because you should eat everything here, no joke:

ITEMS TRIED:
- Lamb Andouille Sausage, 
- Seared Colombian Arepas 
- Spinach Gnocchi
- Devils Horseback (Stuffed dates) 
- Roasted Kashmiri Chicken
- Grilled Pork Tenderloin
- Lamb and Bacon Terrine
- Cheese and Honeycomb Plate
- The Highlander (cocktail) - Amazing scotch based drink, a great option to combat some of the heavier food items. 

I&#39;m probably missing a few more items, but it was seriously an onslaught of amazing food and drinks. Like said try everything I listed above. It was all so good. The Lamb and Bacon Terrine was so flavor packed and almost creamy to taste. This dish actually converted a non-pork eater while at dinner. The Devil&#39;s Horseback lit up your soul and dance on your tongue, if this is the true Devil&#39;s Horseback, I&#39;ll ride bitch any day. 

When in Denver, one must always kick it Root Down"

I never knew that song existed until I was waxing poetic about this restaurant and some friends enlightened me to this awesome fact. Maybe I&#39;m lame for not knowing, but how cool is that? 

Ok. So Root Down isn&#39;t really about this restaurant, but this restaurant holds true to the meaning of the word! According to Urban Dictionary, Root Down is all about getting back to basics so you you can just simply rock! 

The chef and cocktail team here do just that, taking it back to basics, honoring the farmers and producers and the food they create, letting the ingredients rock on the plate with simple embellishments that highlight the natural flavors of these products. 

The evening started with &#34;The Highlander&#34;, of which there can be only one. A scotch based cocktail that was smokey, robust, and a great way to wake up. A word to the wise, it didn&#39;t really pair particularly well with the food, so I&#39;d recommend this before food. 

The menu is divided into sharable plates, entrees, and desserts. We opted to order a several sharables and entrees to be shared as well, which made for a delicious meal. We started with the cheese and honeycomb,  Lamb and Bacon Terrine, Devils on Horseback, and some kale and brussels sprouts salad. The Devils were the star of round one, easily the best version of that dish I&#39;ve ever had. Read the description and tell me your mouth isn&#39;t watering: Tender Belly Bacon, Smoked Almonds, Gournay Cheese Fondue, Peppadew Peppers &amp; Sherry Gastrique

Round two consisted of the lamb and bacon terrine, horseradish gnocchi, apple cider pork tenderloin, and the Kashmiri Chicken and Steelhead entrees. It&#39;s hard to pick a favorite, as absolutely all of these dishes were phenomenal. The chicken was exceptionally well prepared with the crispiest skin, succulent breast, and delicious thigh meat as well. The Steelhead had grapefruit, sweet braised cabbage, and these tender but crispy black lentils with them. The pork was cooked to a perfect medium, and the terrine had fantastic texture and was eaten without the toast! 

Dessert came in the form of a Don Draper, pretty much their take on the Old Fashioned. Sweet, spicy, and the perfect end to a meal.

Root Down just does it right."

I&#39;m not sure why Yelp labels them as vegan, vegetarian, and American restaurant, because it certainly is just a vegan friendly restaurant. Only few dishes on the menu were vegan or can be made. But, one good thing about this restaurant is they have plenty of GF option. 

The staff (sorry I forgot to ask his name) who serves at the bar area was cool! He was very honest about their food and very attentive. Thank god he was very upfront telling us this is not a vegan restaurant, or I&#39;d order a steak and thought it tasted just like a real one!! There is another person specifically pouring water for us. (Thumbs up) 

We got what we can have from the menu. The baby beets salad was so tasty. Simple but flavorful. It comes with two types of beets, arugula, beet pesto sauce, minced garlic, with balsamic vinegar dressing. Perfect combination! The main entree was tofu korma. I have to say tho, it&#39;s a bit too pricey charging $24 for a tofu dish. But it does taste really good. It comes with roasted cauliflower, three slices of tofu, black wild rice?!, with red curry sauce. Great taste! Vegan chocolate ice cream was fantastic! Love everything in the restaurant!

This review is for their brunch menu. On the breakfast side, the menu offered a vegan masala tofu and sub-soyrizo breakfast burrito; on the lunch, vegan-by-request sliders, and a salad option. More than what other restaurants offer, but felt like they could do better especially for a place as popular for vegetarians as this. The other options were very difficult to modify.

Food: 4.5 Stars
It&#39;s quality over quantity b/c the flavor was on point. The masala tofu was a delicious blend of curried cauliflower, kale, and raisins topped with avocados. The olive tapenade was a nice pop of surprise hidden underneath the fried shallots. The pickled red onions carried this over to the side mixed salad. 

Repeatability: 4.0 Stars
Great service. Cool vibe. A spacious dining patio, a separate one for the bar. The food was pricy, $12. And smaller portions than average. Definitely some room for improvement.

They have complimentary valet service which is terrific! We were meeting with some friends for dinner based on Yelp recommendations. We arrived early, so it wasn&#39;t entirely packed, but it sure did get freakishly loud after a little while. 

My interest was piqued by the eclectic menu of both vegan, vegetarian and meat dishes to choose from so I opted to try the veg consommé for starters. It was interesting tasting, not entirely bad but not exactly delicious either. The presentation of the ceramic bowl with a vegetable ravioli and spring greens while our server poured hot broth on top was quite entertaining. It was only lukewarm by the time I sampled it so I asked my server if she could warm it up. She whisked everything away and brought out a total re-do with a piping hot broth pouring on top. Definitely hotter, but the lack of flavor was unchanged. Sigh. 

Redemption of the most amazing boneless short rib was served on my plate along with several gastric sauces that tasted fabulous. Bravo! I savored every delectable tidbit and almost licked the plate! I may return."

Ever since I landed here in Denver, people have been telling me this is the place to be. Make like a seed and root down in Root Down. So to be honest, my expectations were high. Especially with their Yelp ratings too. Like damn son is this place gonna make me transcend into culinary heaven? Eh, no. 

So my main complaint is, why am I still hungry after spending $60 on a meal. Seriously? I get it. Small plates. Tapas. But why am I still hungry? I&#39;m a small dude too. 5&#39;6, pushing maybe 125lbs. My stomach don&#39;t hold much. But spending that much only to be somewhat nourished isn&#39;t my kinda deal. 

That being said though, the food was pretty darn good. Lamb sliders were top notch. Had a very unique taste to it and if it was actual burger size, I probably woulda loved it even more. I also had some sort of scallop dish that was good as well, but again it was gone in three bites. If I was starving to death and I came upon this restaurant, I would think I was in purgatory. Amazing food but not filling at all. 

The restaurant itself is pretty cool though tbh. Used to be a mechanics shop I&#39;m assuming. Love that they still kept the garage doors. Gives the place a wide open layout that makes the restaurant more of an outdoor party than anything else. Service was also pretty cool and friendly. 

Might come back here again if I have a wad of cash that&#39;s burning in my pocket, but for now it&#39;s a pass for me."

The people here are the best. They squeezed us in for a full course dinner literally minutes before the kitchen closed down. They were so sweet and full of personality, and we walked out feeling like we made some new friends.

The food here is so down to earth, both meals were fresh and satisfying. 

My AM meal consisted of a ramen devil egg - such a cute and crunchy twist on a flavorful favorite, a single order of oatmeal pancake - comes with fruit and smothered with sugary drizzle, and a very filling meal of goat cheese biscuits with fried chicken - love that &#34;curry&#34; sauce mmMMm.

My PM meal was the kale salad - hidden chunks of bacon throughout healthy goodness, the lamb sliders - a bit salty but paired wiith the best sweet potato fries I&#39;ve ever had, and the apple almond coconut desert - like a party in my mouth.

Not everything on the menu is vegetarian. However, the veggie dishes are pretty impressive. 

My sister took me here for an upscale birthday dinner. It fell on the 1st Tuesday of the month, which meant that I could order the raw vegan, gluten free dinner. 3 courses plus dessert. 

The first course was soup. Raw food means that it cannot be heated over 118 degrees so the soup came out just barely warmed through. I can&#39;t recall what it was, but it had mushrooms and was drizzled with a flavored oil. I would have preferred a chilled soup to this one. 
Second course was a marinated shaved beet dish. It was my favorite of the night. It was well dressed and felt meaty and substantial. 
My entree was a zoodle dish with fennel and cherry tomatoes. This was a tasty dish, but it wasn&#39;t very inventive. I have a zoodler at home, so this wasn&#39;t that special for me. 

Sister ordered the tofu dish. Three big, marinated and seared tofu steaks with grilled broccolini on top. Her entree outshined mine. 

Dessert was where it was at. The raw chocolate cake was dense and rich. The pistachio crust was a desirable change in texture to the creamy chocolate. When the server found out it was my birthday, she asked if I was a strict vegan. I am not, so she brought out an additional dessert, chocolate pots de creme. I make this at home so this wasn&#39;t a new dish experience for me, but I enjoyed it and the hazelnuts was a lovely addition."

It was 80 during my visit in Denver so that was definitely an option.  We arrive pretty promptly at the beginning of Happy Hour and we were able to snag few of the last seats at the bar.  First, the drinks were amazing...and what&#39;s more amazing are their prices!  We looked at the main menu, but instead opted to choose shared plate options of their Happy Hour menu which were half off. We tried everything on that menu and even doubled some orders.  The beat salad was TO DIE FOR!  Absolutely delicious.  Next were the beef tacos, whatever that beef is braised or cooked in is beyond me, so flavorful and tender.  If I&#39;m ever in Denver again, I would most definitely go back without question."

They know that it is one of the most common ordered items on their menu and they didn&#39;t have enough.

It was my birthday dinner, so it wasn&#39;t a great birthday."
root-down-denver,Jennifer R.,kTbg9kOkO0-C1H1TD--CgQ,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,35,8,HEBUsip9nyDuMpDsEHkzBg,5.0,2016-01-20,"I have been here a few times and I have to say that it never disappoints. The food is inventive and just the right amount of hipster-y. (Definitely on the almost excessive side of the hipster-y scale.) I do appreciate that their ingredients are insanely fresh and many of them come from the greenhouse owned by the restaurant. If loving farm to table makes me wrong then I don&#39;t want to be right. The cocktails are in the same vein, inventive and trendy. The menu is relatively small which is almost always a good sign. 

They have a really good happy hour (not sure about times) with awesome value on drinks and small plates. They also have a Sunday dinner that comes with 3 or 4 courses from a fixed menu (you choose between two options for each course.) I can only remember 3 items I had, but I kinda feel like it was 4 courses total. Not sure. I think it was $30, which is pretty good considering a single entree can be at least that amount. Each course is a little smaller than a regular entree would be, but it&#39;s still plenty and its fun to get to try several different things. I had a pasta starter, Wagu beef for my entree and bread pudding with bourbon ice cream for desert. The pasta was fabulous as was the bread pudding. The beef wasn&#39;t amazing, but was still pretty good. They have a cocktail with St. Germain in it that is pretty wonderful and very &#34;fresh&#34; tasting. 

It&#39;s usually pretty crowded and noisy, but not so loud that you can&#39;t hear the people with you. The decor is trendy and comfortable. Strangely enough, every time I&#39;ve been here except once, my party of 4-6 has been seated in a large booth in the bar area which I love and now request specifically. So I have only once sat in the actual &#34;dining room,&#34; but I really love that big booth in the bar! The service is always superb and the staff is very knowledgable and friendly. I have never had less than incredible service here. 

In conclusion, this place is fabulous (not cheap) and it&#39;s one of my &#34;go-to&#39;s&#34; for out of town guests."

The cocktails are equally as delightful. The ambiance is amazing, and the service is impeccable. My only wish is that they had more tables so I didn&#39;t have to make a reservation so far in advance... This is not a good spot for children and is more of a date night location.

I finally coerced one of my girlfriends to go with me which turned into a double date lol. They arrived before we did, which they do not sit you without your whole party there. 

Once we arrived, our friends were at the bar so I checked in for our table but our friends were told something different in regards to putting their names on the waitlist. We were told that we needed to put our names on the waitlist bc they were full from reservations but our friends were told they had to just wait for the whole party to arrive instead of having them put us down on the waitlist. So we were told two different things from two different people. 

They only had seating available on the patio, which is not weather permitting. Once seated and handed the menus, my jaw dropped because I didn&#39;t realize the price of the dishes. I&#39;m budgeting so I should&#39;ve looked at the menu before choosing this place. We each ordered one plate choosing from either the shared plate list or small plate list. We ordered the spinach gnocchi, lamb andouille sausage, Oregon wild caught albacore tuna crudo, devil&#39;s on horseback, and sweet potato fries. 

The largest plate was the spinach gnocchi and my favorite dish. All the dishes were presented very nicely and all tasted quite deliciously. I was just a bit disappointed in the dish portion sizes compared to how much each dish cost. I&#39;m not willing to spend $100 for just one person to feel full. If I were to come back, I&#39;d prolly come back for happy hour. 

Parking is all Street parking unless you valet. And they&#39;re a popular restaurant so be sure to make reservations if you do decide to try this place out."

The space is quirky and imaginative while still feeling elegant and comfortable. And as strange as this may sound, I love their toilets! The toilet-sink combo that allows you to save water by using hand wash water to fill the tank is amazing and really shows that Root Down cares about the environment and is conscious of water conservation.

Now that I&#39;m done fan-girling over the toilets (ahem), I can say that the service and food here are incredible. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the the menu, personable, and willing to answer our many questions about the area as well. Despite the fact that the place was packed, service was quick and efficient and our table never felt neglected.

Armed with a glass of Rose to sip on, I ordered the Carrot and Thai Red Curry and Roasted Baby Beet salad. I absolute loved the freshness of the curry, which was served at the perfect temperature to make it enjoyable even on a warm day. The apple chutney at the bottom was a nice little surprise and went great with the velvety texture of the soup. I enjoyed the beet salad as well, but have to admit I was a little jealous of one of my dining companions&#39; order of the Spring Pea and Carrot salad. It was just so bright and beautiful that I&#39;m bound and determined to order it next time. (And there will be a next time.)

Thanks for the wonderful experience Root Down!"

My daughter raved about Root Down so we couldn&#39;t miss dining here while in Denver. The service was excellent. We fortunately got a table right away because someone didn&#39;t show up for the reservation but I would plan in advance and make a reservation. There is valet parking there. There is indoor and outdoor seating and we were fortunate enough to visit on such a beautiful Sunday morning. I have egg allergies so I cannot eat eggs so I always love when there are some vegan breakfast options. I had the tofu scramble it has Cauliflower  and avocado. It was beautifully presented. My husband had the huevos rancheros and said his was delicious. They have an airport location so I will be sure to allow enough time to stop there before my flight home

It was defiantly well worth the visit ! We pulled up as kind of a last minute idea because we were in the Highlands and they had complementary valet parking. Inside there is a bar section, dining room, and back patio. Very beautiful dark ambiance with an amazing view of Denver ! 

The host said he could get us in the dining room if we could be out by 7:15 which was over an hour and half so that was really great of him ! 

We were sat and greeted by a Sofia, she was greater server!  She was very knowledgeable of the menu, very attentive and nice ! I got the veggie sliders vegan style with gluten free buns , and she did alert me the sliders did have some gluten in them and the buns had some egg which was fine but very appreciated !!! 

The sliders with sweet potato fries were great and full of flavor !! The little house made veggie patties were packed with carrots, Farro, and many veggies ! The fries were sweet but crispy and topped with sea salt!! My dad has the Kashmiri chicken with a green chili grits cake , Kale salad and two dipping sauces. The chicken he said was very moist and juicy, the polenta was packed with flavor and the one sauce was very spicy and amazing flavor ! 

Overall it was a great experience ! I look forward to going back and trying more meals, brunch, and dessert !"

I looked ahead, and Root Down popped up with several positive reviews. It looked exactly as hipster and awesome as I wanted. 

We ubered there ten minutes early, but was seated immediately anyway, despite the place being pretty buzzing. We liked the feel of the place immediately. The wall we sat by was covered in tin can lids and it looked pretty cool. Our server was super friendly with his newspaper boy cap. We got a glass of wine and a beet cocktail, and quickly decided on our food. The place was pretty packed, but the first dish arrived speedily anyway. I was impressed. Our server was on top of things, and friendly and attentive without hovering. We had the watermelon dish at first and it was absolutely delicious. Fresh and tasty. My entree was gnocchi and my girlfriend had the vegetarian burger sliders. Again, our food arrived quickly, and it was amazing. So tasty and well cooked. And it looked pretty too. We finished with a banana creme brûlée and it matched the rest in flavor and presentation. 

Suffice to say, we were extremely pleased with our selection of restaurants. The ambience was pleasant, the service was on point and the food was both beautiful and flavorful. I would go again any day and recommend to anybody who were in Denver. 

On a final note, this place is both vegan and vegetarian friendly."

We arrived shortly before 10:00 am on Sunday and there was already a huge line. If you don&#39;t have a reservation, the right side of the restaurant fills up walk-ins at the bar and a few of the community tables. 

The menu is focused on seasonal organic and local food. They also have an amazing cocktail menu. While most people were chugging down Bloody Marys and bottomless mimosas, I went with the coconut ginger fizz, which was delicious (even the gin was organic). The blood orange mimosa is also a tasty take on the classic mimosa. 

Gluten-free eaters will rejoice at the options on the menu. We started off with the ramen deviled eggs. The turmeric egg yolk was great, but I loved the pickled celery scallion salad with yuzu vin even more. I&#39;ve never had a Benedict with quinoa cakes before, but I might be a convert. They were crispy and slightly sweet. The Root Down Benedict had perfectly poached eggs and a divine ibérico cheese &amp; sun-dried tomato Hollandaise sauce. The side of home fries were quite colorful to boot. 

However, the best thing we ate was the almond flour-buttermilk pancakes. I can&#39;t believe these are gluten-free. They were both crispy and fluffy and topped with pear butter, honey whipped cream, and coconut flakes. The side of fresh fruit were thinly sliced and lightly sprinkled with salt and chili pepper (Mexican style).

This was one of the best brunches I&#39;ve ever had. On top of that, the gluten-free options were amazing and my girlfriend was ecstatic. I can&#39;t wait to return to try their happy hour and dinner menu!"

Oh my goodness, I cannot rant enough about how incredible the food and service is at this restaurant! Root Down is incredible. I went for dinner. We went right at 5pm on a Sunday, and there were a lot of kids. Even so, it was still not really loud. I started with the arepas, which were hearty and tasty. You only get two of them, but it is filling. It is definitively a &#34;shareable plate.&#34; It is not fried hard like other arepas, and it has a thicker filling. My boyfriend had the sweet potato fries, which were super tasty! I loved them as well. Then I ordered the trout. My goodness. I have never has such amazing trout and brussels sprout. My boyfriend had the lamb, which was also incredible. The service was great!! The desserts were awesome! I highly recommend it!! Also, the chai tea is strong, but I like it that way!"

My main course, trout, was delicious... crispy skin and all the flavors seemed to work very well together. The bread pudding portion size is large, so be ready to share or just be greedy for the night lol. 

I knocked it down a star because of their green chili lentil soup. It was more like salsa and didn&#39;t match the description of a &#34;lime crema&#34;. I had it as an appetizer, so I was very nervous about my entree after initially tasting this. Happy things ultimately worked out."

It was packed at 7 PM on a Wednesday, so reservations are highly recommended, or you might score a few seats at a communal table in the bar area. 

The menu has a little of everything. The plates are small for what you pay, but farm to table dining usually comes with a premium. 

We started with the squash and parsnip soup, which I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of. It lacked salt, started off sweet, then became increasingly more spicy. I found it too watery as well. 

The chickpea fries on a bed of kale salad were delicious. The cheesy cashew Romanesco sauce that came with it was very addictive. A nice vegan and GF dish to share. 

If you have room for dessert, you must have the creme brûlée pie. One of the most unique desserts I&#39;ve ever had. I go crazy for whipped cream, and this one has loads of whipped sour cream on top of vanilla custard and a gluten-free peanut butter chocolate pie crust. They brûlée bananas on the side and top the whole plate off with a load of chopped toasted peanuts, another thing I can never have too much of. OMG. I wanted to keep eating but simply couldn&#39;t. So rich and delectable. If they froze and shipped this dessert, I&#39;d order it online. 

Worth the Uber drive if you&#39;re staying downtown."

This was once an old gas station. It&#39;s a rustic feel and their name says it all, Root Down, getting back to the basics of showing appreciation to farmers with amazing food.  With their menu, it really shines through. They take great pride in presenting amazing food and heavy drinks.  

I had no clue what to order for brunch so I stared at the menu for a while. That&#39;s when I spotted it, then Colorado Lamb Burger. I&#39;ve never had a burger with a fried egg on it. But, I knew while I was here I had to try. Accompanied by sweet potato fries, this burger had a side of a curry-lime sauce and a mint-garlic yogurt (aka tzaziki). I was surprised by this pairing, as these were probably for the fries, I used them on my burger too! When our food arrived this burger was a glorious site. The perfect fried egg on top, just waiting for the yolk to melt down with that first bite. Oh, picture the taste of this burger, the distinct taste of lamb, but with a kick. It almost tasted like chorizo was mixed in. No no, just the spices added made it that way. I couldn&#39;t put this burger down after that first bite. I had egg yolk running back down my chin. That brioche bun was certainly perfect choice! I ate that burger faster than is eaten anything since being in Colorado. I was a fully and happy guest! Our server was friendly and answered all our questions. They have endless mimosas as did most other places we brunches. They fill you up before you drink half of it. My tip, is wait til it&#39;s less than half until you let them pour, then you can figure how many you&#39;ve had to make it worth the price. :) MIMOSAS ALL DAY LONG!  These aren&#39;t the dinky champagne glass mimosas either, these are pint glasses and these mimosas are strong.  

Loved the interior of this place too. Old photos that had been enlarged lined the walls of days passed. The bathrooms were always clean and of course had the toilet sinks. That&#39;s the coolest thing ever! You flush and the sink turns on to use the recycled toilet water to save! All in all I would recommend when visiting to come here for brunch and then go to their sister restaurants to enjoy their brunches too. Great chefs, wonderful service and they show how they care for their food and their guests."

I know it&#39;s farm to table which is great but I literally felt like our waiter drove to the farm in between visits.  Maybe it was on off night , who knows?! I&#39;ve been in the business and I now the difference between busy and incompetence.  It went from funny, to seriously where is this guy?  The place is super nice and the patio was great but for the prices and the amount of food you get is kinda weak sauce.  If you wanna charge that kinda of money for the food , at least be around to serve it.  

Pros:  

Nice decor and patio
Lady wearing red dress Sunday night super nice
My drink was at least decent.  

Cons:

Service was a sweaty bag of dicks
Food was good just overpriced 

The way to my heart is booze and I guess the lady in red knew that and hooked me up with free drink tickets for the wait and apologized.  I&#39;ll come back and give it a go again ,  hopefully I can up this score.   Truthfully it was more of a 2.5 but you wouldn&#39;t read a 3 review."

The plus side, I was happy that the place took reservation as it was convenient for our big party. The restaurant has nice patio to sit on and the interior is cool and modern. The service was also pretty good.

Gravlox/smoked salmon, herbed cream cheese, and heirloom veg on a fresh bagel. Possibly the best breakfast sandwich to ever hit these taste buds. Seriously delicious.

Did have the pulled pork omelette and it was tasty, but the sandwich had already set such a high bar.

Bottomless mimosas will get you there; the house-made bloodies might make you stay. Very solid brunch."

Impressed by a meal at Ophelia&#39;s Electric Soap Box shortly after stepping off the plane from 
Las Vegas to Denver it was on the recommendation of the sister restaurant&#39;s GM that brunch at Root Down was selected over a midday meal at Linger, the resultant four plate meal undoubtedly justifying the restaurant&#39;s far reaching acclaim, though perhaps not *quite* as memorable as the one a week prior.

Now offering Friday brunch, a 2016 development prompted by the same sort of customer demand that has seen a second location flourish at Denver International Airport, Root Down is the brainchild of Chef/Owner Justin Cucci and with a focus on small plates composed of wholesome local ingredients the menu is built to cater to almost any dietary discretion, healthy omelets offered alongside French Toast, Dessert and Pancakes with no one item receiving less creativity or higher praise from fans than any other.

No doubt a space built on concepts of nature and sustainability, even the restroom fixtures taking a approach to reuse handwashing water towards the next flush, those entering Root Down are greeted by bright colors as well as smiling faces, the music trending mid-tempo and cheerful which is likely a good thing as those arriving without reservations are all but guaranteed a short wait during all but off hours.

Ideally built for parties prone to sharing, but also conveniently offering demi-portions of several plates for those tackling the menu alone, it was with a few specials declined that a two-course quartet of sweets were selected, the lamb burger as well as the chicken and biscuits unfortunately left for another time even though both they and the Benedicts all looked great.

Waiting perhaps thirty minutes for round one, the patio full by noon with interior soon to follow, half-portions of both the Gluten Free Pancakes as wells as the Fried Banana Bread each proved elegant and well concocted, the former fluffy despite the use of toothsome almond flour while the later was moist and rich without trending too sweet, the flavor of fruit held in check by bittersweet chocolate and chicory amidst tangy crème fraiche and refreshing citrus syrup.

Showing flare for composing plates with one eye towards classical compositions with the other looking towards pairings that at first may not seem to make sense, desserts offered no less intrigue than entrees as Boozy Bread Pudding awash with nutmeg found its foil in caramel infused with earthy aromatics plus a crunchy cocoa tuille, the &#34;Banana Crème Brulee Pie&#34; deserving every bit of its signature status as the lightly burnt custard danced atop a Peanut Butter crust punched up by housemade beer nuts beneath a crown of whipped Sour Cream."

And I was somewhat a little disappointed. I was looking how fantastic this place is on Yelp but we only enjoyed one dish and that was the diver scallops. 

Food:
Devils on horseback- we started our meal with some Devils on horseback. This dish sounded super tasty. It had crispy bacon, smoked almonds, gounay cheese fondue, peppadew peppers, and sherry gastrique. The dish was good when it was hot, as it just sat there while eating the cheese started to get chunky and it became cold and held a slightly different feeling and flavor. 3 1/2 stars 

Diver scallops- this was probably the highlight of the whole meal. My boyfriend I just absolutely adore scallops and this definitely went up to par. But let&#39;s be real... Who can really fuck up with scallops? Actually I stand corrected, you could over cook them and then it&#39;ll be ruined.. But these scallops were very moist and juicy. The dish consisted with plantain hash, asparagus, edamame, fried capers, pickled red onions, and lemon habanero tartar sauce. If I knew it was this good then I would just order more scallops. Unfortunately there aren&#39;t that much in this dish, it is pretty tiny. For flavor 5/5. For price 3/5 please make it cheaper!

Colorado Lamb Sliders- the dishes were so small that we needed that extra dish to leave us full. This dish consists with ground lamb, aged white cheddar, harissa aioli, arugula, sweet potato fries, and mint garlic yogurt. The meat was very dry and disappointing. The mint garlic yogurt tastes way off and doesn&#39;t mesh well with the meal for its weird flavors. Probably the worst part of the meal. 2/5 

Sweet corn risotto- this plate was salty in some parts of the dish and very bland. Idk if it&#39;s because you have to mix it together but there was nothing special about this dish.. I do recall that we didn&#39;t even finish every last bit of it. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a vegan nor am I a vegetarian. To bland for my taste. 2/5

Presentation on food 5/5: though this restaurant didn&#39;t fit the taste palette I like, they had some bomb ass presentation on their food. 

Service: 2/5 our server was absolutely horrible. Took us forever to get our order in, took forever on getting our water/drinks. She never came to the table to check up on us. It was absolutely horrible. But the service didn&#39;t affect the score of my review. If I included it, I would give this place 2 stars. 

Overall, I feel like the reason why I didn&#39;t like this restaurant that much is because I&#39;m not into vegan or vegetarian foods. The food wasn&#39;t  horrible but it wasn&#39;t great either. I probably won&#39;t come back to this restaurant when I&#39;m in town again. Perhaps I might give it another shot one day in the near future."

The food is that good.  The ambiance is that amazing.  It is locally sourced.  I would eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner... and I have.

So, here are my tips:
DO call ahead and make a reservation.
DO &#34;splurge&#34; and go for the delicious drinks.
DO get the pancakes as an &#34;appetizer&#34; for breakfast for your table.
DO get bagels from Rosenbergs HERE without waiting for 30 minutes in line in Five Points.
DO consider the lamb burger for breakfast.
DON&#39;T miss out on this spot.  

(And... don&#39;t leave with out checking out the really cool water-saving toilets... yes, I just said go check out the toilets.  Trust me, do it.)"

They do brunch/breakfast as well as lunch and dinner. My boyfriend and I ordered the pancakes as a starter and oh my gosh they were delicious. We devoured it in minutes. Everything was super fresh and I can&#39;t even remember all of the ingredients.

I ordered the breakfast burrito which had black beans, chorizo(?), avocado, + egg and it was so good. The mole sauce + pico de gallo weren&#39;t too overpowering and gave it just enough flavor. The home fries were really good too. I love when restaurant&#39;s put a unique spin on this side and they had purple potatoes, regular potatoes, and sweet potatoes all roasted with sea salt. Yum!

Boyfriend has the lamb burger and pretty much licked his place clean. All of the above were decently priced as well. I think it came out to $34 for the two of us (including the pancake starter). 

Must go if you&#39;re in Denver."

The wait was estimated 1 hour but was definitely shorter, luckily they text you when your table is ready so you can roam around (you have 10 minutes to make it back)

A bit disappointed with the food given the hype around this restaurant, but at least the waitress comped our soda due to the long wait
---huevos rancheros: this Benedict was highly recommended by the waiter but the skimp 2 pieces of &#34;tender&#34; pork belly were hard and the poached eggs we&#39;re so undercooked that the egg whites were even runny
---fried chicken &amp; goat cheese biscuits: also recommended by the waiter, the fried dark meat chicken was juicy and good but the biscuits were nothing to rave about

I parked on the street where parking is complimentary - if you can locate an open space. I was shocked when the matradee advised me the wait was 1 1/2 hours.

Ordered the fried chicken with a poached egg on a goat cheese biscuit and also sampled the eggs Rancheros with pork belly. Both entree&#39;s were incredible tasting but we saved room dessert. The  banana cream brulee which had a chocolate peanut butter base and was just fabulous. Service by my waiter was spot on and attentive.

We had a group of 6 come in around 1 PM on Friday for brunch. We had a reservation so we were seated pretty quickly. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is very quirky cool kinda deal. Cozy and trendy, but also pretty sleek and modern. The toilets are strange. LOL. There&#39;s like a running faucet attached to the toilet. Anyways, our waitress was pretty prompt in getting our orders. HOWEVER, I must say the service was INCREDIBLY slow after placing our orders. We didn&#39;t get our food for almost another hour. It wasn&#39;t even busy in the restaurant. So that sucked, cuz we were all getting very hangry. 

My friend and I decided to split the banana bread french toast and the chicken and biscuits. BEST DECISION. EVER. Hands down. The banana bread french toast was delicious, ~$11 for four hefty slices and a side of minty fruit salad. It&#39;s basically like fried banana bread lol. Not like fried chicken fried, but like sorta crisp on the outside, very moist, dense, and flavorful on the inside. It was topped with peanuts and a VERY small amount of syrup. I&#39;m not a fan of drenching things in syrup, so I was fine with the minuscule amount of syrup. The fried chicken was also AMAZING. If you love mushrooms and spicy food, and I guess fried chicken too, this is the dish for you. There&#39;s a slight kick to it and I&#39;m obsessed with mushrooms (there&#39;s a mushroom gravy deal going on here) so this dish was great. The chicken was also fried perfectly. Super crispy on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside. Since my friend and I split the two items, our total came out to about $15 each. Pretty inexpensive compared to the usual SF brunches I&#39;m used to LOL. 

Overall, the food here is excellent. Definitely try the banana bread french toast and the fried chicken! You won&#39;t regret it. The only downside was the incredibly long wait. Prepare for the possibility of being hangry."

Naturally curious people like me who does a lot of research it&#39;s an unexpected treasure trove of information. It got me to listen to music I wouldn&#39;t normally gravitate to. So basically I got educated in a short New York time. 

If you google Root Down two things that matter will pop up.  The Beastie Boys. Yes. Their Song Root Down. Released back in 1994. While listening to them I also found Jimmy Smith&#39;s Root Down Jazzy sensation released in 1972. 

Here&#39;s what I also found out. Of course locally it could mean cheering or building a home. In Australia it means fuc****. So some food for thought while you&#39;re waiting for your order or planning your trip to Australia.

We were invited by a visiting couple from the Bay Area Yelpers John B and Rachel B. Sensational find! R.D serves both vegan and carnivore dishes. Can you guess who favors the latter:)?

I had a big appetite and ordered their Banana Bread French Toast. It was Chicory Crème Fraîche, Salted Peanuts, Cacao Nibs &amp; Citrus Syrup. No need for more syrup. This one comes perfect as is! With a side of their thick bacon! This dish looks pretty and it&#39;s really good and it feels somewhat healthy. Yeah I know! I&#39;m confused too but like me just enjoy it!!

Our server was outstanding and I&#39;m blanking out with her name. It&#39;s the Bottomless Mimosas fault. It comes in a big tall glass reserved for beers elsewhere. Here they give you the respect of someone who is bold enough to order their bottomless mimis! They keep it coming and I kept asking her name. I&#39;m not going to ask again for the 6th time?? Yes I still have a bit of shame left in me but not beyond #7 glass. Hey it was a hot day!:)

You can choose to get your tan on by sitting in their back patio or like us inside. Either way this is a gorgeous place. 

Thank you again Rachel and John! See you both soon!"

Root Down has been one of my favorite spots in Denver for years, and for good reason.  The service is always good, and the food is on point.  They have a knack for blending the right flavors together, and I&#39;ve never had a dish here I didn&#39;t like.

I like their lunch and dinner service, but am enamored with their brunch.  I&#39;ve ordered almost every dish and here&#39;s the run down.  My absolute top, #1 choice is always the Almond Flour Pancakes.  Wow.  So so good.  They change seasonally.  Last winter they had a grapefruit compote (unique and such a delight for the tastebuds on a dreary winter morning), and now they&#39;re topped with a strawberry-rhubarb jam with a cardamom-ginger whip.  Doesn&#39;t your mouth water just reading that?  The Banana Bread French Toast is tasty, and I love the twist of using salted peanuts to top it.  Just be warned, it is rich and heavy!  Only order with a growling tummy!  Root Down is also home to some savory favorites.  The Lamb Burger is full of juicy goodness and topped with a fried egg, and the Steak and Eggs are seasoned perfectly.  They even offer Rosenberg&#39;s bagels.

One little, little gripe:  I wish Root Down would make some cold-brewed iced coffee!  I ordered an iced coffee this weekend and was disappointed it was just their regular hot coffee poured over a cup of ice.  It was really watery.  That&#39;s the only disappointing thing I&#39;ve ever ordered here!

One piece of advice:  if you&#39;re coming with a large group, plan ahead to get a reservation.  I&#39;ve tried to get reservations 1-2 weeks ahead and have been out of luck.  If you fail to plan ahead, get there before the doors open.  On weekends, they open at 10am, and I&#39;ve found if we arrive by 9:45am, we are guaranteed to get a table.  Phew! :)"

The Moscow mule I&#39;m drinking is on point! Sweet and sour with a good amount of alcohol. Only $5 during their happy hour! Next I&#39;m snacking on their sweet potato fries. My favorite! Served in a steel cup these wedges are thick and crispy and salted to perfection. They also come with a special mustard sauce that is very interesting but delicious. They also have a ton of beer and wine on happy hour with interesting apps as well!

The bar tenders are very nice and are quick to take your orders. I probably sat for 2 minutes before my drink was in hand and my fries were out! Will definitely be coming back for dinner soon! Didn&#39;t get a chance to look at the regular menu. Sorry Yelpers!!"

We loved the crabs benedict and the blood orange mimosas were truly bottomless. Delicious stuff.  The ramen deviled eggs were overrated, but the service was great. 

We ordered toast with our benedict, but as an afterthought. It took awhile, but we found out it was because the first set burned, so they didn&#39;t charge us for the toast, after two people (including the manager/owner?) came to apologize for the wait. The wait was totally worth it, though, because it came with this vanilla/cardamom/miso butter that would make a shoe taste delicious, and a strawberry rhubarb jam that I wanted to buy a jar of. 

Loved that they had a gender neutral bathroom available, and sink/toilet combos in the bathrooms that save water. Great idea!"

My waiter was very helpful and food came back just delicious. Very juicy burgers They have a variety of BBQ sauces for all the tastes. They are know for top quality meats. And prices are within reason despite the great quality of the meal. I didn&#39;t take a picture because once the plate was sat at the table I just couldn&#39;t keep my hands off the burger until it was history.  I&#39;ve been a regular but this is my first review and official yelp check in.

The food was ok/average (3-stars).  The ribs and chicken were nothing special and the mac-n-cheese was good. However the service was terrible and that deserves -2 stars. We ate in the bar and Katie introduce herself as the our waitress.  She dropped off one glass of water and a beer.  That was the last time she waited on us.  No refills. No more beer. No more service, even though everyone around us were getting plenty of service. After we ordered, we discovered a flier on the table that the bar had a happy hour (3-6pm).  She didn&#39;t mention anything about a Happy Hour for food or drinks when we ordered at 5:30. We may not have ordered from the Happy Hour menu but it would have been nice to have that as an option.  The fact that there are plenty of BBQ restaurants in the area, this is the last time we&#39;ll be at Un-Famous Dave&#39;s."

The second time, the meat was a little drier.. the beef brisket basically reminded me of beef jerky lol. Both time I was here, I had the feast for 2.. and oh  man.. it&#39;s SO MUCH FOOD. It definitely feeds 3..

The feast for 2 comes with:
-Ribs 
-Pulled pork
-Beef Briskets
-Half a chicken
-Coleslaw
-Baked beans
-Fries
-Mac N Cheese (we switched out the corn)
-Corn bread muffins

I really like their sides. Their fries are definitely cooked to perfection, coleslaw is very refreshing.. there are little pork pieces in the baked beans that make it super delicious. The mac n cheese is just mediocre.. but what is a bbq without mac n cheese? You HAVE to order it. As for the meat... it&#39;s not thaaaat great. I&#39;ve definitely had better bbq meat before.. but it&#39;s still pretty good and i would come back. The portion size is just so big for the price, that it makes it pretty worth it. 

The nachos were also pretty amazing. I would totally order these again!

Staff is nice and attentive!"

I was greeted by the Manager Matt that offered me a nice tall glass of refreshing water he noticed that I was out of breath due to all of the crazy driving because of the snow storm that we are going through. Nevertheless I was so hungry I decided to stay and ordered the burnt tips they were absolutely scrumdiddlyumptious! I have never had them but all I have to say is I will never eat them anywhere else but here they were bursting with flavor in every bite I had them with this sweet and zesty sauce that is served on the table I also ordered the roasted pineapple as the side that comes with the meal my bun was toasted and nice and warm that comes with the sandwich.

Server Tammy was very nice, but was not trained.  She knew very little.   Her fault? No.  This tells me there  is poor management.  How can you let a server on the floor that does not know the happy hour specials, types of beer they carry, demo the sauces, give wet napkins at the end of the meal, what the dressing comes with salad? She was very nice, but the managers need to train her, especially if your taking peoples hard earned money. Might cost some money, but you will get the investment back in good service.

We were served by Katie who was awesome. She had several tables and was clearly busy. She kept up with everything we needed, didn&#39;t ask for anything to be repeated, and brought everything out quickly. She also cleared the table quickly while we were still sitting there, which isn&#39;t a huge deal but shows attention to detail and I dislike sitting at a table after I&#39;m done with a stack of dirty dishes. 

My wife and I ordered the feast for two. We never come close to clearing that, but it&#39;s nice to have the leftovers.  If I had to be picky about my food, I could complain that the corn could be described as meh. I feel of everything I ate this was just okay. 

My daughter, 5, ordered the corn dogs which weren&#39;t half bad, but each one had a line down the side of it that was best described as soggy. She ate it without complaint, but I saw her scrape the soggy part off each one first. 

We did make note that the manager did come by the table to ask how everything was. Which was nice. We enjoy this location and will be back again. Thanks to Katie for the great service. We appreciated it."

My beef with a lot of BBQ places is that they don&#39;t include ribs in a lunch special. Dave&#39;s had a lunch special with two meats, a side, and cornbread and white bread. I chose the ribs and the spicy sausage link. The sausage link was ginormous and the ribs (you get 2) were tender and fall-off-the-bone. For a side I tried the grilled pineapple which has a hint of cayenne pepper and sugar which produced a very unique flavor. I ordered this to-go and they had it ready quickly and my food was nice and hot when I got back to work."

The kids menu was good, they loved their ribs (though by the end of it I was beginning to think they needed a sink AT the table). The bread was really tasty before the meal.

The guys loved the burgers and I&#39;m a HUGE fan of the mac and cheese. However I think I am the only one that appreciated it. Even if there was corn in it, which I normally don&#39;t like extra corn in my food.

They got one of the burgers wrong but it worked out because he wanted what someone else go anyhow. It was a great burger and the other one that was wrong was eaten for lunch the next day by a very hungry 13 year old girl.

The draft beer selection is pretty slim and living in craft beer mecca of Colorado, I expected a lot more.

Service was a bit on the slow side, especially for 5pm on a Saturday. It took them 10+ minutes just to get a table put together for 7 of us. And then our waitress, while good, was obviously spread thin and didn&#39;t stop by to check on us very often. 

We started with the onion strings and they were limp and greasy- ick!  I had a two meat platter with 2 sides and cornbread muffin; the chopped pork was ok and the sausage was decent. Good variety of sauces and good presentation with the chips to sample them. The best thing anyone ordered was the burnt tips- those were delicious! hubby had those with ribs, and the ribs were pretty good as well.

I had collard greens and mashed potatoes as sides. The huge pieces of blubbery bacon in the collard greens was a big turn off to what could have been a good side. The mashed potatoes were very good, and I did enjoy them. 

The atmosphere of this place is a bit chaotic with all the crap on the walls and cavernous feeling spaces. Staff is pretty young and I watched as a waiter tried to bully the young hostesses about who was serving/seating in what areas- unprofessional.

We never made it to the All You Can Eat Part... the initial order was so plentiful that none us could finish one.   The service was a little slow sitting in the bar.  I think server was just doing too much as both bartender and server.   We did have a larger party of 7 people who arrived in waves.  

He was attentive to refilling drinks once he got on a roll with us.  

The leftovers made for a great lunch the next day and prompted so much interest in my office a group of 12 of us met there the very next Thursday night to do it all over again.  

This time we sat in the dining room.  It&#39;s a little loud in there but still overall nice.  We had a great server who took care of us all promptly.

It&#39;s a chain, so you don&#39;t get that &#34;authentic&#34; vibe, but the food isn&#39;t half bad and their happy hour specials are a real great deal.

Decor: like TGI Fridays. There&#39;s all sorts of crap on the walls. From snow shoes, to random signs, to pictures of people you don&#39;t know and that likely have no connection to this restaurant or even the chain. Whatevs. The seating is comfortable (they even have booths), and they can accommodate large groups.

The food: really good if you like barbecue. They have ribs, pulled pork. chicken, you get the idea. The side dishes are also really good, I like the mac and cheese, personally. For those of you on a lighter diet, they do have a light menu. I&#39;ve never tried it, but it seems like it&#39;d be OK given the quality of everything else.

Staff: Not too shabby. They stay light on their toes, I&#39;ve never had a problem with service here."

Pros:
 -- Really good ribs; I had a 1/2 rack and it was plenty for my lower appetite
 --  Different sauces allow you to explore the BBQ flavor spectrum
 --  good baked beans

Cons:
 -- Our pushy waiter gave us the hard sell on big appetizer plates; and then another sell for a &#34;feast&#34; meal; Way more food than we wanted. We succesfully resisted.
 -- Lackluster beer list with all the usual suspects. Zero micro-brews or local beers (unless you count Coors)
 -- Absolutely terrible corn on the cob; they shouldn&#39;t even bother
 -- Exudes &#34;chain-iness&#34;

I could go back just for the ribs alone; And maybe just for takeout"

Went with two buddies yesterday, and had the pork, the ribs and the chicken.  Their chicken was superb, not dried out, and with ample flavor.

I never had fried sweet pickles either? I&#39;m not a fan. Give me good ole dill in crispy batter anyday over these sweet, soggy concoctions.

I have had very good meals, but then I have also had some pretty mediocre or even bad meals.

Haven&#39;t figured out exactly what causes this phenomenon. Maybe it is the time of day. Or, possibly, it is the day of the week. More research is needed....Sounds like another trip to Famous Dave&#39;s is in my future.

I will say, I don&#39;t care for their BBQ sauces. They are all a little too heavy on the worcestershire sauce for my taste. The Georgia Mustard sauce is my favorite of their options, but that isn&#39;t really saying much since I generally go &#34;naked&#34; on the sauces.

The hot link is sometimes ok, but sometimes entirely too heavy on the black pepper. The safest picks, in my opinion, are the Georgia chopped pork and the BBQ chicken. However, if you get a lot of &#34;bark&#34; in your chopped pork portion, it will be very salty.

My husband likes their BBQ Chicken and the St Louis style ribs. He has tried the rib tips, and they are tasty but have a considerable amount of fat. You don&#39;t get as much meat with the tips."

Unfortunately, we have been there twice in the last month and the theme was exactly the same. Completely dried out meat that takes a TON of sauce to make edible. Luckily the sauce choices are very good, just ask your server for a second bottle and you may be OK.

Its a shame because this place used to have the juiciest and most succulent BBQ around.  They must have changed chefs or something. Was 5 stars easy, last 2 visits I feel 2 stars is accurate.

To be fair and balanced, the muffins are still top notch and the fries are nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside. Very well done indeed!

This is my first stop at a Famous Daves, who was apparently self-proclaimed famous before his Food TV debut.  My wife and I decided on this place since we were over in the vicinity.  Ambiance?  Log cabin style bar area with upbeat country rock playing, sort of southern.  There was a friendly server at the bar area.  

They have an awesome happy hour if you prefer to eat rather than drink.  They have drink specials, of course, but I don&#39;t drink.  However, bar snacks starting at a buck, and the most expensive thing was the pound of rib tips for $4.    The rib tips are where it&#39;s at too.  This is not as good a Big Jims further south in Parker, but it&#39;s good all the same.  The bbq is nice and smoky, and not sauced - you can add your sauce of choice (five to pick from).  The rib tips sat atop a basket of wedge-cut fries, which should have been in the fryer ten seconds longer.  They were pretty limp.

The sides were also nothing to write home about.  The green beans were tasteless.  How you can put bacon on top of the greens and still get tasteless is beyond me.  The sweet potato mash was ok - not good.

We ended our meal with dessert minis.  I had the bread pudding - three bits of the sauce plus a small scoop of icecream.  Good sauce, and a nice creamy bread.  My wife had the strawberry shortcake.  Although she liked the cake (more spongy than pound cake), the sauce was almost none existent and we expected more than a slither of strawberry to make it a dessert.

If the sides were better, this would be four stars.  Skip the sides and concentrate on the meat."
