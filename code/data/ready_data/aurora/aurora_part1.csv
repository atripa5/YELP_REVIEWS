The spot is tiny but cute. There wasn&#39;t a lot of folks eating in, but there was a steady stream of people coming in to pick up take out orders. We had friendly and attentive service, but she got both entrees wrong and they were served with the wrong proteins. She was quick to fix once I pointed it out. Our food was ready pretty quickly. The good - the shrimp in my daughters shrimp teriyaki were cooked perfectly. Her rice was sticky and yummy. The bad - the teriyaki sauce was way too sweet. It tasted very sugary and there was too much of it on everything. I had the drunken noodles. Everything was cooked well, but the sauce was very salty. I like my salt, but this was too much.In the end, I would go to other places first."

Those aren&#39;t really in my wheelhouse of things I eat on a regular basis so I took to Yelp to find a spot.  We found Wokano and it happened to be within ten minutes of where we were at.  

We arrived at 3 p.m.ish which is a weird between lunch and dinner time hour to eat.  We got fast and friendly service.  We ordered the aforementioned wantons, along with dumplings for him.  I ordered the Korean seafood soup and the hubs went with crispy combo noodles.  The portions were HUGE!  We both got two meals out of our dishes.  The flavors were good, basic flavors.  My soup was spicy but didn&#39;t really have a complexity of flavor other than kimchee and seafood.  There was quite a bit of seafood though for the price.  The dishes  neither blew us away nor disappointed us."

It was a Sunday evening at 7pm, so while I didn&#39;t expect them to be super busy, I also didn&#39;t expect how fast they were!  After placing my order over the phone, I was told 10-15 minutes.  I arrived in 8 and the food was there waiting for me.  

On to the food: Usually I&#39;m a little suspect of a restaurant that serves everything under the sun, but I decided to go with it.  While this place primarily serves Chinese, I ordered the pad thai.  It came steaming hot and in a massive portion that could easily feed two.  The flavor was sweet, nutty, and delicious, but not spicy whatsoever.  Not sure if you can request the food to be made with more heat, but I&#39;ll try next time.  

Glad this place is so close to my house!  I wouldn&#39;t drive across town for it, but with the convenience of Cap Hill, you can&#39;t lose!"

I&#39;m sad to say what I&#39;m about to say. The food is divine. I ordered. They gave me a time. I watched the clock...unfortunately my phone was on silent as I had just gotten home from work. I missed a couple calls from the delivery driver. When I picked up the call I was being screamed at. Yes. The delivery driver was bitching me out because I missed the call to let him in my building. When I met him at the door he went on and on and on...I simply said &#34; calm down&#34; and when he wouldn&#39;t shut up I said &#34;calm the fuck down&#34;. I tipped the little bitch anyway. I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t really speak English and can&#39;t get a job anywhere else but I don&#39;t feel I need to be verbally assaulted over 2 missed phone calls.

Wokano Asian Bistro caught our eye and we decided Chinese would make a nice lunch on a coldish afternoon.

The interior is what one would expect with a Chinese restaurant with basic tables and chairs and dark walls.  We were pleased to see that the lunch specials were available on the weekend and we both decided to order lunch specials.  For an appetizer we opted for the Crab Cheese Wontons ($5.95).  I chose the Panang Curry with chicken ($6.95) with Wonton Soup and he chose Sesame Scallops ($7.95) with Hot &amp; Sour Soup.  The lunch special also comes with rice and a vegetable spring roll in addition to your choice of soup (soup not included for delivery). 

The Crab Cheese Wontons were a stand out and easily a four star dish.  Not a classic preparation that one would expect from most Chinese restaurants, these tasted tempura fried and were served with a green pineapple mint dipping sauce that kept my taste buds dancing and wanting more. 

My Panang Curry was very good; there was a nice heat level that warmed me from the inside with an abundance of chicken and vegetables.  The Sesame Scallops were more disappointing.  When the scallops were sliced the breading came right off in one big piece and the breading had an odd overall taste and was not pleasing to the palate.  Like any establishment it takes time to find a favorite dish and Wokano Asian Bistro is 50/50 on execution, some things are better than average and some items are below average.  It&#39;s not a destination kind of place but certainly meets a need and seems to be doing quite well in the neighborhood and seems to be the place to call for takeout."

The first Thai place we tried closed at 9, and since it was 8:55, we decided to spare them the irritation of the last minute patrons. We looked online for the second place, only to learn that they too close at 9. So we try Wokano, and notice on the sign by the door that they&#39;re open until 10. Success! So we walk in, and one of the employees tells us that the dining room closes at 9, and that we&#39;d have to order takeout. 

If you&#39;re closing the dining room at 9, advertise that. If you say you&#39;re open until 10, be consistent and honor that. End of rant. 

I have eaten here before, and the food is fairly tasty. But it might tell you something that this was the third choice, and after learning about the limited hours, it might have dropped another spot or two in the rankings."

I was quite surprised that it was a hole in the wall type of restaurant and not a big chain. It&#39;s quite small and has maybe about 10 tables. 

When you enter, you don&#39;t need to wait to be seated, just pick a seat. We had a child with us and asked for a high chair, which they easily grabbed for us.

After we put our food order in, we had to wait maybe 15-20 minutes. While we were waiting, we noticed the constant come and go of customers who ordered take out. It also looked like they did delivery as well. 

We ordered cream cheese wontons as an appetizer with their mint cucumber sauce because of previous yelp reviews. It did not disappoint, but the sauce did take a bit to get acquired to although it was delicious. I say cream cheese wontons instead of crab cheese wontons because there was no crab in those wontons. But I&#39;m not complaining because I love cream cheese lol. 

For my main course, I had the combination pad Thai on a suggestion of my coworker. When it was presented, it looked appetizing. It was just ok. I was quite disappointed because the pad Thai was over sauced. It&#39;s so hard to find good, authentic pad Thai. 

It was my mistake of trying to order Thai at a restaurant known more for their chinese food. Other than chinese and Thai food though, they serve korean food. Service was good, but the woman taking the orders for the tables also had to take orders from the customers ordering take out. But since they were busy, we didn&#39;t get the personal touch of a server and was only checked up on once. 

I do want to come back so I could try their chinese food instead."

We opt to have our FOOD TO GO.  That recent visit was on Thursday December 18th 2014.  Time was about 18:43hrs ish.  Man at that time, this establishment is jam packed with other patrons alike and ALOT of TO GO orders.

From the Menu we opt to have the following items :

*  Kobe Beef Noodle **VERY SPICY** ($12.95)
*  Joam Bong *EXTRA SPICY* ($11.95)

Once at home, and I open the disposable container which contained the Joam Bong Broth and tasted it was just OK..  Barely OK, so its more like a &#34;MEH&#34; for me.  YES, they packed the Noodles with all the Seafood items such as Shrimp, Scallop and Calamari.  Maybe I ordered this dish TO GO, by the time I reached home, due to the &#34;water condensation&#34; and its packed while its HOT, the Seafood items tend to be OVER-COOKED.  YES, the Broth is SPICY but its NOT as SPICY as I requested it to be.  *SIGH*

As for the Kobe Beef Noodle, Hubs said it was OK.  The Kobe Beef Noodle, consisted of Ground Kobe Beef saut√©ed in some kind of gravy, and comes with several steamed vegetables such as Carrots and Broccoli.  Nothing stellar, nothing spectacular about this dish.  YES, this dish, the portion is doable.

Maybe we ordered the wrong items from the Menu.  Overall, it was just &#34;MEH&#34; in terms of taste and flavor for both meals.

I would love to order from this place more often, but it seems like such a hassle when compared to other places nearby.  Their Drunken Noodles with Chicken is awesome, but eat it fresh.

I&#39;m really not sure how this place has a 4 star review, my only assumption is that there is a lack of good options for Chinese food in Denver, CO.

I ordered for delivery, here are the results:
#1 egg roll: was a thin, over fried and flavorless.

#2 wonton soup: was overcooked, mushy not al dente, and barely had any flavor until I dumped soy sauce on it.

#3 singapore noodle w/roast pork:  was over cooked, pork was dry like a cracker, rice noodles were also dryed out.

#4 chicken w/ mixed vegetables + white rice:  Thankfully, this was not over cooked, it was close to decent.  What ruined it for me was the sauce, it had a light scent of that reminded me of dishwasher detergent.

I will never eat here again, I disliked every single thing that I ordered.  There is no coming back from that kind of screw up."

The food is fantastic as a vegan, I find plenty of great options here, ranging from the Pad Thai (ask for it without eggs and with the wonderful tofu. They don&#39;t use fish sauce) to the pho. You&#39;ve also got to have the spicy edamame (best I&#39;ve found) and the genmaicha. I live in Boulder and still make the trek down to Denver every two weeks or so to eat here with good friends, most of whom are not vegan and find a wide range of delicious options!

Note: it&#39;s a small spot, so you might have to wait for a table. Additionally, there&#39;s limited parking in the lot outside, so you will likely have to park on the street. Avoid parking in front of the bar next door or the 7-11, because you can get a hefty ticket / towed for that.

My most recent experience was a near disaster. The kim chi soup was watery, sour, bland. The raw tuna in the tataki salad was inedible - it smelled, was stringy/chewy, and my cat wouldn&#39;t even eat it (and he eats garbage, for heavens sake). The pork dumplings were overly sweet and bland. Nothing tasted fresh and my friend and I ate less than half of what we ordered. What we did eat we ate out of pure hunger and desperation.

If this is the shape of food to come, I&#39;m worried. I loved Wokano for its unrelenting freshness and wide range of choices. Now the food quality has me looking for another staple. 

That said, I adore the interior of this space. The restaurant is small and intimate, warm and inviting, dark and lush with some bamboo plant accents and tasteful lucky cats swinging their paws at you. Not a lot of seating so if you come during peak dining hours, you will likely have to wait, and there&#39;s no place really to wait in the winter.

Really like the General Tso&#39;s chicken as well as their lo mein.  I&#39;ve found their dumplings to be forgettable and their pad thai to be a little too sweet (and doesn&#39;t seem like traditional pad thai).  Portions are massive and delivery is crazy fast.

Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese dishes are all available and all amazing! I love their Thai curries and their house dishes are all phenomenal. Very appropriately priced as well, and depending on how hungry you are a dish with rice is enough to share for two people.

Atmosphere is very dark and relaxed to dine with the family, or even bring a date. Only reason I&#39;m giving Wakano four stars instead of five is because they don&#39;t serve alcohol."

To be fair they are really busy and 1 server is working.

It lightly. If this is the best Asian food in Denver like I&#39;ve seen in a couple reviews, I feel bad for this city. I&#39;ve eaten here 5-6 times, as I live down the street, and every time I&#39;m left underwhelmed. I&#39;ve had the Mongolian beef, crispy prawns (do not get unless you want that Chinese batter where it seems more like a packaging peanut), pan fried noodles, seafood combo and beef and broccoli. Every single dish seams to have the same greasy Chinese gravy that you can get at any mall food court for half the price. The portions are big, and it&#39;s not that the food tastes horrible, but I&#39;d rather have something taste good because of its fresh ingredients, not because it&#39;s a sodium bomb gravy boat that tastes like a cheap Chinese buffet."

Tonight&#39;s delivery was just plain bad.  The Thai Spring Rolls had nothing (zero/nada) inside but shredded lettuce and rice noodles - no pork, no shrimp, nothing for $4.99.  The Sesame Chicken was mostly fried batter and little chicken plus it was supposed to be spicy and was anything but.  So, $16+ $4 tip for delivery down the drain - literally.  Even the garbage disposal wasn&#39;t happy.  Moving on."

Ambiance is nice, and the place smells fantastic.

We&#39;re summer roll fanatics, and this is the best yet. Big, full of goodies, and the peanut and sweet &amp; sour dipping sauce rock! Tofu Summer Rolls -- do it! 

We also ordered the eggplant in garlic sauce dish. To die for. To die for. To die for. Massive portions, eggplant cooked to perfection! Sauce had some oil, but it wasn&#39;t overdone. Nothing was too salty (which is my issue with some Asian joints). Only downside is they charge for extra rice. 

Excellent all around! Can&#39;t wait to try the rest of the items on the veg menu!"

First, they say delivery will take 45 mins but it takes an hour and a half! If they&#39;d just tell me that up front, I&#39;d pick it up myself or go somewhere else. I think they have one delivery guy and he won&#39;t bring your food to your door, you have to meet him in the lobby.

Second, last time I ordered beef and broccoli and they have me eggplant instead. I&#39;m sure their eggplant is great but it&#39;s not what I ordered or paid for.

Their food is good but not worth the hassle. There are plenty of other Chinese places that are good too and not such a pain."

Okay, parking might be a small issue as there are only 2 parking spots in front of each store, but I think parking on the street is not that bad.

This place can maybe seat 20-25 people, so you will get fast service. The waitresses are very polite and attentive and give out great recommendations if you ask them.

The food here is amazing. We ordered quite a lot of food due to starvation mode right before coming here, but here goes!

- Hot and Sour Soup: I&#39;m usually not a big fan, but the bowl was so big I had to try some just for the sake of trying it. It was actually really good! Not as sour as you normally would have elsewhere.

- Stir-fry Seafood Udon?: The noodles were really yummy and not super greasy, and they are VERY generous on their seafood.

- Crab Cheese Wontons: THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE MUST COME HERE FOR! I love love love crab wontons, and the portion comes with 8 perfectly crispy wontons...drool... double drool for their mint sauce.

- Pineapple Cheese Wontons: I&#39;ve never heard of this combination, so I just had to try it out myself. It was different.. and a must try because you probably won&#39;t be able to find it anywhere else.

Now if you don&#39;t have time to make the drive out here.. don&#39;t you worry! They have delivery service right to your door, and might I add... Mr. Delivery himself is super hot. yum.."

I then noticed, when I was walking to the bathroom, that the reason we were waiting was because the waitress was sitting and eating her lunch for the 30 minutes we had been sitting with no service. I was so appalled and embarrassed by the incident with the egg roll, that I didn&#39;t tip her (I work in the service industry and would not expect someone to give me their extra money if I acted that way towards them) she then proceeded to walk outside after us, light up a cigarette, and glare at me through my side view mirror."

I came here with a group of 6 and after our meal I wish we had walked a few blocks further to a far more worthy restaurant. My seafood soup tasted like the soup base was made out of cleaning chemicals and the seafood was nuked to a charred crunchiness. My lady friend had a chicken and rice based dish that also tasted like said chemicals. I took one bite of each and did not touch the rest. Being with a large group for a celebration, I just went with it since everyone else seemed content. Or were they just pretending?

When it came time to pay, despite mentioning to the waiter before ordering that we would be paying separately, our waiter make a huge fuss. I get that it is annoying to break out the bill for 6 people, but when asked ahead of time he said it would be fine. What the what.

The food is always good, in fact, I&#39;ve never had a bad dish from Wokano. The staff are all very friendly. The last time I was in (day before yesterday) when I went to box my food I hadn&#39;t eaten (because there&#39;s always leftovers) the lady gave me a fresh new box of rice to take home! I now live in Hawaii and I can&#39;t even find Chinese food there that compares to Wokano! Plus I don&#39;t think anywhere makes hot and sour soup or wonton soup half as good... Eat here, be happy!!"

Their dishes are perfectly portioned so that you can eat until you&#39;re full and then have enough for leftovers the next meal and maybe the meal after that.  Sweet and sour chicken for daaaays.

Despite the big portions, you cannot skip ordering an appetizer.  I&#39;m telling you that their pineapple cream cheese wontons are worth investing in a pair of pants with an elastic waistband.  Their fresh mint dipping sauce that accompanies the wontons is quite literally worthy of being poured in a glass and drank straight.

I prefer doing take out over dining in because their booth seating is pretty uncomfortable (wood bench, meet my bad back) and their tables are kinda close, so I feel like I may bump elbows with fellow diners.  However, in the winter, it&#39;s kinda nice to dine-in and sip tea in their dimly lit, cozy restaurant."

I called for a take out order and asked for a shredded chicken pho, they told me they cook their chicken and it wasn&#39;t shredded, I thought it was a little out of the ordinary, but ordered it.

Him and I both did a search thru our phone (him thru yelp and me thru Google maps) We both ran across this restaurant. Found in a strip mall next to a 7-11 and a bar.. this place is a TRUE hidden gem. 

Walked in and loved the d√©cor. The space is a little small I must say, but I&#39;ll wait if it&#39;s uber busy. Our waitress was extremely nice.  It was lunch time and the options they had on their menu where much more than your typical Chinese restaurants I have ever visited &amp; the prices were good considering how much food you get.  Lunch meals come with your choice of soup, egg roll, rice and your protein. Most restaurants don&#39;t include a soup. I ordered the &#34;Shittake Mushroom Tofu with wonton soup&#34; along with a Peach Ice Tea. My friend ordered &#34;Thai Chicken Curry with hot &amp; sour Soup.&#34; Lets just say the food is &#34;AMAZING&#34; just thinking about it is making me drool. Everything was so fresh, the spice and seasoning were perfect. Oh.. I forgot to mention.. the &#34;spicy edamame&#34; is to die for, literally.  I wish I lived &amp; worked closer to Wokano cause I would be here everyday. 

The 2nd time I came here.. service was a bit slower and our waiter was not very attentive but aside from that the food was just as delicious. 

If your around 11th &amp; Ogden, and craving Asian.. don&#39;t pass this place up. I guarantee you will be happy."

I got take-out and got the hot&amp;sour soup and the General Tso&#39;s chicken. It was ready within 15 minutes.  The soup was good, no complaints.

The General Tso&#39;s chicken is a pretty big portion, enough for 2 for sure. It seemed to be mostly white meat with a few dark meat pieces that were a little tough, unless they were small over-cooked white meat (hard to tell).  The breading was just right, and probably got a bit soggy on the way home. It was very sweet but not very spicy. There were a bunch of peppers in the sauce so maybe they just weren&#39;t hot but it should have been more spicy and hot. 

I definitely want to go back and try some of the other things. They have a big menu with lots of variety"

I really like their mushroom cheesesteak.  My kid likes their pizza cheesesteak.  We have eaten here several times and it has been a good experience.  They&#39;re not quick, though.  Just FYI, they don&#39;t make it til you order it and they are almost always busy."

I came here for the first time almost two years ago and was totally blown away by the food, it&#39;s very authentic and absolutely delicious. The only other time that I had ever eaten a cheesesteak before I am here was several years ago when I was at a train station in New York, so I&#39;m definitely no expert, though I do like to think that I know a good sandwich when I eat one, which in this case was their mushroom cheesesteak (if that isn&#39;t the longest run-on sentence of all time...) The waffle fries that they offer are also really excellent, just greasy and salty enough for me. I&#39;ve been with friends before and also tried a few bites of the green chili cheesesteak, which sounded like a totally weird combination to me- but it turned out quite good."

I&#39;m not a cheese steak type of person but they offered a unique sandwich that warranted all 5 stars. The most Colorado thing to do to a cheese steak? Put some green chili in it and you&#39;re in business.

So obviously I&#39;m highlighting their unique mix that worked wonderfully well. It almost offered it a nice spiciness to a type of sandwich I&#39;m mostly indifferent to. The bread and steak worked well, I just really enjoyed the sandwich.

So I also had an order of fries and some fried zucchini. I actually really liked the fries, nice and hot. I like my fried zucchini to be a little hotter and taste more fried than zucchini haha. The price wasn&#39;t too bad and my colleague loved her sandwich too. She also enjoyed the zucchini. This place comes highly recommended."

I can now say that I agree.  This place is awesome.  The staff are very friendly and the food is great.  We had the original cheesesteak and the mushroom cheesesteak as well as the onion rings and the crab fries.  All of them were delicious, although I&#39;m not sure how the fries were &#34;crab fries&#34; as I didn&#39;t taste any crab.  The place was very clean (we checked restaurant health scores before heading over and they have always gotten good ratings).  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes cheesesteaks."

I&#39;m a little shocked I haven&#39;t written a review yet, since I easily frequent this place once every couple weeks.  And not just because I love all their posters of Frank Sinatra. 

They have a few dozen cheesesteaks on their menu, in addition to hoagies, wraps, crab fries and all kinds of delicious things.  Whether you&#39;re a strict believer in Cheez Whiz or not, you can find the exact combination that&#39;s right for you.  And they have a variety of sauces and dips you can add to your sandwich. I personally prefer American cheese on my cheesesteak with a side of either white cheddar sauce or their nacho cheese sauce. Freakin&#39; delicious!

I think the only negative thing I can say about this place is the service isn&#39;t always great. There are usually teenagers working at the register, so sometimes it can take a little bit to get your food. But even though they&#39;re sometimes slow, they&#39;re always friendly.

I&#39;m not from Philly, but I am from New Jersey. Furthermore, I&#39;m from a town in New Jersey that is 45 minutes from Philly. Meaning I used to frequent Philly. A lot. And I adore cheesesteaks. A lot. 

So when my wife and I moved to Colorado, I was a little ambivalent. On one hand, legal marijuana. Major plus. On the other hand, where am I gonna find tasty cheesesteaks? For me, this was a dilemma.

Then I found Large Marge. Amoroso rolls? Check. Perfectly cooked ribeye beef. Check. And of course, at least for me, cheese whiz. Friggin&#39; check. On top of that, the onions are cooked to perfection. By the way, I usually get the Original because I&#39;m old school like that.

The fries are awesome. Thick, not thin like an anorexic teenage cheerleader like Taste of Philly. Ooooh! And the Poo sauces that accompany it are fantastic.

Final verdict, this place is top notch. Side note: try their fried zucchini. I hate vegetables, but they fry them up oh so well, so I love them."

(Face the front door to find take out menus) The advertisements for &#34;poo&#34; sauce also grossed me out. Didn&#39;t expect that... Their idea of &#34;Crab fries&#34; is a few specks of Old Bay, and you could barely taste it.

The cheesesteak itself was good, but I avoided the velveeta cheese sauce, so YRMV.

Took about 20 minutes to get my food cooked with 2 couples in line in front of me."

Not really worth the drive, for me. Got the Philly Phanatic (with onions), and made it a combo with drinks and waffle fries. I&#39;ve never had a really Philly cheesesteak, in Philly, so I&#39;m not sure how it measures up to that. I have had other Philly cheesesteaks - Pop&#39;s in PB in San Diego, for instance, and the food was remarkably similar. It&#39;s been over two years since I&#39;ve had Pop&#39;s, so it&#39;s not side-by-side, by any means, but they&#39;re very similar overall, each with their own distinctive thing, but this one was actually decently spicy, or I&#39;ve gone soft in my Colorado-living. The sandwich was a decent size at large, I probably could&#39;ve gone with less, esp since I got the combo, tho, I didn&#39;t finish my fries because...I&#39;m picky about fries.
The waffle fries are kind of jo-jo like on flavor and seasoning, a bit too much grease for me. The sandwich at Large Marge&#39;s (sandwich) was thankfully not too greasy (the one drawback at Pop&#39;s was they were pretty greasy.)
The different sauces were...okay. The BBPOO sauce was probably the tastiest, didn&#39;t really like Batch 1, POO sauce was okay, Chipotle was okay. Spicy ketchup was not spicy, but it treated like ketchup, so whatever, did the job.
The service...well...that could improve, unless maybe they&#39;re trying to give us the East Coast Jersey/NY special attitude. The girl taking the order was not terribly friendly and kind of abrupt. The guys in back weren&#39;t too bad tho. She just didn&#39;t really seem to want to be there, which, whatever, it&#39;s a food-service job that probably doesn&#39;t pay very well and doesn&#39;t make much in tips, so I get that, but still, she had attitude. I&#39;ve worked in customer service for yards, and it was just lacking. Other people got asked how their food was, I pretty much got ignored. I don&#39;t really care, because I don&#39;t really like people talking to be while I&#39;m eating and whatever, but if that were important to you...I dunno, I have resting nice face, so normally I can&#39;t get people to stop talking to me, so it was strange that they really didn&#39;t say anything.
The tables could&#39;ve probably used a good wipe down, which came after I&#39;d already sat down, and they skipped mine, whatever. It was after the lunch rush by a bit, so...I just see that as a bit lacking. I may be grouchy tho, as I had to get up super early today and didn&#39;t get much sleep last night. I still like to think I&#39;m giving a fair assessment.
It&#39;s okay, but not worth going out of your way for."

The meat inside the bread (or hoagie) is well stacked, not lacking much at all (least of all in flavor). I just tried their latest special (called something like the Bully) and it did not need any additional condiments (such as ketchup, spicy ketchup, or any of the other special sauces).

My wife would usually dip her food in the spicy ketchup but the Bully cheesesteak was of a different ilk and needed nothing else.

Glad to have a Yelp check-in offer to get some free fries each order. They make up for it each time with how much we get.

Always looking forward to returning."

We have eaten Philly&#39;s in many cities in numerous states so I have come to be schooled in authenticity when it comes to Philly Cheesesteaks. Not that I&#39;m an expert, but Large Marge&#39;s is the best I&#39;ve eaten. The Sweet Hot is delicious. Just enough fire and just enough sweet. Also, the original is just like it should be, cheesy meaty goodness on the right bread. This is a monthly spot for our taste-buds."

The service was really friendly and I thought the prices were quite reasonable. I also like how you have the option to order a steak, chicken, or vegetarian Philly- there&#39;s something for everyone! They have a pretty extensive menu and although I just went with the tried and true &#34;works&#34; (cheese, peppers, onions, mushrooms) for my first visit, I definitely plan on trying some of their other options in the future...

A cheesesteak is a cheesesteak.  There&#39;s always the standard variations, and each place has their own non-standard ones, and they are pretty hard to mess up.  What makes Large Marge&#39;s more distinctive is the house made hot sauces.  I sampled most of them, for the most part they have good flavor but as you make your way up the ladder there&#39;s less taste and just a challenge to make it burn more.

I ordered off grubhub and usually it takes an hour or longer was expecting it at 850 got here at 820. The delivery driver was so nice. Definitely will order again soon. :) don&#39;t forget to tip them well. Good work guys.

I&#39;m not and expert in the Cheesesteak department but I&#39;ve had enough to know the difference between a good and a bad one.  The LMPC is in the better than most area for me.

The bun was fresh, the meat was flavorful and the toppings were tasty.  They offer a handful of options on the menu and a few custom hot sauce options.  I like a little spice so these are right up my alley.

The place is a little divey but the staff is friendly and they make a quality cheesesteak ... that&#39;s all I need to keep coming back."

This is a delicious little gem tucked away in the heart of Wheat Ridge that is awesome!  Their cheesesteaks are incredible, as are their Italian sandwiches.  I can&#39;t compare the new ownership with that of the original ownership, but these guys (the current owners) who run the place clearly know what their customers like and appreciate.  Reasonably priced, friendly service, and great food make for a most excellent combination in my book.

Oh, and their signature &#34;poo sauce&#34;, i.e. hot sauce, has enough kick in it to make the sandwiches all the more tasty.  Depending on one&#39;s digestive system, the name for the sauce may be a little self-explanatory.  I love it though!"

Ordered a Philly Phanatic which came with a boatload of crispy onions, hot/sweet/jalapeno peppers. It&#39;s honestly not that different than the other &#34;traditional Philly&#34; places I&#39;ve eaten at here in Denver - South Philly Cheesesteaks and D&#39;Angelos in Boulder. Better than SP, but not quite as good as D&#39;Angelos. Had a side of very crispy and heavily breaded onion rings which were pretty tasty.

All that being said, I&#39;ve never been to Philly, so if this is the traditional style cheesesteak, it&#39;s not my choice for cheesesteaks - Penn Station crushes every cheesesteak I&#39;ve ever had, but it must not be &#34;traditional,&#34; as their subs have a much different kind of bread. They only seem to be on the east coast/Midwest, and it&#39;ll be the first place I stop when I go home."

I want to like you, err... I mean the food your offer us.. Err to be precise the Philly Cheese Steak you offer us here in Colorful Colorado...  Was here with Hubs on Saturday Afternoon November 12th 2011 after running several errands.  We were starving so I suggested to Hubs to head to Large Marge&#39;s Philly Cheesesteaks in White Ridge neighborhood.

Indeed the lady who took our order is welcoming and inviting.  If I am not mistaken Hubs order The Works Philly (LARGE) ($11.00) with the Whiz.  As for my order I opt for the Small Mushroom Philly ($5.25).  The food came out piping hot, and thankfully the portion was huge for my appetite that afternoon.  Its indeed messy and indeed we need several layers of napkins to just eat our food.  We also shared the Cha&#39;s Cha&#39;s Green Chilli Cheese Fries ($5.00) and Onions Rings ($4.00).  Hubs had the 32 oz Drink ($2.50) while I opt for the 20 oz small drink at ($1.50)

All in all, Hubs feel that his order is A-OK.  Hubs added that he is not into the Whiz thingy as part of the cheese thing.  I think he prefers his Philly Cheesesteaks with Provolone Cheese instead.  Hubs also said he likes the Cha&#39;s Cha&#39;s Green Chilli Cheese Fries.  Same goes to me, I also like the Cha&#39;s Cha&#39;s Green Chilli Cheese Fries and the Onion Rings.  I like it when our food is prepared hot since that afternoon was a little chilly outside.  Thankfully we have a place to seat at this establishment to enjoy our food.  All in all our experience is 3.5 Stars for the service, 3 stars for the food and the ambience of this establishment.

I also like the photographs and all the newspaper clippings which featured Marge and the celebrity she has come across with.  A small establishment to dine in if you choose to."

But the staff was all very friendly and extremely accommodating when it came to special orders etc. We will definitely be returning in the future because the food is very good and made to order, no nasty sitting around all day kind of stuff and the service was definitely neighborhood style.

I was in Wheat Ridge yesterday visiting the folks and had a little extra time.  I&#39;d been wanting to visit LM for quits some time now and man...I wish I hadn&#39;t waited this long as it&#39;s simply incredible with the key word being simple.  There&#39;s not much in the way of decor with some tin signs and a lot of patron supplied stickers.  It&#39;s perfect.

I walked in and was greeted by one of the two new owners.  I gave my order which was written on a ticket (I sincerely miss that) and money was exchanged.  I was the only cat in there so we go to talking and the two guys are nice as can be and you can tell that they love this.

They have poo sauce which is a hot sauce and then they had a hotter one.  I was warned but I&#39;m pretty adventurous (dumb) and used it for my fries.  It&#39;s delicious but it&#39;s hot.  Not hot in the way that people tell you somethings hot because they are afraid that you&#39;ll cry and salt your own tears with your tears.  It&#39;s legit hot.

The sandwich was sublime.  I got the mushroom and it was everything that I was expecting based on what I&#39;d heard from friends.  Soft bread, piping hot filling and I could taste everything that was described.  Onions, mushrooms, cheese and beef all working together to make one perfect hot sandwich.


I will be back and soon but not just for the food.  It&#39;s refreshing to see to hard working dudes that love what they do and can&#39;t wait to share it with you.

The cheesesteaks are delicious with tender meat and vegies. A very good value.
Poo sauce is kick ass. I love it. Really good on the crispy fries.

Excellent service. We were asked if we were virgins and when we said: Yes, we were given perfect advice about what to order. These people care about helping their customers have an enjoyable experience.

Beer! Yea! Cheap beer. Yea.
Free W-Fi (just ask for the password).

I have some minor complaints:
1. While the bread is quite good with a moderate crust, it is not from  http://amorosobaking.com/ . Cheesesteaks in Philly use Amoroso&#39;s bread. Period.
2. No forks. The sandwich does not hold the mountain of innards so a fork would be handy.
3. I am a Provolone person. Just don&#39;t belong to the Whiz fan club. And, yes, it was my own fault for not scrutinizing the menu and ordering the desired cheese. I just went with the flow. Won&#39;t happen again."

I ordered the Vegetarian Combo: 1 Cheese enchilada, 1 guacamole tostada, and 1 bean burrito, with hot green chili smother. I love guacamole tostadas. It is a true freshness test. I ate it all, so it wasn&#39;t horrible, but it was just starting to turn that funky green in spots. Enough spots to bring about the ick face here and there. The cheese enchilada was definitely a cheese enchilada. The cheese all gooed out and became one with the enchilada sauce on the plate...soup! It was good though! Their enchilada sauce is pretty darn good! It probably mixed with some of the green chili smother.
I took my bean burrito to go and ate it later. It was a basic bean burrito. The smother was supposed to be hot. It was not. It tasted good. 

Service. It is kinda weird there. They don&#39;t really &#34;check&#34; on you, per se...that I have experienced. But it&#39;s kind of OK. Spotty...service is spotty. In fairness, I think there was 1 lady running the whole dining room, at lunch."

What&#39;s brought on this display of mirth, you ask? The popular South Federal restaurant known as Fritangas has spawned a sister in Aurora, and here&#39;s the skinny.

Seeking just a little snack to ward off that hunger? How about some Molletes? This northern Mexican specialty consists of hollowed-out Bolillo bread rounds filled with refried beans and cheese, then grilled to just the right level of gooey-ness. You could also have a look at their array of cornmeal creations - Sopes are round and Huaraches are sandal-shaped but either is topped with your choice of grilled meats, veggies, etc. (Sometimes Fritangas even has Tlacoyos, which are also corn-based and a bit more oblong than a Huarache). Or why not try one of their quesadillas, stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, spicy chicken, pork rinds... (by the way, if you do go this route, please be advised that the quesadillas served here are the folded kind, not the Sincronizada (one tortilla over another) variety). Oh, those didn&#39;t fill you up? No problem! Here&#39;s still more to meditate over.

One of my most favorite sandwiches is the Mexico City wonder called the Pambazo - fried chile-soaked bread stuffed with chorizo and potatoes. And Fritangas definitely does it right - you&#39;ll be feeling the burn more than a certain Secretary of State after just a few bites. I&#39;ve also always been a big fan of Alambres which, in the version offered here, presents no less than five meats (ham, chorizo, chicken, steak, and hot dogs) stir-fried with onions and bell peppers, then napped in thick melted cheese. Ah, you&#39;re in a more marine mood. Well, in that case, a big steaming bowl of mixed-seafood stew [Caldo de Siete Mares] will be just what you need, and then some. Another good choice is Carne Tampique√±a - grilled beef sided with a cheese enchilada, rice and refried beans. But it&#39;s all good, so why not become a regular at Fritangas, and work your way across the menu?"

I&#39;ve been eyeing this place for awhile upon the suggestion of my coworker that they not only serve huge portions at a low price but never really found the time to come here. Enter in a Sunday morning right after a killer workout and in need of some food to fill me up. They have a drive thru (because they used to be a Taco Bell??) so I pulled up and ordered a sausage, egg and potato burrito ($3.75) and bacon and egg burrito ($3) and a minute or two later, I was driving away with two huge burritos. They put green chile on their burritos and I got the medium but really didn&#39;t catch any spice from it. It kept me full for a good portion of the day and my fianc√© loved his as well.

I have watched this particular building for many years.  It was built to be a Taco Bell many years ago.  It has housed coffee shops, donut shops, more coffee shops, and was abandoned for many years.  When I saw a new restaurant opened, I figured I would try it before it was gone.  After eating here, I think they might just make it (after all). 

I have had the smothered shredded beef burrito, the smothered barbacoa burrito, and the al pastor tacos.  The shredded beef burrito had much more beef than I expected, and was flavorful, tender, and slow cooked to perfection.  The barbacoa had a rich deep flavor that I loved, and was even tenderer than the shredded beef.  Both come with beans, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, guacamole, and smothered in green chili.  I found a mixture of mild and hot green chili to be the perfect amount of heat, and the flavor is fairly good.  The tacos were above average, but the pastor was a bit under seasoned, which is heartbreaking as tacos al pastor has been one of my favorite meals since I was a kid and discovered them in Mexico.  The tortillas were (unfortunately) store bought.  

The staff is friendly (or at least smile a lot), and service is prompt.  The restaurant is clean, but stacks of unwrapped chips in bowls by the front door are a bit unappetizing (and unsanitary).  I skipped the chips.  I will return to this restaurant, and hopefully in the future they will fine tune their processes.  I think this place could be my new go to Mexican food restaurant."

Very friendly staff. My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Clean dining room. Clean bathrooms. Salsa just right. Chips were good and crispy, but not too oily. No complaints. 

Went in for a quick, unimpressive burrito to eat in the car with my daughter, but the friendly atmosphere persuaded us, so we stayed, sat down, and enjoyed a very nice lunch. Will be coming here regularly."

Including Taco Bell! 
As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the young lady at the register and she was extremely helpful. I knew I wanted a breakfast burrito, I just didn&#39;t know what kind I wanted or how big they were. She probably could tell this was my first time there and she answered all my questions without hesitation. 
I ended up getting a bacon breakfast burrito and it was a good portion for the $4 I paid for it. It was loaded with bacon, potatoes, eggs, and cheese. There was plenty of green chili on the inside (you can never have enough of that) and it definitely filled me up. My daughters like them, I liked them, we will definitely be back. 

One suggestion, make sure you ask for salsa, they didn&#39;t give me any when I placed the order. This would have topped it off perfectly!"

We moved down the street from this place called Fritangas. The building used to be a Taco Bell back in the day and now has turned into a small quick dining joint. We finally tried it out and were not disappointed. I got a chicken fajita omelet with spicy pork green chili and hash browns. Brian decided on chorizo and eggs with potatoes, beans and mild pork green chili. What I learned was that their spicy green chili is on fire! The mild has better flavor and you can taste your food. :) The chicken fajita omelet was killer. The food and service were fantastic.  The only drawbacks for this place is that the seating area is small and they close pretty early if you want a late night bite."

Its very old Taco Bell building and I was looking for no frill Mexican breakfast that packed good values and still tasted decent. I know the other location had plenty of breakfast specials and always packed.  However.. none of those to be found here.  Didn&#39;t even see the pan handler like the other place (hope not)

The interior was clean, newly remodeled/ painted   and friendly family staff working and I would definitely give positive points for that. 

breakfast I got (forgot the name but it was two strips of bacon, heaping portion of hash browns, other half of the plate filled with chips smothered with green chilli and topped with one egg scrambled for $10 with side of tortillas).  Tasted very meh bland and green chili was very sour and reminded of cheap jar I got from local grocers.  It was overloaded with carbs and served with more carbs on the side.  I would definitely not order this anymore. ...dont ever get this.

Paid over $13 including tip and I was very disappointed for today&#39;s visit.  my stomach still feels uneasy from overload of green chili.

I wish nothing but the best to the owner and the staff and thank them to for being courageous to venture out and open another restaurant.  However, I m hoping they will really see the feedbacks from fellow Yelpers and do the drastic changes if they want to survive at this location.  I really tried to give 3 stars but this location haven&#39;t earned it yet.

5/8/15.  Two smothered chorizo bfast burritos to go.  Let see how they turn out.  Better."

Things are still a little confused, but service extremely friendly.  Dining room seats about 50-75 ppl both booths and tables.  Was nearly filled for Tuesday lunch.   Their menu is enormous and breakfast is served all day.  

No waiting area for to go orders makes things clumsy for sure.   I was also clued in by the owners son the drive thru would be open by April 1st.  The patio will be open over the summer.  Not planning liquor license for a few months or maybe end of summer at the moment.

I&#39;m glad something new came to this location.  It needed some new life.  I&#39;m awaiting my to go order.  If it&#39;s any indication of what&#39;s to come, it sure smells good in here!  

Updated:  I ordered shredded beef burrito with red chili.  I am so glad I did!  Shredded beef was tender and full of flavor, burrito was stuffed.  Big enough for a hearty appatite or to be shared with a neghibor.  Red sauce was also a nice surprise as it was flavorful and not just tasting like a bunch of cumin and chili powder like some places nearby.  Also shared  Queso quesadilla.  It was on the smallish side, but again stuffed with melty queso fresco.   

Nice addition to the neghiborhood."

I was surprised to see one crop up since we have 2 other Mexican restaurants within a 2 block radius of this new place. They took over the old taco bell building that has one of the worst parking lots. We have seen several businesses fail because of that stupid parking lot design for the drive through. I spoke to the owner a week before they opened &amp; he had mentioned they may offer a drive through if things go well. Watching over the last week or so when we drive by, they have kept steady &amp; busy.

There&#39;s not enough places that will make mild food for someone like me. I can&#39;t have hot peppers, not because I&#39;m a wussy, I just don&#39;t like having a swollen tongue. The menu is HUGE. All the food is fresh, no frozen or canned ingredients. I had Carnes Asada &amp; my husband had chilli releno &amp; a chicken chimichanga. Quite delicious!  This little restaurant starts you off mild on just about everything and you decide how hot your food will be when you order it. I finally can have a flavorful &amp; mild dinner. I had to fight a few tears of joy because I have not had menudo in so many years and they have it. It smelled &amp; tasted like the menudo the neighbors use to make and feed me on weekends. I ordered a large and took it home to have today. It was good eats and I appreciate that they gave me a free sample of the menudo before I decided to order some to take home. 

The portions were generous &amp; maybe not as good as the home cooking I&#39;ve had but it&#39;s damn close. Also some of the best service I have ever had. All the waitstaff share serving each of the tables. We will be returning since they offer a few things that our regular place does not offer. It&#39;s great for a small restaurant."

Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t too impressed with it so far. Granted I&#39;ve only tried breakfast items so far. This review may change if I enjoy one of their non-breakfast items in the future. 

The people who work there are exceptionally inviting and kind to their customers. The inside looks very bright and vibrant and includes Mexico City posters. 

I&#39;ve gotten breakfast burritos twice here now and neither have been too impressive. All breakfast burritos come with free chile and cheese and are a decent price for the size of burrito compared to most places around here. If you&#39;re ordering your breakfast burrito for take out then you can get a coffee to go for a dollar. Which isn&#39;t too bad of coffee. 

I got the machaca burrito and was sad about its blandness. The meat was cooked well and wasn&#39;t dried out and you get quite the helping of meat in there which is nice. But it overall was kind of bland, even with the green chile. 

The second time I got the chorizo and potato burrito since I love chorizo and chorizo is never bland. However I&#39;m not sure if it was just today, but the chorizo was a bit over cooked and was mostly chewy and sometimes crispy where it had cooked too long. The potatoes are the freezer potatoes that are small and disappointing. I love potatoes miss the fact that they used fresh potatoes in everything  back home. This is pretty standard in Colorado have potatoes like this unfortunately. Even in some of the popular brunch places. 

I&#39;m gonna try some of the meals next time and hope that this close to home Mexican restaurant has better lunch/dinner food."

I had a cup of tortilla soup which was really good and a chile relleno and it was the perfect amount of food b/c the relleno was smaller than at most restaurants. I also got the half/half sauce and it was plenty spicy. 
My bf got the burrito supreme and it was big. We both thought the food had great flavor. The kitchen was kinda slow even though it wasn&#39;t that busy so our sweet waitress offered us a dessert for free.

(Go to either of those for your taco fix.) Hubs had combo #1with taco, tostada, chili relleno and enchilada: he said it was goid but the chile relleno was cold. I had the combo #6 with a beef burrito, Chile relleno, and enchilada: the entire meal was cold... The manager offered to redo mine but we had waited awhile already so I opted to stick it out.

We went again yesterday for breakfast and again found the service to be slow and confused. The place was about 1/3 full and there were 3 girls serving.
We waited close to 30 minutes for huevos rancheros and huevos con chorizo. My potatoes were undercooked and our food was cold. They do not butter the toast so expect a dry half toasted piece of bread.
I see potential here if they could coordinate between front and back of the house. Staff needs more training."

One of the best parts about this place was their site. You click into it, and this sexy, booty groovin&#39; R&amp;B jam kicks up immediately. It gets your heart pumpin and in the mood for food. Tacos, pretty good. Burrito, according to my man, pretty nice. We only went there a time or two, and haven&#39;t been back. Maybe that says a lot, but I think a lot of it is the hours, too. But I&#39;d go again."

Obviously they are still working out the opening kinks but, the food was awesome, everyone is super friendly and from what I could see, food safety and sanitation is actually being practiced(right now).

We ordered a steak smothered burrito, a carne asada smothered  burrito and a smothered carnitas burrito. The steak had no seasoning whatsoever and the frijoles had absolutely no salt. The carnitas burrito consisted of a tortilla filled with refried beans and some fried pork bits on top. Still love the salsa provided with the chips and salsa but they give u a very small basket of chips and a tiny ramekin of salsa and charge you $2 extra for more. My hubby still likes the breakfast burritos so maybe just for breakfast?

Wow! Mexico City fare in Aurora. Food is authentic and awesome. Staff is uber friendly. Had the Huaraches De alambre (diced steak). Glad me and hubby shared. It&#39;s a lot of food!"

The first evening I had the Fritangas Burger. Mind blown! Amazing flavor and unlike any burger I have ever had. This burger had ham, bacon, hot dog, pineapple, avacado, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I am not sure what kind of cheese they use but it was very delicious. 

Tonight I had the crispy beef tacos. Without exaggeration these are the best crispy beef tacos I have ever had. They even make their own shells!

I also warn they don&#39;t have liquor so if you have your heart set on a margarita- well ya wont get it here. They do have fresh juices though....Its a new place so I will extend some growing pain grace :)

All items on the menu should have taken five minutes to plate and serve.  Desserts looked good but after over an hour we just wanted to go home.  It was a Thursday and the food was average. Now I know why they always look busy, people are taking up tables for over an hour. Wait staff needs training and kitchen needs to speed it up. 
To be fair, there were a dozen tables filled (about 2/3 capacity) and three groups came in for take out. Take out was given priority, they did not wait longer than 5-10 minutes."

When I go into a Mexican restaurant my expectations are to eat good wholesome food and feel great about the service. Very clean on the inside as they just opened. Chunks of onion in my breakfast burrito was a first, I recommend they be chopped smaller for enjoyment of food. Definitely something to test out, as they are new to this neighborhood my feeling was a tex mex and nothing to set them a part from other establishments. I would prefer a flavor or sauce unique to the establishment."

This is about what we expected for a restaurant in a remodeled Taco Bell.  We ate in, as opposed to some of the other reviewers, and thought it was OK.  Our food was not cold, as noted in several reviews, and the service was great.  Very friendly and attentive servers.

Is this a 5 star restaurant?  Of course not.  Hello?  It&#39;s in a Taco Bell building!!  But the food was pretty good and the staff was trying very hard to please.  We&#39;ll definitely give them a couple of more tries before making a final decision, but I&#39;ve had much worse food in much bigger and nicer Mexican restaurants."

So far the breakfast burritos are pretty good, totally worth the money. But the service is not so great, ate in once for breakfast, food was good service was I guess okay, and I think it was the owner serving us. Dinner food was boring and bland, nothing special at all. And the two other times we&#39;ve picked up breakfast burritos ive had to repeat the order 3 times for them to still get it wrong and if you want more than 1 salsa for 3 burritos you have to be very specific and practically beg for enough, and check before you go because they still try to get away with not giving you what you asked for, and yes I offered to pay for the extra salsa.

I was glad to notice that a Mexican restaurant opened in this spot as I pass it every morning on my way to work (there was a coffee shop there last and it didn&#39;t last long).

First impression is that the staff really needs training.  I never knew who was serving me as the server coming to my table seemed to be a different person each time.

I came here for the first time yesterday...since it&#39;s an old Taco Bell I thought it was a fast food Mexican place but when I walked in there were 3 waitresses standing around and I realized it&#39;s actually a sit down restaurant.  It&#39;s too small to be a sit down.  I decided to order a burrito supreme to go. It wasn&#39;t bad actually, but someone in the kitchen put a Styrofoam to go container under a heat lamp, so when I got my burrito the container didn&#39;t close because it was misshapen from the heat lamp.  By the time I got home I had a little mess because I spilled some green chili in the bag.  This is obviously a training issue.

I had noticed that they also had a breakfast menu, so this morning I decided to give it another try to see if my prior experience was an aberration.  Two different waitresses approached my table...I told the second one that I had already ordered coffee from the first waitress.  I should mention here that English is not the waitresses 1st language.  I ordered breakfast and asked that my eggs be lightly scrambled.  It didn&#39;t look like the waitress understood me so I told her &#34;don&#39;t cook them too much&#34;.  When I got my eggs they were like rubber and the edges were crispy.  Although everything on the plate was hot, the bacon was cold.  The service was very iffy...a couple of times I got a waitress coming over to ask if I wanted more coffee when my coffee cup was empty and my food hadn&#39;t arrived yet.  I would say yes and they would run to the kitchen, grab the pot and come back.  I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t show up with the pot and if I needed it they can just fill it, if not they can move on (I see this as another training issue).  This happened throughout my morning breakfast.

When I was ready to leave I asked who I thought was my waitress (since she had shown up at the table a couple of times) for the check but a completely different girl brought out the check.  To tell you the truth I have no idea who I was tipping for the service.

Bottom line, they needs more service training or be assigned sections so there isn&#39;t so much confusion on the customer part.  I still think this should be a fast food restaurant, not a sit down service.  There&#39;s a lot of room for improvement."

A little pricey compared to casa vallarta lunch down the street   like its more central american flavors.  Give it a try  I think it is kinda of hit or miss for people because it is a different taste then the tex-mex type of restarauts around here

Got an enchilada platter, Taco, Tostada, Tamale and Burrito Especial. The Tamale and Enchilada was great. Rice and Beans that came with the Enchilada were good as well. Taco was kinda watery. Not greasy, watery. Still trying to figure that one out. The Tostada didn&#39;t have any beans on it but that&#39;s OK, The supposedly Beef and Bean Burrito Especial didn&#39;t have even a spoonful on meat in it. The taste was good but pretty damn expensive for a bean burrito. Probably wont be back."

It is very inexpensive to get a Bento box which is awesome because it comes with soup crab cheese wontons four pieces of sushi white rice ginger and soup. The servers are also very nice and also willing to listen to any concerns or questions I had , when I wouldn&#39;t want the soup. he offered extra white rice on the side. You can see the restaurant has a bar and a bunch of dining tables, so grab a chair and go. The whole Bento box was perfect if filled me up right away and I only paid about $10! You can hear a lot of formal music in the background and lots of formal conversations from lots of guests and the servers.

It was more than half empty so that&#39;s great if you like to avoid crowds. We were greeted right away and given a booth. The booths are the type that you can move so our was far apart and we had to keep readjusting. No big deal since no one was seated near us. 
The satay chicken was a little rubbery. Tasted microwaved. Ordered five sushi rolls that nearly all involved some crunchy tuna or shrimp tempura. All five rolls were great. 
I&#39;d recommend this place for the attentive service, available tables and good rolls."

It&#39;s located in a strip mall right after the U-Haul. The interior decor has that feeling of a japanese sushi place with the sushi bar right in front of the entrance. But the tables, chairs and other decor felt more like a chinese restaurant with it&#39;s plastic table tops and chairs. We were seated immediately since the place wasn&#39;t too busy at all. The menu just a classic example of &#34;jack of all trades&#34; in asian food. It literally has Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese inspired items. Being in Denver we weren&#39;t expecting too much since we are from LA so know what real asian food is suppose to taste like. 

Anyhow we had:
Tokyo love boat for 2: 8 pcs of sushi, 12 pcs of sashimi, rainbow roll and shrimp tempura roll. Hrm being in Colorado you absolutely don&#39;t expect fresh fish so of course this was your frozen fishes served as &#34;sashimi&#34;. You can tell from the color and straight taste this fish wasn&#39;t super fresh but just OK. The nigiri sushi sashimi was cut thin. It was tailored more to the regional flavor profile obviously. It was not served with your traditional dab on wasabi under the nigiri rice. The rice was also not seasoned with your usual rice vinegar sugar. Overall flavor 2.5/5. Overall value 3.5/5

Salmon Teriyaki bento: served with white rice, 4 pcs california rolls, 2 pcs cheese wonton, 2 pcs gyoza, and miso soup. What to say here... first the miso soup was 100% guaranteed made from instant packets. Yes i&#39;ve eaten and made enough instant and fresh miso soup to know the difference. The salmon for the salmon teriyaki was cooked abit over so the ends of the fish was very dry. The teriyaki sauce itself was pretty standard. The best part of this bento was sadly the chinese style cream cheese/imitation crab wontons in the sweet n sour sauce. At least it was crunchy with the right amount of sweetness in the cream cheese mixture. The fried gyoza was OK with a standard pork/cabbage mixture. It wasn&#39;t very flavorful and definitely needed to soy for that extra saltiness. Yes they tried to make the bento more presentable/cute with your heart shaped rice mold. YAY! This is one of those entree&#39;s you eat just fill your stomach and not really to enjoy. Overall taste 2.5/5 overall value 3.5/5

The service was one of the better points of this place. The waiters do speak mandarin/cantonese for those out of towners. Overall this place is definitely not a must try but more like a if you have no choice and absolutely have no other asian place to go to kinda place. It&#39;s definitely jack of all trades and a master of none place."

  We went here for Dinner since its the closest establishment from where we were after work.  Time was about 18:50hrs.  At that hour, this establishment is filled with other patrons alike for the Dinner rush etc...

  We were seated at the left wing of the establishment.  Our server gave us the Menu.  From the simple Menu, I opt to have the Nigiri and Hubs ordered 2 items from the Regular Menu.

From what I recall these were the items we had that evening :

*  Cheese Wonton ($5.25)
*  Royal Chicken ($9.95)
*  Shrimp Fried Rice aka Tokyo Fried Rice with Shrimp Option ($9.95)

*  Hot Vietnamese Coffee ($3.50) for Hubs  

The items I have on the &#34;Sushi&#34; items were :

*  Ebi ($1.00)
*  Octopus ($1.00)
*  Tamago (Egg) ($1.00)
*  Squid ($1.00)
*  Flying Fish ($1.00)
*  Eel Sushi ($2.50)
*  Spicy Scallop ($2.50)

Take note the Nigiri ORDER ONLY comes with 1 item per Nigiri.

I ended my evening with Honey Dew Boba...

  This establishment was just MEH.  YES, maybe its popular with the Neighborhood what nots.  The service is OK.  The service to bring out our food is fast.  The ambience is OK.  But I come here to get some Sushi/Nigiri.  The Sushi/Nigiri were tiny.  I am disappointed with the portions let alone the taste of the Nigiri.  *SIGH*

  Nothing fancy, nothing stellar.  Nigiri QUALITY is NOT that good either.

  The Shrimp Fried Rice, was also MEH.  Come on, don&#39;t be like another establishment that just put those frozen vegetables like peas and carrots.  Create your own creativity or something.  Furthermore, the Fried Rice is tossed with those Black Soy Sauce, that I dont fancy that much.  *DOUBLE SIGH*  The Shrimp Fried Rice was a little greasy, uninspired and once again small portions.

  At 19:00hrs, they ran out of certain items when we want to order.  Maybe this establishment is very busy and popular with the Lunch crowd or something.  Even with the Boba I want for my Drink, they ran out.  *TRIPPLE SIGH*  The server said, they can put the &#34;jelly&#34; that they have.  Oh well...

  Hubs also said his order of Royal Chicken was just MEH.  Small portions for his liking.  The Royal Chicken is overly salty and too sweet at the same time.  The Royal Chicken dish is DRENCHED with too much of Dark Soy Sauce once again.  The Hot Vietnamese Coffee comes in with a TALL GLASS, that makes the Coffee colder faster in which Hubs does NOT fancy. 

We would NOT be returning anytime soon or in the future.

Left the establishment about 19:40hrs ish.

My apologies for this rant.

They have lit up pillowy lights on the ceiling and a sushi bar as well as alcohol bar. I tried the coconut roll for under $12 (coconut shrimp, mango, cucumber, avocado, wrapped in soy paper w/ house mango sauce). This was not your conventional sushi roll! It was slightly sweet &amp; pretty refreshing. I enjoyed the unconventional soy paper wrap &amp; its presentation. I also had the Osaka roll (spicy tuna, spicy crabmeat, avocado, white tuna, mayo, eel sauce, rooster sauce, tobiko and scallions) for $12 thought that it was subpar to the coconut roll because it was too salty for me. I loved all of the ingredients but just wished there was less salty brown sauce (eel sauce) on top. There were tons of specialty rolls to choose from so I will definitely venture back to try some more. The combo fried rice (comes with different meats + shrimp) was really delicious &amp; so were the Vietnamese egg rolls (that come with a little bit of pickled carrot/daikon, lettuce &amp; noodles). I really loved how vast the menu was &amp; how many dessert options they had (includes: mango sticky rice, mochi, fried banana with ice cream, chocolate cake, chesecake &amp; key lime cake). They also deliver (free w/in 3 mi radius)! This is the 1st time I&#39;ve seen a place where you can get both pho &amp; sushi. It is a win win for me. They have a sister restaurant called Bangkok Tokyo that I&#39;d love to try too."

Delicious food, awesome service, and quick delivery most nights too. (The dining room is always very quiet when I&#39;ve gone in to pick up food, they must do a TON of delivering).

I&#39;ve asked them to modify or substitute items on their menu several times now, and it&#39;s never been an issue at all. Love it.

Must try on the menu: Gyoza, and Sriracha Chicken (listed as Sriracha Beef, I decided to substitute).

2 little quirks about this place:

~ closed on Monday. A little odd, but hey, we all need a day off
~ the portion of rice they give you with to go orders is pretty small. If you love your rice (or plan on having seconds) I would definitely order an extra side.

Go here, be happy."

We ordered yaki udon, sesame chicken, wonton soup, calamari, a California roll and a unagi roll. We loved everything but the sesame chicken: It didnt taste good and it was rather runny with the vegetables that steamed out in transit. I really didnt want all the foliage(bed of broccoli, onions and carrots)... it made for soggy, dripping pieces that had a strange flavor and not really sweet. That should be replaced but I probably wont call them.
I thought the wonton soup was great but it wasnt the original type we&#39;re used to as it was pho broth based and my wife, who does not like pho, queued in on that right away... even though I didnt tell her when I initially tasted it, as I love pho. So the soup ended up being all mine. The calamari was made differently as well, from the styles you normally see(not a bad thing), and it was tasty and tender. Wife&#39;s yaki udon was very tasty but it was also very greasy. The sushi rolls were yummy. Some great stuff and some not so great stuff. Maybe just tried the wrong things from here since the ratings are so good?."

Beef dish was juicy and hot, well seasoned and rrally good. It wasnt greasy. Wontons were crisp. Gyoza was flavorful and crisp. Not greasy. Very very good.

Customer service was excellent. Took only about 8 minutes to get 2 bento boxes for takeout.

Miso soup was a huge miss, as we&#39;re the California rolls. They tasted fresh there was just hardly any filling.

Wait staff was friendly and kept up well with drink refills. When one roll took longer than the rest, they brought out the first batch so we weren&#39;t left hanging, and then brought out the last couple rolls a few minutes later.

Great variety of rolls to choose from-- we went with the Tornado Roll, Volcano Roll, Rainbow Roll, Philly Roll, Spider roll, and one I can&#39;t recall the name of. They all tasted awesome. I&#39;m sad sushi doesn&#39;t keep well in the fridge, because naturally our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered too much food.

Decor is tasteful and fun, and if you like you can sit by the bar and watch the sushi while its prepared.

Wait staff is very polite, and kept up with drink refills and additional orders (we ordered the Spider Roll as an afterthought and it still arrived with time to spare).

Price was also pretty reasonable, considering how much we ordered. Location is extremely convenient to my work."

First impression,  the restaurant is clean,  decor is nice and the staff is friendly. In reading the menu,  I had a dilemma.  Should I order sushi,  our should I have the Pho? Why decide,  I say to myself.  Have both.  First the sushi.  Fresh and yummy. I chose a Philly roll (tame, I know) and a few pieces of nigiri ( 5 to be exact). The result was delightfully fresh. Highly recommend. And now for the Pho. I ordered a median Pho Ga (Vietnamese rice noodle soup with chicken). It was tasty,  but I have had a better bowl at other places (outside Colorado). Don&#39;t get me wrong,  I will probably order it here again.

 If you find yourself in Aurora,  do yourself a favor and stop by for some sushi. Tell them that guy from Oklahoma sent you."

My boyfriend ordered the pho and said it was probably the worst pho he has ever had. I tasted it and it was quite bland with barely any meat. Also, the herbs that came with it were wilted and not fresh. We requested a set of fresher basil but were told all of the basil they had were like that.

Us and another couple were the only customers there,  and service wasn&#39;t good. Our server didn&#39;t check on us except for to clear our table when we were done."

Extensive menu with many Asian noodle and rice favorites with many sushi items.

Next time I want greasy noodles sadly mislabeled as Pad Thai, I will go to the nearest dollar per scoop buffet.  As for the sushi, the ladies at the neighborhood King Soopers prepares better rolls and nigiri then Saigon Tokyo.  If I have to pay a delivery fee I expect delivery at least within an hour. It&#39;s sushi. It&#39;s not cooked. I live 4.3 miles away by the longest route. Please provide at least an entertaining excuse.  My tip, which, again, grossly generous for the quality and wait, do not offer more horrible food for free as a resolution to serving bad food from the beginning. 
Save your money  and time fellow Aurora residents. Never dine or order from Saigon Tokyo.  Little Caesers is less disappointing."

As other reviews have stated, I also have to admit that I&#39;m a sushi snob. I ordered the shrimp tempura bento box and a spicy tuna roll; and let me tell you, it was an orgasmic experience for my taste buds. The food was flavorful, fresh, and nicely prepared. What&#39;s even better is they do free delivery if you live within a 3 mile radius. The lady who took my order over the phone was polite, sweet, and competent (and if you do the delivery option, they take cash or debit card, an extra plus if you&#39;re like me and hardly ever have cash on you).

The pork was thinly sliced and with the panko, it was crispy.  They punch holes in the togo containers so the steam can escape, so the crispy things stay crispy.  The 2 gyoza and wontons were crispy.  4 pieces of Cal roll were pretty small but tasted fresh, rice didn&#39;t appear to be refrigerated.  Scoop of rice was fresh.   They give you a tiny container of sweet and sour sauce for the wontons.  Small container of sauce for the katsu.  My only complaint is about the tiny container of soy sauce.  It tasted like it had vinegar in the sauce.  I noticed that after I already put the wasabi in.   So, what I thought was soy sauce was probably the sauce for the gyoza.  If so, I was missing soy sauce for the cal roll.  Maybe next time I need to ask for a soy sauce packet.  Oh they also give you soup but I opted to not get the soup just because it was already a lot of food and I didn&#39;t want to get full from the soup.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d get the Tonkatsu again because the pork was sliced too thin."

It was a beautiful sunny Colorado afternoon and the wall of doors were open with a nice breeze. We shared 6 appetizers and had a nice glass of red wine. We did not try the pasta as we. We ordered the Brussel Sprouts, risotto balls, calamari, Stromboli, meatballs and an eggplant dish. 

All were good but the standouts were the Brussel sprouts and the eggplant. I&#39;d order 2 of each next time for the 4 of us to share. The Stromboli was my least favorite. 

The restaurant was busy and our service was prompt, friendly, and attentive. 

We look forward to coming back another time."

Food? Don&#39;t waste your time. We came in and I ordered a really basic pasta with marinara, meatballs and cheese. My pasta still had about 2 cups of water with it on my plate. Meanwhile, there was absolutely no marinara on over 1/2 of it. I found the marinara, eventually, but basically was eating angel hair in greasy water with cheese and meatballs. They also as this weird garnish of a baked pasta noodle flower on the side. It&#39;s not tasty. My kids ordered spaghetti and meatballs and pepperoni pizza. Everything looked good, but the spaghetti, according to my husband and son, wasn&#39;t good. My husband said it tasted like spaghetti O&#39;s. The pizza was good looking but didn&#39;t taste good either. It was pretty flavorless. I know kids meals are supposed to be basic with flavors, but this was cardboardesque."

With an abundance of great local eateries in the shopping center, we had many choices along the way. Once again, we used the Yelp app to narrow down our choices. Salati Italian Street Food had an overall rating of 4 stars so we stopped by for a quick bite to eat.

Salati is located within The Shops of Northfield Stapleton. The nearest cross streets are Unita Street and E 46th Avenue. Most people find it easiest to enter the shopping center off of Northfield Blvd and work their way down Unita Street to find the restaurant. Just in case you need a frame of reference, Salati is just across the street from the movie theater. Ample parking is available in the public lot which is large enough to accommodate busy crowds.

Outside you&#39;ll find patio seating with a small awning for shade. Most of the area is exposed to the sun and the shadiest seats are closer to the building. When you walk inside, you&#39;ll notice a small bar area to the left. It has beautiful bricks behind the counter that cover the length of the wall. The arched ceiling is lined with wood panels, giving the entire business a rustic feel! Plenty of open seating is available in the main dining room as well as in a small nook near the kitchen.

When we walked inside, we were greeted by our waiter who seated us promptly. We sat off to the side, away from the main dining room. As I looked to my right, I noticed a  window to order take out. One lady ordered from there but ate her meal in the restaurant. So, I&#39;m assuming that you can also place your order here and bypass interacting with the waiters/waitresses. 

Anyway, as we browsed the menu, our waiter came back and asked what we&#39;d like to drink. I ordered a root beer but he said that it may not be in stock because they had a big rush of customers last night. Luckily, he found out that the stocked up overnight. I was a little confused because you don&#39;t go over the available drinks and then once the customer makes their choice, tell them it&#39;s not available. 

Once that was resolved, I moved on to ordering my pasta. First you pick your base pasta then add your protein (meat), sauce, and toppings. I wanted basic penne pasta with Alfredo sauce and mozzarella cheese. I wasn&#39;t too fond of the fish that was on the menu so I just had them service the Mahi-Mahi on the side. My husband ordered his meal and asked for mushrooms and lo&#39; and behold, they were out of mushrooms too!!! This was also due to the large crowds that came in the night before. Somehow, they had not restocked their entire food supply yet! Needless to say, we were a little disappointed already!

Our meal arrived within 10 minutes of us placing our order. The pasta was well-cooked with a soft texture to it. The cheese, although appearing to be  well-melted on the pasta, was still a little thick. The flavor wasn&#39;t overpowering and seemed pretty basic on that it didn&#39;t have a lasting effect on me. The whole thing was pretty bland! 

Our visit started out a bit rough.  Remember the root beer was missing but then found later and the depleted supply of mushrooms??? I knew this wasn&#39;t going to go over too well. We were appreciative with the amount of patience our waiter had with us. It&#39;s not his fault that they had not restocked their supply for the day. I&#39;m glad that we stopped by because of all of the places that were in the nearby vicinity, this one seemed most promising. It&#39;s possible that this was just an off day for the business but they need to be prepared by having all foods and drinks stocked for the day."

The food came out hot but it just missed the mark on taste.  I also ordered an Irish Mule, and Mexican Mule. The drinks were just ok. Couldn&#39;t really taste the ginger in the mules.

If the owner/manager reads this, I&#39;m happy to discuss further, because this place could be very good if things in the front of the house get fixed.  Four star food, one star service, but unfortunately those two things don&#39;t balance out at all.  I came in with a big group, with a reservation that I&#39;d made three weeks prior.  I called in the afternoon to confirm and give them an exact number of guests, and they said great.  When we arrived they didn&#39;t seem to know that we were coming, and that was the beginning of the end.  As people arrived, we got scattershot waters and silverware.  Some people got drinks, others didn&#39;t.  They were in the process of revamping their wine list, so there was no beverage menu.  Some people ordered food, but we were told that because we were a large party, they wouldn&#39;t allow us to order off the build-your-own menu.  Wish I&#39;d known that when I called them twice before we got there... A few other larger parties came in after us that night, but our food came out so randomly, and it was obvious that the other groups got their food long before we did.  Several people in our group were done eating before the last few had even gotten to order.  Once the majority of the group finally got their food, almost everyone seemed to enjoy it, so that was a plus.  But at least three people didn&#39;t get their entrees for almost an hour, and one couple only got their appetizer because apparently their main course order was never turned in to the kitchen.  While we tried to be patient and accommodating to the situation, it really marred the evening for the group.  After people started to pay their checks and left, the manager came over to ask us what the problem was.  I had seen her talking to a few people in our party, but it turned out that they had not been given any recourse or discount for having to wait so long for their food.  The manager basically told us they were understaffed and the waitress was new.  Well, sure, but we had a reservation and you knew we were coming, so there&#39;s no reason to have such a problem.  I was most disappointed that she basically made no effort to apologize or remedy the situation.  I&#39;m pretty certain that nobody in our group will be returning, which is a shame because the food was quite good and there were several things I would have been interested to try.  But poor service and attitude from the staff will turn anyone off to a restaurant.  I wish this place had worked out better."

This place is really pretty good for a number of reasons:

1. Very friendly and professional staff
2. Live music! Ok, it was just one dude and his guitar, but he was really pretty good.
3. A pretty decent happy hour with a full bar and enough options on draft to satisfy most tastes.
4. A variety of food choices from small plates to dinner sized portions.

Not a bad spot for a pre-movie or comedy show meal."

I wouldn&#39;t know, but it just seems that the slightest thing, whether it be bad hired help, a bad few days of poor food quality or a general cleanliness issue can derail an otherwise well-intention&#39;d business.  

So seems to be the case here.  My first visit was a resounding success - I loved it, and promptly left a great review.  I went back, on 7/13/2016, expecting a similar, quality result.  When I arrived, the restaurant was empty, and I went up to the order-line.  There was a female worker, who, at first, did not acknowledge me, instead, scooped chicken from the food bar, into her plastic, Tupperware-from-home container of what looked like home-made Mexican Mole.  After she was done serving up what I would assume to be her lunch, she set her dish down and then turned to me to take my order.  I went for a flatbread sandwich, with meatballs and a little sauce.  She &#34;shoo&#39;d&#34; a fly off of the flatbread before grabbing one to prepare.....  

The end product was flavorless, greasy and unfulfilling.  I sat in a booth with an un-wiped table, choked down what I could, and promptly left.  Sad turn of events.  Wish these folks the best of luck."

My husband really liked his penne with a mix of spicy and regular marinara, Italian sausage, peppers, onions, and cheese.  I got the penne with the white sauce, mushrooms, and winter veggie medley (red and yellow squash and brussel sprouts).  The medley looked weird - almost like meat, but tasted good.  I asked for the romano cheese, but it ended up tasting and looking much more like feta (which I don&#39;t care for).  I should have done the parmesan, I guess. 

My other two mix-ins I got on the side - an arugula/spinach mix and tomatoes.  I also got two dressings - a caesar-like kind that was good, and a homemade ranch that was AMAZING.  I seriously would have been better off with the salad rather than the pasta.  

I initially ordered the roasted brussel sprouts - actually one of the reasons I wanted to go there (I LOVE brussel sprouts)...  But, they had a super busy day and were out!  (Although we didn&#39;t find out until the pasta came out - they should have told us sooner.). I tried ordering the roasted corn instead, but they were out of that, too!   It is great that their business is picking up, though.  They make everything from scratch with fresh ingredients, so it&#39;s easy to run out of things when there is a huge rush.  

So, even though it sucked not to be able to have brussel sprouts or corn, it was awesome how they handled it.  We ended up being given some free minestrone soup that had a lot of good vegetables in it.  Also, the chef came out personally to apologize to us and ask if he could get us anything else.  I ended up asking for more spinach/arugula and tomatoes to go with that delicious dressing, and he gave me that, plus some cucumbers and red onions! ...my own little wonderful salad!  All the staff were super nice and accommodating - and they were having fun singing along to the Jackson 5 and other oldies.  

A few side notes - the corn syrup-free soda is interesting.  It&#39;s good, but you may need to stay on the server to give you refills.  I had to ask a lot of questions before I really understood what it was, as well.  

And, one of the toilet handles was broken...  I had to lift the back lid to flush it.  I told a staff member and hope they&#39;ll fix it soon.   

On the whole, a good meal with great service.  I would come back next time I&#39;m in Denver!"

You can make pretty much any pasta you want, from straight buttery noodles to penne with bacon and vodka sauce.   You can mix and match and get your pasta your way for sure.

Their calamari is also excellent which is my goto side, but there are a good selection of sides too.

If your craving pasta, Salati is sure to satisfy."

Happened to stop by during lunch hours which is a fast casual concept. You pick your type (calzone, bowl, salad), protein, sauce and toppings. My noodles were undercooked. The Vodka sauce was just OK - and the protein offerings meager. Also ordered the crispy brussels that were quite tasty (saved the meal honestly) and the curly fries, which were BARELY curley and more like pub style chips. These were also pretty good. 

Pricing wasn&#39;t bad, but I expected a little more. I would have preferred a sit down option. Italian as fast casual is very tricky and can border into Sbarro levels of quality if you&#39;re not careful."

My husband and I stopped at Northfield on our way home from a long road trip.  I had a bad feeling from the moment we walked in.  What is &#34;Italian street food&#34;? I&#39;ve been to Italy and none of this resembled their street food.  Other than that, the menu was just strange.  Against my instincts, we stayed for dinner.  We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer despite the fact that it was topped with feta cheese which I consider Mediterranean or Greek not an Italian cheese.  Who cares what it tasted like, the meat (some kind of pork) was so off-putting in appearance that I couldn&#39;t get over it.  Who throws gross grey strips on top of their bruschetta? After my husband seasoned it for us and got past the visual displeasure, the flavor was ok, certainly nothing to write home about.  We both ordered pasta for our main entree.  I won&#39;t address his food because he ordered off the make your own menu so he was responsible for his choices (somehow, he ordered that nasty pork again which he actually just took out of his dish and set aside).  I ordered the Milano which was a Basic penne, chicken, mushroom In a cream sauce.  They clearly boil the pasta per dish but unfortunately, despite the fact that they were not busy AT ALL, they don&#39;t have time to properly drain the water off.  Therefore, my dish was a watery mess with the most flavorless chicken completely unseasoned.  I am pretty sure they pre-boil or bake the chicken totally unseasoned and then refrigerate it and just throw it in the pasta.  I couldn&#39;t even eat the dish so our server brought me the eggplant dish which was also inedible  due to the large amount of water the pasta was siting in.  Not even the little crostini which garnished both dishes were good and completely lacked any flavor
Other than the oil brushed on each side for toasting.  Gross.  Will never go back and recommend to no one."

I stumbled across this quaint location in the outdoor mall and was excited that I did not have to go to Olive Garden to get my Italian food fix. The restaurant was well lit and open but that&#39;s about all it had going for it. First of all there were roughly only 8 people in the place when the waitress told me to &#34;sit anywhere&#34; I did then the waiting began. Not even a hint that they recognized I existed. Finally someone came over and asked if I&#39;d like a beer, no water was fine with me because I was considering bailing and cutting my losses. The waitress came back with my water then disappeared again. After what seemed like forever she came back and I ordered a pasta dish. She informed me that it would take 20 minutes to bake it and suggested I try something else. I told her I&#39;d wait it out. Unfortunately it was not worth the wait. The dish came out sizzling hot, burned in some areas but pretty much tasteless. I guess it&#39;s my own fault, I should have bailed when I first had the thought to do so. It would not take much to get this lovely place higher ratings 1.Pay more attention to your customers 2. Provide a follow up after the food is delivered to see if everything was okay (I wanted another slice of bread but she never came back) 3. Expand the menu 4. Figure out how to get food out of the kitchen faster..."

The restaurant is really fancy and very romantic for a restaurant that is not as wildly noticeable from the outside. We saw large brick walls that looked like an ancient pavement and thought the dining hall was beautiful; almost like traveling back in time. We sat by the patio outside while still sitting inside and had a lovely server by the name of Kristina (or Christina) help us out and she was very knowledgeable, friendly, and fair of what to expect of each dish. We ended up eating the plate of &#34;Meatballs,&#34; and the &#34;Nutella Piadina.&#34; The main dish of meatballs was $10 and it came in a delicious little pot with a large portion of red sauce, melted white Parmesan cheese and vegetables. The dish was sure hot and delicious. The only main thing was I expected more meatballs and it only came with three. Three different flavors of: Sausage, Pork and Salami. It was that good. I wanted more the dish was kind off too small. The Nutella Piadina was awesome and very chocolatey. Thanks to the Nutella of course!!!!"

Slow service. 
Food had rubbery texture like it sat under heat lamps for hours. We got a chicken pasta dish with rubber chicken and cold hard crusty pasta on top and the meatballs that were unnecessarily spicy. 
Young staff set hot plates (not hot food, remember it sat under heat lamps) in front of my 11 month old along with plates and utensils. Yes the area in front of my baby was clear for a reason.

A little confusing when you walk in, as there is a soda fountain right there - thought maybe it was a fast casual spot and we would need to go stand in line, but the manager took care of us. They were fairly busy but we were seated right away.

Food was great, if the menu was a little confusing to navigate. Staff was very friendly in explaining it though. Got the roasted 1/2 chicken special and it was great. Risotto balls were very tasty, as well as the sweet potato tots. Saw about 9 things on the menu I wanted to try, so will definitely be back.

Only complaint was the service. Was a bit slow - took a while to get our check and then to get it picked up. All the while staring at dirty plates. Pre bus people! :)"

The curly fries were unusual in shape and quite tasty.  The food portions were ample and the prices quite reasonable.   We arrived shortly before the happy hour expired and ordered our drinks before the cutoff time but did not receive the discounts initially supposedly &#34;because the computer erred.&#34;  That part of the bill was fixed, but not the additional dollar for the dessert that was higher than the stated menu price.  Service was initially good, but then dropped off as the place became more busy.  The air conditioner was going full blast with drafty cold air blowing around.  There were some flies buzzing around as well.   The outdoor seating was not being used and it seems to have been poorly designed.  Finding the restaurant was a little tricky because the street numbering system in the area us totally ridiculous.

SALATI offers full service, but also Chipotle-style takeout.  I really liked the Piadina (flat bread loaded with sauce, meat, and vegies, folded like a big Italian taco), and have never had anything like it.  The food at this place is super tasty and reasonably priced.  I hope they do well.  I&#39;ll know I&#39;ll be back."

Our server was very personable and great with the kids, and he explained the menu (design your own sandwich, salad, or pasta). We ordered the crispy brussels sprouts as an appetizer, and they were delicious. The pasta and salad entrees were just okay. Next time, I&#39;d choose more of the small plates. Portions are reasonable and prices are inexpensive. Overall, a great, family-friendly restaurant."

I do think the food was good and came out super fast but the overall dining experience was so rushed and unpleasant.  Our movie finished across the street at 7:20.  We walked over to the restaurant and took our time ordering.  The guy that took our order was very sweet and pleasant and our appetizers arrived literally five minutes after we ordered them.  We got the calamari and it was fresh and tasty.  Before our appetizer was finished our food arrived.  No kidding, not even half way through our meal the server came over (my husband had his fork in his hand and I was actually chewing my food) and asked if we would like a to go box.  We said yes since I was not going to be able to finish my meal.  The boxes arrived seconds later and while we were still eating the check arrived with the time stamp of 8:02.  We felt to rushed and since we rarely get to go out these days kiddo free, we won&#39;t take the chance and come back here.  We were literally in and out of the restaurant in 30 minutes (with appetizers and two main meals) and really wanted to have a relaxing evening together where we could unwind. So disappointing!"

Three of us stopped by Friday late afternoon for some small plates and drinks.  Absolutely fabulous!  First of all, Salati is the &#34;perfect&#34; type of restaurant for Denver and for Stapleton.  It&#39;s cool, inviting, great ambience and has amazing food.  We had the meatballs, calamari and eggplant dish.  All were super generous portions, beautifully presented and just delicious!!  Sean was our fun waiter -- A++ to him!  This new restaurant which has been open for 6-7 weeks now, is exactly the kind of restaurant Stapleton needed.  Great prices, generous pours, actually good wines at a reasonable price per glass (try the Malbec).  A perfect place to stop for a drink but do NOT miss the food!

Deli Zone offers a variety of subs/sandwiches that are tastier than subway and actually prepared with care!

I like the breakfast sandwiches ($3-$5) here because they&#39;re served on a warm, soft  kaiser roll. You can also choose how many eggs you want in your sandwich (I usually do just one).

It seems that the sandwiches&#39; ingredients, in general, were carefully selected to complement each other in terms of flavor, as well as texture. They&#39;re also fairly priced (under $10 for a med. sub)!

The sandwiches at this particular location are prepared very well, and the service here is friendly! The tables are clean, and there are a variety of condiments available to sauce up your sammie.

I wondered how tasty they&#39;d be and if it&#39;d be worth it, so I decided to dive in! 

When I went in to get a sandwich, the cashier seemed like a deer in headlights. The entire time he was acting sorta nervous and shakey; I almost wanted just wanted to pat him on the shoulder and let him know everything was okay. 

After several minutes of waiting around, I got excitement when the sandwich was made. &#34;Here you go bro!&#34; Said the sandwich crafter. My mouth was watering with the smell. It was warm, smelled fresh and looked scrumptious! Wiffs of unprocessed chicken and cured bacon whistled through the air. 

After tearing through the door to my home, I went to try the sandwich. Once I sank my teeth into the sandwich for the first time I felt one thing: mediocrity. The bacon was cooked to perfection, but the chicken, along with the bread and pesto mayo, was dry! The sandwich was incredibly dry! Every bite tasted mostly like bread, so the meat to bread ratio was off. 

I might go back and try a breakfast sandwich, that&#39;s where the rave seems to be at this place."

We dined here at the suggestion of relatives who absolutely love Las Hadas and eat here all of the time. We were warmly greeted by the owners and staff. 

But my husband, brother and I all had very different experiences. Compared to our relatives who would always give this a 5 star rating.

My husband had a beef chimichanga and said it was 4 star. My brother had cheese enchiladas and rated them a 3 star. 

But my food was awful and 1 star would be too high. I ordered a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, chicken burrito and a crispy chile relleno. My chile relleno had cheddar cheese inside that was very cold and not melted at all. The sauce on top was spicy and tepid in temperature. The chicken burrito was also cold inside and missing the cheese that had been requested. And you guessed it, the cheese enchilada was also cold. I didn&#39;t return my food because I didn&#39;t want to offend the relatives. But this was the worst Mexican food from my perspective."

Eclipsed in ghastly hideousness only by the guacamole, it looks more like a fairy nightmare, or vomit. 

The multi-color paint job of orangey salmon on most of the walls, electric lime on the restroom doors, dark watermelon pink and grape medicine purple in the ladies room, is retina searing. Gift wrap ribbon tying sarapes, sombreros, various paintings, and fish replica cover the walls. Fake flowers and various other souvenir shop and  flea market finds populate many other spaces. The restaurant looks like a bad impression more than a vibrant and inviting dining area.

Maybe it&#39;s a bit harsh, but the decor is really distracting and unappetizing. I almost didn&#39;t go in, despite the neon open sign, the place looked dead. Thank goodness there was no live music (as advertised on the menu)!

The menu itself is overcrowded! So many combinations! I wanted enchiladas and guacamole (before I tried it on the nachos, more on that later). There is an option for 3 enchiladas, or one for deluxe enchiladas which includes sour cream and guacamole plus rice and beans.  I never eat rice and beans, but this option was cheaper than ordering the enchiladas and a side of guacamole, what sense does that make?!?  

As alluded to, the food is pretty bad. The salsa was watery. The chips were stale. The nachos were overloaded and soggy, you physically cannot eat them without a fork!

My husband&#39;s fajitas came out several minutes before my enchiladas. Unacceptable! The beef was chewy and tasted like teriyaki. My enchiladas were okay. I was shocked to find some avocado in the pale sickly pile that was passed off as guacamole! 

If eye-sore decor isn&#39;t a problem for you, try the tacos at tacos y salsas on Iliff, if it is, try La Loma in the Highlands."

That&#39;s about the nicest thing I can say about this place, it&#39;s pretty bad.  Not the worst I&#39;ve had, but it at least gets an honorable mention in that category.  It&#39;s one of those places that gets all the little details wrong.

Like most Mexican restaurants, they start you off with chips and salsa, which is to say stale chips and lackluster salsa.  It&#39;s not terrible, but it&#39;s by no means good.  We ordered a plate of &#34;super&#34; nachos, and then I had the fajitas and my wife had the cheese enchiladas (she LOVES cheese enchiladas... just not these ones). 

The nachos were also not terrible, but by no means good. Between the pickled jalapenos and the mediocre guacamole, they were so loaded with watery toppings that you couldn&#39;t eat them without a fork.  Even if the chips couldn&#39;t support the weight of the toppings, the beans kept everything nicely glued together in a paste that we almost finished.  I was pretty hungry, after all. 

The fajitas hit our table too quickly, but then we had a few minutes before the enchiladas showed up.  We were almost the only customers in the place, so I have no idea why the timing was so screwed up.  The fajitas themselves were... well, not terrible but by no means good.  So at least they&#39;re consistent.  The steak was overdone and not all that flavorful, but at least it wasn&#39;t tough.   The enchiladas were worse.  They were buried under a mountain of unappetizing slop.  I think it was beans, rice, and guacamole, but in any event it was the real star of that plate. 

Anyway, I strongly suggest passing this place up.  There&#39;s plenty of better Mexican food in Denver."

First we sit down to eat, and they bring this pathetic little dish of watery salsa with some cold, stale tasting tortilla chips. I would have preferred tostidos from the grocery store compared to these things.  

Next, we order, I ordered pork tamales with green chile and my boyfriend got a beef burrito. When my plate came out, I cut into the first tamale and saw no pork. I thought, &#34;oh, ok all the pork must be in the middle?&#34; It was not, as I kept cutting there was just thick, disgusting corn flour and some brown colored substance from what the pork was probably cooked in. At the very end of the tamale there was a tiny chunk of pork. I systematically went through the other two tamales looking for pork and had a similar situation. The waitress didn&#39;t once ask how we were doing or how the food was, only after she brought the check and we had paid did she look down at the mountain of shredded dough on my plate and said, &#34;oh, didn&#39;t like it?&#34;  


My boyfriend ate his burrito but wasn&#39;t a fan of the sides, I did not try his plate so I cannot comment really. All I know is I paid $7.50 for three small bites of pork and what was probably a box-mixed corn dough covered in some 505 chile sauce. I normally never complain about food and will eat about anything, but this was just a bit too much for me."

When we mentioned it the server brought a bowl of cold cheese and never came back to check on us again until we had decided to stop eating. I got my check and saw they charged me $2.25 for a side of cheese which was actually an ingredient they forgot to include with our meals. When we addressed our dissatisfaction with the food and the service they were not receptive at all and refused to take off the charge for the side of cheese. Not only was the food terrible it made my boyfriend and I sick the rest of the night. Just a warning for future possible customers there are much better Mexican places in that area."

Went on a Friday night and it was packed (for good reason)  we didn&#39;t have a wait though.  Came in and a Mariachi band was playing (not cheesy and really good).

The margs were great and came out fast.

I had the Chili Rellenos (crispy) and it was fabulous.  I ordered it with guac (which theirs had some kick), the rellenos were just what I was looking for and cheesy goodness, the green chili on it was wonderful as well.

My fiance ordered a chicken Chimi Changa and the flavor of the chicken was wonderful. He did say the rice was a little dry though.

I only thing I wasn&#39;t impressed with was the free tortilla chips (salsa was excellent).  They seemed dry or overdone.  Other then that this was a fabulous place with great and fast service and I would highly recommend.

When I try this place again, I may change my review, but for now, it only gets two stars

The food was decent, although the chips and salsa is not all you can eat as is pretty standard with most Mexican restaurants. Portion size was average. 

And now for why it only gets two stars: service was horrible. There were ten adults and about ten kids (can&#39;t remember the exact numbers of those, since none of them were mine, lol), and since we were having a board meeting, we were seated in a separate room (the room to the left as you enter the restaurant). I peeked into the other part of the restaurant, and it seemed to be an average lunch time crowd, and from my vantage point, I could see the coming and going of patrons, so I know they never got &#34;slammed.&#34; 

With such a large group of people, it does tend to get chaotic, but we had at least three different servers wait on us, and the communication amongst them was slim to none. Of course, with such a large group of people, there is an automatic gratuity tacked on to the bill, so it seems to me, the wait staff didn&#39;t have to work that hard to please us: they were going to get at least an 18% tip. Normally I have no problem with the addition of a gratuity for a big party, but I do have a problem with crappy service because of the guaranteed tip, When I&#39;ve been with a big group of people at other places, where we had great customer service, almost every single person added more to the automatic gratuity as a recognition of the great service. I wish we could&#39;ve subtracted from the automatic gratuity for this place, it was that bad. 

Someone may ask why I would bother going back? Well, like I said, the food was decent and I like supporting the smaller non-chain type establishments. Watch for an update in 2014.

Edited: the gratuity was not only for the base meal/drinks, the gratuity was for the sales tax, too! That is wrong in so many levels. (sorry, I was reminded of this when I was looking at a tip thread on the talk forum)"

My mom &amp; I went out to dinner because hey! I had a $25 restaurant gift certificate and thought it would be a cheap dinner. The fine print on the certificate was you had to spend $50 and then they add an 18% gratuity- i thought okay not sure how we&#39;re going to spend that much but we&#39;ll sure as heck try! 

First off when we originally got there- we were one of 3 tables, many others filtered in and by the time we were done deciding it was pretty full. Then it took fifteen minutes her to take our order and then people who had ordered after us were getting their food before us. Hey! We&#39;re hungry too!  

Then we ordered Patron margaritas- let me just say there&#39;s no way in hell they were actually Patron &amp; they were so weak we had to ask for another shot so we could taste anything other than the mix. It tasted like they put watered down Jose Cuervo in them. Very disappointing. 

Now comes the wait for the bill, my first mistake was giving her the restaurant certificate BEFORE the bill- so then it took 25 MINUTES to get our bill....umm did you have to make the ink? Then we get the bill and our food was around $20 but the drinks were $40 dollars!!!! I understand Patron is extra (even faux Patron apparently) but $12 for a margarita and then $8 for a shot of it!  I was charged $20 for one of the worst/weakest margaritas I have ever had. Again I know Patron is extra but it didn&#39;t taste like Patron and there wasn&#39;t enough of any booze in there to justify that price tag. And to top it off my mom was charged $14 for hers. They&#39;re just making up their prices left &amp; right to inflate the tab. 

I&#39;m almost positive the waitress just made up the drink totals because all their tickets are handwritten but I have never been to an establishment that straight up robbed me like they did &amp; took as long to do it. If you&#39;re going to rob me at least do it quickly, don&#39;t drag it out. I&#39;m sure they were laughing thinking &#34;stupid gringas&#34; and indeed we were swindled. 

The icing on the cake is the next day I go to chipotle with my bff and they have a Patron margarita on their menu for $6.95 and not only was it a stronger margarita but was actually Patron! What a concept.

The food was okay and worth the $20 we spent but the drink debacle completely ruined my experience and left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The service coupled with the outright outrageous prices (which they don&#39;t list on their menu conveniently) and terrible margaritas- I will not be back and I will tell others the same."

We won&#39;t be back. There are much better Mexican places in Aurora for a comparable price. 
 
First we went there for breakfast. The burrito was fairly unimpressive, bland and a bit soggy. We were disappointed in their main attraction. But we decided we&#39;d try again for lunch another day. I ordered the chili rellenos (crunchy) but again found my food soggy and bland. 

How do you make chilis bland? It&#39;s a mystery for the ages but their chef accomplished it. 

We have no plans to return."

That made me a little upset but they quickly sat us and apologized... after that the service was ok.  I noticed the other waitress, however, was quick and friendly and VERY attentive to her tables.

The buffet: get there early and it is great! Get there late, order of the menu.

Overall their food is good, not great but not bad either. Like you won&#39;t be saying best taco ever! But you also won&#39;t be throwing up in the back room.

The restaurant is charmingly decorated, with bright colors and a variety of Mexican-themed adornments on the walls. Shortly after you sit down, a basket of fresh-fried, piping-hot chips and rich tomatoey salsa in a little molcajete will be brought to you. As good as this first nibble is, don&#39;t get too carried away, because you still have to order from the large menu! 

Las Hadas was one of the first places I ever remember trying Chicken Mole. Although the state of Puebla boasts no less than *seven* (count &#39;em!) types of Mole, the one usually seen in the U.S. is the blend of nuts, spices and just a little dark chocolate ground together and simmered for ages until all the components coalesce. The version served here is exemplary, helped in no small part by moist chicken. 

But if that just isn&#39;t ringing your chimes, never fear. You have plenty of other options. Chiles Rellenos are here - soft or crispy! And both are great. Their Chimichanga (served with your choice of chicken or beef) is substantial and satiating. And if you go on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, you&#39;ll be able to sample their Carnitas, made with delectable marinated pork (and swing and sway to the mariachi band that tends to frequent the place at these times). 

After all that food, you&#39;ll wonder how you could ever fit in a Sopaipilla or even an order of Flan. But try, won&#39;t you? Really, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. 

But now that I think about it, that last line pertains to the whole restaurant!"

Last night, a few friends and I stopped in for dinner.  The restaurant is larger than some of the other places I&#39;ve seen in the area.  Plenty of seating for a large crowd.  We were seated immediately and as per usual with most Mexican restaurants, chips and salsa were brought out quickly.  One of my friends ordered a beer.  It came with a frozen, frosty mug that had salt on the rim.  That mug looked so frosty it made me want a beer!  My one pre-dinner complaint is that they charge extra if you want more chips &amp; salsa!  LAME!

The menu is HUGE!  Big selection!  I got a combo that included a chicken burrito, a relleno and a chicken flauta.  The chicken was moist and well seasoned and the flavors of the dish were well blended.  The relleno was also nice &amp; crispy... so delicious!  My only complaint is that I ordered it spicy, and it was not spicy.  Regardless, it was really tasty and well constructed!

It seemed like an eternity before we finally got our check.  For the most part, our service was good but this was getting a little ridiculous.  Finally, the check came.  If my friend wouldn&#39;t have told me, I wouldn&#39;t have known this is the type of place you take your check up to the counter and pay.

I asked the hostess as she was running my debit card if they can make spicy food, and I mean truly spicy, not wussy normal person spicy but SPICY and she said no.  She actually laughed with me as she told me how they get complaints that the food is too spicy as it is.  I swear, the normal restaurant patron is a freakin&#39; wuss... GROW A PAIR ALREADY!

Anyway, this was a great dining experience and a gem hidden within a sea of Mexican mediocrity in Aurora.  I am sure I will come back for some repeat visits... even if I have to sneak in spicy green chili to put on my food."

Even though they advertise that breakfast burritos are $1.50 you&#39;re forced to pay and extra $.45 for purchases under $10 which is HIGHLY illegal!!

They know that they&#39;re wrong due to the fact that when a purchase does come in under the &#34;minimum&#34; amount they ask if its OK. Is it OK? Of course its not OK! When called out on why, they either just say its the rule or remember that Spanish is there preferred language of choice. You&#39;re passing the cost of you&#39;re merchant processing on to your customer because you don&#39;t want to pay the fee for lower transactions! 

News flash, either raise your prices, or don&#39;t take credit cards all together. Its thousands of Mexican restaurants in the metro area and this is one of the many reason why this one just got lost in the shuffle."

Still, I have been eating there for ten years, and will continue to do so."

Pro tip:  the sweetness of the apricot blonde cuts the spice of any burrito.  

The servers are awesome.  I went here last year and came back the other day, and the server remembered my brother &amp; I.

The service was meh: when asked what she would recommend or what dish was popular there, the waitress seemed confused and just read all the entrees to me. Okey dokey. After bringing out our food, we didn&#39;t see her again until well after we were ready to leave.

The food: meh. Not bad...but not good. The beans side dish was probably the best-tasting thing...but I&#39;m fairly sure it was right out of a can. Even the pina colada was bland.

The best part, I suppose, is that it has a patio."

The staff is very friendly and have come to recognize us when we walk in. 

I personally love the Mexican style shrimp cocktail with a gespatcho style salsa that you can eat with a spoon. Tamales here are another favorite of mine as they are prepared in an authenticate style.

The staff has always been very friendly and efficient, always greeting us with a smile every time. 
Chips and salsa are better than some and we usually get a bowl of chile con queso which is delicious with the warm tortillas to dip into it. The bowl is huge and I always get to take the remainder home to pour over hash browns or whatever! 
We usually order the same things respectively and we both enjoy our meals. I have been there during weekday lunch when they have their buffet and the choices are very tasty as well as it being very reasonably priced. Chiles have decent flavor and the rellenos are cooked just right. Have tasted the chicken for the fajitas and it also has good flavor and spicing. 
Can be loud on Friday nights when the Mariachis are playing but not for too long as they tend to stay in the front of the restaurant unless requested to a table."

Yelp has done another good deed promoting this place.  We went to visit our Grandma and all had a craving for some Mexican food.  I opened up Yelp and began the search.... Las Hadas is what we found.  The best reviewed and closet to our location.  

We went on a Saturday night.  The place was fairly busy and the staff was inviting and courteous.  

Everything on the menu looked authentic.  There was a good mix of &#39;classic-authentic&#39; Mexican and yet still had the traditional &#39;safe&#39; Mexican food.  

I wanted to a try a little bit of everything, so I got the Las Hadas Special.  A cheese enchilada, tostada, beef taco, tamale, beans, rice, green chilie and a tortilla.  The enchilada sauce was great, the rice was home-made and the portion size was muy grande!!  Overall as a group we all left stuffed and utterly satisfied!  

For dessert we tried the xango and the fried ice cream.  The ice cream had the perfect texture and enough whipped cream on it to kill a horse.... the xango was interesting, hint of bananas and cinnamon, deep fried.   

If you&#39;re in the area this place is definitely worth checking out!  I will add it my &#39;Mexican places to visit list&#39;.  And next time we go over the river and through the woods to see Grandma, I hoping we&#39;re all going to be craving Mexican food again!"

My wife and I are always on the lookout for good Green Chili, so we tried their smothered burritos. Again, they were not bad, but not awesome. Their house margarita appeared to be just mix from the grocery store and a shot of tiquela. Seating arrangements were a bit tight, and they ran out of high chairs, so my wife and I had to eat in shifts while the other kept our kiddo entertained.

We&#39;ll likely go back since it&#39;s so close to home, but we&#39;ll only be ordering food to-go and eating it at the house."

The portions are enormous and not expensive at all. Two items with a generous tip came to $13,and we had leftovers. 

My only complaint was that I ordered my burrito with green chile sauce. I was expecting it to be covered in something like a green salsa, and what I got was a brown pork sauce with pork chunks!

Now order a glass of wine, and instead of saying it, eat it! This is precisely what I did last Friday night around 5:45pm. The place was already getting packed. A glass of Red Zin really helped me adjust to the fact it was that early, pitch dark out, and I was already ready for bed. But hey- cheers to Friday. I couldn&#39;t have picked a better place with its soothing light and upbeat yet jazzy music. Plus, get there a bit early and glasses of wine are $5 before 5pm! 

I sat at the bar. The bartender wasn&#39;t overly friendly. I would say she could benefit from giving a smile or two, however, this place was so good I can&#39;t even give it a second thought. The wine is by the glass but you can also go shop in this cute little corner where they have all of their wine by the bottle. I heard Tuesdays are where it&#39;s at due to their Tuesday night bottle and bruschetta pairing for $20 (after 8pm). 

All of their food looked amazing and I could smell every time something new came out of the kitchen and swept past me.They have amazing looking cheese plates and apps, and even mouth watering sandwiches. They are known for their bruschetta thouhg, which is exactly what I came for. They have about 8 different kinds, and you pick four for $15. It is great for sharing with a friend. It may not look big but they fill you up. I like that they cut them up for you as well, so their is no mess, and you can keep an impressive date face with whatever beau you brought in with you. I recommend the artichoke, the salmon and lox (sweet baby Jesus that was good), the apple and brie, and the prosciutto and fig (yum)! 

I literally could eat here every day of the week. I feel cool when I am here because the music and atmosphere make it feel hip, the lighting will make anyone look good even on their gnarliest day, and the decor makes you want to go home and get pinteresting so your living space could look just as cute! I cannot wait to come again. It is perfect for date night!"

Wine selection is *on point* - it&#39;s a great place to try something new, because you know that all the recommendations are legit.

And the GF bread is pretty damn good too. 

Other than the bruschetta, the wine list and ambiance stand out to me. It&#39;s a liiiiittle pricey for a restaurant that mostly serves salads and sandwiches and appetizers, but everything is delicious and fresh and pretty. 

The overall atmosphere seems very feminine to me; this is a perfect ladies night out sort of spot. The music is usually a little too loud for me (especially during lunch, for dinner it&#39;s not so overwhelming), but I have nothing else to complain about. The wait staff is so great. I recently visited and felt unwell and had to leave before I ordered anything, and the hostess brought me a ginger ale in a to-go cup!! So so sweet. I always leave Postino feeling happy and taken care of."

The make your own bruschetta board is my favorite -  yummy prosciutto for days!  Go there for happy hour which is until 5pm.  

Boom!"

If you&#39;re looking for the absolute best happy hour in the city then look no further and block off your Monday or Tuesday night because this bruschetta board and wine dive is killing it. 

Come in after 8PM and get a bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20. Twenty dollars my friends - get involved!! 

I&#39;ve tried every board and just about every wine. My favorite by far is the Zin. My favorite board is the spinach/artichoke and also the salmon and capers. They&#39;re not small either. These boards are mammoth - enough to feed two people.  Which, conveniently makes it the best date night spot as well. If you&#39;re feeling extra hungry, double up on the same deal and take one bottle home with you. They&#39;ll have to cork it but you&#39;ll walk away full on 2 boards and 2 bottles for $40!  Somebody, anybody beat this deal? No one? Anyone? Winner - Postino. 

If you can make it on a calm night then sit outside on their massive patio and ask your server to tell you about all their wines. You&#39;ll be surprised by how knowledgable all of them are. 

Postino, let&#39;s be friends. You have won me."

I&#39;m so glad I did! It was the patio that drew me in, but the food, the service, even the music was all excellent. I noticed Postino specializes in wine and has a killer happy hour deal for $5 glasses until 5, also on Mondays and Tuesdays you can get burrata and wine for a decent price (I cannot wait to try this!).

As for brunch, I ordered an open face sandwich with ham, gruyere, and an egg.  It came with a side of small cherry tomatoes in a citrus-y pesto.  My husband ordered a sandwich which was delicious as well.  I also recommend the tomato mozzarella starter.  The mimosas are good but I thought the bellini was too sweet.  

Service was very good, attentive but not oppressive and very friendly.  This is definitely a new favorite!"

Reasons Postino is amazing:

1. They have happy hour 11am-5pm and they encourage drinking wine at lunch.

2. Monday and Tuesday nights from 8pm-close you can go and get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. That&#39;s insane.

3. They have the best bruschetta I&#39;ve ever had. There&#39;s tons of options and they&#39;re all so incredibly delicious.

Always ask what the seasonal bruschetta is because I guarantee it&#39;s going to be amazing."

From the wall bricked with books to the (seemingly random) Star Wars wall art, this place had some colorful decor choices that left me scratching my head, but it just added to the charm. 

The restaurant was thriving even on a Tuesday night, but not so busy that we couldn&#39;t be seated right away--my kind of place. They had quite an extensive wine list, but being my predictable self I settled on a glass of rose to sip on during the evening.

Ordering the bruschetta was a no brainer. Come on, if you&#39;re given the option of ordering a plate of bread with delicious random toppings on it, you have to go for it. My favorites were the summer seasonal bruschetta which had cauliflower and a sauce that tasted like magic as well as the ricotta with dates and pistachios. The Brie and apples with fig spread was also very good.

If that wasn&#39;t enough, we also ordered all three desserts on the menu for the table to share. The sundae was notable simply for the inclusion of what we&#39;re pretty sure was chocolate covered corn nuts. So addicting and so tasty.

I never thought I would have a go to bruschetta place, but it looks like Postino fits the bill."

Great selection of bruschettas and all four bruschettas that we ordered were great.

Their &#34;Two combo&#34; which is pick two of three choices: a half panini (many different paninis to choose from), small salad (also numerous to  choose from), soup of the day were really good and fair priced ($10.50).

Desserts were wonderful.

Good selections of wines.

Negatives: too loud however that&#39;s the only negative and when the weather cooperates there is plenty of seating outside.

Very nice experience overall."

Personal bruschetta favorites: Brie &amp; apples with fig spread, prosciutto with figs &amp; mascarpone, smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates &amp; pistachios 

I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place as it continues to be my go-to spot in the city. With a chic ambiance, friendly staff and phenomenal food, I highly recommended you to check it out for yourself! 

BONUS: If you&#39;re in the mood for a late night happy hour or dinner date, stop by Postino on Monday and Tuesday nights after 8 p.m. and get a bruschetta board AND bottle of wine all for $20! Double bonus... they have GF bread options as well!

I took my Dad there to buy him his birthday dinner and it was such a treat. We tried the Hannah&#39;s field salad, the olives, the mozzarella and tomato appetizer and four bruschetta&#39;s. The mozzarella and tomato app was probably the highlight for me - just SO good and fresh, every note of flavor was on point. The brie, apple and fig spread bruschetta was way too sweet for me -- but what did I expect?
I cannot wait to go back for happy hour. The service was fantastic too which just made the whole night complete. Thanks Postino!"

Without having reservations I only had to wait 10 minutes- not bad. They even offered you wine while you wait!

This is definitely the go-to spot in the highlands for a night out with friends. Great, upbeat music, good finger foods, and the vibe here makes you feel as if you&#39;re in a big city and ready for a night out on the town! 

Food was good, I had the bruschetta board and my favorite was the green apples and fig. Recommended to us by the waitress, it was the best bruschetta on the whole board! We also got the regular bruschetta- not my favorite as I thought it was not very full of flavor compared to other bruschettas we tries. 

I recommend coming here during happy hour- wines are only $5 then! Otherwise they range from $9- $12."

This place earns 5 stars.  Portion sizes are HUGE on the panini sandwiches, and they&#39;re like $10.  Get here before 5PM and you can get yourself a 32oz craft beer for $5.  That&#39;s one heck of a deal in my book.

Beyond the food pricing and sizing, Postino&#39;s also has a cool atmosphere to it.  They play trendy music and have a really nice ambiance.  Sit out on the patio and kick back.  They heat lamps outside for when it&#39;s cold out.

When you go, obviously you have to get the bruschetta. They have a bunch to choose from, they are all great.

I&#39;ve also had cheese/charcuterie plates here and they all hit the spot. Big portions too.

We had a super patient waitress who came back to our table multiple times to check if we were ready to order (many time we were not). She suggested buying the bottle of wine rather than individual glasses because 1 bottle gets you 4 glasses for the price of 3. If you come before 5PM, glasses of wine are $5 each which is @ least a 50% discount. If you come after 8PM, bottles are $20. We got a nice Riesling that they put on ice for us at the table. They don&#39;t have a private parking lot so you&#39;ll have to find street marking (no meters). The interior decor of this place is very unique, modern and trendy. They played some Snoop Dog and Soul for Real while I was here (interesting!). I tried 4 types of bruschetta for $14. They included:

1. Brie &amp; Apples with Fig Spread
2. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula &amp; Tomato (my personal favorite because of all the tomato, the flavor was most closely like original bruschetta)
3. the seasonal bruschetta with an orange roasted pepper sauce and cauliflower 
4. Smoked Salmon with Pesto

I also tried the sunshine daydream salad for $10 (fresh greens with cashews, bacon, grilled corn, green beans, goat cheese, cucumbers, olives, and radish with herb vinaigrette). I loved the cucumbers and corn. The salad was a 6-7/10. We asked for recommendations with the paninis and went with what our waiter said was the restaurants&#39; favorite: chicken and mozzarella. You can pick ciabatta bread or focaccia bread. Our waitress said she liked focaccia better so we went with her pick. Parts of the sandwich were super salty (I think it was spots where they just sprinkled more salt than others). I loved the large chunk of mozzarella cheese inside but it definitely wasn&#39;t my favorite dish of the night."

The steal that will keep you coming back is $5 glasses of wine until 5pm.  This is quite possibly the cheapest drink in Denver.  This is not just on select wines, this deal applies to the entire wine list.  

Postino has a large and inviting outdoor patio that can easily work for two tops as well as large groups.  I could easily spend a sunny afternoon sipping wine on this patio.  

Their wine list has a nice variety and has a little something for every palette.  I enjoyed two glasses of white wine and was pleased with the recommendation from our server as well as the grassy Chardonnay I ordered. 

Now for the hiccup:

I was not a huge fan of the Bruschetta ($14) like all the other Yelpers have raved about.  The problems start with the unnecessarily thick slices of bread, the bread is good quality bread however it&#39;s sliced too thick and difficult to eat.  The flavor combinations range from classic to more creative.  

The tomato, mozzarella and basil combination was nice however it lacked flavor; I would have preferred heirloom tomato&#39;s for added juiciness and a drizzle of good quality olive oil.  The pesto and salami combination was lack luster at best, the salami was something I would buy at the supermarket pre-sliced and pre-packaged and took away from the nice tasting pesto.  The ricotta, pistachio, and date combination was better than the first two.  There needed to be more dates or the dates needed to be sliced smaller for even distribution and the same goes for the pistachios.  It was fine, nothing I would order again.  

The star of the Bruschetta plate is the white bean (puree) and marinated tomatoes.  This one packed some much needed flavor, the tomatoes were marinated with garlic and other herbs which made this combination a winner.  I would order this one four times, the other three were throw away in my opinion.  

The concept is great and I certainly love the wine.  The menu is limited in a good way and with a few modifications it could be craveable.  My hope for Postino would be for them to take more time with developing flavor forward (marinating, cooking, pickling, etc....) combinations and not just putting two or three ingredients on top of a piece of bread and pretending it&#39;s the best bruschetta ever, I&#39;ve had better.  I wish Postino the best and hope they can survive the booming Denver restaurant scene."

We chose several bruschetta on our platter...the ingredients sound like Tuscany: prosciutto, ricotta, figs, tomatoes, herbs. All of them are done on a wonderfully crunchy-soft textured bread that our waiter said was from Denver Bakery. 

We didn&#39;t get any wine, but saw dozens of people enjoying it by the glass. Their wine happy hour deal is $5/glass before 5 PM...I&#39;ll have to remember THAT one!

Our experience started out very pleasant, we were sat on the patio, and had a server who seemed knowledgeable and almost over attentive. 

After ordering a bottle of wine and an appetizer, the service seemed to disappear. We finished the entire bottle of wine and appetizer and there was still no sign of our server or anyone else that worked their that might have taken over his section. 

We waited a little longer, hoping to order the dinner we came for and at least one more bottle of wine...fifteen minutes after we&#39;d finished what we&#39;d ordered, still no one had come over. 

We weren&#39;t necessarily upset at this point, just annoyed that we had come for dinner and would have to go somewhere else. We left our table and walked up to the bar to close out our tab and told the girl  behind the bar, &#34;we&#39;ve been waiting for about thirty minutes since we finished our wine and appetizer and no one has come over, can we go ahead and just close out&#34;. 

It&#39;s at this point that we became upset as the employee started mocking us and joking that no one had come over I guess thinking that we were kidding or joking with her. My partner and I kinda looked at each other like is this happening? She continued doing what she was doing and didn&#39;t get us the bill so we asked again. 

She kept making jokes and this is when my partner kinda lost his cool and in a raised voiced demanded that we get the bill so we could leave. The manager must have been standing near as before I knew it he was asking what was wrong and we tried to iterate our story as the girl behind the bar kept going with her jokes.

The manager moved us away from the bar (and customers) and we told him what was going on, he very genuinely apologized, comped our bill, and offered for us to sit down and finish the meal we&#39;d set out for. Despite his amenable response I still get stirred up thinking about the girl behind the bar and the whole experience up until this point. We went ahead and left as the experience had already become irreversible."

Every day, including Saturday / Sunday brunch!  I&#39;m pretty much in love with this place right now; every food dish I saw come past me looked amaze-balls, so get here and check it out (ideally before 5pm).  

Went for brunch.  Brunch was awesome.  Pitchers are 32oz, so by my math that&#39;s $2.50 a beer...and it&#39;s not PBR.  We shared a pitcher of Funkwerks Raspberry Provincial, which normally runs ~$7 for 12oz.  If wine is more your style, they have a very nice, slightly quirky wine list.  

For food, they have a full brunch menu until 1pm on Saturday / Sunday, in addition to their regular menu.  We went with 1/2 salad / 1/2 panini for $10.  Puts Panera to shame...  We also started with bruschetta...don&#39;t skip that part.  Our favorites were the prosciutto / fig / mascarpone and ricotta / dates / pistachios...I plan to go back and try them all.  You may initially balk at $14 for bruschetta...but these are hearty, unique, and worth every penny.  

On Mondays and Tuesdays, they take their bruschetta game a serious step further; any bottle of wine and a full board of bruschetta for only $20!"

The wine was good when served correctly and apps were great. The staff kept mixing our wines by pouring different wine in our glasses that were half drank and kept trying to clear our app plates before apps came out. We started to feel like they wanted our table but decided to try to ignore it and enjoy our company. Don&#39;t come for a long stay as it is clear they like to turn tables.

If you like wine (cheap but pretty good wine), come here. Until 5pm, each wine is only $5 and they have quite a bit of choices from Riesling to Chardonnay to Rose. That already is a great start to the perfect evening out with your girls or guys or date or family or whatever. 

The bruschetta. omg........so many varieties so many choices!! Each one comes with 4 types of toppings and each topping has around 3 pieces to share. The most notable ones were salmon pesto, apple and brie, and bacon and tomato. We had 3 girls and we shared two plates of bruschetta and also a chicken mozzerella panini. The panini is huge and they were nice and cut it into 3 pieces for us so it was perfect for sharing. We were pretty stuffed by the end and only paid around $21 each before tip. 

I also must commend Postino on their service. Many different people came up multiple times to clean our table and also came to fill our waters. It was like magic, water cup was always full. Our waiter was lovely and even put wine on hold for us since it was going to turn 5pm soon. 

Perfect evening and delicious food. I love girls night =)"
postino-lohi-denver-7,Jack K.,HhA0S6P-bgNwR3HQjd4d9Q,"Denver, CO",1,1,1,136,113,csNONDkmFfVzQkA-ZVng0w,5.0,2016-02-12,"When I first moved away from my home town, it was to the Phoenix area, which is where Postino hails from. I think they have (had) 3-4 locations in the Phoenix area and it was one of my go-to spots. So naturally I was pretty pumped when I heard they were coming to Denver. It took me longer than I had hoped, but I finally was able to make it there this week.

Bottom line, you should go check out Postino. It&#39;s in the LoHi neighborhood, which is one of my favorite places in Denver anyway, and I have to say that I like it even more than the original Phoenix locations. 

We went on Monday night, a little later in the evening, and they were running a special &#34;$20 Board &amp; Bottle.&#34; Now, for those that aren&#39;t familiar with Postino, their specialty is Artisan Bruschetta. They have like 10-12 to choose from, so the &#34;board&#34; they speak of in their special is a board with 4 different types of Bruschetta and then a bottle of wine. I don&#39;t think I have to tell you how good of a deal that is, so find out when they offer it and go cash in. 

I love the Brie, Apple &amp; Fig Bruschetta, it&#39;s probably my favorite. A simple but great one is the Salami and Pesto, their classic Tomato, Basil and Fresh Mozzarella is awesome. I&#39;ve had all of them, and while I like some more than others you really can&#39;t go wrong. 

Anyway, they are known for great deals on wine and good Bruschetta in Phoenix. They obviously brought the same idea to Denver, but the actual venue itself is better than any of the Phoenix locations. If you have a pulse, and you&#39;re in the Denver area, you should go to Postino in LoHi."

A group of us (about 20) came in for a birthday celebration and with a reservation, they were able to seat us all in the back room/area! They&#39;re specials are $5 glasses of wine until 5 pm and then on Monday&#39;s and Tuesday&#39;s, you can get a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta (it&#39;s a lot of bruschetta!) for $20!! Needless to say, we got a good amount of that special. You can order 4 different kinds of bruschetta on your board so you&#39;re not stuck with one variation. If you don&#39;t finish your wine, they cork it for you! 

The service was fantastic! Very patient and attentive which can be difficult sometimes with a larger group. The decor is very cool - books lining the walls, rustic wood lighting and great music. We&#39;re already planning our next stop in!"

Normally I&#39;m much quicker to judge and do not require multiple visits before spouting off about a business, but like a fine wine, this one deserved some extra time to marinade. 

What I love about Postino:
+ Bruschetta, especially the tomato jam and goat cheese
+ $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm
+ Friendly servers and bartenders
+ It&#39;s a short walk from my humble abode in LoHi

Not my favorite, but not a deal breaker is the large groups of drunk, loud ladies that gather here for happy hour. I get it, Postino was designed for women. The menu of cheese plates, bruschetta, salads and paninis is catnip for those of us with estrogen. Throw in an affordable wine list and we come flocking. 

And with the flocking comes squawking. Did these gals not learn the expression &#34;inside voices&#34; in elementary school? I&#39;m glad that everyone is letting loose and enjoying the offerings, but that doesn&#39;t mean the whole dining room needs to hear your personal business.  Wine doesn&#39;t make people quiet, that&#39;s for sure.

If you are smart, you&#39;ll arrive at Postino around 4-4:30 pm, take advantage of a glass of the $5 wine. Then stick around past happy hour to enjoy some romantic lighting and a much calmer atmosphere. Once the cheap drinks stop flowing, the rowdy bunch moves on. 

Yes, I&#39;m officially old."

OK, not really. My sister moved to Colorado recently, and we hit up Postino for board and bottle during my first visit. 

The decor is great as usual. I loved seeing all the books surrounding the pass through and trying to figure which were mine (Last year you could score a $10 off coupon by donating books). There&#39;s a great patio that looks over the city. It will be a popular place when it gets warmer although there were some brave souls out there during my visit. I was also happy to see plenty of bathrooms. I mostly go to the Gilbert location which only has two for a very busy restaurant.

Service was great, and I was pleasantly surprised to see some familiar faces from Arizona. No need to mention the food and wine. It&#39;s the same as other locations, and the reason I dine at Postino so often."

We wandered a bit around LoHi and stumbled into Postino. Right off the bat, the hostesses were friendly and welcoming. The ambience is nice, it could be romantic, classy or casual; something I love about dining in Denver.

They have a great selection of wine and local beer and I think a full bar. My buddy and I split a panino and a bruschetta plate. Wow! Both were packed with flavor and presented artfully. The bruschetta was incredible. Seriously, so good. Its also a steal at its price and could suffice as a meal in itself. What&#39;s more is that they have Gluten-Free bread (always looking out for my Celiac wifey)! For that, they will be added to my GF list.

On Mondays they offer a house bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.
Every day they offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer from open until 5 pm.

These are both great things.

But, good deals isn&#39;t what makes me a fan of Postino (well, it isn&#39;t the *only* thing that makes me a fan.) I order a wide variety of food - a cheese board, a Pub Board (soft pretzels served with chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts), 4 kinds of bruschetta, and even a sunshine daydream salad (mixed greens with cashews, bacon, grilled corn, green beans, goat cheese, cucumbers, olives, and radish with herb vinaigrette) - all to share of course, and enjoyed all of it.

Planning on eating a full on lunch with high expectations - my friend and I were stuffed after only sharing a generous serving of their bruschetta plate. And my expectations were exceeded. 

The bruschetta app is prepared on thick brioche bread that isn&#39;t unbearably crunchy to the point of cracking your tooth on the first bite. It&#39;s thick and soft with the perfect amount of toasted consistency. You have the option to choose four bruschetta toppings. We went with mozzarella with basil and tomatoes deliciousness, artichoke deliciousness, roasted pepper and goat cheese deliciousness, and then the burrata, bacon, arugula &amp; tomato deliciousness. But that&#39;s only half of the bruschetta choices! Never seen a bruschetta list so divine, and wonder why more restaurants haven&#39;t thought of spicing up their bruschetta options. It&#39;s expanding the basics, people!

The service was so polite, the place is beautiful inside, and there&#39;s even a fireplace and a wall comprised of books. Though the parking isn&#39;t ideal (I&#39;m not where is in LoHi), the food, cucumber lemonade, and service make it all worth it."

Finally, as if there aren&#39;t enough, Postino LoHi offers you yet another place to blow off some of that pent up office steam by conversing loudly over EDM in a dimly lit room to the splendid tastes of bruschetta and wine. I kid. Kinda. This place is cool. I tend to get frustrated at places like this, just because they make me feel like I&#39;m the only upper twenty-something who doesn&#39;t have my crap together in the world, but, Postino LoHi was able to cut through all of my insecurities by offering some pretty amazing food and drink at a pretty awesome price. 

The wife and I went on a Tuesday night, so we were excited to try their bruschetta board and bottle of wine for $20. We waited a while for our server to notice us, honestly I think just because it was so dim in the restaurant, and it didn&#39;t help that I accidentally laughed and blew our candle out... Regardless, she eventually came and we ordered the cook&#39;s choice of wine (or something like that) - a Spanish Albarino. I had never tried an Albarino before, but I was so happy the cook recommended it on their wine list - it was so refreshing and tart. Another cool thing about the wine list is that it doesn&#39;t matter how much each glass or bottle costs on any other day or time, on Tuesday nights after 8 PM, the whole bottle is $10 (when you buy a bruschetta board for $10 as well). That&#39;s awesome. And the wines all seem like they would be good... yeah, I&#39;m not a huge wine drinker, but I at least didn&#39;t recognize any of the wines to be the kind that the wife and I pick up at a gas station on our way home from Taco Bell some nights... So if that speaks to you, then good. 

The bruschetta was the best I&#39;ve ever had. They let you get 4 kinds, so it&#39;s basically the ultimate wine snack. We shared the Brie and Apples w/ Fig Spread (awesome-the brie was melted and paired so well with the tart apples), the Smoked Salmon w/ Pesto, the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, and the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone (my favorite). 

It&#39;s loud, but it&#39;s cool... try not eavesdropping to the sounds of dozens of people yelling over the music about their problems. Cheers."

then i ordered the hannahs small salad which was great and lightly dressed
the seasonal bruchetta was by far my fave: butternut squash, capers, almonds, ricotta 
we also ordered the apple/brie, smoked salmon/pesto, seasonal, and mozeralla/tomoatoe

I had the Brie and apple with fig spread; the Mozzarella, Tomato, and Basil, the Prosciutto, figs, and mascarpone, and the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, and Tomato.  All were fantastic, and the combinations were perfection.  I also had the butcher block (don&#39;t judge me).  The artisan meats and cheeses, Tuscan bean (hummus?), olives, nuts, and crostini were a great accompaniment to my Riesling, which was $5 a glass since I was there before 5 p.m.

The restaurant itself is in the former Denver BookBinding Company building, but it has been renovated to give it that LoHi edgy look.  The patio has a beautiful view of downtown with a fireplace, but if you must stay inside there are booths, tables, and couches to choose from.  The service was prompt and friendly.

They are known for their wine and bruschetta, and for good reason.  The wine list is well curated, and reasonably priced.  They even do a happy hour every day until 5 pm with $5 glasses of anything on their menu. The bruschetta is where it&#39;s at.  All of the choices on their menu are great, and the cheese and toppings are high quality.  My favorites are the artichoke spread and the burrata, and the seasonal is always great as well. I&#39;m not a big eater, and with the richness of all the ingredients, an order of bruschetta is always/if not more than enough for me.

Before I moved to Denver, I lived in Arizona for seven years and visited the original Postino often. I just went to their neighborhood debut night and can say it&#39;s already a well-oiled machine of a restaurant; definitely did not feel like opening night, except for the general buzz of excitement.

First, the libations. Postino has an exceptional wine menu, not necessarily in sheer number (they have perhaps 10 reds and 10 whites by the glass), but it is exceptionally curated. It&#39;s also the place to go to try a varietal you&#39;ve probably never heard of (unless you&#39;re a sommelier or serious wine geek). I had a Spanish Monastrell (red) that knocked my socks off. If you&#39;re in the mood for beer, you&#39;re in luck. They have a great beer program heavily geared towards local brews, of course.

Now the food. If you go to Postino, you must get a bruschetta board. No, seriously. If you go to Postino, you must get a bruschetta board. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s their secret goal, but I can&#39;t order bruschetta at any other restaurant because they have elevated it to (ahem) a mile-high (sorry) level. They start with sourcing bread locally from City Bakery. Then they get serious about the toppings. For $14, you get a bruschetta board with up to 4 varieties. I can&#39;t really say which is best, because they&#39;re all great. But really, get the tomato jam as one of your four. 

Salads that are more than just a bowl of greens? Yup, great salads here. Pick your protein if you want to make it a meal.

They also have some great paninis, either on ciabatta or focaccia. If you like tuna, their Tuscan Tuna will be your new favorite sandwich. It&#39;s like a Cubano, but with tuna instead of pork. 

You like drink specials? They have drink specials! Before 5pm glasses of wine are $5. They also have a great $20 special on Monday and Tuesday evenings.

Sit on the patio and enjoy a Denver evening at Postino. Cheers!"

Now that I&#39;m back in Colorado I am trilled they opened here too!

What I enjoy the most is the bruschetta!!  It is so scrumptious. Just taste it and you too will know what I mean. They have gluten free for $2 more. My favorites are salmon &amp; pesto, prosciutto figs &amp; mascarpone, ricotta with dates &amp; pistachios, and fresh mozzarella tomato &amp; basil.  Honestly they are all tasty. 

Wine- there is not a large selection but what they do have is great. Everyday before 5:00pm each glass is only $5.

Service- is always awesome! Friendly, courteous, attentive, without being overbearing.

Ambiance- modern, clean and innovative. Love the seating setup on the patio, along with the outdoor fireplace. They also have a great couch area under a chandelier that looks like it&#39;s made from old wine bottles.

Bottom line this place is awesome for drinks with friends or to hangout and relax on the patio. 
It is so great that even contemplated keeping all to myself."

I had a full-scale melt down when I realized they came to the Highlands and called everyone I knew!

The Monastrell wine was recommended by our waitress when we asked about the Malbec... I wasn&#39;t familiar with Monastrell but it&#39;s my new favorite!

The food is perfect and I could eat the bruschetta for ever and ever!"

Postino is a huge development in my happy hour playbook. In case you haven&#39;t seen from the reviews: happy hour. Every day. All day, until 5. $5 wine. $5 bubbles. $5 PITCHERS of beer. 

But don&#39;t stop there. You should eat, too, you know? The bruschetta is the star of the show. You can mix and match from a variety of selections to make a bruschetta board, all of which were excellent. I am partial to anything fig (so hot right now, fig), but there is something for everyone. They also do a soup du jour, salads, sammies - and - a killer meat and cheese selection. 

Wait for it: heaters on a dog friendly patio.

But key word is trying. It&#39;s a great space with great staff. Their lemonade cucumber juice with honey was amazing. Aside from that, wine list was decent-good with great happy hour prices ($5 glasses).
I thought the food was good. Just... I don&#39;t know just how describe it, other than a place really &#34;trying&#34; to find its niche. Their chefs seem to really be trying to figure out their direction with the tapas menu. They were good and some very traditional. Like mozz, bread,basil, Olive oil/basalm but the others were trying to be original just not landing with their mixes. And I bring up the tomato basil mozz because even that tapas choice was bland. Oversized tomatoes just over bread neither toasted nor super fresh with a lil basil and small amount of cheese. I ended up just asking for balsamic and cutting up the tomatoes with a little shredded basil then salting them up and dripping some of the balsamic on it. Then really tried to spread and smeered the mozz on the bread and adding the tomatoe mix on top. Much better than their bland presentation, but then others are over done and not simplified breaking down the flavors of the ingredients and how everything complements each other.

Overall, pricey but pretty good. 
Come here if you&#39;re in your mid 30s to early 50s to feel fancy and be &#34;seen&#34; in the Highlands."

ALL of the bartenders were so friendly and attentive and helpful! We ordered some wine and a butchers block while we waited. I asked if we needed to close out our tab before we moved and they just transferred our tab! I guess they do tip sharing here which explains why all the staff is ON POINT! Busy and full but everyone was so friendly and calm and collected! Great job guys! The food and the wine was nothing short of exquisite and fresh. I would say you definitely get more than you pay for and then some. The atmosphere and patio is quite the place too. Would be fun for bigger groups I think. Thanks for a great night Postino!

Took a quick look at the menu and it appeared to be pretty varied however my eyes rested on the Bruschetta and i looked no further.  Loved that there was such an interesting variety that I could mix and match for our Bruschetta board.  Perfect match for my glass of wine, well, make that two glasses of wine - take the edge off the anxiety of flying.

I ordered the Brie and Apples with Fig Spread (my favorite), Burrata, Bacon, Arugula and Tomato (piled high with bacon, yum!), Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone (love the sweet and salty), and fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and basil (just the right amount of salt to bring out all the flavors).

The staff as well as customers were smiling and welcoming, music was on point and the building is open and warm. The chef was sampling some new food for the menu and brought out a delicious Italian quesadilla for customers to sample, i know it sounds odd but everyone loved it! The owner Ray was there and was all smiles, telling jokes, and making sure people were having a blast all night.

Total joint at first look, but eat something here and be happy.  I&#39;ve had the burgers, fries, tots, fried pickles, cheese sticks (hand made?) and the meatballs.  Somebody must be using grandma&#39;s recipe for those things cuz they are killer.  And seriously, if there&#39;s an off menu daily food special... order it.  I got this pork sandwich one time that was just insanely good and another time it was tortas.  Portions are plentiful, prices are more than fair.  Service is great.  Rooftop is great.  The new ownership is doing something right in this neighborhood and even though I don&#39;t live in the area I try to stop in if I know I&#39;m going to be nearby.

Plan to return often!
Met with both owner and chef, great conversations about restaurant&#39;s history and families.
Decor amazing, an airbrushed mural done in 1996, by an artist that now lives in Paris.
Both of us ordered hummus, tanjines (lamb and vegetarian) with couscous, and the best flan we have ever had.
Give this Moroccan eatery a try, just west of 225 on Mississippi, corner Uvalda."

Right when I walked in it was empty and a lot smaller then I had imagined, however it gave off and cute and homey aura that I loved. The owner was super friendly and made small talk with me while I was waiting for my party to arrive. The place had been here for 23 years which really surprised me. 
We ordered mint tea which gave off a nice herbal scent which was enjoyable. We started off with the Chicken Bastilla, which was amazing we devoured so fast that we forget to take a picture. But the savoriness of the chicken and the powered sugar on top surprisingly made a great combo, and I loved the flakiness of the dish. Right when I came out we were worried that it would be a little dry but I was perfect, def my fav part of the meal.
For the main course I ordered the Chicken sandwich with a side of seasoned fries, this is not your typical sandwich as it came on warm fluffy pita bread and the cucumber yogurt that came with it was great. Lastly we ended with baklava and mhencha. Mhencha was so yummy I actually enjoyed that more than the baklava which surprised me.
Overall my experience was great, and when we were leaving they were getting packed so I suggest going their around 545pm ish, if not you might have to wait a little.
Def be back."

We stopped in and were charmed by decor and the owner. What a wonderful friendly man. Everything on the menu looked great. Mint tea was great. 

We started with the Middle Eastern combo appetizer. The falafel was good but the hummus was MUSHY and the baba ghanouj was pasty and tasted something awful. Really AWFUL. Bad eggplant maybe?

The chicken couscous was DISAPPOINTING. It had no flavor. Both the chicken and the vegetables. I know! How could it be? The vegetables were surely cooked but they didn&#39;t taste stewed. You know, the kind of stewed that seeps into the couscous on your dish? I think it needed some sauce to round it out. WORSE? The couscous came out COLD. I think they just prepared it the day before and then heated up some chicken on the plate. I mean, this couscous came out temperate COLD like straight out of the freezer. The apricot chicken was pretty alright. 

I&#39;ll spare you the..um..bathroom aftermath."

We got a couple of appetizers, the bastilla and baba ganouj. While the baba ganouj was lovely, the bastilla stole the show. I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough.

For lunch we did lamb gyros and seasoned fries. 
Every part of the gyro was perfect. The pita was warm and soft, the vegetables were crunchy, the tzaziki was refreshing and the lamb was spiced beautifully and tender. 

The seasoned fries were also excellent though with the appetizers a little bit too much food. In the future I would do one or the other. 

Overall, the entire experience was fantastic. The only low point was being too full and unable to finish all of the delicious food."

The decorations are lovely and the painted walls make you feel like you have stepped out of Aurora.

I went last night with my SO to celebrate some good times, and we were both blown away and look forward to coming back to try more items on the menu. Our first taste of Cafe Paprika was the Chicken Bastilla. A flakey plastry filled with savory and sweet flavors, we would have been enchanted if that were all we got to enjoy as we savored each bite. Next we got the apricot lamb and a Plum flavored lamv tajine. Soooo goood!!! We shared so that we could each get a full experience of both dishes, and they were both equally amazing. Lastly we tried their made-from-scratch baklava. It was similar to the Greek dessert but incredibly different as it was less syrupy and was served with a light syrup made of a combination of fruit flavors. Absolutely delicious!

The owner was our waiter and he was wonderful. You could easily see his pride and love for Cafe Paprika. The service was great, the food amazing and the presentation perfect. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try some new items!"

Vegetarian and the combination of lentils with cilantro was delicious and refreshing! The hummus was fresh, pita bread soft and warm, fries perfectly seasoned.  

I think my favorite thing about eating here was the cozy atmosphere and personable staff.  We were waited on by the owner.  He chatted with us quite a bit and made us feel welcome. 

Just a note. Tea and hummus is offered but is not complimentary, don&#39;t get sucked in!  He started pouring the tea before we even said yes, creating the impression that it was free. We said we didn&#39;t want hummus but then he brought it anyways and charged us for that as well.

As a child I have always passed this place, probably some odd thousands of times. I never knew exactly how it would taste, because it always looked empty. Turns out that I was always progressing through the neighborhood during their closed hours. Determined, I decided to give this Mediterranean locale a try. 

WOW! And that word is an understatement. The decor wasn&#39;t up-to-date, but it was lavished in a painting with a desert, clean floors and PACKED with patrons; some were regulars! As I walked in I was approached by the owner, who was quick, prompt and timely. 

I ordered a Gyro sandwich and this was some of the most exquisite, flavorful meat I&#39;ve had in a Gyro. Instead of the habitual square slices that I have experienced, this meat was cubed, which allowed it to be packed into the pita tightly. Absolutely elegant, and it was F-I-L-L-I-N-G! Something that isn&#39;t always common in this little mom-and-pop shops. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back for another Gyro sandwich very soon! Thanks for the incredible food!"

Now that&#39;s a compliment to the Mediterranean restaurant title. This particular restaurant serves Moroccan food too with many popular cultural dishes. I love to try new things and the I tried the Kabob plate which was incredibly delicious and so full of life. It looks similar to Israeli food but with more vegetables and rice. The Gyros are a multicultural thing, but this restaurant does pull it off pretty swell and smoothly. They are popular for their seafood, chicken, falafel, and bastilla. They serve sides of French fries too! They have a variety of seafood like oysters, scallops, shrimp, and fish. They serve their food with hard shell taco and with the veggies and fries! Let&#39;s not forget the amazing fact that they don&#39;t leave out dessert for anyone. They have their popular Moroccan cultured pastries, tiny, miniature cakes, bread with powder and cinnamon sticks. It&#39;s a good cafe which serves all these different variety of foods, snacks and desserts. They also serve their traditional coffee, tea, and chai. They obviously don&#39;t end their menu from here, these are just things noticeable on their chalkboard menu, I&#39;m pretty sure they have wayyy more stuff to sell besides my point, but I&#39;m eager to go back again and pay another visit!!"

For my entree, I ordered the preserved lemon and olive tajine with lamb, and I was pleasantly surprised at the strong flavor in the lemons, but they were not overpowering. All of the ingredients shined and mixed well. If you&#39;re not in to lemons, then this dish won&#39;t be for you, but there are plenty of other delicious looking items to choose from.

She lives in Hawaii and doesn&#39;t have things like this so it was a treat for her :) I found that the whole time we were welcomed and attended to by the owner. He was so nice. And pours tea with a very long, impressive flourish! I would say almost the length of my body lol baller status!!!!
   For lunch we shared the Bastilla as a app. It&#39;s like if you took a baklava, kind of, and put spiced chicken inside and without the honey. Or if you could make a Hot Pocket edible... This was crazy good! The powdered sugar dusted on top makes it look like dessert but it is something even more special :D After we had the Lamb Shank and a Fish dish (I think it was sole...) Nice portions, not too big and enough for small leftovers! Both lamb and fish were just so tender and full of hearty flavor.

It was clean, well lit and quiet.  The falafel was really good, and I normally don&#39;t like falafel.

The meh: Nothing had much flavor.  The gyro meat was dry.  The hummus, baba ganoush and tziki sauce all tasted about the same.  EVERYTHING had too much cinnamon on it.  It wasn&#39;t a little bit for an exotic flavor boost, but saturated the rice, the potatoes, the meat, and I believe it might have been sprinkled on the hummus and ganoush.  I think the cinnamon could have been balanced with salt, which was sorely lacking in everything and not readily availble on the table.  

All in all, a mediocre experience.  I&#39;d drive the distance and go to Jerusalem&#39;s over by DU if given the choice."

My wife usually orders the tangine dishes which burst with flavor. I usually order the kabobs. 

We have yet to be disappointed. They vegetables they use are fresh. They make their own hummus, which is mouth watering. 

One of their best dishes is the apricot lamb. They do not use canned apricot and you can taste the difference.

Keeping that in mind, I&#39;m about to oversell the crap out of this. If you don&#39;t want to chance overhyping yourself, suffice it to say that this place is absolutely worth trying, and consider it a summary of the below that the food was marvelous and deserving of the five-star rating.]

Now, as for the food... Where do I begin? We started with a combo appetizer. It included babaganuj, falafel, and hummus, served with slices of pita. All of it was phenomenal. Very savory and flavorful. I had to stop myself from eating too much and not leaving room for the main course.
For my entree, I ordered the Apricot Lamb, which came with soup before the meal. The soup was a type of lentil soup, but I didn&#39;t quite catch what exactly. In any case, it was delicious. I could have gone home with several buckets worth and been overjoyed.
And the lamb? Oh... I never thought I could ever come across food that was so delicious I cried, but this came real close. I got emotional, it was so delicious.

I will be returning on countless occasions."

I started off with baba ghanouj and pita bread for appetizers and they were both very tasty.

I ordered the lamb &#34;tajine&#34; (sp?) with garbanzo beans &amp; potatoes, served over rice. It came with a selection of soup or salad, and I chose to try the soup. The soup, which was cooked with garbanzo beans, lentils, tomato sauce and basmati rice, was very delicious. 

The lamb tajine was cooked to perfection; the meat was very tender that it fell of the bone easily. Together with the flavor of garbanzo beans, potatoes, spices, and basmati rice pilaf, it tasted amazingly well.

I certainly recommend this place to groups and families."

The chicken bastilla is my new favorite food; the flavor combination is odd to a Western palate but so good!

Perfectly cooked lamb on top of a bed of rice pilaf, with a giant piece of pita bread on the side. If I wasn&#39;t so full I could have eaten more!

I was coming to try the Bastilla so I decided to order two appetizers to make it more of a meal.  The other thing I ordered was the hummus/baba ganouj/falafel combination platter.  Service was very friendly, though I felt a little like a was being shamed for not ordering a drink (trying to stick to water more these days for health reasons) as both the server and the owner pushed to try to get me to order the mint tea.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good, but please take &#34;No thanks, just water&#34; for an answer!

The Bastilla was everything I had hoped it would be - tender marinated chicken mixed with eggs and nuts wrapped up in flaky Filo dough like a savory Mediterranean quiche, topped with sugar and cinnamon.  It was absolutely fantastic! 

The combo platter unfortunately did not fare as well.  The falafel was actually one of the better I&#39;ve tried (had a unique greenish tint and herby flavor), but I can&#39;t comment much on that since I don&#39;t particularly like falafel.  The baba ganouj was just okay - it had a nice smokey flavor but lacked the richness and nuttiness I&#39;ve enjoyed at other establishments.  I was neutral on the pita as well - it was warm and soft but seemed to be of the pre-made variety.  The hummus, unfortunately, was just plain bad.  It was watery and almost completely flavorless.  Seriously, I&#39;ve gotten better hummus from the grocery store!

I think Cafe Paprika is just one of those places where you&#39;ve got to dig around the menu a little to find the gems.  I will definitely return on the basis of the Bastilla - hopefully the rest of the wrinkles get ironed out soon because I&#39;d really like to see this place continue to succeed!"

We ordered 2 appetizers Bastilla and Falafel. The falafel is the best we&#39;ve has thus far (we tried several other after our visit here) For entrees everyone had a different dish. I had the lamb tajine with preserved lemons and olives. It tasted very fresh and the lamb was very tender. Others had combinations of tajines, pasta, the apricot chicken, and gyros. We also had the lentil soup (and again the best we&#39;ve had thus far.) Mint tea with everything! 

For dessert we had 2 baklavas, the flan, and the m&#39;hencha! All were very delicous, and by far the best baklava we&#39;ve ever had! Seriously we keep trying baklavas anywhere they have them and none compare. 

Over all it was a great experience, and will definitely recommend! Not so much for big groups maybe as the physical location is a little bit small but some might find that cozy!"

The mint tea isn&#39;t what you&#39;d get in Morocco, but I&#39;ll take the less diabetic inducing mint tea that was served at Paprika over the inordinate amount of sugar I eventually became accustomed to."

Some friends did a tamale comparison, between Yareth&#39;s and La Popular.

Yareth&#39;s hands down. I was actually not a tamale person until we did this. Their tamales (we got a few each option) were amazing, so tasty and dry like the desert.

I bought it an hour an a half ago and it&#39;s still warm! Not piping hot, understandably, but totally warmer than I would think for being made an entire hour and a half ago! 

I chose: potato, egg, cheese, ham and mild green chili (handheld). It cost a whopping $3.77, out the door. Amazing. There are lots of pieces of nice diced ham, along with fluffy eggs. I didn&#39;t taste too much potato, but that&#39;s actually great for me because I&#39;d rather taste eggs and meat (and cheese!). Their green chili is really delicious, and the star of the show, imo. It&#39;s very flavorful and has a nice spice to it, even though it is mild (actually the perfect amount of spice for me). My husband got some medium green chili to go last week and it is definitely quite a bit spicier than the mild. I cant imagine what their hot tastes like. But I&#39;m a wimp when it comes to spicy things. 

It&#39;s also convenient that this place is about 5 minutes from our new place. Convenient and dangerous lol. I hope to try lots more things on their menu in the future. Go give Yareth&#39;s a try!"

Yelp let me down for the first time. I went with the breakfast burrito with no meat, and it was just...meh. I thought the food would be great due to the reviews, but it warrants 2.5 stars in my opinion. The whole burrito was just soft and mushy - I couldn&#39;t figure out what was egg versus what was potato, and the cheese and chili just blended together to make a hodgepodge of mush wrapped in a tortilla. It wasn&#39;t gross, just not very exciting to eat.

The lady who worked there was nice, so it saves this from a two star review, but the food was just not up to par. I guess it would work in a pinch, and it&#39;s pretty cheap, but I would definitely not seek it out."

All three of the burritos had cheese in them and I didn&#39;t ask for that, so I had to throw them all away. Waste of my time and money. I&#39;m guessing this place is good, but I shouldn&#39;t have to ask for no cheese if it is not listed in the ingredients on the menu. Cheese is disgusting"

Breakfast burritos dominate a good 1/4th of the menu so what the hey... &#34;Yes, a breakfast burrito w/ chicharrones and hot chile  please&#34;. The nice senora went from counter to kitchen and back again in a minute or two and a hot to the touch chubby little burrito in foil was in my hands (so hot that I could still feel the heat through the five paper napkins she wrapped it with!). Well, not really &#34;little&#34; but definitely &#34;chubby&#34; and heavy too! Good burrito. Not dry but really rather juicy, the chicharones were cooked hard so they weren&#39;t fatty, more like bacon, and the hot chile? Ummm not really but it at least hinted at heat (which I gotta say is more than most of these chicano mex style burrito joints wield). If I lived near here I might be tempted to stop by more often but the lack of seating, even outdoor picnic tables makes the prospect of slurping down a juicy burrito in my car and likely onto my clothes... well it makes a return visit seem not as likely."

1)You have a face
2)You are looking for a delicious take-out place in NW Denver
3)You are a fan of authentic Mexican street food
4)You are tired of Americanized Mexican food

Is that you?

If not, I&#39;d like to know how you are using Yelp without a face.

The menu is extensive, but sticks to it&#39;s guns. There isn&#39;t anything fancy going on here. This isn&#39;t Mexican Thai fusion - it&#39;s just delicious, authentic, AFFORDABLE, Mexican food. 

I ordered 7 tacos and a burrito, plus some guac just to check how things were going at Yareth&#39;s. How are they going?

HOLY SHIT THEY ARE GOING INCREDIBLE.

The hard shell tacos are fantastic.

The corn tortillas were freshly made at some point in the recent days compared to most places that have stale, old corn tortillas. In fact, if you are used to a place that is buying tortillas and having them sit on the shelf you probably wont even realize what that flavor punching you in the mouth is. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just Yareth&#39;s.

Speaking of punching you in the mouth, their x-hot sauce is xxx hot. It&#39;s legit spicey in a way that most places do NOT know how to do. I have lived in NW Denver which is now a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood for almost 10 years - and there is no shortage of authentic Mexican restaurants up here. 

However, I have NEVER been to a Mexican place that has sauce this hot. It&#39;s neon green - which is nature is usually a warning NOT to eat. I tore into the sauce though, and I was not disappointed with the heat. I&#39;m not sure WHAT makes it so hot, but it had both of my eyes watering profusely. 

I will be back to Yareth&#39;s, THIS WEEK, and frequently after that when I need a Mexi-fix which is pretty often."

I stopped in, and got a breakfast burrito (egg, potato, pork, hot chile, and cheese). The service was fast and the person at the counter/cook was pleasant. The burrito came out freshly prepared and hot in a minute or two. I couldn&#39;t believe how heavy it was  - probably 3/4 pound. It was a little softer than others, very juicy, and a little hard to eat while driving. 

Next time I&#39;ll just eat it in the parking lot, or wait til I&#39;m where I need to be, but I guarantee there will be a next time. The burrito cost was only $3, and was more filling (and delicious) than 2 burritos from Santiago&#39;s, my previous favorite.  I can&#39;t wait to try the other offerings here. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back here, even if I have to go a few miles out of my way to get there."

The burrito is hearty is lots of beans, meat, lettuce and tomato all smothered in chili. Fantastic! And filling, only made it through half before I had to submit. 

The price is very cheap (only $6.99) and the women who runs it is an absolute doll. Food came out very quickly as we&#39;ll. only thing they could add would be seating which was mentioned on a previous yelp.

I&#39;ve from the South and I have spent my entire adult life searching for fantastic BBQ. My favorite brisket is Fette Sau in Brooklyn that is very famous for it&#39;s BBQ. This? Better. I couldn&#39;t believe it. That brisket deserves all my stars. I could eat my weight in it. 

Other highlights:  entire table loved the smoked turkey (I HATE turkey and really enjoyed a slice), the jalapeno cheddar sausage and other diners also raved over the ribs (I only had a tiny bite and they were excellent).  

But seriously. The brisket. 

I also enjoyed the ranch style beans. I&#39;d never had that style before. Deeply savory and rich. No sweetness. Name fits them perfectly. 

The potato salad was also really good. My friend felt it needed more salt but I actually enjoyed it as is. More german style. Lovely potato flavor without being overwhelmed by mayo. 

Big fan of the condiment bar with pickles and onions to add just enough tart to all that savory meat.  

Thanks, Globe Hall! My first meal in Denver set me up for a weekend of great food!!"

It was WAY more of a dive than I thought it was going to be, but it was also a relatively fun dive. It&#39;s got a bit of a roadhouse feel, but it&#39;s also ACTUALLY dirty and disheveled. Now is where I have to confront the fact that maybe I don&#39;t like Dive Bars, I just like bars that pretend very, very hard to be Dive Bars. Is this what it feels like dating a Hipster?

Anywho, the BBQ is solid, but not amazing. The ribs were a bit dry, and a touch not-quite-hot-enough, but the brisket was actually superb with a ton of flavor and was nice and moist. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of their sauces, but that&#39;s personal taste - they were great, just not exactly my style. They also serve trashy white bread with their BBQ so that&#39;s big bonus points.

Drink selection seemed entirely appropriate for the type of place this is, and while I was visiting with my Denver Passport and only tried cocktails, I was very pleased with what I got. 

Huge props to the servers, they were fun and friendly and attentive and fast. Great folks without a doubt. 

In the end, if someone asks to go back, I&#39;d go with them. But I&#39;m not entirely sure I&#39;m going to seek it out. I definitely recommend going here just to give it a shot, but I&#39;m not entirely sure it&#39;s my kind of place. 

They do have a music venue attached, and there was a Steely Dan cover band performing the night I went, but they didn&#39;t start until after I&#39;d left. I can&#39;t comment much on the venue itself.

We got the two entree BBQ platter. Food was bland, and it was pretty pricey for how little we got. We couldnt even finish it because it wasnt very good. We took some serving trays to put our utensils and bread/butter on. After we took the trays, and had been eating off them, the waitress told us they were all dirty.

And some of the food is very good, too!  E.g.: the ribs were pretty excellent both times, with a good rub, smoked well.  The brisket is okay (last time it was a little oversmoked &amp; on the tough side, but serviceable with the sauce).  But-- I feel like the fattest fat American writing this-- it&#39;s hard to enjoy what they&#39;ve got when they give you so little of it.  

I had the 2 meat combo: two meats and a side of beans.  In the photo, you&#39;ll see 2 ribs and one thick piece of brisket, with the beans and condiments (so many pickles! like, just, handfuls of them! for some reason!).  All this was $16, which seemed close to twice as much as it should have been.  (I would have gladly forgone like 90% of the pickles for another rib.)  In the end, getting home and opening the takeout box, well, it felt like opening your Christmas bonus envelope and finding a Jamba Juice coupon.  Impossible not to be disappointed."

Rocked up to Globe Hall about a quarter to 11 in the hopes that they&#39;d still be serving and even though they had just about closed up the kitchen for the night, they gladly served me. In fact, the service was just as great as the food - exceptional! The lovely woman who served me went above and beyond to take care of me. 

Had limited options left, but everything I had was fantastic. Seriously some of the best ribs I&#39;ve ever had - fall off the bone tender, great dry rub, all around delicious. Also had some brisket, which was also excellent. Loved the potato salad as well, and appreciated the optional white bread, onions, pickles and jalape√±os. 

I noticed at least one review noted a lack of sauce - this was not the case when I visited, as I was given two different sauces with my meal - spicy and regular, both of which were very tasty.

Was surprised when we ordered the brisket that it only came chopped. That&#39;s not Central Texas Style. We asked for sliced but said the brisket was already all chopped up. I imagine before it got chopped it would have been fairly good brisket. You could see a nice smoke ring. But the small pile we were served was dry and tough. 

The pulled pork as stated in other reviews needed more flavor.

The sausage was the best part.

The whole experience from my first inquiring phone call to picking up last items was incredibly positive. 

The barbecue menu is simple, not overwhelming. Most of the meats are local, hormone- and antibiotic-free, and smoked to perfection. I love that the meats are not doused in sauce, but the  option is available if wanted. My favorite side is the non-creamy coleslaw made with apple cider vinegar, fresh and light.

Located in historic Globeville, &#34;The Hall&#34; was easy for our guests to find, with plenty of parking next to the building and on the street. The back patio, with tables, chairs, corn-hole, and smoker was a great place for our guests to hangout, eat, drink, and relax as the sun went down. We loved the &#34;dive bar&#34; feel, with the hall next door for live music and dancing. Prices are reasonable, too.

The owner and staff are the best part. I can&#39;t express how amazing they have been.  Having worked in the service industry, I know how important customer service is, but they take it a step further. Communication was open, honest, and timely.  Any questions we had while planning, were answered within a day or two.  Jeff, Faith, and staff have been welcoming, accommodating, helpful, and flexible every step of the way. They even followed up with us after the party.

If you enjoy a non-pretentious, relaxed atmosphere, BBQ, a beer, or are in the area, make your way to The Globe Hall for some amazing ribs, live music, or a cold one. They will not disappoint."

- Bland pulled pork with too much fat left in it. No flavor. No sauces available. I had to go the kitchen and ask for salt &amp; pepper. They have one large box of each.
- Crappy plastic flatware. This ain&#39;t Taco Bell, people.

That said I do have preferences for certain &#39;kinds&#39; of bbq. Having only been to TX a couple times I&#39;ve always thought that TX bbq was more like Dickies or Bennetts here in Denver. Globe Hall has changed my view on that. There meat is moist and attention is paid to the nuances in flavor and texture that make up the difference between good bbq and great bbq. Bark, smoke, spice, sauce, it&#39;s all good. One thing that really stood out for me was the brisket. As an amateur bbq-er I know how hard it is to get a fork tender brisket and the pit master at Globe Hall has nailed it. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.

As a band, there isn&#39;t anywhere to secure or stash equipment, no green room, no reliable admissions system. Lacking in power outlets on stage. Plenty of monitors, but sound and acoustic quality is pretty low. It would benefit from acoustic panels, and some booths to kill that army mess-hall vibe.

The BBQ is smoked all day and the sides taste homemade. It&#39;s a no frills setting but has a genuine dive bar feel and once you try the food you won&#39;t care. The staff is awesome, very friendly and always attentive. The owner is usually around and always takes the time to talk to people and make sure you&#39;re enjoying yourself. The back room has live music performances pretty much every Friday and Saturday night. So there&#39;s an entertainment option as well if you stop by on those nights. Corn hole outside on the back patio too if your in the mood for some friendly competition."

Not very busy but it was a great opportunity to chat with the owner and staff. All amazingly nice.  And it was the perfect opportunity to check out all the kitchy decor and the whole space. 
And then the bbq.  It was amazing. I had the pulled port and my pal has the jalape√±o cheese sausage. Both so tasty and delicious. And we got all 3 sides; baked beans, potato salad, and coleslaw.  All so delicious.  Great Texas style bbq.  Highly recommend. Go here you won&#39;t be disappointed."

First bbq place ive been to in denver that has the texas bbq feel. Long tables, squeeze bottles of homemade sauce, rolls of paper towels, and slices of white bread to go with the fine smoked meat. Great food, very reasonably priced, cold beer, and a nice crowd. Owner was great and kept checking on us throughout the night, and showed us his very impressive smoker out back. Very accommofsting to us and our 1 year old daughter for an early dinner. Cant wait to come back sans baby for some live music. Great addition to the neighborhood, and Denver in general. Thanks Jeff!"

Jeff&#39;s got something special in the works with a friendly staff, great beer on tap (get Dale&#39;s), a rad music venue (adjacent playing Thu-Sat), and some GREAT barbecue - ribs, pulled pork, tenderloin, and nice turkey offering for slightly lighter fare.

We ordered the pulled pork sandwiches, and one each of all the sides.  We sat at the bar since the only two tables were occupied.  The pulled pork was pretty good and the beans and potato salad were really tasty.  The coleslaw was weird, I&#39;m from Texas and I&#39;ve never eaten vinegar soaked slaw as a staple, lots of pepper on top.  Also, the sandwiches are not made as such, you get an ample pile of pork but two thin generic white bread slices and you have to make it a sandwich but you don&#39;t get a plate so you have to slop it on yourself from paper-very awkward IMO.  If you&#39;re going to do a Texas pulled pork sandwich, put it on Texas toast (fat bread slices) or a quality bun and leave the top off to the side.  The whole point is to let the sopping greasiness soak into the lower bun and then you smash it all together.  You&#39;ve got to get this right people.  Would be nice to have some &#34;greens&#34; too, but don&#39;t make them spicy. All in all though, the food is good and with some honest tweaks would be a good place to grab food and some music.

My only real negative issue is the ambiance, it smelled funny/musty and wasn&#39;t welcoming. Sort of like that grandparents house who doesn&#39;t open the windows often, not the one that makes cookies and smells odd but homey.  Like a dive bar in Detroit vs a dive bar in Dublin, you know what I mean?  I think it&#39;s the horribly ugly old carpet. I just couldn&#39;t get past that-made me want to gag. This place would be so cool if they would do a few things:

1) Get real on the Texas themed food, you&#39;re like 80% there and it&#39;s good meat.

2) Replace the flooring in the main bar room.  Seriously, find a discounted pallet of reclaimed wood, keeping all the imperfections and place it down like an old Texas bar unfinished.  You could do this in a day or two-would smell and look fantastic. Otherwise, I don&#39;t think I could handle this place again.

3) Have a real order bar/counter, again just get an old salvaged walk up bar and place it at the back with a big chalk board.  Have friendly staff taking orders, the girl look a little baffled on how to handle inquiries or suggestions but the bar girl was great.  A Texas girl would do you a world of good- big hair, big smiles, friendly. Heck, add in some deer antlers and such and you&#39;ll be set.

Bonus if you add a screen door ;)

I hope this place makes it, tons of potential. Check out the Georgia Boys BBQ house in Longmont for inspiration, they are doing it right."

When you first enter, the life might might make you faint. Everyone is so friendly, you sit in cafeteria style tables, and get your lovely and tasty barbecue with a verity of sauces on a tray, and you serve yourself and friends on wax paper, or &#34;plates&#34;. Sounds cheap, but it is so good, everyone there is now family, that you haven&#39;t seen in a long time and you want to socialize. Speaking of which, they have a dance floor and lave bands weekly. Also, they have a great dessert, a slice of pie with chocolate sauce on the bottom, a layer of banana slices, and whip cream on top. Talk about amazing! People around the state, even country come here, also, they might be hiring. Enjoy!"

I&#39;m usually a person that can&#39;t stand BBQ or even steak for that matter, I got invited to the opening by a friend and decided to give it a try. WOW! Best BBQ I&#39;ve had anywhere hands down. I may not like steak or BBQ but this place is better than any steak house or BBQ joint I&#39;ve tried in or out of town. The meat is always fresh and prepared on a daily basis. Staff is friendly and helpful, we ended up staying until close and got a few boxes worth of food since they don&#39;t serve or save leftovers. Any choice you get of meat will be tender and impossible to put down. The BBQ sauce is a bit sweet but add some hot sauce to the mix and it&#39;s great. They also have live music on the weekends that spans Jazz to Bluegrass. Great environment to get food or drinks. The hours are a bit odd but it&#39;s because they really do care about the quality of the food they&#39;re serving. All the sides are also great. I would highly recommend you try this place even if you&#39;re not a BBQ fan, they may just make you a believer. I&#39;ve had the entire menu and nothing has disappointed."

We came here for the first time to get the chilliquilles and we ended up getting more then that! Their happy hour drinks are fantastic. The house margaritas were delicious. Just right!

Plus, the service from the father was at tentative and genuine. You could tell he really loves to cook. He actually brought us out a cup of his frijoles chicharone? (If I spelled this right) and we literally had to grab a 32 oz cup of that to come home with us! We told him to put that on the menu next time! 

Tuesdays also is $1 tacos. Monday and Tuesday: try the al pastor tacos. There&#39;s a hint of cinnamon and amazing spices in those little !!! Love it. We definitely found a new authentic Mexican restaurant."
hacienda-camino-real-aurora,Toby J.,CvRvews21rwD9XUv5VOOaQ,"Nether Providence Township, PA",0,1,0,2,86,rtRYr2BHlZN7WrULFZoqEg,1.0,2016-05-30,"I feel about leaving this review the way I felt about the $2 tip I left our waitress--feel horrible having to do it, but would feel worse if I left nothing at all. 

Obviously, the service was terrible. It was a slow night--I counted 3 tables, including ours. One of the tables had the full attention of who I assume was the owner--he visited them so often I thought they might be getting annoyed, but they seemed cool with it, so I figured he was aware of his audience. Even came by our table to ask how the appetizer was. And it was really good--chips and guacamole presented beautifully on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes. 

I did, however, gloss over the fact that it was TREMENDOUSLY  difficult to order. We tried English, we tried Spanish...the girl seriously looked at us like she spoke neither. But we got through it.  Or so we thought. 

She didn&#39;t really visit the table after taking our order, save to deliver our kid&#39;s meal. When the owner came by and asked if we wanted a box for the kid&#39;s food, it was clear she hadn&#39;t submitted our dinner order--EVEN THOUGH SHE HELPED MY WIFE DECIDE ON AN ENTREE. 

So I tell the guy--sure, a box would be great, but we&#39;re still waiting on our dinner. The girl is walking by at the moment, he stops her and I say &#34;las gorditas?&#34; And she sighs, looks deeply embarrassed and apologizes...to her boss. So he asks us what we ordered. I tell him we each ordered the gorditas. He asks for details about how we want them, and I say, just like it says in the menu (which entailed carne asada). But he looks at me like I&#39;m stupid, and asks what meat I want, delineating my options. I repeat: just like your menu says--with carne asada. At this point, we&#39;ve been there nearly an hour and I tell him to just make it to go, please...explaining that our kid is done with her dinner and it&#39;d be a lot to ask her to sit and wait for a) our dinners to be made, and b) for us to eat our dinners.

I finally get the food wrapped up and it turns out, they only gave us 2 (two) gorditas. Not 2 gordita dinners. Seriously--how many ways can they screw up a single, exceedingly simple order?

I&#39;ll tell you how: after realizing all this, after I tell them that the order is still incorrect (as politely as I can, because I can&#39;t stand people who make a scene), they&#39;re like &#34;yeah...really sorry--that&#39;ll be $37.&#34;

I owned a food truck. If I ever screwed up that badly with someone their meal would be comped. 

This dude, knowing that we missed our dinner because of his staff&#39;s incompetence, and knowing that even now, after he intervened the issue had yet to be remedied, didn&#39;t even see fit to comp the incorrect part of the order we waited around for. 

And, oh yeah, the gorditas weren&#39;t as ordered. They were stuffed with beans, and the menu made mention of everything from the diced tomatoes and sour cream to the carne asada, but said nothing at all about beans.

I want to give 2 stars because the guac was good, but it&#39;s tough to screw that up too badly. Revisiting it via this review has soured me even more on the experience--I usually cool down after 24 hours. But these people were strident in their ineptitude, so much so that I suppose there&#39;s even some sort of twisted beauty in it."

The shrimp kabobs were flavorful and a nice way to start our meal. I had the 3 item combo and the shredded beef was tender and fresh. My fianc√© loved his fajita burrito and we both agreed the amount of food was excellent for the prices.

The inside however is bright and cute. My friend had the chili rellanos. She liked it a lot.  It came with rice and beans I had a smothered pork burrito. I was disappointed more menu items didn&#39;t&#39; come with rice and beans. The salsa tasted homemade. My burrito was huge but I didn&#39;t taste my favorite ingredient... love. Maybe in the evening there is a different chef. I&#39;m sure he followed the recipe just fine. I just didn&#39;t didn&#39;t get the feeling that any care was put into it and that&#39;s a definite flavor.

&#34;For your review of: Hacienda Camino Real

I would like to take a minute to defend myself... The second you walked in I was friendly.. You didn&#39;t see what was going on obviously didn&#39;t care that I was the only person running the front.. As in waitress hostess bartender bidder and cashier I had to go orders to bag up and send out not just tables not to mention I was answering the phone but that&#39;s not all the cook was not the regular cook and was running behind therefore it was hard to please everyone but thank you for this wonderful review :) have a blessed day&#34;

No, we saw you were the only person doing anything - mostly waiting on the table with two gentlemen behind us.  The manager - or whatever position she held - was doing the same thing as well.  

I am sorry if your feelings were hurt by my being frank, but I felt others should know about our experience.  I appreciate a heads up by others when my money and time will be ill spent.  Perhaps what you should have done during our visit, was explain, apologize, something.... anything..... would have been better than what you did and did not do.  

Indeed, have a blessed day!"

Well tonight was the last time I will try. I ordered something off their menu, pazzole, and was hung up on as the woman could not speak enough English to communicate and understand me. I even spoke broken Spanish to her, I know pretty decent spanish, as I have worked with Spanish speakers for over 5 yrs! and still I got nothing in return. She sat on the phone In silence for two minutes before hanging up. Clearly they don&#39;t need the business. I won&#39;t try again. Good luck!!! Unless your dinning in."

Ordered 4 of the best street tacos I&#39;ve ever had: carnitas and carne asada. And their happy hour is awesome. Definitely check this place out if you&#39;re in the area. They apparently even have karaoke on Fridays. But it seems chill, not like a crazy loud bar or anything. It&#39;s really nice.

Update: I went in for breakfast this morning, I had their Chilaquiles breakfast dish - fantastic. Oh and they make their own horchata! How could I resist."

Chips and Salsa to start (as expected) this salsa was the most authentic salsa I&#39;ve had since my abuelita (grandma) Luisa from Mexico that never once set a foot in the U.S. I proceeded to order the 3 combo of chile relleno crispy and it was exactly what I had in mind.

Not sure how to remove it from this restaurant. So I live nearby and we walked to get a bite to eat here at Hacienda on Colorado/Mexico and not to my surprise it had a wait time of 45mins....My party of 3 wanted to eat at the bar but it too was standing room only! we noticed that one side of the patio had a party of about 10 eating and the rest of the tables empty....so I enquired why and was told they didn&#39;t have enough staff to service anyone else..needless to say I asked for the manger( Angel Casillas) who listen to my suggestion of me going to eat on the patio and getting my food from the bar myself because they were short staffed. He in turn said that even though they are short staffed he wouldn&#39;t have a problem with sending a server to get our order and drinks. He sent one of his best servers Chris who was a delight and very quick we getting our order placed even though there was a wait outside we walked in as if we were VIP and got seated order the drinks and our appetizers and on top of it being so busy Angel stop by to see if everything was okay and it was perfect. His customer service skills was top-notch I even mentioned it to the president of Hacienda Darrell how impressed I was with the service today! On top of that the president of the company gave us a one pound chocolate delight dessert it was amazing and delicious. This is my favorite Hacienda and I will always dine here. Thank you so much for making myself my nephew and my friend feel like we was your VIP for dinner. I always felt that if you give great service you will be rewarded for it(so please never forget to reward the people that keep your company growing) and I have always been in this type of industry and I&#39;m so glad that this type of service has not been lost!

It&#39;s most definitely the best of the options we have for Indian food to be delivered in our neck of the woods.  The food doesn&#39;t disappoint, it&#39;s a little on the slow side when it comes to the delivery itself, but we do find ourselves enjoying a bi-monthly meal from here on the &#34;I don&#39;t wanna cook&#34; nights.

Our usual order is garlic naan, samosas, lamb vindaloo, and chicken korma.  I always have a gripe that things aren&#39;t hot enough for me, but their extra hot seems to be enough for Jess to avoid, so I&#39;ll take partial blame for that part."

Instead of garlic naan, we got whole wheat plain naan. Our onion kulcha was just missing. Chicken tikka masala was missing, replaced with another dish in a red sauce with a non-chicken mystery meat, carrots, and green beans. My saag paneer was replaced with saag with breaded fish.

So, these things happen- but when we called and asked for a refund or a replacement, they insisted that they had checked with the driver and we &#34;had everything.&#34; They offered a refund for only some of the dishes and did not offer the option of a re-delivery. 

Eat24 customer service was amazing and helped us talk to the restaurant, who ultimately authorized a $20 refund (which was not the amount of the full order). The food did not taste good, but, to be fair, these are not dishes that I ever would have selected.

Disappointed in the food, even more disappointed in the service."

I came here about a year ago and I was super delighted with their buffet food then, and today I was just disappointed. 
The entire buffet line was tasteless. The chicken was only dark meat no white meat. I am aware not everyone likes white meat but come on have at least a one chicken dish with white meat. 
Despite that I decided to give a try to all their chicken dishes and it was a total let down, to get a better perspective the naan was the only good thing I had there. 
Really sad, I was planning to turn this spot into my fav - now I gotta search again."

You ask how why? Let me tell you.

The SAAG PANEER looked and tasted like a half package of frozen spinach hand mixed with just a few cheese cubes. I&#39;m used to this type of dish whipped and creamed to a smooth warm consistency with a lot of cheese cubes. Worst Saag Paneer ever!

CHICKEN JALFRAZIE sauce actually had decent flavor. I ordered it medium spicy but it came mild. I was put off by the overuse of frozen mixed vegetables. Then I bit into the chicken...YUCK! The creepy soft and chewy texture didn&#39;t feel right which was visually confirmed when I saw the chicken was pink and not fully cooked!

Since when are MANGO LASSI&#39;S made with sour cream? Oh, that&#39;s not sour cream? Well you could of fooled me because this was the most sour lassi I&#39;ve ever tasted. Couldn&#39;t even tell there was mango in there. This Lassi was clearly spoiled and could not be consumed after a few sips.

I hate giving 1 stars reviews but when the food is inedible...... when the food is not fully prepared, raw, or spoiled... I have no choice. I hate that I felt bloated and sick to my stomach after eating this food. I hate spending more than $40 and getting ripped off.

I&#39;m sending bad karma from my aching sick gut to the reckless and indifferent owners who serve this as food. Shame on you. I hope your crap hole restaurant closes down!"

Pros: They had a mix of vegetarian and meat dishes. I was pleasantly surprised to have a nice, fluffy basket of naan. This was really a nice touch. The carrot halwa was delicious. My favorite dishes were the saag planner, vegetable biryani, and chicken korma.

Cons: They appeared to have a limited selection of dishes. The tandoori chicken was a bit dry. I felt that many of the dishes could have used more spices in them.

We came here for the lunch buffet around 11:30 and were disappointed. Every single thing they had out was cold. The rice was even cool and there was no serving utensil for the rice so spooning it took forever. Even if the food wasn&#39;t cold it tasted awful. The dal was thin, runny, and bland. The pakora was made using old looking vegetables. The vegetable curry tasted like it had chicken stock or was made using canned soup. This is the worst Indian food I have ever had.

The booth was very uncomfortable.   The table was too far away and the person sitting behind me kept on leaning back and pushing me forward.

The water was luke warm and tasted funny.  The Mango Lassi was good and I would order it again.

We started with the Coconut Shrimp with Korma Sauce appetizer.   There were 3 battered shrimp covered with sauce.  I didn&#39;t taste any coconut,  but the sauce was tasty and I saved it for the naan.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was average.   It came in a pretty metal bowl.  The basmati rice was garnished with 3 peas.  The server said to let her know if we wanted more rice.

The Garlic Naan was okay, a little flat.

The food was solid.  We would be interested in coming back for the lunch buffet if we were in the area."

Chicken Tika Masala
Veggie Biryani
Onion Naan
Rice pudding
Samosa&#39;s- For free after spending a certain amount.

I read many reviews saying food was hours late or never arrived so I was worried, ordered my food on a Wed night around 6...received it in 30 min so I guess I was one of the lucky ones! 

So now to the food...I got mine medium (spice level) &amp; it was perfect to me but I do love very spicy food! Honestly everything was tasty &amp; flavorful, not the best Indian food but still very good! EXCEPT the samosa&#39;s they were literally raw dough!! (See the pictures!!)Yes they were free, but I almost did pay for them til the coupon popped up! Maybe that&#39;s why my order was on time? (unlike other reviewers)

They would have received a 4-star rating if all my food was actually cooked. But the delivery guy was nice &amp; I did enjoy 99% of what I ordered! Would I order from here again? YES! But if I continue to get raw food, or late/no show as others have it will be my last!

So we fly into Denver and pick this place.  Call them to place an order over the phone.  Their site said Lunch Special is $7.99 with rice and naan.  We ask for the total and she states it comes to $72 for three things, two apps, lassi, etc.  when we ask why, she said its dinner price.  I end up telling her it&#39;s 11:00 AM how are you charging me dinner price?  We then go down line by line what we order to make sure everything is correct.  By the end of the call our total came to $30.  Yup, $40 up charge for some reason.  Ok mistakes can be made and we were hungry. 

Once I get there order was partly filled because they forgot make few things and it will take another few minutes to make.  So I purposely at this point don&#39;t leave a tip. 

I check my card statement the next day and saw two transaction... One for the actual bill and one for a generous tip.  Yup, they tried to tip themselves without my authorization.  Of course I called back and the same lady tried to play games until I mentioned my lawyer, my bank and a lawsuit.  Had her call me back by the owner who also at first tried to play games until the same threat of a lawsuit... Now they are refunding me the money, but I strongly encourage everyone to stay away or even check their bills.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was excellent, and I was impressed with the portion size.  For just over $10, I got enough rice and Chicken Tikka Masala for three servings!  The lunch special also came with two large pieces of naan.

The staff gave us Complimentary Papadum which somehow was a little &#34;stale&#34;, NOT Crunchy, or NOT Crispy, aka to our liking aka NOT FRIED that evening, or have been kept in a container for a long time.  *SIGH*

The staffs ask if we want the Vegetable Samosas either in 6 mini pieces or 2 big pieces.  We opt to have the 2 Big Pieces.  That is good, if they offer options of the kind of Samosas based on Patrons decision.  First came the Vegetable Samosa.  YES it comes out piping hot from the fryer but its was a little bland and under-seasoned.  YES its FRIED in crispy pastry with Mashed Potatoes with some Peas.  It comes with 2 dipping sauce, the Tamarind and Mint Chutney.  I like the Mint Chutney coz its a little spicy and very &#34;addictive&#34;.

Then comes with our order of Lamb Biryani and Lamb Madrash.  Hubs did not fancy or did not like his order of Lamb Biryani.  *SAD FACE*  The Lamb Biryani get a &#34;MEH&#34; and it lacks some of the essential spices that we are familiar with Biryani.  I guess Taz Indian Restaurant Biryani its just one tone, one dimension of flavor aka DO NOT WOW us at all.  *SIGH*

As for the Lamb Madrash, its SPICY to my liking, though they can be MORE SPICY.  Hence I think this Lamb Madrash is my next mission to compare to other Indian Restaurants in town.  YES, it comes out BRIGHT RED!  Maybe with the &#34; food coloring&#34; or the SPICES that they put in the Madrash dish itself.  For this alone, it received 3 stars in my personal taste buds and personal books.  Hmm, now I am intrigued on how to cook Madrash dish from scratch!  

With our order of Taz Special Naan, the Lamb that we opt for, came to a minimal at best, though its stuffed with Cheese and Chilli.  For this Taz Special Naan, I wish they could increase the Lamb &#34;pieces&#34; and make it more &#34;fluffier&#34; kind of Naan.

Overall the service from the staffs are indeed inviting and they answered all our questions in terms on what they offer.

May return when needed since they offer LUNCH BUFFET everyday (Monday-Sunday) though unlikely... but I may just have to convince Hubs, the next time we come for a visit, maybe that Vindaloo dish can &#34;win&#34; our hearts, err in this case our tummy.

They are in the midst to have things running smoothly, more like with a Bar and other dishes to offer during LUNCH Buffet in a couple of weeks..  3 stars at best.  Left Taz Indian Restaurant at about 20:30hrs ish.  From their Paper Menu, or TO GO Menu, its stated that they offer DELIVERY.  Taz Indian Restaurant is opened DAILY from 11 am to 10pm.

Above anything else, we wish them well in their future Business undertakings and may them prosper with many more years to come in this part of Neighborhood.

Mild was very mild, medium was just about the level of spice we both prefer. We were very happy with the food, which was ready for pickup promptly and tasted delicious. Price seemed reasonable. Two entrees will come to just about $30, add in 2 naans and 2 mango lassis and you&#39;ll be at $40 for two.

There was apparently some coupon confusion on pickup -- we had the $20 for $30 yelp deal and they didn&#39;t want to honor it because we&#39;d also received a free rice pudding due to the size of our order. In the end they did though, which was nice. 

So just a tip, pass on the free rice pudding, buy the Yelp deal, save $10, avoid arguments."

We (my coworkers and i) ordered chicken curry. 
The chicken was definitely uncooked/raw!!! 
When we got the order they apologized, said they would let the cook know and would refund us. Won&#39;t be going back again unless I want the risk of food poison. Now it all makes sense why all 3 of us had stomach pains last time."

I actually work for an Indian webhosting company right now, and always am getting good suggestions from my coworkers who are at an office in India whereas I am the off-shore worker in the states.  (Reverse outsourcing is interesting eh)

I&#39;ve had delivery from this place numerous times, many times during my workday from the home office, but last week have finally had a chance to visit the place in-person with my roommate.

The food here is AMAZING! The staff are wonderfully pleasant, and almost got the order right the first time; however the bread order came out wrong the first time. 
We ordered 1 regular naan, 1 garlic/herb, 1 cheese, and 1 roti. We ended up with an onion kulcha, and 3 plain naans. They fixed it right away though! The cheese melted inside the naan is SO delicious when fresh out of the oven! The garlic naan is also supremely tasty! 

Of note: they have _never_ messed up even the most insane online orders. It was only the waitress who decided to use her head, and not a pad and paper, to record our moderately complex order at the table for lunch.

They offer complimentary papadam, which is delightfully crispy and cuminy, to crunch on as a small appetizer before they bring any other food out as well.

The appetizers were great: You never can go wrong with a vegetable samosa, especially with tamarind dipping sauce! I also enjoyed a salad with their house yogurt dressing and it was also quite tasty and hit the spot before the gut-fire that followed. 

Now don&#39;t get me wrong: I love hot food. I _love_ hot food. Starting with the pickled jalape√±os on Nacho Day from first grade onward, graduating now to ghost pepper sauces and eating raw haba√±eros without even so much as wincing (a little sweat is good!) I have asked them to make me a firey hot chicken saag.  They did NOT disappoint! It was both extremely flavorful, as well as filled with the body-warming spices and peppery punctuated heat I love so much.  They also do a great Vindaloo of any style; I&#39;ve tried chicken and fish and the fish is actually better than the chicken for its flavor and moisture content. The sauce either way is great!

They have a ton of other things I&#39;ve not mentioned, as this is only 1 review; I&#39;ll add more later as I sample the whole gamut of their selection - I live close, and will DEFINITELY be coming back time after time to this amazing restaurant!

Go there and do yourself a favor!"

I have to come to the very edge of Aurora, Colorado in a tiny strip mall to get a true taste of India. I ignore the tear in the leather booth when the aroma of steamed vegetables and a dozen unknown spices flood my nostrils. Vegetable MoMo ($4.99) is placed in the center of the table. Evenly plated in a circle on what looks like a cheap Ikea plate, my eagerness takes over as the steam rises. The roof of my mouth quickly resents my impatience, but I tell myself, &#34;Worth it.&#34; 
Fifteen minutes pass as the Bollywood music videos play on the television before the main event of Chicken Korma ($12.99) arrives. With the first bite of the most tender meat and creamy, perfectly recognizable korma sauce, I feel elated that I didn&#39;t fill my stomach with only the Veggie MoMo. The chicken must have marinated for weeks with how easily my teeth tore into the flesh. The rice soaks up every bit of this bright orange sauce mirroring the color of the walls. From my three months of living in Bangalore, India, I never imagined I&#39;d find a place this familiar in atmosphere or food as perfectly prepared and accurate to the cuisine of a country half way around the world. To finish this impeccable d√©j√† vu, I order the most popular dessert in India, Gulab Jamun ($3.99), &#34;Deep fried milk balls soaked in saffron flavored syrup, served hot,&#34; as the menu states, and hot it is. 
The only obvious Americanization I noticed belong to the labeling under &#34;Drinks.&#34; The chai was labeled &#34;Chai Tea.&#34; Any Indian would laugh at this statement simply because chai actually means tea. I&#39;m sure this was just to make it easier for us Americans, but I giggle to myself, saying, &#34;Tea tea.&#34; 
Way past my limit of fullness, I finish the last bite of this classic dessert, gathering as much syrup as I can fit on my teaspoon. If this establishment were closer, my paycheck would be lost to this small business every week."

The hostess immediately set us up and was very nice and even kidded with us.   The interior is modern but retains a warmth.  We did the lunch buffet. There was a nice selection.   The vegetables seemed much fresher than other places we&#39;ve been.   They also had a nice alternative to the tikka masala standard and offered a tasty chicken korma.   Slight complaint that the flavor profile was a little blander than we would have liked.

I wish this place was closer to my house, but near my Mom&#39;s which is not too far away.  They offer delivery which works out great for her.  There was only one other table occupied at 6:00 PM on a Wednesday, but seeing the good Yelp reviews eased my worry.

The food is really good here.  I had the Lamb Korma spiced medium and it was truly tasty and no ghee floating around.  My Mom ordered the Bharta Makhani     (eggplant dish) which even though my Mom ordered mild had plenty of flavor and a great constancy.  We also ordered the Taz Naan (which gives you a choice of three fillings) we did cheese, garlic, and lamb... again very good and not greasy.  I also had a cup of hot chai tea which went well with the meal.

All around great Indian food (I need to try the Nepalese someday) and where Indian Restaurants have been lacking in my neighborhood, this one will be worth the 15-20 min drive...and again I am jealous for my Mom who is within delivery area.

Definitely check this place out!  So much more for me to try on the menu....I went with my favorite of Lamb Korma and they did not disappoint."

My husband and I found Taz on Grub Hub one night when we didn&#39;t feel like cooking or going out anywhere (which is very rare, let me tell you). 

Grub Hub had a ton of options, but we chose Taz because of the high reviews and no delivery fee. 

The food was delicious! The Tandoori Chicken was surprisingly moist, the peppers were perfect. My husband enjoyed the Seesh Kabab as well. 

Not to mention, our order arrived well inside the estimated delivery window. I try to stay out of Aurora as much as possible, so I might never see the restaurant itself, but with delivery this good, I don&#39;t have to."

I ordered via Eat24 and wanted to inform Taz that the driver was incredibly rude. I am mobility impaired and provide clear instructions as to how to get in my building no matter where I order from. No one buzzed the apartment number outside the building as stated each and every time I order from anywhere, especially if my husband or son is not here to answer the door.  A neighbor apparently let the driver and his companion in the building. I received an email from Eat24 that the driver was outside my door. I got up and opened the door about one minute later. I heard my husband&#39;s phone ring and apparently, the change I made to my contact number last night after an unsuccessful order to El Costeno (they closed early, but the phone number on my account was wrong even though I changed it well over a week ago as I got my new phone).  On my way to the door, I checked my account and the number was still incorrect. I then opened my door and two men were there. I apologized and explained why it took me a couple of minutes to get to the door as I am sick and disabled and about the phone number on my Eat24 account. I went to reach for my food and it was withheld. The shorter of the two men rolled his eyes and quite rudely said he rang the doorbell four times. I told him that&#39;s part of the reason I state to buzz the apartment number downstairs as the doorbell is hard to hear, in addition to my mobility issues. I was then told (again, rudely) that if I ever make him wait again, I would not get my food and I won&#39;t get a refund. I was then handed my food by the second man. I then shut the door loudly.  The driver was waiting a total of four minutes. Had he followed the instructions on the order, it could have been avoided. My mobility impairment often leaves me partially bed ridden and I put the same instructions on each Eat 24 order as well as Pizza Hut, Delivered Dish, etc. to make things as easy as possible on the delivery drivers. I haven&#39;t had an issue with ANY other driver from any other restaurant or service. In fact, Taz has been here before with no problems. While Taz was my new favorite Indian and Nepali restaurant, I won&#39;t be ordering again."

With a lot of places hitting closing time I got on Yelp and found Taz and remembered it&#39;s very close by. They were also open later than I expected so I called in and spoke with a very nice lady and ordered chicken tikka korma with garlic naan. My food was ready very timely when I arrived 15 minutes later. The restaraunt was very calm, inviting and clean. I took my meal to go but am looking forward to eating inside there on my next visit. My chicken tikka Korma was delicious! The tecture and spice consistency was thicker which I prefer and it had the right amount of coconutiness. The only thing I forgot to ask or wish I was asked when I placed my order was level of spice/heat. It was a very very very mild dish and I do prefer a kick though the flavor itself was very good. The garlic naan was on the thinner side but tasted great! I&#39;ll definitely be going back here often!"

Normally, I am a chicken tikka masala addict, so I was disappointed it wasn&#39;t part of the buffet. As I sat in my pout, I begrudgingly grabbed chicken vindaloo, which I usually don&#39;t like. It took one bite for me to realize I am wrong. Their vindaloo is off the chain. It might be the only vindaloo I have ever had seconds of.

Beyond the awesome vindaloo, they gave me a huge portion of some of the best naan I have ever had. They also had excellent dal makhani, which other places in the area tend to make taste like red chili. I also generally think gulab jamun is gross, but these were buttery and had the most balanced honey on them. So good!

I am only giving them a 4 because the saag was lacking the paneer and the lack of tikka masala. 

I look forward to ordering take out from them in the future.

Now, I am going to the gym."

All of it was mild and delicious, although I would have liked a dessert option or a red meat option included.  The menu is incredible.

Place was empty - was seated quickly - waiter (?) was very friendly and helpful with suggestions.  I ordered the Butter Chicken and an order of garlic naan.  What surprised me was that he did not ask for a hotness scale.  Food came out relatively quick.  The naan was delicious.  However the Butter Chicken was a little on the bland side - maybe next time I will ask them to kick it up a notch in heat.  The portion size was large enough so I had lunch for the next day.  An added plus - they deliver to my abode!

Personally, I always like to start my meal with an order of Momo. Originating with the Newari people from the area around Kathmandu, these dumplings feature either cabbage or chicken lovingly tucked into a white flour wrapper, then steamed to perfection before being served with a simply stunning sesame/tomato chutney. Alternatively, you can treat yourself to an order of the flaky fried turnovers called Samosa, or the moist fried fish nuggets known as Pakora. And who - really, who? - can forget the plump coconut shrimp served with fragrant cream-based Korma sauce? But make sure you don&#39;t gorge yourself too senseless, because you still have some choices ahead of you.

Noodle lovers will go agog for the Chau-Chau or Chaumin, whose wheaty strands are quick-fried either with chicken or seasonal mixed veggies. (Interestingly, many eateries in Nepal use the Thai-in-origin instant noodles called &#34;Wai Wai&#34; - available at many of Denver&#39;s Nepalese and Bhutanese markets - for this dish). Vegetable fans will be similarly enamored with Bhindi ko Tarkari (sometimes also called Bhindi ki Sabji) - chopped okra simmered with dried mango powder, turmeric, and the spice blend called garam masala until it reaches maximum succulence. Oh, you&#39;re looking for a little more heat? Try some salmon with the chili/vinegar sauce called Vindaloo - but don&#39;t blame me when you spend the rest of the night going &#34;owwwwwwwwwwwwwwww&#34; - I did warn you, after all. Another great item is the dark, decadent Handi Chicken (the name refers to the earthenware pot traditionally used to cook the dish) whose subtle notes of cardamom, cumin and coriander will send you into culinary conniptions.

I know you want to stuff just a bit more in, so why not finish things off with a little carrot pudding (Gajar ka Halwa), pistachio ice cream (Kulfi) or even creamed rice with almonds (Kheer)? Then you can plan your next meal there, because I know you&#39;ll want to return again and again once you&#39;ve tried what&#39;s on offer at Taz."

They are very nice folks making delicious food. We called our order in and it was ready on time. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Korma with a side of garlic naan. We ordered them spicy and medium, and they were both really spicy. I guess the spicy one was a little more spicy than the medium, but not much. Regardless, great flavor and lots of food for leftovers. Looks like they are applying for a liquor license. Until then, it&#39;s probably best for takeout/delivery. They still need to decorate their interior a bit more. They are running AMAZING deals right now, will be back soon and ordering medium spicy level next time.

After eating some leftovers I had to bump up my rating to 4 stars. Tender chicken and really rich sauce. So good."

Having living in the Bay Area for many years, which is famous for the most delicious Indian food.  I was very surprised that there was a little restaurant that we stumbled upon totally by accident would surpass our expectation.  The food was spiced very delicately with very little oil but tasted so delicious.  My children absolute favorite is chicken tikka masala and sag paneer, they asked to eat there for lunch and dinner everyday for three days straight.  For adult, please try their fish curry, and I have no idea how they made their dal but it was so delicious beyond words, even better than my-in-law in India. 

We found this restaurant during Christmas time of last year, this restaurant was just opened and the only restaurant opened during the Holiday.  We wanted to leave a review asap after getting home to spread the words.  I am so happy that they got 4 stars rating.  

Thank you for your hospitality.  Our children keep asking to go back to Colorado just to eat there again.  I am not sure when I can drive 1000 miles again."

First, the restaurant experience. They are a fairly new Indian restaurant to the area so I wasn&#39;t surprised that the atmosphere in the restaurant was not the best, but the atmosphere is not why I eat here. It&#39;s the FOOD and it&#39;s incredible. Their chicken Jalfrazie, naan, chai, and samosas are to die for. Their service is very on-point, very attentive without being too much. Very neutral, which I find refreshing.

The delivery experience was amazing. I&#39;m always hesitant to order delivery because my apartment complex has multiple buildings and most drivers get confused so I usually have to go hunting for them, BUT this guy was waiting IN my lobby IN my building. It was SO EASY. The food also came in 30 mins when usually GrubHub estimates an hour, so it was very fast! The samosas were still hot and crispy. 

I LOVE this place. Highly recommended. Ignore the negative reviews, I&#39;m convinced that they&#39;re planted by the competition."

I love that right when you come in it is full of Koreans which makes me feel i def came to the right place. I usually love going for lunch as the prices are only around $8 dollars pre entree which also includes like 8 side dishes. Totally worth it.
They def have the best naengmyeon  which is cold buckwheat noodles deal. For $13 dollars you get the noodles and short ribs or giant kimchi dumpling. This time I went I got my mul naengmyeon which is the buckwheat noodles in a icy broth with the short rib and I also got a shimmering soup called taro gookbap, which isn&#39;t actually that spicy with a side a rice... I was super hungry
The noodles were great and since I was sharing that I asked for another bowl they were sweet enough to give me. Another bowl with broth in it so I didn&#39;t have to pour the broth from the original one. However we found hair in the short rib which was gross... they gave us a new one and apologized and gave us free giant dumplings. I was actually going to give them a lower score however they were so apologetic and there service was actually better then usual hence it is four stars... but if I could it would have been 3.5 stars

Let&#39;s talk service - the staff was absolutely amazing!  After getting seated, our server came back with 2 hot and 2 iced teas. My older Asian parents, my brother and I were all amazed. That&#39;s top service that she knows older Asian folks prefer hot drinks and brings them out without us even asking for it! We also loved that she was so tentative to our food, helped us cook most of our meat, and even served us too! I rarely get a server that&#39;s willing to fully cook your meat at KBBQ. If they weren&#39;t so understaffed, I would give a full 5 stars for service. 

As for the food, it was good, but I wish I saw more. The meat was marinated well and the flavors came through. However their side dishes were slightly lacking and not as extravagant. They have the basics - kimchi, seaweed salad, tofu, fish cakes - but none of the fancier dishes - macaroni salad, candied sweet potato, or anchovies. The kimchi in the kimchi pancake was also very small.

I think for the wonderful service, I might make Silla my regular KBBQ!"

Sills used to be known for their cold noodles, and it looks like they still serve pretty yummy noodles! I didn&#39;t try it, but it looked good.

However, their service was atrocious.

Our waiter (male, brown hair, glasses) behaved disgustingly. He slammed our plates into the table and dropped all of our plates on the ground. He ignored us whenever we needed help. He seemed to not care one bit. And it&#39;s just unbearable. I was super disappointed with the way they acted.

I work in the restaurant industry and I know that there are times when work is stressful, but don&#39;t ever put your anger on the customers. The customers are always right, no matter what situation. 

And to make matters worse, when we got our check, him and the cashier in the front gossiped about us in Korean and laughed. Luckily for them, we weren&#39;t able to understand what they were saying. Let&#39;s be real, that&#39;s childish. Adults shouldn&#39;t gossip in front of the customers or in general. Very unprofessional. 

I hope this staff somehow ups their service game, because their service isn&#39;t doing them any good right now. Definitely not coming back."

Hands down the best &#34;Authentic Korean BBQ&#34; we&#39;ve had since moving to Colorado! Service was what you&#39;d expect from a Korean restaurant; not too much talking, place your order, your drinks come, then food, eat and pay. Nothing wrong with that. I wish they had more sake options but hey that&#39;s okay just order 2 at a time as each sake only pours 3 1/2 shots so if you&#39;re there with someone else do yourself a favor and order 2. I&#39;m not a big meat eater but my husband and daughter love bulgogi. The Mandu is just okay. The kimchi pancake is so yummy, you just order that. The kimchi stew is also very good. Piping hot good.

Begin with an order of the North Korean favorite Kimchi Wangmandu - large pillowy dumplings stuffed with spicy, fizzy fermented cabbage. The seafood fans among you will find the sultry, slithery oyster pancakes called Gul-jeon to be another good choice. But then, the tables do have those little grills for a reason, so why not follow your starter with one of their many barbecued items, like short ribs, squid or even beef tongue? You control the meat, you control the heat - hmm, maybe that should be their slogan. But hey, I&#39;m getting a bit ahead of myself. Don&#39;t forget that each main course comes with a metal bowl of steamed rice and an array of the ever-changing side dishes called Banchan - which ones will be waiting for you on your next visit? There&#39;s only one way to find out...

If the idea of doing your own cooking just isn&#39;t appealing, never fear - there are a number of other options to be had. The fish selection alone includes monkfish, cod, croaker, and a couple types of mackerel, so you&#39;re sure to find one that will push all the right buttons. Then again, you can&#39;t go wrong with the spicy soft tofu stew (Soondubu Jjigae), especially since it comes in four different levels of spiciness. Alternatively, you could try one of their casseroles, like the one with beef tripe (Gopchang Jeongol) or the one with large chunks of ham loaf (Budae Jeongol or &#34;army casserole&#34; which was indeed created for American servicemen in South Korea during World War II). With this many possibilities, the only thing you can be sure of is that you&#39;ll never leave hungry after a visit to Silla."

Silla is typically a great Korean restaurant; great ambiance, service and exceptional Korean food. We quickly realized as we entered the restaurant that it was very busy, probably unusually busy for a Sunday evening. Every table was booked and the host/waitstaff were flying all over the restaurant trying to manage the chaos. 
Seating took a while and we quickly realized we were being ignored by the entire wait staff. Menu&#39;s were not presented to us until about 15 minutes after we were seated. We wouldn&#39;t have had an issue if the staff informed there would be a 20-30 minute wait so that they can manage all the busy tables rather than trying to sit every single person that came through the door. Rather than that, we were rushed the entire time. 
Once we got our menus, we were pressured to make decisions on our dinner choices. The young waiter tried to snatch our menu&#39;s away and we were not finished ordering. All of us could tell he was very stressed and agitated. I even made a point to ask him if he was feeling okay. 
We remained patient despite all of this up until waiting for an additional 40 minutes with no response from the wait staff. Every time we pushed the &#34;waiter button&#34; at our table, we realized table 2 was ignored on the screen and even deleted. 
It&#39;s a shame that a restaurant we have come to love over the years provided unprofessional and dismal service. It may have been a bad day for them, and we hope that they can work that out with hiring more staff or even managing the tables.  We left after waiting for 45 minutes with no food and drinks. 
We anticipate coming back in the very near future, your kimchi ji gaes and bibimbaps are delicious."

First thing is first, the interior design has always just been TERRIBLE. It is not cute or quaint or attractive in anyway. It&#39;s just terrible. Anywayyyyyy ahha back to the good stuff. 

Silla honestly is getting 3 stars from me mainly because of their awesome lunch deals, meaning they have a good deal on their soup during lunch and I am such a soup girl. Their soups are always fantastic, I love the Yukgaejang and any of the Soondubus. Their Mool Naengmyeon is still on point. 

But other than that, there is nothing too spectacular that it has to offer. The side dishes are not as good as they used to be and I don&#39;t really go there to eat KBBQ anymore. It&#39;s overpriced for KBBQ in my opinion and the quality is about the same at other restaurants. But like I stated earlier, their soup is enough to always bring me back, especially for lunch when it is on the cheaper end!"

It was packed when we went with a group of seven that had to be divided into two tables of four and three (the large tables were newly occupied), and we suffered from the same slow service that so many other reviews report. Part of it can be attributed to slow staff, but a bigger part just seems to be they&#39;re understaffed. Saturday night around 7pm, and there couldn&#39;t have been more than three different people working up front for a full restaurant. They wandered to whatever job needed to be done, which you would think would speed things up, but nope. Need a host? Sorry, he&#39;s cleaning a table. Waiting on your check? No dice, he&#39;s cutting meat at another table. They&#39;ll get to you eventually, but whether or not you&#39;re high on the priority list is luck of the draw.

So why the four stars? Well, the food is damn good. We ordered bulgogi, kalbi, and soondofu, but before any of that came out we dug in deep on the side dishes. They didn&#39;t skimp on any of the servings and everything was excellent, though I will say I was disappointed they didn&#39;t have the little sweet fish I was accustomed to getting at Seoul and other KBBQ joints.

The seafood soondofu was tasty and plentiful. I wish I had remembered to put my egg in earlier before the soup cooled down too much to cook it, but thankfully I&#39;m not squeamish about eating it raw. All the meat was fresh and without too much fat. I only wish there had been more.

It was a bit on the pricey side, but I&#39;ve been spoiled by cheaper establishments. 

Just a few quick sidenotes for those who may not be acquainted with the Korean style: 

1. To get service, push the button on your table. They might take pity on you and visit even if you don&#39;t push it, but you&#39;ll be exacerbating an already long wait.

2. Don&#39;t be afraid to walk up to the counter with your check. They&#39;ll generally come to your table at Silla, but, again, you won&#39;t be doing yourself any favors if you&#39;re in a hurry.

3. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for refills on the side dishes. They&#39;re free and awesome, and included in your BBQ bill.

4. Don&#39;t plan on going here if you&#39;re looking to hit up a bar or club afterwards. The smoke gets &#34;all up ins&#34; your clothes and hair, and you will smell like a walking bulgogi. If You&#39;re looking for chicks/dudes who dig that kind of thing, go nuts. Otherwise, plan accordingly."

This is a small local Korean BBQ place, and the BBQ here is the best and most authentic I&#39;ve had anywhere. They have individual Korean BBQ grill stoves at each table, and you can grill your own food. They also bring out a bunch of Korean appetizers to accompany each meal, and at the end bring you a cold rice dessert drink, which is really good.

I have had Soon Tofu at many places and this one is the best in Denver so far because it has the most selections I&#39;ve seen, not only can you get pork, you can also get beef, combination, seafood, oysters.  You can pick your spiciness too, which I love.  Hey, after all, the only thing I can read outside were the word Tofu, that should tell you that they&#39;re known for their tofu soup.  ;)

They add an egg at the table so you get an almost poached egg in your tofu soup.  I don&#39;t like my egg too runny so I would scoop up tofu to cover the whole egg and let it sit in the bubbling soup to get cooked more.  The side dishes are always delicious and I think the Soon Tofu is definitely worth the lunch price of $6.95.  

Also ordered the kalbi the first time I came here thanks to other Yelpers.  It was one of the best kalbi I&#39;ve had.  Very tender and juicy, but also very expensive at $25 for 1 order.  I feel it might be worth it to just go to an all-you-can-eat Korean place because I pay that much a person and I can eat all the kalbi in the world I want.  I must say the quality of the meat is really good though.  

All in all I&#39;m a fan of their Soon Tofu and also their kalbi.  I would only really recommend paying $7 for the soup rather than $9, which is the dinner price.  It&#39;s the same exact thing. 

Can&#39;t wait to come back and try something else, but their Soon Tofu is just so fantastic!  Yummy broth!"

I&#39;ve been coming here for years upon years, and it&#39;s still the most reliable Korean place in town.  They do their meats very well, both Kalbi and Bulgogi and pork.  You can grill yourself at your table but I like it cooked in the back.   The nengmyun is a great spicy cold noodle dish during the summer; and their bibimbop is legit.  During the winter, nothing beats a tofu jigae, a molten spicy soup overflowing with kimchi, meats, and tofu.   Special mention has to be made of their bento box for weekday lunches.  They come out with a huge meal--your choice of grilled meats, rice, chapchae noodles, a bowl of beef broth, vegetables, and then half a dozen banchan small pickle dishes to sample--all for under $7.    That&#39;s by far the best lunch deal in town.

The service is OK; some of the wait staff are extremely nice motherly women; some are a bit curt, especially with the non-Koreans.  The owner is usually there, and he keeps service brisk and efficient even when they&#39;re busy.   The decor is modern; they just did an interior remodeling which leaves you feeling like you&#39;re in a Beverly Hills heiress&#39;s horse stable.  (Go, you&#39;ll see what I mean.)"

Made a reservation for FRIDAY February 18th 2011 for a PARTY of 15 .  The restaurant provide us the 2 rooms their ONLY BIGGEST rooms in the establishment.

Half of my friends opt to BBQ their own food, while half of my other friends opt for the kitchen to cook their food.

This time around,  I opt for 1 appetizer of Fried Oyster Pancake, 2 main entrees; 1 order of Galbi and a order of Spicy Sauteed Squid.

I like all the food that I ordered, though I so wish there could be more of them especially the Oyster Pancake.  The Squid though NOT as SPICY as I want to, was A-OK.  I think to make the Sauteed Squid better, if only they put more spice, vegetables and more Squid for that entree.

The only downside about SILLA is the service.  Though they tried to accommodate to all our needs, I do hope they can provide more waitstaffs in the future for big groups.  So the other patrons would not wait for a slightly longer time for the food or their beverages or water to be filled up etc etc.

All in all, my friends and I have a good time feasting away our Korean food.  Above anything else, I still dont mind returning when needed to SILLA.  Thank you SILLA."

First thing i learned when ordering is that lunch specials are not served on the weekends, so its pretty much regular menu items only.
I ordered the bimbimbop and the bin tae tuk.  I was a dissapointed with the bin tae tuk because i felt that they dont  use enough mung bean and substituted a lot of pancake mix.  It was also a little greasy.  The sauce for the dish was good but overall not too impressed with this dish.  The bimbimbop was ok but really how can you mess up bimbimbop, its just rice and a bunch of vegetables.  
The banchan was ok but the variety was not as extensive as seoul bbq, also some of the dishes like the fish cake and seaweed had too much oil on them.  

Dishes here typically average $10 bucks, in my opinion seoul bbq was better."

None of the Korean places I&#39;ve found in Denver or surrounding areas do this so from what I can tell, the best you can do is go for a &#34;Combination&#34; A, B, C, D etc. for somewhere between $40-$120 depending on how many people it serves.

That said, this place is genuine. It can be hard to decide what to order for two of you if you are trying to get nice bang for your buck but I recommend one of the smaller combinations. A la carte BBQ items can be expensive (though I imagine the portions are plentiful). Sides are great as well and I&#39;ll definitely go back.

Not a lot of English spoken in the restaurant so read up on some Korean dishes if you&#39;re new to this kind of thing."

After I had to go to Aurora for the 2nd time in 3 days (and my 4th time there, ever), I once again thought I&#39;d better get some good food out of it. This time it was at Silla. Now, I am no stranger to Korean food. However, I normally eat it in social settings; taekwondo potlucks, gatherings in a Korean household, etc. I&#39;m not as used to going to a restaurant and reading from a menu, but oh well, it was worth a shot. 

I came here in the lunch rush and was pretty much ignored by the patriarch except for him to mutter &#34;hana&#34; (one) to one of the waitresses. I should point out here that I know just enough Korean to be very polite, and count to 20. I also know that I was the only white person in this restaurant, and I was the only person that wasn&#39;t greeted upon my entrance, or my exit. Every other person was greeted by every single employee. Just thought it was a little odd- most Japanese restaurants, for example, have people practically screaming &#34;irasshaimase!&#34; at you ever 30 seconds. 

I decided to go with the daelgi bulgogi (grilled, marinated pork) that comes much like a bento box with rice, pickled bean sprouts and broccoli, and chop chae (glass noodles). In addition, this lunch special comes with some simple soup, and plentiful banchan (sides) of pickled/preserved: radish, green bean, eggplant, cucumber, and of course kimchi. This is a lot of food for one person, and even better when the lunch special costs $6.50. Most importantly, to me, my pork was excellent. A bit spicy, very little fat or cartilage, and very well seasoned.  I really enjoyed the banchan because I really had no idea what went into most of them and just had to go with it and try them out. It also kept me eating lots of different vegetables and flavors, as opposed to just eating my mound of white rice because it was there. 

Service, if you are not Korean, is OK at best. I had water and then was given a refill of &#34;water&#34; except this water was brown. Everyone else was drinking it so I just jumped off the cliff and went with it. It actually was quite good, but thinking it was water was a little unnerving. I had to try to get my check 2-3 times but once the message got across it was fast. There wasn&#39;t any language barrier with any of the servers at my table, so it just seemed like a weird miscommunication. My meal ended with sikhye (sweetened rice &#34;juice&#34;) which was really refreshing and was just sweet enough to satisfy me at the end of the meal. There&#39;s a ton of Korean food in this area, but if I wanted a reliable, quick, and very affordable lunch option, I&#39;d definitely come back."

I&#39;m Korean and the side dishes and entrees are very good! I use to go to Seoul BBQ but this place is far better. One plus is that they don&#39;t charge for extra rice like Seoul BBQ does! As far as the service goes, sometimes it&#39;s great sometimes it&#39;s not, so it&#39;s a hit or miss. Ambience is pretty chill, nothing super fancy. I feel like they should expand! Pretty small space for the amount of customers they get. Definitely recommend if you like Korean BBQ!"

I&#39;d only had Korean BBQ once before and it was very comparable.  Love all the side dishes and being able to wrap them up in lettuce leaves with tasty freshly cooked, right at the table little pieces of meat just makes me happy all over.  I originally ordered the wrong thing and when our server brought out two giant steaks I knew I&#39;d made a mistake.  All was quickly remedied when I explained to him what it was that I did want.  The staff was quick to please, the food delicious and the atmosphere at bit dumpy.  Will go back for sure."

Once we finished we went up to the counter to pay for the bill the server just sat there counting her tips in front of us, she sat there counting her cash for 5 min.

My boyfriend knew of this place, and am very glad he took me here and broadened my horizons. 

They had remodeled the place since the last time he was there...apparently more of a contemporary look now. Okay, back to the food. If I was rating just the food, I would give them 4 stars. We had the &#34;hangover&#34; soup (sorry I don&#39;t remember the Korean name right now). it was a huge bowl that came with lots of fun dishes of assorted sides....kimchee, fish cake, black beans, etc. The soup was a little spicy for me since I am a bit of a wimp in this area...but I still liked it quite a bit...it was a good spicy...and look forward to getting it again!

So why the 3 stars. During this visit the service was not as good as it must have been in the past, it was a bit cold temperature-wise, and their remodeling effort added a &#39;cold&#34; feel to the place versus a &#39;warm&#39; bubbly place.  

I hope to continue going back to see if the service and overall experience improves, so please don&#39;t let the 3 stars rating of my single experience deter you from going. Do check it out yourself &#39;cause I know you will enjoy the food! It was very good. :)

I&#39;ve been to Silla plenty of times and this place is actually one of my favorite places to go to.  When we came into the restaurant, the atmosphere was pretty nice but the room was pretty cold so it was pretty uncomfortable at first. We were seated right away. Our waiter was pretty and attentive. Every time we pressed the button he came pretty fast.

So let&#39;s get to the food. SO I love Korean food! One of my favorite types of food! So for someone to ruin that experience for me will make me very pissed and so angry! Anyways, we ordered the beef tongue, karubi, and the yukejan. The meat came pretty fast and the side dishes were came with our meal. They weren&#39;t the best looking side dishes but they were pretty delicious and we got extra side dishes that we liked without charge.  The beef tongue was delicious and I wrapped them in lettuce and miso. DELICIOUS! The karubi was juicy, nicely cut, and the marinade wasn&#39;t too sweet, so I liked that :). The yukejan was very spicy and warmed me up pretty quickly. They gave us a lot of yukejan so that was nice :)

I was in a meeting with two other co-workers just prior to making the decision to go out for lunch.  One knows Korean food very well as she grew up with it and kept talking about the &#34;spicy Korean soup&#34; she gets at P &amp; Y.  Less than 15 mintues later the three of us were en route to Aurora....and P &amp; Y was closed.  So we headed to Silla.

When I saw the words &#34;Tofu Tofu Tofu&#34; on their window outside, I knew they&#39;d have something for me.

I went for the mushroom tofu soon which was on their lunch special list.  Our meals came with various sides for sharing (eggplant, zucchini, broccoli, kimchee, wakame.....and I can&#39;t remember them all) as well as a scoop of rice.

Having absolutely no experience with Korean food outside of kimchee and the H Mart, I was a bit befuddled as to what to do when my boiling hot bowl of soup came out.  I followed my co-workers direction and cracked the accompanying raw egg into it and waited for it to cook.  Once the egg got to a desired thickness and it cooled off just enough, I dug in.  The stew itself was laden with a very generous amount of silken tofu, lots of juicy shitake mushrooms, and the perfect amount of heat (I ordered mine extra spicy).

The meal was topped off with a cup of sweet rice juice (this is what co-worker called it...who knew you could juice rice).

Our server was very sweet but they got a bit backed up when it was time to pay.

Definitely one of the better meals I&#39;ve had during the work lunch hour and cheap too!  $22 for three of us and we got to taste tons of different things.  So glad to learn I have some co-workers who know what&#39;s up."

the bibimbap is great but I am unable to compare it as I&#39;ve only had it here twice now.
I do enjoy all the little dishes that come with your entree&#39;s to sample different Korean apettizers. I agree with one review that weekend does not have lunch menu so going in alone is a bit much when you have to order a full dinner size entree for yourself. But, there are worse things than leftovers!
The staff could be a bit more on the helpful side with ordering and answering questions for us that are not fully knowledgable of Korean cuisine."

My dining partner and I decided Korean would be the best meal to satiate us after our rafting trip.

The food was good and did hit the spot, however the price and service left a lot  to be desired. When we arrived, we had to wait to be seated for about 7-10 minutes, no biggie. Once seated, we were told that we had to move to accommodate a party of 4 since the booth was bigger; FYI, just about all the booths in this establishment are the same size! We move to the different table and what do you know, the booth is the same size as the one we were seated initially. My take, the server did not want to serve us because WE were the most diverse customers in there aside from the dominant Korean clientele in there.

We, or shall I say my dining partner was checked on during our dinner only once. No refill on water and we weren&#39;t even asked about a drink order from the start. $27.95 for galbi aka kalbi, $18.95 for bulgogi....ridiculous! 

We weren&#39;t even offered the complimentary tea,we saw others get, after their meal.

Bottom line, if you don&#39;t go with a Korean associate or are not Korean yourself don&#39;t expect service with a smile or any service at all!"

Although many people might argue that fact. I&#39;m more &#34;American&#34; than Korean, but 1) I grew up with  home cooked Korean food and 2) I&#39;ve tasted the finest Korean food in the one and only City of Angels.

To first put things into perspective, on a scale of 1-10 (1 being scarce), the Denver/outskirts area is a 3 on the abundance of available Korean food/restaurants. With that said, one can only compare within that caliber.

I&#39;m also a little biased when it comes to service because my friend&#39;s friend works here and she&#39;s a doll. 

But, first thing&#39;s first. I came here twice for the same thing: nengmyun noodles. They try to imitate LA&#39;s nengmyun and it&#39;s pretty accurate. Not too sweet. 
If you come for lunch, the special is nengmyun and kalbi or dumplings (less than $10). I got kalbi (duh) and it was delish. It&#39;s a great Korean combination, those two. 

At the end of your meal, they always serve the rice drink (sheekkae) which is made to PERFECTION. I love it and ends the meal right.

Can&#39;t say much about their other menu items but if it&#39;s summertime and you want something cold, come here for nengmyun and kalbi :)

Silla delivers.  I feel like their flavors are so...home-like, authentic, rich, tasty, I could go on and on...

The only other Korean restaurant I&#39;ve been to is Seoul BBQ on Havana (I think Havana).  I thought they had delicious food, but after going to Silla, I feel that it does not compare.

I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of Asian restaurants have toned down the intense, &#34;Asian&#34; flavors for the general populations&#39; palate.  I admit that our flavors are often strong, intense and spicy, but that&#39;s what makes Asian food so good!  It&#39;s gotten to the point where I find some of what I thought were the best restaurants, bland.  Silla is definitely NOT in this category.  

Everything we had was so flavorful and delicious.  

I recommend: (I don&#39;t remember any names so I&#39;ll do my best to describe them)

Stir fried potato starch noodles with cabbage and mushrooms (No words can describe my love for this dish).. chap jae? 
Spicy tofu soup (So goooddd!)
Galbi- the best ever!

There&#39;s no better place to start off my reviews of Korean restaurants series than with Silla - it&#39;s been around forever. Unlike most of my Korean friends, I only get to eat Korean food if we go out to eat, but let me just say that there is nothing as good as a home-cooked Korean meal. Unfortunately, the only way I will get that on a regular basis is to get adopted into a Korean family or find myself a Korean wife - from my experience, the former is more likely to happen for us non-Korean guys... Never mind that though, on to Silla!

I believe this was actually the first Korean restaurant I went to. It was pretty good the first time from what I remember, but it gave me a strange initial impression of Korean food - spicy and lots of vegetables. I didn&#39;t really care for the stuff much in the beginning since I was raise up on an very carnivorous diet. I was extremely elated when our servings of Korean BBQ came out. It was kalbi-riffic! Since then, Korean BBQ has always held a strong place in my heart.

So why 3 stars you ask? Everything else I&#39;ve had there over my many visits has been alright - yes, just alright. As I started becoming more of a Korean food fanboy, I discovered other places that are much better. Since Silla has had multiple owners over the years, I&#39;ve noticed it to be a little inconsistent. My most recent visit was a little bit of an upset. We were seated, but it took a while before we got served. When I got my kimchi jjigae, I was so excited only to find a very pitiful serving of meat inside. Although Korean food has taught me to love my veggies, I was very disappointed. Would I go back? Possible, but unlikely. Stay hungry my friends!"

As someone else mentioned, their lunch special is a very good deal. I had the Daeji Bulgogi which is a spicy pork meat. The lunch came with soup, rice, bean sprouts, and I think some noodles that are called Chap Che. Of course there are four types of Kimchee. Everything was really good. The service wasn&#39;t the fastest, but the place was rather full. The biggest drawback was that there isn&#39;t a lot of room in the booths because the tables have a grill underneath so my legs were really cramped. This is really just a minor detail, but if you have long legs, be aware. Overall, great food, and I would be back for lunch.

Their loss was Silla&#39;s gain.  I had looked up reviews for Silla and wanted to try it anyway.  Were we glad we went there.  Yummy!!  This will be my new &#34;go to&#34; place for Korean food.  

We ordered the seafood pancake because my friend has not been to Korean before.  I wanted him to try it.  It was perfectly cooked, crispy and not the slightest bit greasy.  My only complaint about it was the octopus (or squid/not sure which it was) was way too chewy.  They either need to leave it out or make sure it doesn&#39;t get cooked more than 1 minute, max.    We took half of it home for today.

We also ordered the kimchee soup w/pork and a beef soup with veggies and egg.  The flavors of both were just divine.  And the many sides were also quite tasty.  

I only have 3 criticisms of the place, which is what kept me from giving them 5 stars:

1. They don&#39;t serve the sides unless you order certain items.  Every other Korean place I&#39;ve eaten at in NYC and the Korea House bring the sides out to everyone when they sit down.  I think they should do this.
2. Our waitresses were lacking in their English which created a bit of a language barrier.  We ordered 2 waters and 1 hot tea.  They brought out 0 water and 2 hot teas.  Then when we asked for water one of the waitresses filled the tea glass with water.  3. They didn&#39;t clear our plates at the end of the meal, which is a big deal for me.  No one wants dirty plates all over the table when they&#39;re finished."

My boyfrined was stationed in Korea, and he introduced me to this restaurant.  A week ago we took my Mom, Dad, and daughter and we had a wonderful meal.  I must say that the best deal is to go during the week for lunch, much more reasonable; same food.  My favorites are probably the Kimchee soup (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m spelling it wrong:  Kimchee Chigea--something like that) and good old Golbi.  Yum."

Not a big place and it filled up quickly with the lunch crowd. Since the majority of customers were Korean, I knew that the food must be fairly authentic. I ordered the miso soup and my friend ordered the pork bulgogi. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious. My soup was quite good although I thought they had overdone it a bit on adding potatoes. The soup also had tofu and zucchini and dried anchovies.. My friend loved the pork that was served with rice and chop chay noodles. We were quite pleased and decided to return some time soon to try the dinner menu. The awful tinny radio playing through the speakers was annoying and unnecessary. Service was swift and the price was shockingly cheap in that we both ordered beers.  It was a good experience and worth the drive from central Denver."

The first thing I learned was they don&#39;t serve lunch on the week-ends. Lunch dishes are typically around $10 bucks and diner dishes are around $20 bucks. My youngest daughter and I had the bulgogi, my oldest daughter had the BBQ chicken and my wife had the miso soup. I found the food to be very good. I have eaten in many other Korean restaurants and I would say Silla would be among my top 5. The staff was busy but found the time to check on us. There didn&#39;t seem to be assigned tables because different staff members checked on us almost every time. Overall, I found this establishment to be one of the better Korean restaurants in this area. I would definitely go again!"

For Silla, there were no English servers that they asked a random Korean teenager to wait our table...  Having had superb Korean food in California and from Korean friends&#39; homes, I must say that Silla&#39;s food is mediocre comparably.  That being said, it is one of the better Korean restaurants in the area.  The BBQ items are your best bet: bulgogi, kalbi, and daeji bulgogi.  The bibimbap and soon tofu can satisfy a strong craving, but nothing to wow over.  They do give you a ton of side dishes with your meal, so whatever you order, you will leave with a full stomach.

When I have Korean food, I can&#39;t help but be reminded of the scene from Along Came Polly, when Jennifer Aniston introduces bulgogi to Ben Stiller, who ended up with an irritable bowel syndrome flare-up.  No worries, Silla would not give you any irritable bowels, inflammatory bowels, or any other form of bowels.

1 star off: no free brown rice tea
1 star off: had no idea what the drinks menu said, it was all in Korean
1 star extra: so authentic that they had to pull a random teenager to wait our table, maybe they can get her to translate the drinks menu too"

Not only was my food mediocre, but it really lacked flavor. 

As for the service, we&#39;ve experience so much better there.  The ladies were attentive, but they weren&#39;t very nice.  I had to use the little doorbell buzzer thing a few times.  Maybe it was just a bad night, I hope next time it will be better."

We ordered a combo ($70-ish) for 4 people and left absolutely stuffed full of bulgogi goodness. Marinades on the meats were outstanding. We all took home leftovers as well. Plus I think it&#39;s kind of fun and entertaining that you get to cook the food yourself on the grill on the middle of the table -- keeps the men occupied that&#39;s for sure. I tried many many different sides of pickled items and enjoyed it all. All said and done, a wonderful meal. Downing a bottle of soju is a must! (not by yourself of course)."

This is definitely my go-to place for authentic and delicious Korean food, whether it&#39;s BBQ or lesser known dishes, such as Seolleongtang (Ox Bone Soup). It&#39;s also a go-to place for several of my Korean friends. 

My partner and I eat here a minimum of 2-3 times a month. We&#39;ve not once had a poor meal. 

The rating should be 4.5 for two critiques: 

First, they have a pretty wide menu and great offerings for group meals, but it&#39;s not quite as developed as I would like (No Dukboki?!?!? What?!?). 

Second, while the food is always good and the service friendly, they are less consistent on timing and quantity of banchan. If they get too busy, they may take a wee bit longer to visit your table and you don&#39;t always know how many different banchans you&#39;ll get (banchan=mini korean side dishes that arrive before the meal).  Ranges from 5-12. 

However, even with the critiques, Silla will always be my first recommendation and my favorite Korean restaurant in Denver. Yummy!"

The place is a bit pricey but for high quality korean food this would have been worth it, however it just wasn&#39;t that great. The food tasted good, not great, but not bad either, I have had worse. We had Tonkatsu and Galbi Dang and it was just ok. The service was non existent. Their were about 8 banchan and they were tiny, ok tasting. We ate them all and were never offered refills. Our water went empty and never got refilled. I had to grab one of the workers attention (who was cleaning the floor) to ask for more kimchee, a few more pieces came out. A tasty rice drink at the end put me up to 2 stars, but without that I might have given 1 star. FYI I am white american and so was my company so perhaps that influenced the service we were given, although I have no direct evidence to support that suspicion."

Dude: I had Korean last night at this place called Silla. Man, I had these banchans and kalo-bees and stuff. It was out of this world.

Dudette: I haven&#39;t had Korean that often, so I don&#39;t know much about it. But I know you can BBQ your meats at the table, so it must&#39;ve been a blast.  How was the grilling? Did your hand get tired? (ha-ha)

It seems a lot of Koreans go here but the food is just ok.  One way I like to determine how good a Korean restaurant is by inspecting their banchans (the side dishes they serve that help you eat rice).  Needless to say, their banchans need a serious OVERHAUL!!! Their banchans are low grade, at best.  Just yesterday we ordered Daegoo Mureejim (hot &amp; spicy steamed cod fish head with vegetables).  You have to order this a good 45 minutes in advance because they have to soak the fish head; we ordered over an hour before pickup.  The dish was still somewhat undersoaked so some parts of the fish head were still dry.  Ok, so their side dish is so bad I&#39;d love to say, &#34;I don&#39;t wish to take your banchans so would you give me a discount on the food instead?&#34;  How is it so bad, you ask?  Well...What Korean restaurant serves seasoned Italian parsley as banchan????  Italian parsley, reallllllllllly??????  This crosses the line for me!  Last I checked, this was NOT an Italian restaurant!  It&#39;s completely just a filler.  I don&#39;t even mind authentic Korean filler banchans /or cheap banchans but Italian parsley, really?????  My parents and I both don&#39;t understand why people keep going over there.  A couple of days prior, we had ordered ttug bog gi (spicy rice cake) and it was SOOOOOOO spicy with way too much red pepper paste (go chu jang) and red pepper flake that it became unflavorful, yet way too spicy.  Also, I think this is done only in Korean restaurants (at least at Silla) where all the banchans are served in aluminum foil wraps for take out.  They are so cheap that they can&#39;t even buy the small sauce containers with lids to put the banchans in!!!  Seriously, really???  This could seriously cause more food smell to travel outside of the package and spill if you are not careful.  On the positive side, I will say they do a pretty good Yu-Chun Chik Mool Nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodle dish in beef broth served with egg, cucumber, radish and sliced beef).  Silla, if you are reading this, PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE change up your banchans; get rid of the Italian parsley banchan and substitute it with actual Korean banchans, even if they are &#34;not expensive&#34; banchans!  Thank you!"

I remember when I was a kid this place was busy and delicious...  Boy does 16 years ruin a place.

We arrived 15 after but they&#39;re strict..  So my mom didn&#39;t order anything and ordered my galbi tang.. While waiting, they gave us below mediocre ban chan! Radish and regular kimchi was extremely sour!  Yes I&#39;m half Korean and even my full Korean mom didn&#39;t like it.  The potato salad and the cucumbers were so so.. Deff no sae Jong kwon.  When my food arrives the soup was still boiling and for the rice, it was not so nice!  It was room temperature and dare I say frdgerated the microwaved...

silla-restaurant-aurora,Chris H.,SxktlZ8y6-_dVSmiWv_8iQ,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,10,1,W25zu-bZHkSmv2ZaSq3W6w,4.0,2008-09-30,"This is the best Korean BBQ place in Denver in my opinion.  There may be other restaurants that do better on individual dishes or ban chan (side dishes) but I think the BBQ here is the best.  If you&#39;re in the mood to party Korean style (aka 1. Gorge yourself on various meats that you grill yourself 2. Wash it down with bottles of soju 3. Go to the noraebang [karaoke] and sing embarrassing songs you would never admit to liking while sober) you can&#39;t really go wrong by starting at Silla.

As I said at the beginning, the BBQ is always good here.  For those who are unfamiliar with Korean food, the menu has pre-set meals that you can order.  These meals include various combinations of meats you can grill, soups, and various side dishes, entrees and appetizers.  Ordering the right one of these pre-set meals (depending on the size of your party, should be 4 or more) is usually the best way to get the most bang for your buck at Silla.  Oh and a little tip, if you don&#39;t like one of the items on the pre-set meal, you can usually substitute it for something else at no charge.

The meat is always really good here and they give you a lot of it.  Sam Gyup Sal (thick cut bacon), Galbi (marinated beef short ribs), Bulgogi and Ju Mool Luk (marinated beef) and spicy chicken are all on the menu and included in the aforementioned pre-set meals.  Maybe I&#39;m biased because I&#39;m Korean but I think there&#39;s something about grilling the meat yourself that makes it taste better than just having it someone cook for you.

The other thing Silla does really well is Naeng Myun.  Naeng Myun is a cold Korean noodle dish served during the summer and it&#39;s awesome at Silla.  It&#39;s a refreshing mix of a bunch of different flavors.  You have the sweet and spicy go chu jang (hot pepper paste), sweet and crisp pear slices, the pungent mustard and cool cucumber all mixed up in a cold broth with noodles and a hard boiled egg on top...  Mmm...  If you&#39;re a fan of Korean food but have never had Naeng Myun you owe it to yourself to try it here.  I don&#39;t traditionally like Naeng Myun, but this place made me a believer.

The other dishes are pretty standard Korean fare, the Soon Doo Boo (spicy soft tofu stew) is good and the Kimchi Jjigae is good.  Not exceptional but it will cure a hankering for Korean food any day.

Finally the service is not that bad for a Korean restaurant.  I have no problem saying that that the service at a lot of Korean restaurants really sucks (even when their guests are Korean!) but other than the minor annoyance of them not splitting up the bill for several credit cards, I can&#39;t really complain about Silla.

Overall, I give Silla 4 stars.  I&#39;ve had better Korean BBQ at my Mom&#39;s house and also at other restaurants in LA so it doesn&#39;t quite get 5 stars.  Having said that I will say you&#39;ll have a tough time finding better Korean BBQ anywhere else in Denver."

The waiter didn&#39;t even rub butter/or any type of oil on the grill so when we grilled the chicken, the chicken came out burnt. We assumed that, like most Korean Bbq restaurants, they would grease the grill for us. Not only that, but they completely ignored our group. Normally waiters/waitresses check up to see how the food is and if there was anything else we needed, but not once did they check up on us. We always had to get their attention by sending someone to signal for them. Also halfway through our meal, we realized that they had not given us rice. When we asked for rice, they didn&#39;t deliver it until we were nearly finished with our meal. How hard is it to serve rice??

We ordered 6 pastries. Instead of putting the pastries I *had already paid* for aside, they sold a couple to other people. They tried to offer me 2 &#39;free&#39; desserts to make up for it. Not in the I&#39;d get 8 pastries total way, in the they would give me 2 different desserts to make up for the ones they sold from under me.

Kind of a smaller menu Panera... Been twice and the food is a little better I think.  Funny moment when I wanted a couple pastries and the pastry cabinet was a ways from the cash register so I was talking over the top of a line of people to order.  Then when I thought someone would just grab my scones and hand them to me... Like in a coffee shop.... They handed me a number like I had ordered sandwiches or something.  I waited almost ten minutes to get me scones.  Almost walked out.  I was thankful the scone was good :)  

Not a great set up, a bit confusing, not a bakery, not a cafe, just another place to get a sandwich that is a little smaller than other places and a bit more expensive.

WHEN I LEFT I THOUGHT:  Average but nice.  Didn&#39;t meet the hype."

Everything is always fresh. The restaurant is always clean and comfortable. The staff is always polite and friendly. But the reason I marked this place only a 3 is because they never get a full order correct and the service is always slow. 

They never run two registers simultaneously, especially if it is not a main mealtime. They would rather let a line of people build up. No one ever takes the initiative or thinks to ask the customer that just paid to step over to the large table by the drinks to wait for their order so the next person can be waited on. Their excuse is that they are not a fast food restaurant. That may be true. But I expect faster than slow food and service.

It is as if they don&#39;t notice or care that wait times are high. And when I politely said something, the woman behind the register started to cry and ran into the back. If you can&#39;t take constructive, polite criticism, get out of the restaurant business."

While waiting, we missed breakfast and were told that even though we were in line there was a hard stop for breakfast?? We tried to ask why the line was taking so long but the guy just walked away. We decided to stay since we had been in line for so long, still hungry and tried ordering lunch. The cashier had no idea how to put &#34;no croutons and cheese on the side&#34; in the system and she seemed timid to ask her bad attitude unhelpful coworkers that ignored the increasing amount of customers in line and their clearly struggling coworker. I didn&#39;t think that was too much to ask? The tables were filthy and the lettuce was wilty and not cold at all. The server had a rash on her right hand when she handed my food to me and when I asked about my drink, she blamed her coworker for not giving that to me in the first place instead of just taking care of it. Very poorly ran. The next day we went to Rory&#39;s diner and it made up for the debacle we experienced here at Kneaders. I debated writing a review but they really should figure that out. I was embarrassed for them as a chain. Lesson learned: shop small business and don&#39;t deal with being treated like cattle. Check We won&#39;t be back."

Everyone just sitting and waiting til a worker tells them they don&#39;t have any food. And I feel sorry for the one Asian kid that worked here. Had to walk around and deliver bad new to everything.

This is a typical sports bar with a decent selection for food options and there&#39;s quite a bit of space for everyone to watch all the different games.

Ambiance. Typical sports bar. Lots of TVs, tables and chairs not in great condition. The name, along with the green clovers on the exterior sign, elude to it being an &#34;irish&#34; place, but nothing about the decor or menu would back that up. When we first got there, they just had music playing over the speakers which was fine. Eventually, a live band started playing. The bass was so terrible that I could feel it. I couldn&#39;t tell you if the singer was any good, because I couldn&#39;t hear him over the feedback. I also couldn&#39;t tell you anything my husband was saying, because it was so loud. Overall, 2 stars.

Service. Had been at the table for about 10 minutes before anyone came by to wipe it down or even welcome us. After that, the server was friendly and decently attentive. Overall, 3 stars.

Food/Drinks. We started with the boneless wings with the sweet chili sauce. I disagree with the word &#34;wings&#34; when describing this item, as it was really just chopped up chicken covered in a sauce. However, the sweet chili sauce was really good, not too spicy but had a little kick. I then had the Santa Fe Chicken Wrap with fries. The wrap was very good (I also added guac) and you could tell the fries were homemade (but a little soggy). My husband had the French Dip which he said was pretty standard but could tell the beef was not freshly sliced. He also said his beer was a little flat. Overall, 3.5 stars.

Misc. There is ample parking. Seemed like a good crowd of people there, no one getting too rowdy.

If we lived closer to this place, we&#39;d consider going back again, but not sure I&#39;d make the journey for this."

I was told the burger was very good, but my French dip was lukewarm and so soggy.  This was before I dipped the sandwich in the au jus.  I attempted to dip my sandwich, but the bread fell apart before reaching the au jus cup.  I figured the bread was wet enough (with what, I don&#39;t know), so I took a bite.

We went in and the Packers game was on so we sat by one of the many tvs to watch.   Our server came over right away and got our drink order.  She came back right away with our drinks. 

We ended up ordering the chili cheeseburger and buffalo chicken sandwich with fries.  They came it within a reasonable time. 

The chili cheeseburger looked amazing.  It was smothered in green chili and had pickles,  onions,  and cheese on it.  I had to eat it with a fork,  but it was good!  The burger was juicy and the chili not too spicy,  but just right. 

The buffalo chicken sandwich had no words to explain how good it was.  The chicken was super juicy and the Buffalo sauce plentiful.  We added some cheddar cheese and dipped it in blue cheese dressing.  All I can say is WOW!

This is the best bar food I have had in Colorado. I hope this wasn&#39;t a one time thing.  We will be back and hopefully not disappointed."

We decided to order chicken wings and two burgers. The chicken wings are great, you can get them battered which makes them extra crispy and put the sauce on the side so you can decide how much you want. The burgers were HUGE and cooked to perfection, the fries were nice and crispy. I&#39;m the only one who ordered a drink - a tall coke and rum. I didn&#39;t come during happy hour, but the bartender mentioned they were two for the price of one from 3pm - 7pm.

Lots of neon signs. 

Happy Hour just might be one of the greatest things in the US. 2 for 1 drinks and raging drink specials. Add in a little buffet of free chicken wings and tater tots, and you have a prime spot to have drinks and for some, a free meal. I had a glass of white zinfandel, to take advantage of their &#39;2 glasses of house wine for $6.25&#39; deal. I&#39;m not sure what the brand of wine was but it was dry, tasty, and the glass was about the size of my head. To top it off, it contained half a bottle of wine and our wonderful waitress joked that another glass would have me consuming the entire bottle. I opted not to go for that. 

With cheap drinks, plenty of tv&#39;s, and tons of loyal regulars, I&#39;m considering this the &#39;Cheers&#39; of Aurora. After a round of karaoke, I&#39;m sure even the guy in the back corner will know your name."

Magners is the only Irish thing you&#39;ll get here.  The clientele is sketchy, the bar staff is really slow, and the inside is a bit dank.  The service here needs some major improvement.

We went for a date night and sat at a high table away from the bar. I asked the waitress after waiting 15 minutes of sitting if they had a blender. They did. Great. I ordered a strawberry daquiri. It was so strong and so absolutely disgusting I took 2 sips and I was done. Gross! Geoffrey had Amaretto and Sprite, so he was pleased. We ordered fried pickle chips, wings (mild and naked), and soft pretzel bites with cheese. The mild wings (mine) were actually pretty good. They were a little small for my liking. Geoffrey didn&#39;t care for the naked wings much. I am not much of a pickle-eater, but I generally like fried pickle chips. The pickle chips were too thick and this rendered them not very crispy and a little greasy. I couldn&#39;t eat too many of them. They were too strong of a dill flavor for me (thickness also plays a part here). Geoffrey and I have a thing for soft pretzels. I ate most of those because I was pretty dissatisfied with the fried pickle chips. The waitress did not check in enough and I found myself waiting for a refill with a scorching tongue. We are looking elsewhere for a good pub. Sorry."

I jokingly call it &#34;cougar paradise&#34; because the women there (I&#39;m one of them!) are older than the downtown crowd, but still fun, fabulous, and just out to have a great time. The men seem to be friendly, chatty, and not overly clingy.  Just a good, salt-of-the-earth mix of locals.

Food has been great to me but some of my friends are not the biggest fans...I&#39;ve never gone wrong with the standards (burgers, tuna melts, fries) and the portions are big.

Drinks are good!  Happy Hour wine comes as a 2 for 1 in huge goblets, so you feel like a lush, but also?  Yay!

Joanna (aka &#34;Jo Jo&#34;) is about the sweetest and most proficient cocktail waitress/bartender I&#39;ve ever met.  As a former cocktail slinger myself, it&#39;s hard not to be critical of service, and there&#39;s not a single thing I can say about her other than AWESOME."

Optimus is confused by Mexican menu items in an Irish-style pub that&#39;s really just a sports bar with a stage. Yeah, this place is about as Irish as the chili relleno I ate here last week. But hey - it was not a bad chili relleno.

Karaoke Thursday is a hilarious time to watch drunken humans &#39;sing&#39; - most of the time EPIC FAILING just as much while singing Highway to Hell as they are trying to get back off the stage (OMG is she alright??)

Also, there is always this one older drunk chick that talks to Optimus and Sideswipe like she&#39;s got no one else to hang on to, but... well, let&#39;s just say it was visit # 3 to this place that we even figured out she was a she. Ladies who smoke: be aware, your voice is going to get deep and scratchy, and your face is going to shrivel up faster than a dog&#39;s ass at the vet. This chick could have played Ghost Rider as Nic Cage and the  Spirit of Vengeance all at once - with no make-up! Lady, do yourself a flava and suck on a Chantix once in a while, will ya? Foulness.

Libations abound. Not the best prices, the service is meh, and the scenery as well. But heck... it&#39;s right down the block.

Anyways - on a &#34;bloody mary&#34; challenge (followed by a whiskey taste test!?) we found that this place has really decent bloody marys!

Food: I was kinda drunk at this point but the buffalo burger was quite delish. The fries, NOT delish. At all. I don&#39;t know what kind of fries they are but they are the same as fresh fish company and they blow. Please get better fries.

Drink: $7.50 for a pitcher of PBR. I got 2 sides of green olives with them with no backsass from the bartender.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere here is sweet. They had live trivia and trivia on some tvs as well. A million tvs with all variety of sports. We got the channel changed on one of the prominent tvs no problem.

It just feels dirty in there and I like dive bars. The music is wayyyy too loud but it&#39;s probably that way because of the older crowd that frequents this establishment.

We very nicely called and said we were missing sesame wings because we decided we would just do without the soup. The lady that answered told me I was wrong and both orders of sesame wings were there cause she remembered putting them in there. As I proceeded to explain that we were in fact missing it she said &#34;oh Ya we only charged you for one so you only got one.&#34; But then why would she say she remembered putting two? Then we realized we had ordered sweet and sour chicken but got a side of teriyaki rather than a side of sweet and sour sauce. When we called the same lady she told us it was sweet and sour and that they just put food coloring in it to make it brown. We told her okay, never mind then and just waited on the wings to come. But when I got my second order of sesame wings arrived we got the exact same sauce that had came with the sweet and sour wings. Then I found a huge hair in my white rice which completely made me lose my appetite. It&#39;s obviously not well organized and I will never order here again.

Hubby and I have ordered from China Chef many times. I believe we average once every 2-3 months ordering takeout. (Note: We have NEVER eaten there.)

I place my order (we&#39;ll call her Caller #1). There was emphasis on a particular item. Caller #1 states item will cost extra. I advised that was no problem. Caller #1 advised it will be 35 minutes - 1 hour for delivery. Caller #1 hangs up before repeating my order back to me. *****PROBLEM #1 *******

An hour passes. Food is not delivered.******* PROBLEM #2 ****** I call back after 1 hour and 6 minutes.  Sounds like a different caller so we&#39;ll call her Caller #2. Tells me driver left 5 minutes ago.

Food is delivered.  About to plate the family&#39;s food and I notice I&#39;m missing the aforementioned particular item. ********* PROBLEM #3*********.

Again, I call back. Sounds like Caller #2. Advised my item was missing.  Caller #2 tells me to hold on but she doesn&#39;t place me on mute. I can hear her asking someone about my order with an attitude. *********** PROBLEM #4 *********. Caller #2 comes back and firmly tries to tell me I NEVER ordered the particular item. ********* PROBLEM #5 ************.  I&#39;m furious at this point especially because I had an in depth conversation with Caller #1 about food item.  I asked to speak to a manager.

Manager comes on line. Doesn&#39;t say her name. *********** PROBLEM #6 ***********. I advise her of my issue which is China Chef forgot an item in my food delivery.  She must have told me about three times I wasn&#39;t charged for the item. Seriously....that&#39;s not my issue and she wasn&#39;t even trying to hear me.  ******* PROBLEM #7 *********. I told Manager very firmly she needed to deliver my missing item. Manager hangs up on me.   ************PROBLEM #8 ***************.

I pack up all the food and hubby &amp; I drive to China Chef. Place is about 17 minutes away.  My game plan is strictly to confront &#34;The Manager&#34; and get a refund.  Manager is on phone being syrupy sweet with a customer which totally irritated me because she offered no customer service to me.

Manager gets off the phone and immediately tells me &#34;I am just going to issue you a refund because I don&#39;t want to deal with you.&#34;  WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!!!!! ************* PROBLEM #9 ********.

I ask Manager it&#39;s ridiculous she would not even try to hear my concerns and doesn&#39;t even care about true customer service. Manager feels like everything is my fault because her account of the story is &#34;I yelled at her.&#34;  We went back and forth and she refunded my credit card. Told me to leave her establishment.  No problem....but I needed some information first.

I asked for Manager&#39;s name. She would not give it to me. ******* PROBLEM #10 ********. I asked her boss&#39; name.  She would not give it to me. ********** PROBLEM #11 ********. I asked for the owner&#39;s name. She would not give it to me. ********* PROBLEM #12 *************. I asked for the owner&#39;s phone number. She points to the window. *********** PROBLEM #13 **************.

I guess I should have just walked out and parted ways forever. However, I need to make sure my credit card was refunded appropriately.  Owner was supposed to call me but that NEVER happened.

I&#39;ll admit, their food is good but it was never &#34;consistently&#34; good. So sprinkle some horrible customer service with that and I will not be going to China Chef ever again."

Their sweet and sour is top notch, the crab and cheese wantons a little heavy on extra dough but still good. 

Problems:
-The white rice was very mediocre.
-No veggies with the sesame chicken??! What a bore."

Trying to place a delivery order with them is an exercise in bad attitude that I can&#39;t abide anymore, it used to be one particular girl giving bad service, now it&#39;s everyone who answers the phone.  They don&#39;t know basics about the surrounding area, even seemingly 1 major street up, I gave them my cross street as Alameda and Havana (insanely close to them) and they seemed absolutely baffled as to how far it was from their location. They began a side conference between people there as to who would go out to make the delivery, only to have it end with them refusing delivery altogether because I was &#34;too far&#34; away.  According to Google maps i&#39;m less than 3 miles from their listed address, so I have no idea what their problem is, I just don&#39;t intend to deal with it again."

My favorite was the sesame chicken with egg fried rice. The chicken wasn&#39;t spicy but had lots of flavor. I really enjoyed the egg fried rice. And they served a ton of it. 
The orange chicken was okay. I thought it was a little tough and stringy, but it could have been because I ate that the next day. They gave me so much that I could eat the orange chicken for 3 meals. 
My wife likes Lo Mein and the chicken and veggies. She enjoyed both very much and liked China Chef much more than our usual place, Joy Asian Cuisine. We will definitely come back here!"

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place, ever since I walked past it a few months back. So when dad suggested a drink on the patio - I was game! After sampling a bite, and a drink - I&#39;d return already.

PRO&#39;S: 
+ Location is killer and is embedded with other amazingly good restaurants worthy of a try.
+ Pearl street is totally walkable and fun to bar hop!
+ Food is great - we sampled the crab beignet&#39;s - which were stuffed with crab, corn and perfectly fried. SO delicious and hit the spot :)
+ Venue itself is insanely nice - with a full oak bar, rooftop and patio. It exudes a relaxed yet upscale vibe, without the snootiness. 
+ Drink menu is vast and offers so much to choose from. Mom and I opted for a classic red wine blend, while the boys stuck with a local brew and mixed beverage.

CON&#39;S:
- Staff is nice but slightly awkward. Rob, our server, actually said he wasn&#39;t  confident in the menu, but suggested a few items we might find tasty. He also glowed about his previous workplace (another restaurant), which I found to be odd and not complimentary of our current location.
- Parking is a nightmare in this area - as it&#39;s all street parking, but I&#39;ve always found a spot just a couple blocks off Pearl.

I&#39;d like to sample more of their southern fare, as everything looked delicious, fresh and full of seafood - my favorite!"

Amazing decor on the first floor (the rooftop deck wasn&#39;t open so I didn&#39;t get a chance to check it out which was a bummer because it was a beautiful night at sunset)

The waitress was very nice (and I completely forgot her name although she told me). So I&#39;ll admit it, we probably came off as difficult because there were a few things we didn&#39;t like and a few things we liked:

Fried Green Tomato Caprese  - great flavor &amp; nice crisp on the fried tomatoes

Bacon &amp; Scallops - This was a misleading dish. As you&#39;ll see from the pic, the bacon was like a big huge slice of fatty bacon. Not even pork belly ish, just bacon. It looked like a pork chop but was mostly fat. My friend took it to task and picked out all the meat but it was just not what we were expecting based on the menu description.  The flavor was good though! The server was sweet enough to take them off our bill.

I ordered the Vinho Verde wine which was delicious. Then I switched to prosecco which for some reason seemed flat even though it was from one of the smaller individual bottles. It was a mystery.

To continue with me being difficult, when I went to the restroom, the toilet wouldn&#39;t flush and had no water in it so I had to come rolling out and tell them and they all felt badly.

Overall a good experience, just would change up the description on the Bacon &amp; Scallops"

The restaurant? Not a winner.

Sat at the bar which I usually love and ordered their corn and crab beignets, a wedge salad with the blue cheese dressing on the side, and a glass of a nice Oregon pinot noir. The wine was reasonably priced and delicious. The beignets were neither. Waited for well over a half hour for them to arrive and when they finally got there I searched in vain for any taste or even small sign of the advertised &#34;lump crab&#34; they were supposed to contain. None to be seen anywhere in the dish. They tasted like corn hush puppies that cost a ridiculously high $13. Left half of them uneaten. The salad while served with a very nice blue cheese dressing had it slathered all over the plate instead of being served on the side as I requested. 

Bottom line? Won&#39;t go back. Lots of great places around these days so no need to settle for mediocrity. Sorry. I wish you good luck, but . . .

I&#39;d actually say by itself it&#39;s worth 5 stars. Denver loves a great patio and I&#39;m no different.

I&#39;m not saying the food is bad by any means! Just that it&#39;s not the culinary equivalent to atmosphere. South Pearl has a lot to live up to with Gaia, Izakaya, and even Khaos on the block. While Fourteen Seventy Two definitely fits in terms of style, the food could use an upgrade.

My husband and I came here for brunch last weekend. There was a farmers&#39; market on Pearl with a booth directly in front of the street level patio. We got there right at 10 am and were told the patio waitress wasn&#39;t there yet.

We waited a few minutes at the bar then promised we&#39;d be low maintenance if they let us go upstairs. It was well shaded and exactly what I wanted. I can&#39;t say the same for the bottomless mimosas or bloody marys.

The fried green tomato caprese appetizer. Had it not been drizzled with balsamic vinegar it would&#39;ve been good. The bread for breakfast sandwich was massive! My husband&#39;s biscuits and gravy was more like chili and gravy. Both entr√©es were okay, and due to previous reviews I wasn&#39;t expecting better.

The mushroom burger wasn&#39;t some processed mass put on bread, oh no it was not. It was chopped up mushrooms formed into this delicate, HUGE patty.

Top it all with cheese and coleslaw.  I know, I wasn&#39;t totally sold when I ordered but after one bite, I was in love.  Really really good...I want to do a healthier version with baked sweet potato chips and remove the cheese and coleslaw...or try a healthy version of the coleslaw...hmmm

Short story: come try the food.  And eat out on the patio or on the roof deck if you can."

We now make it a weekly ritual of going to the farmers market on Pearl St. and this place in conveniently located in the middle of it.

I really have nothing bad to say. Tylee was our server and she rocked.  Funny, friendly, and advised us well on the menu.  They have southern food with a little bit of a twist.  Jess got biscuits and gravy, but the gravy was green chili (pretty damn tasty too).  I had possibly the best chicken and waffles ever.  The portion was too darn big to finish off and still feel good about myself so I made Tylee take it away as I cried a little.  

The decor reminded me exactly of what I&#39;ve seen in New Orleans, the patio was nice but a bit cramped.  This is probably in our top three favorite brunch spots now, you can bet your sweet bippy we&#39;ll be back!"

Got the She Crab soup and it was really delicious. My husband ordered the rack of ribs, which very easily came off the bone and had great flavor. I had the fried chicken, which as a whole, was exactly what I was looking for. It came with two boneless chicken breasts, perfectly breaded/fried. Sides were macaroni and cheese and asparagus. Both were delicious, though i thought the macaroni was a tad too cheesy and the asparagus was the really skinny kind, so i couldn&#39;t pick it up with my silverware.

After looking at the menu, I was excited to give it a try. Let me start by saying that our server was awesome. He was attentive, funny and was the only positive thing I can attribute to this restaurant. 

If you are starving, DO NOT GO HERE. Their service is slower than molasses. I&#39;m happy to wait for food when the server tells you certain menu items will take a certain time to make, or if the place is packed. The restaurant wasn&#39;t even half full and it took about an hour to get our food...most of us ordered salads without protein. We then waited another 30 minutes to get the dessert we ordered for her birthday.

When we got our salads, one of my friends noticed there was MOLD inside the raspberries on her salad. Raspberries can go bad really quickly, but really? At a restaurant? I should have ordered the dressing on the side because it was SOAKED in it. A wilted salad with moldy raspberries for $12? I decided to add shrimp to my salad for $9....I got 3 medium sized shrimp.....for $9?! Unreal.

I won&#39;t be going back here. You can get better food, at a better price, that doesn&#39;t take an hour."

I thought the atmosphere was cozy upon first walking in. There were only 2 other tables of patrons there so it was pretty quiet, and with a whole place pretty much empty we were sat at a table right up against another group and up against a door which at first seemed a bit odd. Thankfully, the table didn&#39;t end up to be drafty and we weren&#39;t completely bumping up against the other table, though it might have been nicer to have had our own space for conversation since there were plenty of tables, but I guess we could have asked to be moved too. I made a reservation online, but they had to set the table up once I got there...when they weren&#39;t busy.

Our server went down the menu commenting on various items as &#34;#1 seller&#34; which applied to many of them and seeming was his way of making an interesting recommendation. 

We went with the fried green tomato caprese as an app which didn&#39;t disappoint (though I don&#39;t think it was a #1 seller). The tomatoes were cooked very crispy with out being greasy. 

I am from the south and LOVE shrimp and grits, but sadly have found most places that serve it out here to be disappointing, especially Lucille&#39;s.  That said, the shrimp and grits here was outstanding.  I had it on the goat cheese grits.  It had a very strong smokey flavor that was different but delicious. There was way more sauce than grits and shrimp so I asked for some bread to go along with it so that I could enjoy more of the sauce. We were brought a small 1/2 of a cibatta roll that was about the size of a pop tart, but it helped hit the spot. 

My friend had the salmon; the presentation was great and she said it was really good. 

Our service after the initial part of the visit was appropriately attentive as not to be overbearing but to allow us to enjoy the food and our chat. 

If you haven&#39;t been in this area before, it&#39;s right by Sushi Den. Just go ahead and park 2 blocks away and walk over. It is not worth the headache to try to fight for a spot close (which isn&#39;t likely anyhow).  I made the mistake of circling around for 15 minutes trying to find a spot and never saw anything just for this place and it wasn&#39;t a big night for dining out.  You also need to make sure to pay attention to the parking signage in the area since it is heavily residential. I saw several DPA&#39;s out issuing tickets. 

That said, I would definitely visit this place again &amp; would really like to check it out in the warmer weather to get to enjoy the patio."

Think southern fusion cooking.

I had the lamb and bison meatloaf with vindaloo sauce - wow! I ordered meatloaf, and with vindaloo sauce you ask? Yes. It made me completely rethink how meatloaf should be served. The zesty vindaloo went perfectly with the lamb and bison. The seasonal veggies were extremely flavorful as well with plenty of garlic, and the bourbon sweet potato mash was tasty too, though I would have liked a bit more influence from the bourbon.

The lady had the southern fried chicken, which was out-of-this-world good. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the batter was so well seasoned that I joked it had crack in it. She got it with the mac &#39;n cheese and the bourbon sweet potato mash, and I have to say that their mac is some of the best we&#39;ve had.

Service was very nice too, and the decor is very nice. So why not 5-stars? There are two levels - the upper which appears to be more quaint and quiet, and the lower which is still a dining area but has the bar and can be very loud. We could barely hear each other across our table due to the Saturday night crowd at the bar. However, I will say they have a nice little craft beer offering that I was not expecting. No Falling Rock or Freshcraft, but not too shabby for this type of establishment.

In short: awesome food, and next time we&#39;ll try to sit up top."

So, I thought we&#39;d try it again on a nice day.  And, today was a very nice day indeed - especially to sit out on their little patio.  So, off we went.

Pretty quiet today but not totally deserted like on our last visit - front patio was full.  The owner gave us a nice table for four (just the two of us).  Very comfortable and just enough sun to keep the chill off.

I still have somewhat of an issue that they don&#39;t have a &#34;lunch&#34; menu and if you are paying full price (sans coupon) it&#39;s probably more expensive than we would normally do plus you cannot be in a hurry.  Service is not what you&#39;d call quick.  Can&#39;t imagine you could get in and out in an hour.  No problem for us and we didn&#39;t mind the slow pace.

As she almost always does when they are on the menu she had the mussels - blue PEIs, andouille sausage, sweet onion, white wine and ciabatta (not house made) - $14 but a generous bowl full and she ate every one with gusto.  I couldn&#39;t make up my mind but their 1472 house burger sounded tempting - 50/50 venison and beef, fried green tomato, caramelized onions, red eye gravy, melted swiss on a brioche bun - $14.  It was cooked a perfect medium and as big as my head.  Had to whack it in half to begin to approach it and only managed to dispatch half.  Really excellent fries on the side.

I thought the food was amazing and with our &#34;deal&#34; we only shelled out about $15 plus the $13 for the coupon (she had a glass of wine so that bumped it up a bit).  They hype their open to 6pm &#34;happy hour&#34; which I don&#39;t consider happy at all.  A Bloody Mary was $5.95 on HH - cant imagine what it costs at non-happy hour prices so I passed.  

Netting it out - nice location, lovely patio on a gorgeous Colorado afternoon, and excellent food.  I&#39;d go back in a heart beat - especially if a &#34;deal&#34; comes around again."

So here&#39;s what happened: On Sunday, my boyfriend  and I were visiting the farmers market and stumbled upon your patio. We
 figured it was the perfect place to break and enjoy brunch before  walking back through the market. It was a beautiful day and absolutely perfect for patio brunching. The hostess was awesome and sat us  immediately. After we were seated we were completely forgotten about
 and then blatantly ignored. We smiled and made eye contact with every employee that came near us thinking maybe we were just sat in a bad location. We were looked at by a blonde female server and a dark haired male server twice on two different occasions yet no one
 approached or even smiled back. We began to feel as though we were a problem that no one wanted to deal with. The restaurant was not busy by any means and there were open tables. After sitting there for about 15 minutes the hostess came and sat another group right next to us.
 She looked at us, asked to take one of the chairs from our table and then left. We didn&#39;t have any drinks so it was pretty obvious that no one had helped us. We then started to question what in the world was going on. Everyone knew we were sitting there yet no one wanted to
 help us. After sitting there almost 20 minutes we gave up. We approached the hostess stand and asked for the contact information of a manager. This is honestly the best part of the story. Not only did the hostess provide your information but she provided a card and explained how to contact you and that you are also the chef. What she didn&#39;t do was ask us why in the world we were asking for this information. The blonde server was standing right there as well.
 Neither of them even bothered to ask us what was going on or what happened or offer to help. I&#39;ve never been so disappointed in service. I&#39;ve had bad service but never a complete lack of service. Needless to say, we won&#39;t be going back and after being ignored by those I contacted; I hope no one attends this restaurant."

Hmm not too good for a Saturday afternoon, but- lots of yummy sounding appetizers- so we stayed. Fried green tomato capresenappetizer is a 5++ amazing! Tuna tartar- (where perhaps the menu would have enlightened us)- not a fan at all, the lemon overpowered the entire dish, it was difficult to tell the quality of the tuna the way it is served- def a disappointment. The bacon/scallops ehh- not a huge fan of the bacon back, the scallops tasted amazing though. Pork nachos were good (BBQ pork also amazing)- just the chips left much to be desired.

Came with friends and they loved everything.  I was a little bit more on the &#34;it&#39;s okay&#34; side.  Two of them split the low-country boil.  It looked good and the portion was generous.  Three had the shrimp and grits, which received raves.

I had the steak sandwich, which was flavorful but so, so tough.  From the bread to the meat, I felt like a big dinosaur ripping apart a smaller dinosaur with my teeth and my tiny, tiny forearms.  The potatoes that came with it were a cold, greasy lump.  I don&#39;t know what they were but after two bites I was done.  

The corn and crab &#34;beignets&#34; were really just overly fried fritters.  Not sure what the fuss is about I thought they were greasy and tough.  Devilled eggs were the blandest I&#39;d ever tasted.  Totally forgettable.

The manager and servers are really nice.Patio seating was soaked with the sun. They also were OK with the free flow champagne rather than the mimosa.

But when it comes to the order, way below average. Mine and the friends&#39;s order was mixed up and they gave me the exact opposite than what I wanted. Somehow my vegetarian omelet was pathetically half a plate with 3 pieces of bacon. I had to order two sides because the food was not enough.... who knows each side of coleslaw costs $5.

We came here for Brunch.  The time for the Brunch was at 12 noon.  We were seated immediately coz we had a reservation for a Party of 7.

We were seated &#34;inside/outside&#34;, next to the Bar.

We shared and ordered this items :

*  Steamed Mussels ($12.00)
*  Corn &amp; Crab Beignets ($10.00)
*  Conch Chowder ($10.00)
*  Seafood Salad ($17.00)

My friends opt to order these following items :

*  1 Seafood Salad Bowl ($17.00)
*  2 order of Grit Cake Benedicts ($22.00)
*  1 Gator Benedict ($13.00)
*  1 Chicken &amp; Waffles ($14.00)
*  1 Biscuits &amp; Gravy with Option of Scrambled Eggs ($10.00)
*  1 Bottomless Mimosa ($9.95)
*  1 Key Lime Pie
*  1 Coffee ($2.50)
*  1 Bloody Mary on the Rocks ($6.00)

There were plenty of Alcoholic Drinks, that my friends consumed which I lost count aka to note.

Our lovely Server her name is Lori.  I think and feel that, that morning/afternoon, this establishment MIGHT BE Understaff.

It took awhile for our food especially the &#34;SHARED APPETIZERS&#34; of Steamed Mussels, Corn &amp; Crab Beignets and Conch Chowder to be ready.  ALMOST Like to about 45 minutes from the time we were seated and order our food.  When the food came out, ALOT OF FLIES SWAMPED TO OUR Table.  I so wish that the Staffs or The Management can do something about those FLIES.  

We took notice that the Bowl Of Steamed Mussels, ALOT OF the Mussels were LEFT UNOPENED, hence we voice our concerns, and our lovely server rectify the problem immediately.  After a few minutes of waiting, we get a FRESH NEW BOWL Of Steamed Mussels which, the Broth Tasted Way Better than the First Bowl Of Steamed Mussels and the 2nd Batch/2nd Bowl, ALL The MUSSELS are open, aka GOOD To Be Consumed. 

Everyone like what they ordered and shared.  The SEAFOOD SALAD, was indeed plenty to share around.  The highlight dishes were the Corn &amp; Crab Beignets.  EVERYONE Likes the Corn and Crab Beignets THE BEST.  Though I think at first glance, the Corn and Crab Beignets were &#34;Over-Fried&#34;, the Corn &amp; Crab Beignets were Crunchy outside, lots of &#34;Juicy Shredded Crab Fillings inside with plenty of  Corn.

The Conch Chowder, though the broth is flavorful, UNFORTUNATELY there are NOT Much of Conch inside the Chowder, more to dice potatoes and other vegetables in it.

I was VERY Disappointed with my order of Ceviche ($13.00).  Too much of Citrus aka LIME in the Ceviche.  The Tuna tends to be &#34;over-cooked&#34; by the time it reached to my table.  DEFINITELY NOT ORDERING THOSE AGAIN.  My Bad...  NOTE TO SELF : DO NOT ORDER THE CEVICHE, from a &#34;Southern&#34; Establishment...

All in all, its AN-OKAY Establishment to dine in.  To RETURN its a MAYBE, BUT NOT IN A HURRY.  Since it was a BIRTHDAY Party for a friend, 6 of us, shared the cost and each of us paid about $35 which includes tips and tax.  

Take note they included the 20% Gratuity in the receipt since we have a PARTY of 7.

We got the Corn and Crab Beignets, which we were told was the #1 seller of the restaurant. They were very rich, but my partner loved them. I then ordered the Southern Style Chicken, which was a huge portion of chicken, mac n cheese, and broccolini. Very good, and I make my own fried chicken. My partner got the smoked pork sandwich with ham and gruyere, and this was the really stellar dish. We saved most of the sandwich for dinner, after eating there for lunch, because we had so much food, and it was STILL AMAZING. Even after being re-heated in the toaster oven. Now I want to go back and just get that pork sandwich. My partner and I are both good cooks, and we cook our fair share of southern food, so impressing us is hard. That pork, though, was phenomenal. 

Surprisingly, my least favorite things were the mac and fries. The fries were a bit hard, as in, undercooked. And the mac was good, it just wasn&#39;t the star of the meal. 

The price is a little high though, so this will have to be a special occasion restaurant."

We stopped here for brunch before heading to the farmers market. The place itself is really nice. It looks like a place you would see in the French Quarter. 
We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the 20 minutes of sunshine that graced Denver last Sunday. Our server Tylee was really friendly and fun. We ordered bottomless Bloody Mary&#39;s. 
Jeff had chicken and waffles. It looked amazing. From my couple of tastes I almost developed food envy. Lucky for me my biscuits and gravy were amazeballs so food envy was avoided. I liked the spin on biscuits and gravy. Instead of heavy white gravy they use green chili with bison meat. And the ginormous cheddar biscuit was so good!
We noticed on the menu that they have brunch appetizers. We didn&#39;t order any ourselves but I think this is a genius idea! Everything on the menu looked amazing. 
I will be going back to try the gator benedict and the fried green tomato benedict. 
Everything was affordable. Portions were huge. Everything was tasty. Fantastic service. Yup, we&#39;ll be back."

The fried chicken is a staple and always hits the spot.

Classy interior, great patio, non-pretentious attitude. My friend and I split the macaroni and cheese and the chicken and waffles. No complaints. The Mac and cheese had Panko crumbs topping it and had a gooey cheese mixture. The chicken and waffles - fried chicken, off the bone, not-too-greasy white meat layered on top of a fluffy buttermilk Belgium waffle with maple syrup and bacon bits. Phenomenal. Happy hour until 6, so we each had a $5 glass of house wine. Huge portions. Could&#39;ve had one entree and split it and been contentedly full. Instead, we are everything. And as full as we were, very pleased. Attentive waitstaff as well."

I think it is so cool how they have bottomless breakfast drinks (although they need to update their online menu, it is $12.95 not $9.95). Also, you can switch up your drink. So if you want a bloody, mimosa, cape cod, or screwdriver, or several or all of the above, you got it!

There was a TV close enough for us to watch some of the game which was nice, glad it wasn&#39;t a bunch of in your face TV&#39;s but was there for those who were interested. 

I was originally going to order chicken &amp; waffles but the fatty in me just couldn&#39;t do it when I found out it was a pulled chicken and not fried. That sounds gross on a waffle.

I had the breakfast sandwich and the fancy potatoes, forget what they are called. They were out of sausage though, bummer. Most of my table ordered the breakfast sandwich and everyone was pretty happy with it. Hubby had the steak &amp; eggs which was so good! Someone else had a burger and it was just okay, nothing special. The deviled eggs had a great flavor.

Lauren did a great job, she had to take care of several tables and managed to pull it off. Although drinks did take a while, it was just because she was swamped. Good thing they have food runners.

The bill wasn&#39;t too startling, but it is a nice place so don&#39;t expect cheap. There was a 20% gratuity added to our bill since we had 9 people there.

Highly reccomend!"

It was cold and rainy; perfect weather for comfort food!  I had the fried chicken with macaroni/cheese and veggies.  YUMMY!  I&#39;d say it was the best fried chicken I&#39;ve ever had!  And the mac/cheese was VERY tasty!  My friend had a sandwich (???) that she LOVED and the goat cheese grits, which she said were pretty good.

I ordered a blackberry basil cocktail-not too sweet, good. The fried green appetizer was delicious. The crab corn beignet was pretty good, a little on the cold side for our taste. After 2 of them you get your fill. The fried chicken with Mac and cheese was tender and tasty. Mac and cheese was average+we think its always relative to your taste. 
It&#39;s a restaurant worth checking out. I would give it it 3.5-4. Overall good just not a wow."

I&#39;ve been three times now and can&#39;t say that any one thing will get me to go back or recommend this place to anyone else.  The customer service is terrible - plan on waiting.  The food only subpar - had The Fourteener Burger which was very bland.  Memos are all juice.  Moonshine for every mixed drink to keep a southern vibe...not all that good.

We went yesterday and the place looked packed - we were told the wait was 45 minutes despite seeing four tables open.  My friend went in to ask about them and we were all of a sudden sat right away.  So much for 45 minutes?  Once we finally sat at a table in the bar, we waited over 20 minutes without a waitress stopping by...despite asking for service.  We also tried to order drinks from the bartender directly who disappeared for just as long.  Needless to say we got up and left without spending a dime.

Each time I&#39;ve gone here it seems so disjointed, the food is lack luster, and no one seems to care.  I&#39;m honestly surprised this place has stayed in business so long.  Don&#39;t waste your time or money...unless you simply want a cold beer on a warm day, it just won&#39;t seem worth it."

The biscuits were good.

The patio area hostess was completely MEH.  We were never given menus at the bar.  The mojito was okay, but it seemed sweetened with something besides simple syrup.  Like maybe some chemical sugar substitute.

We were seated at a table in the pet area.  No one ever came to the table after that.  I had to get up and snag a guy.  He seemed surprised.  What a joke.  He was a good server once we got him, except he never brought the BOTTLE of wine to the table.  It seems they have a huge disconnect between the server and the rest of the staff....

Food was pretty good EXCEPT the pathetic scallop and bacon app.  They actually took a couple of scallops, sliced them on the round, and then tried to pass them off as several scallops instead of two--not to mention horribly over-cooked.  A totally lame app.

The fried chicken was terrific and so was the mac and cheese.  I also really liked the catfish."

  The scallops with bacon appetizer and the green tomato caprese were both big hits.  Rather than the expected bacon strips the scallops came with large smoked bacon chunks.  I thought the bacon might overwhelm the scallops, but no.  The fried green tomato slices came atop generous rounds of fresh mozzarella atop a ripe red tomato. A delight.
I ordered the beef ribs.  It was topped with a small lobster tail, sided with potatoes gratin and asparagus.  All perfect, though more potato than I wanted.  
C liked her order but half her plate was shell macaroni in cheese, twice as much as she could eat.
R and S both had the shrimp and grits.  Large shrimp, tasty grits, but twice what a person could eat.  They would have liked less but with some sides.
Dessert was the peach bread pudding.  Delicious.
They were out of Zinfandel, I had a Pinot noir.  R had a Lagunitas.
Service was superb.  Tab was $160 for four with appetizers and drinks."

The owner was walking by the door when we arrived so he greeted us and was very welcoming. My husband and I are from the south and we recommend the shrimp and grits here, as well as the crab beignets. Mind you that the dishes here are not authentic southern dishes, but they are southern dishes with a twist, which makes them unique but still delicious.
The fries green tomatoes caprese was such a surprise! Light and super tasty. Try it!

This place is big on Southern flavors. Portions are great and they also serve bottomless drinks: mimosa, bloody mary, screw driver, and a cape codder all of which are interchangeable. You can definitely get your fill of booze and linger over breakfast.

The building the restaurant is housed in is great. They have a roof deck, an outdoor patio and an indoor patio as well which is where my friends and I dined. Perfect on an overcast day. 

At 11am when we stopped by this place wasn&#39;t busy at all which I was shocked by given its location and also it&#39;s very delicious menu that&#39;s different from what all the popular places in town offer.

My friends and I enjoyed the Fried green tomato egg benedict, chicken and waffles, and low country skillet. I personally enjoyed the low country skillet but wasn&#39;t crazy about the way the crawfish were cooked, but the chicken and waffles dish i tried was so good. A great combination of sweet and savory.

My friends and I said that we would decidedly come back here again.

I only gave 4 stars as there is a little bit of lack of attentiveness by servers."

Also, they take reservations which can be a lifesaver when not trying to wait around for hours, thus wasting your whole weekend day.

I met up with some girlfriends for brunch on a Sunday and was more than excited to be able to sit out on the patio (and be warm) in the fall. They have a great patio--perfect for dining and people watching. Two stories of patio, in fact.

I started with a Bloody Mary, because that&#39;s what you do.  It&#39;s brunch, ya&#39;ll. We shared the barley salad which i promptly tried to recreate at home the next week.  Arugula, barley, cranberries, apples and goat cheese...yum.  Then, I ordered the grit cake benedict and was more than pleased.  The grits were good (although I&#39;m no expert) and the shrimp and the creole sauce were on point.

Our waiter, Tom, was outstanding. Went through the entire menu with us, told us what he liked what he didn&#39;t care for, things to substitute other things for. He awesome and attentive. We did the bottomless brunch and he brought out pitchers for our table to share. They were never empty, he was always replenishing them. 

Now the food was AMAZING. We got the fried green caprese to start it was amazing. We had also asked how the She Crab soup was and he ended up bringing us a sample just to try it. Everything looked great, their green chili with biscuits and gravy was delicious. I got their breakfast sandwich, also really good and huge as well. Nothing I would complain about at all.

We searched brunch places for hours when we came across the menu here. Everything sounded amazing with it&#39;s Southern twist. We were also very excited to enjoy bottomless Blood Mary&#39;s. 
I called at 10 to see if we could make a reservation. The host was very sweet and gave us the good news that there was an opening for our requested time. When we arrived we were seated in the little sun room area towards the front. It was a bit chilly, but in less of 5 minutes of being there the general manager Josh moved a heater closer by because he noticed we were still wearing our jackets inside. Such service! It only got better from there. Josh helped us out on deciding what dishes to get. While we were deciding he kindly brought out a generous sample of their house made biscuit and chili. He said we had to try it! It was absolutely amazing. The biscuit was a perfect pairing with their flavorful meaty chili. 
We ended up choosing the French Toast and the special which was a slow roasted Pork Benedict. 
The bloody Mary&#39;s were perfect but lacking a garnish (celery, olive etc.) I had suggested pickled okra as a garnish and they brought some out for us. Then later as I was looking around I had noticed that others were now receiving the pickled okra in their bloody Mary&#39;s!!! 
The French Toast was so good, it had a coconut and frosted flake crust, topped with rum soaked pineapple. 
I will be back the next time I&#39;m in Denver. Thanks for a wonderful experience."

We ordered beers at the same time we ordered our food. They arrived about 15 minutes before our food did. 

We waited an hour for our food. 

I ordered the 1472 burger, medium. When it arrived it was a bit over cooked, and little dry. The flavor was good, but would have been amazing if prepared correctly. My fries were leaning toward the cold side. This is a big failure. 

My mother ordered the shrimp, and avocado salad. This too was very disappointing. The salad came with 4 shrimp, and very few thin slices of avocado. For $16 there should have been a half dozen shrimp and half an avocado on this salad. 

All in all we wasted over 2 hours for a mediocre meal. 

Our server was pleasant, but very slow. The overall experience was bad, and I won&#39;t be recommending this place to anyone. 

It&#39;s getting 2 stars because the burger has potential."

If you like creole/Cajun food in a relaxed atmosphere with good jams you should come by.  Conch stew, collard greens, grits, and so on. I live in the neighborhood and its an easy go to.  The service can be on the slow side sometimes, but if you&#39;ve ever been to the south you&#39;ll know that&#39;s the norm so chill out.  Don&#39;t be such a foodie diva."

The blue crab and corn beignet were ridiculously rich and delicious; I&#39;ll be thinking about them &#39;til I can get back for more!  The fried green tomato caprese was OK, but there were large slices of red tomato at the bottom that were out of season (and so fairly tasteless).  This dish could be tasty in the summer, I&#39;d give it another try.  The bottomless, mix-and-match cocktails at brunch (bloody marys, mimosas, cape cods, screwdrivers) were awesome.  Our server Rod was friendly, funny, and professional.  We loved it, and when we&#39;re in Denver, we&#39;ll definitely be back!"

This is where we go during &#34;brunch rush hour&#34; because Gaia and the other restaurants have a 45 plus minute wait, but 1472 always has a table.  Which says a lot.  

The pros:  Attractive facility, friendly staff, great patio and balcony, a unique twist on the standards - meaning their chicken and waffles is roasted chicken, not fried, and their biscuits and gravy are not with sausage white gravy, but are with green chili.  

The cons:  The friendly staff is slow, their bottomless mimosas have a bottom that I found many times - and have had to ask for a refill, and have had to wait quite some time for said refill.  The WORST though, was when, FOR BRUNCH, they couldn&#39;t provide coffee.  COFFEE!!!  We had to go next door, stand in line forever at Stella&#39;s and buy our coffee there.  :(  They don&#39;t offer up the children&#39;s menu unless asked for, even if they see a 7 year old in the party.  

We will go back, mainly because of the location and the convenience of being able to seat a large party instantly.  I will give dinner a try sometime too.  South Pearl is a tough block though - and you really have to bring it a step up if you are going to compete with Gaia!"

Intrresting story on the building... Love the laid back atmosphere. I had the lamb/bison meatloaf with the sweet potato mash and my lady had fried chicken with mac-and-cheese. Both them were a delicious fresh take on a comfy old favorite. I would recommend this place to anyone. It&#39;s a nice place that is not in downtown.

They have a great looking place in a prime location with friendly staff but the food was just plain bad.

It reminded me of something off of Kitchen Nightmares when Gordon goes in and the Chef says his food is a &#34;10&#34; and then Gordon finds stuff rotting food in the freezer. The food was poor, all of it. I had the blackened catfish, as did one of the other in our party. It was greasy and just bad. One of the others had a burger and it was over cooked and dry. The potatoes were like something you would find in a cafeteria. All in all I&#39;d avoid this place.

Sorry for the harsh review but with a place like this you need the honest feedback, your food is no good. I&#39;d post a help wanted sign and find a new chef."

I dislike wasting money on shitty service and meh food.  Started off with Veronica the tender of the bar giving my pal cream for her coffee.  The cream curdled in the coffee, not normal and The tender, in a condescending tone brushed it off.  Food was mediocre and The tender added gratuity on our 5top!

I went here on a date. We were seated immediately on their street-level patio. They have an upstairs patio too - so much outdoor seating. It then took at least 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table. That was a complaint with this place. They seemed to be very understaffed. The staff were very friendly but they need to hire more people.

We started with drinks - their beer list was pretty good. We went in mid September and they still didn&#39;t have Pumpkin beers or Oktoberfests so I settled for a Porter. We also ordered an app to share - the Roll of Monte Cristo. SO good! 

I wanted to have the Goud Soup but they didn&#39;t have it yet - mid-September, you&#39;d think they would. Instead I had the Bacon Wrapped Jumbo Scallions over sweet potatoes and apples. That dish was really good! The bacon wasn&#39;t as cripsy as I would have liked, but the rest was great!

My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles - very tasty and a very large serving.

Definitely worth stopping by. The food is all Southern and the patio is lovely. Be flexible with the menu and you&#39;ll love it."

We asked The Google for guidance and were led here to Lowdown Brewery. 
Our server, Danny, was awesome. I had a great Milk Stout and Julie had the namesake IPA. Ok, ok, we each had two. We had a smoked trout app plate and, as intended, it just made us hungrier.
What the hell. We ordered the Taos Pizza and built another from the build your own list.
The pizza was great, the beer was better and Danny, the self described Concierge of Denver, even helped us plan our Palm Springs trip in February."

Luckily close enough to my hotel was Lowdown Brewery, and they didn&#39;t close until 11pm, which allowed me enough time to check into the hotel drop off my bags and head out for a drink. I arrived to find a rather empty taproom, with only about 6 others which is to be expected on a Monday evening around closing time. Anyways we took a seat at the bar and were greeted by the friendly bartender who gave us a quick rundown on their beers. Much to my surprise they had over 10 beers on tap, so we decided to order two flights and just do a tasting of each.

My favorite was the Lowdown IPA, with a subtle ruby red grapefruit, tangerine, and pine flavor. I also tried the Nitro Lowdown IP which in my opinion which wasn&#39;t as good as the regular LowdownIPA.  Other greats were the Fest in Show (Oktoberfest) and the Tripel which were light and refreshing while delivering an excellent taste. My least favorite beer of the night was the Patio Pounding Pilz &amp; the Tuggie Milk Stout, however I won&#39;t say they were bad, just not my taste. Dirty Shame was a pleasant surprise, as I usually don&#39;t like darker beer, however it was much better than I had expected. In addition to great beer there is also a pretty extensive food menu available serving up a variety of items, however I didn&#39;t manage to order any food this visit.

Overall Lowdown is a quality brewery, with extended hours that have you covered until at least 11pm, even later on weekends. Even with all of the breweries in Denver Lowdown is worth checking out, they have beer to fit anyone&#39;s taste!"

The food that was served to us is farm to table concept (which was amazing!) I especially enjoyed the fresh vegetables that we got and the homemade sauces that came with our meal. 

But the service on the other hand, was a complete bust. The older guy that was waiting on us wasn&#39;t the greatest. The place wasn&#39;t busy at all. There were a couple of tables and a couple of people at the bar. Ended up having to go up to the counter just to ask for the bill and to go boxes (waited for 20 minutes for him to come by). Then another 15 minutes went by until he came and dropped off the items. Then ended up taking the bill up to him in order to get our bill paid. If I didn&#39;t take it up to him, we would have waited even longer to get everything done."

I feel like the food and beer have both slipped in the past year or so. The kitchen seems less inspired than it was in the beginning. I&#39;ve been underwhelmed with the food the last two times I&#39;ve eaten here, and feel like Lowdown is probably more in the 3.5-star range.

I got the pilsner beer and it was delicious. Also, the bbq chicken and the margarita pizza were both incredible. I think that his brewery should get more attention than it does.

My beer was good, not great. Maybe I&#39;m just not a beer snob and can&#39;t tell the difference or something (and I fully admit my beer palate isn&#39;t that refined), but my white ale was nothing spectacular. I feel like I could&#39;ve gone to the grocery store and gotten a Sam Adams white or some version like that and it would&#39;ve tasted just as good. 

My pizza (I got the Lowdown) was sub par. It was good, but again, something I could&#39;ve gotten in the freezer aisle at target. It was filling and tasted alright, but I would recommend you eat before you come here. 

I will say, I really liked the place though. The inside has exposed pipes, you can see the giant things they keep beer in (whatever it&#39;s called) and there&#39;s a lot of wood which gives the place a cool vibe. 

They nailed interior decorating, just wish they had nailed everything else too. On to the next one i guess."

I&#39;ve been to this place quite a few times and am usually pretty happy with it. A variety of beers and food make it a good place to come to - not many breweries also have a full kitchen! The chicken sandwich, chicken thunder thighs entree, and hummus are all good options. I was pleasantly surprised with the Moroccan spices on the chicken entree.

His wit, charm, and good memory make you feel very happy with your decision to join  the other relaxed and hip customers at this convenient Capital Hill spot. 
I usually leave with a growler of Selfish or the IPA. The Golden Shower was an early summer favorite and a fun beverage to order. I love the ability to order beer in different sizes because the selection is really worth exploring. 
The kitchen does a great job with the pizzas and especially with the unusual ones such as pulled pork and scrambled eggs. Some of the other item I&#39;ve had left something to be desired. The aluminum plates don&#39;t help.  But it&#39;s clear they care about food as well as great craft beer."

We&#39;ve had LowDown on our list of places to visit for close to a year, right before moving from Broomfield to Lakewood. Met a couple at one of our favorite breweries, NightHawk, who RAVED about Low Down. Ok, ok, we said. We&#39;ll go. 

Thank goodness for the iPhone reminder app!! Tonight was THAT night. 

LowDown has connection - the beer-tenders are awesome: immediately friendly and generally awesome. Very attentive and with great energy. 

LowDown has great (no, fantabulous) food... We had Devils on Horseback as an app (we could&#39;ve eaten 59 more) and then we ordered the Beetza pizza. Anatomy? Crisp and thin crust, beet pesto, prosciutto, kale and goat cheese. Interesting combination on paper, and really tasty in your mouth!!

Atmosphere? LowDown is a great space - the feel reminds me of a bit industrial, simple and clean wood bar... Exposed piping above, well placed colorful prints interwoven with black and whites... Games galore behind the counter. We heard sounds of laughter behind us.... You sunk my battleship! Auuggghh.... Jenna blocks hitting the floor.... Rancorous laughter! Not too loud though, rather a nice mix mingling with the Will Smith Pandora radio station (think Ice, Ice Baby... And the song that played in Dangerous Kinds (side bar - great movie!) 

I know you already wanna go... And I haven&#39;t even gotten to the beer yet!! Take a look at the pics of the menu from other Yelpers... Really cool names! We both orders &#34;The Ale Otherwise known as..... Porter&#34; (re)named in honor of Prince&#39;s recent passing. Prince had some skills on bass.... He has a solo posted on YouTube - very impressive. Who knew? 

Back to the porter.... Only a few words needed here: 9.0 ABV. SMOOTH. Chocolate notes with banana and apple hints. Yep, I could have had 59 of this one too.... Good thing we had to catch a movie, otherwise, might&#39;ve had to call a cab instead, lol.

I ordered the the Beets by Nick -Roasted beets, goat cheese, herb-roasted carrots, spicy pumpkin seeds, pine nuts, red onions, arugula, herb vinaigrette.

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon hungry for lunch and thirsty for beer.  The waiter was super attentive and at our table within seconds of us sitting.  He quickly got our beer orders and passed out menus.  It was tough to decide but I went with the open faced chicken sandwich and tomato bisque.  My husband tried out one of the pizzas.  Others at the table all ordered pizzas, salads, and sandwiches.

Everyone was really pleased with their meals and the beer.  We all took bites off of each others plates and there was really nothing to be unhappy with!  When we asked for refills of our beers, we were given them really quickly.

Lastly, I&#39;d like to talk about the atmosphere.  What a great one!  We started off inside as it was raining and the inside is very fun.  After the rain let up, we really enjoyed our time on the beautiful outdoor patio.  There are board games to play and lawn games set up on the patio.

Their patio is cute - nice tables with a small dog-friendly section if you want to bring your pup. There&#39;s also a corn hole set up there, if that&#39;s your thing. Inside gets super loud, but the service both inside and outside was great. The beer is delicious and the pizza was fab. If you&#39;re looking for a casual place to sit outside and enjoy a cold one, this is a solid choice."

We&#39;ve come here about 5-6 times now and it&#39;s always great.  The bartenders are so over-the-top friendly they just make our day.  Even if they didn&#39;t have great beers we&#39;d continue to come for that alone.

And speaking of beers - I usually warm up with the patio pounding pilsner, which is appropriately named.  I could drink this all day long.  So I usually switch to the Lowdown IPA or a milk stout.  Oh and you can order a Golden Shower here.  Just sayin.  Nobody even gets mad.

The only food I&#39;ve had here is the hummus plate and that&#39;s delicious.  I&#39;m interested in trying the pizza sometime, and I want to have brunch here just for the names of the plates alone.  It&#39;s also extremely spacious and has a gorgeous patio that needs to be seen not described.

I&#39;m always excited to come here and I love the warm and welcome way that we are always treated.  Keep up the excellent work!

Cheers!"

The interior is really cool and trendy which is typical around this part of town.  They have a good amount of TVs to watch the game.  Since I don&#39;t drink beer, I stuck with their house gin for around $5 a drink.  When I order talls, I expect them to come in pints.  This was more like a juice tumbler.  

They have an outdoor patio area where there&#39;s lawn games and such.  That&#39;s pretty cool.  The service here is average and parking is a nightmare."

The roasted potato side is good, although you never get enough ketchup (or whatever the provided sauce is). Brussels are good too. I had a very tasty dark ale there as well.

What is lacking is the service. I recently went with a friend who arrived before me and had to flag down a server to get a beer. Can&#39;t remember how long it took to order. We got our food in a reasonable timeframe. However, once delivered, the server didn&#39;t pay much attention to us. We waited and waited for the check. Eventually we got his attention and were able to pay and leave.

I went by myself yesterday. I had a different server, but similar experience. I got a vegan happy hour plate and the roasted potatoes. Then, the lack of attention began--and this was around 4 p.m. and it was not busy. I ran out of water and was very thirsty after eating the salty but tasty potatoes. Eventually, the server refilled my glass. Then I waited and waited to get the check. I tried to get another person&#39;s attention and failed. I thought my server would stop by after he dropped off food two tables over, but he didn&#39;t. So I waited some more. 

I needed to get on with my life, so I just left some cash on the table and walked out. 

I really want to be able to go this place, but the service needs to improve."

This was my first time here, so I was really looking forward to trying it with said friends&#39;s recommendation. The weather was gorgeous that evening, so we headed straight to the patio and shared a picnic table with a couple at the other end. The environment was a cross being backyard-y and beer garden-esque, and very comfortable for a casual weeknight dinner. 

Being IPA lovers, most of us ordered the Lowdown IPA, which I found to be very crisp, refreshing, and well balanced. The four of us also split the large pizzapodopolous (did I spell that right?), which was so delicious we nearly licked the pan. 

If you&#39;re looking for a chill evening hangout in the Golden Triangle area, check out Lowdown. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

I had the delicious house salad with grilled chicken, arugula, figs, jicama and toasted pumpkin seeds.  It was huge, filling and so tasty.  Often a house salad is a lame combination of lettuce, a few boring veggies and some gross cheese, but this was anything but.  

The beers we had were good too.  The pale ale was my favorite, with good hoppy flavor.  The Belgian white was also good (just had a taste), and nice and dry.  My husband&#39;s Golden Shower Belgian strong ale (not actually served warm directly poured into mouth) was excellent.  My least fav was the pilz, which tasted ok at first but the more I drank, the closer it tasted to Miller Lite than Stella.  But everything else I&#39;d say was above average for a small local brewery (not that there aren&#39;t a million really good small breweries in Denver, and most better than a lot of the larger ones).

Our server was super helpful and cool, and we hung out until they closed at 11.  Word of warning, the kitchen closes earlier (I forget if it was 9:30 or 10), so make sure to get your order in."

I was dragged in here as a party of a welcoming party for an in-law.  Maybe I&#39;m a craft beer snob, but aren&#39;t stouts supposed to taste, you know, stoutlike?  I had theirs here and it honestly tasted like a Fat Tire with molasses in it, there was really no richness or depth of flavor at all.  I also had some kind of ale, which also had underwhelming flavor...so much so that I don&#39;t even remember what it was. 

But what really brings them down is the food.  I got their Korean ribs and green chili pork tacos and my wife got their chicken parm sandwich.  First off, the chicken parm sandwich was nothing like it was described; it was a chicken club.  Which would be fine, but the bread to filling ratio was so high it&#39;s a miracle you could taste any filling at all.  My ribs were DRY.  Like, bone dry.  Impossible to eat without allowing first to soak in BBQ liquid for a solid 30 seconds, and even then were uncomfortable to eat.  The only thing really worth eating were the tacos, and they were average at best.  They had green chilis, and they had pork.  Done.

The worst thing was the fact that I spent 60 dollars for this meal with two drinks.  Way overpriced; they&#39;re pricing themselves in a market where I couldn&#39;t possibly give them three stars.

The downtown crowd loves this place, however.  They were packed to the gills when I went in.  So who knows, maybe I just picked the exact wrong things."

The space is pretty cool and would actually be a good place for a larger group to eat and drink and I did like my beer (Treason) but the pizza was just okay.

The space is nice with plenty of seating. There is really nothing to break up the noise though, so it gets very loud when it&#39;s a full house and it can be difficult to hear your party.

I need to add a disclaimer to say, I am not a beer drinker. My sisters love their brews and had good things to say about the selection and their orders. My cousin really enjoyed the sour beer in particular. 

The food. We ordered the hummus plate to share. Meh. I love hummus, I consider it to be a food group all on it&#39;s own. The &#34;Big plate&#34; offered 2 kinds of hummus with a selection of crudites. The hummus choices had too rough of a texture like it wasn&#39;t blended long enough and was very bland. Generous portions, but very bland. There were 4 of us and we didn&#39;t finish it because it just wan&#39;t that good.. I ordered the Vaca Sagrada which is an Indian dish of spiced veggies stuffed into a tortilla served with mixed greens and quinoa. I was immediately disappointed when it arrived. It sounds like a substantial dish, but it was a fairly small portion of the &#34;stuffed tortilla&#34; and the greens &amp; quinoa were lackluster. Almost no dressing, very little quinoa. Booo. I was sad. I think it can be difficult for some places to really pull off vegetarian or vegan offerings well and sadly this was the case here. I do appreciate the effort for inclusion, but flavors were lacking. My sisters are not vegetarians and had regular sandwiches (chicken parm &amp; the Havana) which they both raved about. So for them, this place was a big win! For me, not so much.."

We were there to watch football and do some drinking, so food wasn&#39;t the main event, but we did split the margherita pizza.

Pleasantly surprising healthy and hearty salads at a brewery? Even Better!

A solid line up of brews? Now, you&#39;re talking!

This somewhat new local brewery is busting at the seams with a lot of opportunities of fun. The inside space is expansive with plenty of seating and standing areas by the bar. Overhead, there are flat screens for those sports fanatics out there. But the real winner is the patio. Perfect for those ubiquitous sunny Colorado days - it&#39;s complete with corn hole, bike racks, picnic tables, and dog friendly folk with their furry friends! 

The beer in which I indulged was tasty and went down smooth. I had the staple Selfish pale ale with grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple complement and the American Red Ale. Both were delicious. But not as delicious as the House Salad: a medley of dried apricot, toasted pumpkin seed, tomato, jicama, shaved carrot,
mixed greens, gorgonzola vinaigrette. So good and an unusual find at a brewery. Good beer and healthy food. It&#39;s a win, win"

--Hanover Fiste (testifying about Captain Lincoln F. Sternn in the film Heavy Metal)

I am not sure how relevant that quote is, but it comes to mind every time I walk into Lowdown Brewery.  And, I have walked in here several times now.  There are several things to like about this place.

1) An actual parking lot!  I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoy this.  One winds up paying for parking in so many nearby places.  It is nice to pull into a free parking lot and walk right into the patio area.

2) The space.  Lowdown is roomy, with large community tables.  The patio is significantly nicer than at most places.

3) The beer.  I am pretty happy with most of what I have tried.  They have a few beers that always seem to be around, like the Selfish (Grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple complement this pale brewed with all Pilsen malt). And there is typically something new for me to try on each visit.  And there are guest taps as well.  The non-happy hour pricing is now $5.75 a pint (which seems a touch high).

4) The food.  I have had mixed experiences on the food.  Some things I thought were quite tasty, and others I found to be just okay.  The food prices might seem a bit higher than one expects, but you cannot beat the convenience.

5) The staff.  Friendly people, solid service."

This is one of those I wish I knew the recipe so I could make it at home, but I kind of don&#39;t because I&#39;d eat it every day and be fat. It goes great with the homemade pretzel bread they serve with it. For our meal we split the beet pesto pizza. The beet flavor was surprisingly not too strong which was good, and you could really taste the goat cheese and prosciutto. To wash it all down I ordered the American Porter which I liked because it wasn&#39;t overly heavy, and didn&#39;t have any smoke, so you could taste the chocolate notes.

However, beyond that it really does nothing to grab my attention. Denver is filled with great brewery and restaurant options. I would suggest Lowdown try to be goof at one or the other, instead of just ok at both.
  
It is not like the food is bad. There is just nothing creative about any of their dishes. Everyone is doing wood fired pizza. It&#39;s like the third place I have been to with devil on horseback( bacon wrapped whatever). Also by doing a weird variation on Gumbo you completely (deconstructed if you will) made it unrecognizable. It&#39;s a simple dish that is not broken and doesn&#39;t need to be fixed.

Now the beer. 
Oh you have an IPA that lacks hoppy flavor, a white ale that tastes like a flat blue moon and really not a lot of others worth mentioning. This is Denver. My suggestion is bring the creativity, and flavor or don&#39;t plan on being open much longer."

I had ordered the big cheese and it was just plain terrible! I couldn&#39;t even stomach the rest of it. I ordered the happy hour green chili pork tacos hoping that they would make up for it and they weren&#39;t that great either... they were just so so. I generally like the ambiance of this place, it&#39;s great for drinks with friends. But I wouldn&#39;t expect to have a good meal here. However, the staff was awesome."

Maybe it&#39;s because I foolishly don&#39;t come here when it&#39;s cold outside. That is an error I will have to fix in the winter, because Lowdown is too good to not come to regularly.

That being said, their patio is my favorite in Denver, which is why I can often be found here when the weather is nice. Plenty of room with a cornhole game area, bike parking, and nice big umbrellas at every table!  Servers are all fairly attentive and friendly, even outside away from the bar. They also tend to be easy on the eyes...

Their menu is seasonal, and that includes the beers. I haven&#39;t had a beer I dislike here yet; the White Ale and Selfish are two that I always enjoy that are usually available. It should be noted that this is a brewery, so most of the beers are made in-house with a guest beer or two in the mix. Plus, if you like a particular beer, they sell growlers. If I have one complaint, it&#39;s that I miss beers I&#39;ve tried previously that haven&#39;t made a reappearance, like the Sinister. First-world problems, right?

Everything I&#39;ve tried on the food menu has been delicious. The Devils on Horseback appetizer and Chopper pizza are two regularly-appearing items that are definitely worth a try. Seriously, why aren&#39;t you here yet?"

1)They have parking. In a town where parking is becoming a premium. This makes it easy to go to and not have to circle for hours or park a million miles away.
2) They have an awesome patio. Great for summertime. Lots of tables and also some spaces to play games on.
3) They have food! Not a food truck. An ACTUAL kitchen. Two thumbs up. My favorite thing to come out of there so far is the Kurt Brussel. The boyfriend would probably say his favorite is the devils on horseback... but Kurt Brussel wins because so much bacon and so much roasted brussel goodness! Pizza is always good although be warned the Salty Dawg really is VERY salty. I probably wouldn&#39;t order that one again.
4)The beer. Always have a good selection. Something new to try most times we&#39;re in there and bartender is friendly and willing to describe beers. Last time a server brought us a round to try after we found out about a beer that was available but not listed on the menu. Great customer service.

A great neighborhood brewery with a good bar menu and good service!"

The beer selection is plentiful but not overwhelming. The descriptions are exactly what you need to make your decision. Still not sure? Ask for a tasting as the waistaff is more than happy to oblige. 

The food--pizzas are amazing. As a petite asian girl I can easily finish a personal pan pizza and have room for a few bites of dessert. I got to try the Lowdown and Smurfette pizzas. The thin crust was on point (not cracker thin). Boyfriend tried an entree. Looks like all the entrees are seasonal. He had the buffalo braised short ribs which were a knockout.

I would describe this place as easy: easy to park, easy to dine, easy to chill in my very casual attire.

I am really glad our friends who live in Denver took us here. It was a real treat before heading back to Texas."

When the wait staff found out it was his bday they all stopped by to wish him a happy bday!  He felt very special. I tried the beet salad which was delish and as always, the homemade dressings are the best!!  My husband had the &#34;pork drumsticks&#34; which sounded odd but were unbelievable!!!  They are a must try. The kids of course loved their pizzas and there were no leftovers. 
There is something for everyone in the family, at Low Down."

First off, I am tickled that this joint is located in my hood. Secondly, they did an AMAZING job prepping for their opening. They had a very successful soft opening and I can&#39;t wait to frequent this establishment in the future!

Family friendly, this place has a kitchen that serves fun foods with some vegetarian and gluten free options. Their low down potatoes were great and the raspberry chocolate dessert was mouthwatering! 

The beers were really good! I loved the pilz, the Scottish style Lonely Sheep, and the Bessie stout, also available in nitro. They can be enjoyed in samples,  1/2 pints, full pints, and growlers. They did a great job of having enough product for their very busy first week! 

The place is designed well. There are a bunch of seats at the bar, some free standing high top tables and a lot of large community tables. Which are cool, but not my ideal. I anticipate this place becoming very successful and think they might need more standing room for those just wanting to perch and drink.  The best parts of the design include the high wooden ceilings, the concrete floor that I think is left over from MapsCo, and the ladies bathroom! Seriously, I LOVE the restroom design! 

The staff was fabulous! We met a few of them and they were so friendly and welcoming. You can tell that a lot of thought went into developing Low Down, and it has resulted in quality! Thanks for enhancing the hood LD!"

The vibe of the place is pretty cool, there were some people playing board games when we were there and a variety of sports on the TVs.  Almost everything on the menu is a terrible pun or just plain ridiculous name.  

The beer was just ok.  My pilsner was fine, but was a bit lighter than I expected.  Most of the beers are fruity, which may or may not be your thing.

The food was excellent, though.  This would be 5 stars if I was only talking about the food, but I sense most people come here for the drinks.  I got the tomato mozzarella basil pizza (Marge-Simpson).  My friend got the Hatuna Matata, which is in open faced seared tuna sandwich that also looked delicious (and also came with some delicious looking roasted potatoes)"

Never got a chance to play cornhole. The food selection was awesome. My boyfriend and I shared a salad and pizza. We were blown away with how fresh our meals were. Beer selection was also great. Only reason I&#39;m not ready to slap the 5th star on is because our waiter was a fucking weirdo. Zero social skills, very disengaged for a dude that works in the service industry."

I&#39;m not a fan of the sports bar layout with 15 TV&#39;s hanging from the wall.  I have tasted several of their beers and have never been blown away by anything they have served.  I will continue to visit this place because my wife and I can count on them serving us a better-than-ok meal.  We prefer to go to breweries that have food trucks parked outside, but it&#39;s hard to depend on food trucks sometimes.  

Again, their beer didn&#39;t seem like anything special to me.  I didn&#39;t leave feeling like &#34;I need to get back here to have a pint of that!&#34;  like I do with my more preferable breweries (e.g. TRVE, Great Divide, and the new Alpine Dog Brewery)."

The long bench seating gives it a fun social vibe and the beers are very good.  The bar food here is well above average and for me at least, the bigger draw.

Once for sunday brunch I remember having a chorizo breakfast pizza.  Sounds weird, but trust me, it is worth that extra work-out you are going to have to do to burn those calories.  Fantastic flavor, and a pizza you will not soon forget."

They have a good selection of beers that they cycle out seasonally and decent food.  I&#39;ve tried a few things over my visits there and it is all pretty good food.  Pizzas are one of their more popular dishes.

They also have TVs playing sports games live and yard games such as Cornhole on their patio.

The servers are all nice and professional and will give good recommendations of beers and food for you.

The ambiance is very casual and friendly.

One of their bigger draws is their variety of board games.  Come hang out with your friends and play some fun games that you can turn into drinking games.

All in all its a fun place to hang out for a casual night out and offers good drinks/food, but it doesn&#39;t really stand out from any other bar.  That said, I continue to go back."

We were able to sample all 11 of the beers that they brew in house (the waitress was great about making us a sampler try, even though typical tasting flights are not on the menu. It turned out that each one was around $2.  The highlights were the Tripple (super apricot-y and rich), The Russian Imperial (very rich, almost raisin-like) and the Lonely Sheep Scottish Ale (very nutty).

This place is not only a brewery though, it also has a full menu. My group of 3 shared 2 of the small-size pizzas-plenty for us all. We got the Papa Smurf (pancetta, blue cheese, brussel sprouts, onion, hummus) and El Blanco (mozzarella, artichoke hearts, garlic, arugula, goat cheese).  Their super crispy crust and plentiful toppings made these a great addition to the beer.

The atmosphere was nice--very spacious and cool, although we arrived right when they opened for lunch, so we were the only patrons (at first). The service was great and I am totally ready to go back, next time I am in town."

The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the bartenders are all really friendly and knowledgeable.  They know how to explain each beer and aren&#39;t afraid to give honest opinions on any of them.
I have tried all of the beers offered and I have to say that all are tasty. Dirty shame is my favorite in the current line up. 
They have a big patio out back with lots of seating and corn hole. It&#39;s a great sunset watching patio for summer nights. 
I have tried their hummus plate. It was good, the hummus was flavored well and they didn&#39;t skimp on the good veggies.
Last time we were there I noticed their brunch menu. Everything looked great and was creative. Sadly we had just had brunch elsewhere but we will be headed back soon to try out the breakfast goodness. We also saw that they have bottomless mimosas for brunch, a must have for any self respecting brunch spot!"

I do have to say it&#39;s looked good, as I&#39;m always about trying out a new brewpub.

I finally got my chance to go for a co-worker&#39;s birthday lunch, as I work just a few blocks away.

I will freely admit that although I liked the vibe when I walked in, I wasn&#39;t sure of the menu-it was like a lot of brewpubs menus, but maybe a little smaller and not quite as much traditional fare-for example, I don&#39;t think they have fries on the side?

Before you call me stupid for judging them on whether they have fries, let me assure that by the end of the meal, I was calling myself stupid for doing so.

Ultimately, I decided to make my own pizza, a 10&#34; with ham and pepperoni. For beer, I ordered their staple pale ale. Both were excellent choices! My pizza was ridiculously good, and the perfect portion-I was able to eat the whole thing without feeling overstuffed. The pale ale was great as well-very balanced and refreshing. My co-worker got a flight of the majorities of their beers and also said each was great.

The cherry on top is the service-very friendly, very attentive, and very quick. 

We ended up coming back the next week again to have lunch, and I think this could very well turn into a regular lunch spot. The food is delicious, the beer is great, and the staff is very welcoming and friendly.

Yelp had some good reviews (only 4 of them since the place was rather new), but it was lunch time and we decided to give the place a go...Starting with a table full of sample glasses, we enjoyed all the brews but the barleywine and tripel were the stand-outs.

Their drink specials are decently priced for happy hour. I would consider this a gastropub for sure since their food isn&#39;t the typical burger, fried foodapalooza menu you&#39;ll get at any old local neighborhood dive.

All around it&#39;s an awesome place to be. What&#39;s not to like? Slammin&#39; beer, great food, awesome service, inexpensive, local, roomy, fun...it&#39;s like perfection. Let me give the Lowdown...pun intended.

When it comes to salads one doesn&#39;t usually think a brewery would have one of the best in town but this place does. I love the Et tu, Brute salad is my favorite and it&#39;s awesome. Add some pancetta to that and you&#39;re golden! The selection of sandwiches is also great and they are tasty and huge.

The beer is very good and they offer great rotations of certain brews. No matter what your flavor there is a solid beer waiting here. Plus, they have cocktails available for the non-beer drinkers who are always dragged to breweries. On the weekends this place can get really packed but that&#39;s because it&#39;s got an awesome location.

In Denver it&#39;s all about having a great patio and Lowdown has succeeded. Not only is there plenty of room, a great view and ample seating but there are fun games to play as well. Never a dull moment at this joint!

The inside is awesome as well: bar seats, high top tables, community style seating and your basic sit down tables for families. Yes, kiddos are welcome and to my surprise they don&#39;t annoy me at this brewery. The atmosphere is laid back and really cool. I don&#39;t think I would ever turn down the opportunity to stop in and enjoy some goodness."

I have had their buffet n really enjoyed it.ordered from their menu n loved it.
The idly is jumbo sized after a plate of idly I wasn&#39;t able to finish my dosa :). The cooks/ server are really generous with ghee on top of idly/ vada sambhar.

My only issue is the restroom. Needs very through cleaning."

This is exceptional Indian food-and- VEGETARIAN alert!  This is authentic vegetarian Indian that would make most folks give up bacon forever....

The food:  Other reviewers swooned about the DOSAs- so we of course tried some, having never heard of these delightful Indian crepes made of rice and lentil batter.  Naturally GLUTEN FREE, peeps, these dosas will knock your socks off.  They are the biggest damn crepes I have ever seen, literally rolled out longer than my forearm, and stuffed with yummy things.  Try a Dosa.

Also notable were the Coconut Chutney, please draw me a bath...I dipped everything into mine.  Delish.

The British Boyfriend, slightly dubious about the vegetarian thing, was so ecstatic about his dinner that he actually showed emotion by smiling- so this place is clearly his new favorite.

A wonderful wonderful hole-in-the wall gem found in a strip mall in Aurora, the only teeny downside was the interior/menus/floors could have been a teeny weeny bit cleaner.  Then this would be 5 stars, strip mall and all!"

Ordered food and 45 minutes later no sight of any food.
I had to go and remind them, and still no sight.
Finally food starts to arrive, buts no spoons; I believe they want us to go the Indian way and dip hands all over the place.had  to go again to the reception to ask for spoons, and they promptly give me spoons; guess they forget that customers need napkins also. Had to ask explicitly for it as well.

Finally chinese food arrives, I had hoped they get me fork; I was probably in other space hoping for it. So I ask again and get it.

Then keep waiting for 15 minutes for my final dish, see most of the customers moving out. I had hoped after all this nagging they would have mended ways, but no I again need to goto the reception to remind them of the last order; and get the response - Oh sir, you didn&#39;t get it!!!!

All in all a horrible experience. I was with another family who advised me not to go here as there previous experience was baf and I was optimistic that they would have improved. Hoped for too much.

At the end get the answer, sir we were short of resources today!!!!!!!

Never again......"

One thing to know is that all of their food is vegetarian, but don&#39;t let that in any way stop you. I was a little hesitant at first, but when I saw their lunch buffet and tried the food I was hooked. They have a lot of different things (I&#39;m really not sure what they all were), but more than anything I was amazed that they could make vegetarian food taste that good. They had a few items that had a good kick to them (that were also my favorite) and the rice was also very good with the tomato chutney. For dessert they had a pistachio cake and dough balls marinated in honey. The dough balls were by far the best of the desserts. I left feeling very full and happy, and will have to come back again."

We came in around 7:30pm and were seated right away. It was fairly quiet -- there were around six others in the restaurant, but we were ready to chow down.

The Channa Masala was incredibly flavorful and spicy! I&#39;d say it was about an 8 out of 10 on my spicy level. It was comparable to Mexican hot, or jalape√±os in Korean soup spicy. (Does that make sense? Ha.) In any case, the masala was excellent.

The Paper Masala Dosa was HUGE. My sister and I both dropped our jaws when we saw it. We had never encountered such a thing before. We didn&#39;t even know where to begin, so we started picking away at the ends and dipped the bits of dosa in the chutney and other sauces, and it was good. Really good. The dosa was crispy, yet soft and stretchy. There was also a slightly sweet taste to it as well. There was a warm sauce (I think it was sambar?) that was spicier and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Portions were large (for us). We ended up eating half of the dosa and a third of the masala before we surrendered and boxed those babies up.

The service was not so great. The server came by three times throughout our time there. Once to take our order and two other times to bring over the food. We had to go over to the reception desk three times to ask for boxes and ask for our check. So, we ended up skipping dessert. The two guys working didn&#39;t stop by or even look at us ... Wut. Slightly upsetting and disappointing; hence, the three stars.

But, don&#39;t let the skimpy service keep you away! Do stop by, if you&#39;re craving some yummy Indian food!"

I still go because the food is just that good, but I&#39;ve never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life!  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m not Indian or if they treat everyone this way, but the servers often act annoyed that I am there, service is never friendly and always slow, and last night, my server got my order wrong and then ARGUED with me for several minutes about it rather than just fixing it.  I was half expecting to get charged for the wrong order the way he carried on about how it was all my fault (they didn&#39;t, thank goodness).  But man, the food was so good I still have to give Masalaa three stars.

Bottom line, amazing food, terrible service.  I recommend going for the buffet or takeout to avoid having to deal with the surly waiters."

Nothing about this place was good. The waiter pushed the AYCE buffet as the best dinner choice. The food was not good. Overspiced unrecognizable mush for the most part. The dosas were good when delivered to the table and hot but they were short lived as they cooled off and got spongy. The floor was sticky and my shoes stuck to the floor as I went back and forth from the table to the buffet. The pitcher of water left on each table had room temperature water and the waiter disappeared never to ask about drinks again. We did have a diligent busser that cleared dishes but didn&#39;t speak. We left promptly and indulged in a huge fro-yo as we were still hungry. We will not be back, ever."

I am going to go ahead and say it; this place has even got Saravana Bhavan beat! At this point, I can compare with dosa places I&#39;ve tried in Houston, Dallas, SF, Seattle, Paris, Amsterdam, and even some places in India. I think this is the best I&#39;ve ever had. This is a little nondescript place in a strip mall in Aurora suburb of Denver. 
We liked it so much, we had two meals here over consecutive nights in Denver. Ambiance is simple but clean. Loved that they served in all steel and no paper or styrofoam. Place was packed on Sunday and Monday night. Staff is friendly but shy and usually swamped. 
Now, Who has an awesome spicy Andhra dosa? They do. Who can make an awesome pav-bhaji dosa also crispy? They can. And best of all, ever heard of Rava Mysore Masala Dosa? They have it. Oh my god, my mouth waters just thinking about it. A crispy Rava dosa with a dry rub Mysore masala and potato filling. 
Sambar was hot, had lots of vegetables and chutneys were very tasty. We also tried the idly and Medu vada - again, best I&#39;ve had in the U.S. Crispy on outside, gooey inside - just perfect. Above all, their prices were so reasonable. For these prices, I&#39;d never get table service, real plates, let alone this level of taste and freshness anywhere in Texas.

For South Indian food novices, here is a key : Dosa is a complicated and difficult to make item. It&#39;s like baking, all the ingredient balance has to be perfect else they turn out soggy or thick or tasteless. So are chutney and sambar. Anyone can make samosa or chicken tikka masala. Dosas are thin crepes made from a lentil based fermented rice flour. Above all, they are full of protein, vegan and gluten free. Sambar is also lentil based, chutneys are coconut based - again super nutritious, take tons of spices and hours to make. For those who think vegetarian food doesn&#39;t have enough protein, idly, dosa shuts them up. So even if someone charges you $$ for a dosa, pay up- it takes a lot of hard work. 
I&#39;d say if the world appreciates American pancakes, admires French crepes, the Dosa should be worshipped."

Both had incredible flavor. As for the tikka, watch out if you do not like spicy because it was very spicy and I am not particularly sensitive to hot food.  It was less creamy than other tikka too; this was not a bad thing at all it was just different than what I&#39;ve had elsewhere.  As for the environment, the restaurant was seriously lacking decor. The walls were bare. It would be a nice touch to see some artwork on the walls. The restaurant was small but not too cramped and it was very clean.  As for the service, it was not good.  I hesitate to include this in my review though because I think they might have just been understaffed  and incredibly busy to make it worse.  But, we literally had no server and no one came to our table for the first 45 min we were there.  We had to track someone down to order an app and then to order our entree and then to get our check and then we finally walked to the front to pay. I was on a date, and the lack of service made it slightly less enjoyable  than it would have been had we had a great server.  I have to say judging by the number of people there, and how good the food tasted, I&#39;ll probably give it another shot.  I&#39;m hoping it was just an off night."

It was 12:30pm on a Friday - buffet nearly empty - no idlis/papadum down to the last 3 pieces and the rest of the buffet had been polished off save a rice dish.  Having the consistency of a poorly set sand castle, the idilis eventually appeared.  That aside, the dosa was alright - hence, the achievement of one star.  One star for being good in the past.  Please figure out the customer service thing - it costs nothing.

If it had been 2:15pm, I would not have been so irked by the lack of food in the buffet.  As I left and paid my bill, I was given incorrect change and stared at as if I should just leave..."

The masala chai is made fresh to order so expect to wait about 20 minutes; it is worth the wait!

Southern Indian food is my favorite type of Indian food because they have dosa, a stuffed crepe like dish, the crepe being fermented rice and lentil, stuffed with veggies, potatoes and amazing spices. They had the largest selection of dosa&#39;s that I have come across so far, and I think the best I&#39;ve ever tried. My wife had the masalaa dosa, which is pretty traditional and probably what the restaurant is named after. I had one of the specialty dosa&#39;s, can&#39;t remember the name, but it was like a curried masalaa dosa, and both were incredibly good. We&#39;ll definitely be back. Just wish they were closer to my neigborhood! 

Also, this was the first time I had been there, but apparently they have recently remodeled and reopened (within the last 3 weeks!). It was very nice ambiance inside, with hanging lights, and these cool metal cups and water containers, beautiful artwork and nice color choice. Staff was very nice and helpful. Just thought I would mention that."

Having visited this place almost every week after I moved to Colorado, I can say that something has gone wrong with the chefs. We had bad experiences two times in a row. The first time my family opted for the Thursday night buffet which is usually amazing. This time all the curries were soaked in oil and all the items felt stale. I didn&#39;t want to give up on masala yet, but, I wish I had. The second time was a nightmare. We ordered two curries and the heat level asked was spicy. We got the curries after almost an hour and it was tangy as hell. We send it back and what do we get? The same curries now very hot! When I told the staff I cannot eat it as its too hot, they say I asked for it. We did get a couple new curries after some argument but those tasted stale too. Being a South Indian I know my curries and dosas. I am not going back there! It&#39;s a shame they had to go down this way:/"

The side dishes usually taste good, though on the oilier side. 
Reduced one star for keeping pooris on the buffet instead of getting some naan at the table. The pooris(if any left on the tray) are usually dripping in oil or have the feel of a papad.

I probably wouldn&#39;t have gone back after the first awful experience--imagine not being acknowledged when you walk in, being seated about 10 minutes later even though there are two other parties in the restaurant, then being ignored at the table for over 15 minutes. Drink orders not taken, naan not coming out with food then being cold when brought out, I could go on and on. Quite a bit of time passed between the first two visits (almost a year) and we&#39;d forgotten how bad the service was and remembered how much we loved the food. Went back a second time and after getting inside immediately remembered how awful the service had been. Above experience was repeated except for the second time they were not only negligent, but also rude. Mind you we&#39;re pretty easy to please people.

I&#39;m obsessed with curry and this is one of the best that I&#39;ve had. And that takes A LOT for me to say, especially for a vegetarian dish!

Lunch buffet is $8 weekdays and $11 weekends with a free Dosa (Crepe with potatoes inside). My fav from the Sat buffet was Channa Masala (Chickpeas Cooked In Rich Creamy Gravy)

I&#39;m still giving them 4 stars because I think they serve good food at a good price.

- Very reasonably priced buffet where you can try all sorts of Indian foods.  

- Clearly labeled buffet items, although I don&#39;t recall reading whether items were spicy or not, which was important to me.  Some items were labeled as gluten-free though.  

- Be sure to KNOW your common Indian entrees, curries, chutneys, etc. before dining here.  As others have stated, it&#39;s a strictly vegetarian buffet, so you can be adventurous without regard for unknown meat/seafood.  I suppose I was spoiled to the level of service I received at the local African Grill, where the owners individually assisted every customer in understanding the flavors, spice factor, regional variations, etc. of every dish on menu.  Of course, their prices reflect that additional service.  So if you know what you want, you can&#39;t beat the prices here at Masalaa.

- Being newbies, my husband and I both ordered &#34;tea&#34; when asked for our drinks and expected traditional black iced tea.  A pitcher of water is brought out to every table, so that should have been our clue that maybe fountain drinks weren&#39;t offered, but oh well.  Our server came back to our table and tried to clarify what we wanted, but we simply did not do well communicating with him - we didn&#39;t understand what he was saying and he didn&#39;t understand us.  He brought us two unsweetened cups of chai tea (sugar was on the table.)  Even though we didn&#39;t order exactly that, it was a nice treat to have authentic freshly prepared chai tea along with our lunches.  I&#39;m not sure about the prices on those, but both of our lunch buffets + chai teas + tax was right under $30, so no complaints there.

Overall, this place deserves a try.  If I return I&#39;ll order an entree, because the buffet items didn&#39;t appeal to me.  I know I like Palak Paneer, so hopefully they offer it on the menu here."

I dont know how this stuff works, its like computers are working against me to ruin everything, but I digress.

ME LIKEY. that&#39;s all i can really say .. ok, it isn&#39;t all i can say. this place was awesome. non descript strip mall restaurant with an indian market next door. parking lot has lots of sketchy &#39;15 min parking&#39; spaces that i hate. buffet was spot-on yummy and since it is a vegetarian indian place i could eat everything and not worry about goat getting in my gobi. interior isnt all fancy schmancy, just your average restauranty setup with a medium sized buffet when we were there. food was all delicious. korma was a stand out (but some were a little burnt on the bottom - maybe an issue with their buffet table) .. buffet dosa was small, but delicious. bread on the buffett was kinda blah. no spoon for the pickle, but i guess everyone just uses their fingers (or a spoon from something else) .. 

worth checking in if you like exploring vegetarian indian spots (and it wasnt too far from dry dock brewery which was why we were in the area for their vanilla porter)"

No, as a carnivore I did not need to be coerced to visit an all veggie and mostly gluten free place.  I came of my own accord with a sense of adventure.

Masalaa is located in an unassuming strip center between a Dairy Queen and a Saloon.  So if the vegetarian thing isn&#39;t for you there are options...  I am open to new things, however.  That&#39;s a good thing, as Masalaa will please.

The interior decor is not fancy.  Simple tables have individual paper placemats and silverware wrapped in a paper napkin.  Interestingly, a full water pitcher greets you at the table with metal water glasses.

Samosas are my first vegetarian course, doughy and tasty dipped in the mint or tamarind chutney.  

Masalaa is known for its dosas, but I bypass the dosas for a potato and cauliflower entree.   Mmmmm.  Called Adraki Aloo Gobi, the sauce has a hint of ginger in a tomato based stew with onions.  It comes with white basmati rice.  With no Naan on the menu I add Chapati, a roasted flatbread that falls just a little short of the slightly-burnt-crispy-soft-tandoor-fired Naan I am used to and love at most Indian restaurants.

For less than $20 including tip I have crossed over to the dark side, a vegetarian for a night.  Masalaa is so good, however, that even a carnivore like myself can forget that there is no meat to be found anywhere in this restaurant.  

If I lived closer I could be a regular at Masalaa.  Don&#39;t tell that to my wife.  She might have me in Doc Maartens or even worse...  she may suspect I am trying to impress a vegetarian girlfriend."

Just wow. I love Indian food, especially south Indian. Dosa...

This place does it right. Vegetarian all the way, but the flavors sing. The chutneys and raitas are a just right.

My friend and I over-ordered on purpose, partly b/c we were hungry, partly b/c she was taking dinner home to her husband, and partly b/c the prices were cheap. We got two appetizers (gobi and pakora). Both were very flavorful. The only complaint was that I was expecting more veggie per fry bit. I was expecting something more like a patty of spinach and onions. What was served was more like kale chips and onion rings. (not that this stopped me from eating them). The gobi were deliciously spiced.

I ordered a paper masala dosa (the huge one). I brought half of it home. We also got the chana saag (ooh, saag, how I love you) and the veggie korma. Both served with a nice big bowl of jasmine rice. 

I just wish it weren&#39;t so far away from home. Luckily, it&#39;s not so far from work. 

tip: it&#39;s kind of cold inside, so ask to sit closer to the back and away from the door."

The dosa is more than enough to feed two people.  I ended up ordering entirely too much food ( I couldn&#39;t help it....I wanted to try everything!).  If I lived in Denver, I would go out of my way to eat here regularly.

The gobi (deep fried cauliflower appetizer) is absolutely amazing.  Trust me on this; go to Masalaa and order it now.  

Everything is vegetarian, and they are willing to make anything vegan."

The restaurant itself was kind of dingy and run down, but the selection was good and the service was friendly. The buffet featured items that we had never seen before. Most of the entrees were super spicy (just how I like it!), but there were plenty of milder, starchy options to balance the flavors. The best part was the dosa (rice pancakes)--soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and served with a hearty helping of spiced lentils. I was a little disappointed with the desert selection (just ras malai and some sort of mango paste), but both were tasty. Overall, a fairly satisfactory visit (especially since it was all vegetarian!)."

I&#39;d give them ZERO stars for their business acumen and customer service skills, but alas I had to give them a one because yelp made me.  The food is great,  if you can order off the menu that is.  Unfortunately, if you go on Saturday or Sunday and they have a buffet, then you HAVE TO get the buffet.  They should just say that up front on their door  that says SAT/SUN Lunch= BUFFET only, because when we wanted to order the tasty dishes on their menu for Sunday brunch (They don&#39;t even open til Noon on Sunday mind you), they gave us all a really, really hard time.  No, like really - a tough, tough time.  They kept trying to get us to eat the buffet which was $4 more than the dishes we each wanted.  We were not hungry for the buffet. They made us feel so bad (all five us including my elderly parents visiting us from out of state), for not ordering the buffet.  We had people with dietary restrictions.  Totally inappropriate for a business to operate in this manner.  I will never return and I had vowed the same 3 years ago when we last went.  Alas, we were meeting a friend in South Denver who is VEGAN and we decided to see if they had changed their horrid ways.  WRONG!  They are still horrid.  I do not think they should operate a business in this manner but then again, I took my business and money elsewhere- I did not stay this time.  I refuse to be treated like crap. Bottom line- you don&#39;t treat people in this manner.  

Okay, all you folks out there who love South Indian food, fret not ,and give Tiffin&#39;s in Boulder a try - tell them GET CLUED IN sent you.  They will treat you with respect.  But seriously, no need to be abused at this place.  Unfortunately, this review will not shut them down because Indians love this vegetarian place and their $11 buffet on weekends.  I just wanted one dosa and was told I was a second class citizen because I did not order the buffet, and had to wait 45 minutes PLUS even though they were serving dosas to the people who did order the buffet.  Not cool.  Again, if you want good dosas, and idlis, visit my friend J. Patel at Tiffin&#39;s... great food, and great service.  They are closed Mondays. 

A good mark of an Indian restaurant is the following:  Nice greeting when you enter, the presence of some (not all) indians, and a good healthy mix of people, and clean bathrooms.  This restaurant exhibits neither-  all Indians when we go, and their bathrooms are nasty - No toilet paper at all all three times I have been in my 12+ years of living in Denver.  No wonder they change ownership so much."

A bit of trouble due to a language barrier making and confirming reservations but we had a table all set up when we arrived.  A very no-frills place but decent enough.  Tablecloths are covered with a heavy, clear tablecloth not unlike plastic slipcovers from 70s jokes.

Service was really good and there was a $10.95 buffet that night.  One of us asked the server how spicy it was because she has a very low tolerance for heat.  He told her it wasn&#39;t too spicy because it&#39;s meant for a wide range of tastes.  Okay, that sold me, too.  Lots of choices and so awesome that I can eat everything without going though all sorts of questions.  Many items were labeled vegan and/or gluten free so a very easy place to go with everyone.

Food is very different from Northern Indian menus I&#39;m used to.  Good, but different.

Turns out it was too spicy for both of us so watch out if you&#39;re also a big baby. ; )

They were so nice to do separate checks, too."

Blink and you&#39;ll miss this place, tucked in a little strip mall of off Parker Road where all the shop signage is the same.

If you want a departure from your typical saag/naan/daal buffets, head here.  The cuisine is south Indian, so there are some items you won&#39;t find elsewhere (or probably weren&#39;t even aware of - I wasn&#39;t) such as dosas.  And you know what?  If you haven&#39;t had a dosa yet you&#39;re missing out.  They bring out one per diner and it&#39;s like a big, loosely rolled fried crepe filled with spicy potatoes.  Melt in your mouth goodness, and another vehicle for scoopin&#39; up curry.

When our Yelp group went, I think our unanimous favorite was the gravy and cheese.  I&#39;m taking a real stab at it here, but judging from their website, it was the Paneer Tika Masala.  I also liked the curried chickpeas and the little fried balls (I tried to interpret what &#34;fried balls&#34; were on the website, but it looks like there&#39;s more than one fried ball variety).  Also, a great variety of chutneys.

They also have mango lassis and they don&#39;t ice them down like some places.  Nothing says &#34;stuffed to the brim&#34; like a cool, sweet mango yogurt drink to top everything off.

Pretty decently priced at $9 and not jam-packed busy.

I&#39;ve been once before for dinner when I lived closer, but it was a few years ago and I&#39;m not sure what we ordered.  It seemed like one of everything.  I need to make my way back down for dinner sometime soon and order eggplant off the menu.

If you&#39;re looking for an Indian food experience a bit out of the norm, look no further."

Lounge 5280 is on the mezzanine level above the gate level. You can people watch without actually having to partake in what can sometimes be chaos.

Pre-flight drink of choice for me is the Bloody Mary and Lounge 5280&#39;s will not disappoint.

The mix is homemade and they come with a variety of garnishes. One is a pickled green bean. They are crafted especially for Lounge 5280 by a nice little old lady.

The secret ingredient to their mix that will have you wondering???  Some of that pickled bean juice.

Oh... and for those not from around here, the 5280 in the name is a secret reference to the altitude.

I was lucky enough to snag a table for two in the bar-great comfy seats, a plug for my electronics, and free wifi-so I settled in for the long haul. Service was great, especially considering the staff were stuck in the airport too, and they still had a great attitude and worked their behinds off for all of us crazed customers.
The Bloody Mary was great, good size with a nice spice.  I also got the ahi tuna appetizer, which was quality tuna with a good cold noodle salad.  It was perfect for me, but really pretty small for the price.  In general the prices were quite high, even for &#34;stuck in the airport&#34; prices.

He suggested a Bloody Mary that was on the spicy side and suggested bleu cheese stuffed olives.  I said sure, bring one of those suckers over!  He came back with the drink AND a glass of water since he thought I would probably need to sip some of it.  The drink was so...good.  There was an asparagus stalk and green beans in the glass; a meal in and of itself.  It was indeed spicy but not so bad that I needed the water.  I sat there for a long time and was never bothered or pressured to order more drinks or food.  I did end up having another drink and did order a cheese plate as well as some olives.

The cheese plate was a nice brie that came with some walnuts and some yummy bread in a separate cup.  The olives were tasty as well, seasoned with I have no clue, but it gave it a nice flavor.  However, I didn&#39;t realize just how many olives I would get, and probably only ate half them - they&#39;re sized to share.

They have food too - but just apps and small plates.  This is where they first fell short: my burrata app came with decent quality cheese, but the tomatoes weren&#39;t fresh, the herbs were wilted, and the rosemary bread was stale. $14 for this; Jeez.

But the main issue: The wi-fi signal was surprisingly bad; Such a damn shame with everything else they&#39;ve got going on; I became so annoyed with all the drops and re-connects that I decided not to linger longer.

Note: Lots of useless pics of this place on Yelp - mostly closeups of wine bottles or cocktails.  I did my best to add more useful ones.  With that and the aforementioned location update, I felt my Yelp maintenance duty was done for the day."

On a long layover to Seattle, I found myself needing a place to peacefully do PowerPoint while charging my various electronic devices.  I stumbled upon Lounge 5280 after pigging out on Chinese food at City Wok.  I really wish I had a smaller meal so I had room to try the cheese plate and/or duck confit salad at 5280.  

1) They have 53 wine by the half glass, glass, and bottle (a little odd that they charge by the half glass, I&#39;ve never seen that before?) 
2) They have Colorado-made or owned alcoholic products.  I had the Doctor Leopold, which is not as strong as I&#39;d like it to be, but still good.  It&#39;s made with Leopold American small batch gin and Leopold orange liqueur.  I was contemplating a second drink, but then remembered that I was coming home to Seattle to see the parents, so... even the slightest hint of intoxication will be frowned upon. 
3) Friendly service and cute, quiet place that makes you forget you&#39;re at an airport!  I like that they leave you alone and don&#39;t give you a hard time for sipping on one drink while staying... forever (okay, 2-3 hours).   

Don&#39;t be fooled by the limited menu they post on the sign outside, there&#39;s actually a more extensive food menu.  My only complaint is that they&#39;re doing last call for food at 7:45pm - what?!"

This is not any ordinary Sunday discount brunch bloody mary, with watered down house mix tomato juice. The bloody mary here has body and full flavor. Get it with an infused jalapeno or bacon vodka, but if you are a traditionalist, they have several different vodkas you can get. 

I try to arrive a little early to the airport to get one of these. Even if I have a flight at a different terminal. This place is the place to get a drink and do some great people watching. It is becoming a go to place for me when I am departing out of DIA."

Since I recently learned that just about every airport has a Signature Bloody Mary and in addition to being one of my favorite libations... &#39;I ordered a diet coke w/a lime.

What, are you nuts?!... &#39;I need breakfast!

This was the third place that was serving bacon infused vodka on my short, four day trip... &#39;Hot item. Colorado loves its bacon. Yep, I could live here.

Andy B. also mentioned that I should try the bacon infused bourbon. I was ready to buy us a couple of shots but when I asked Liz if they had any in stock... &#39;No such luck.

I had eaten breakfast and still had some time to kill, so I was walking around the terminal. I saw this cool looking wine bar, and I saw that it was open. (This was about 945am). 

So I&#39;m like &#34;Ooh, I heart wine!&#34; and then I&#39;m like &#34;But it&#39;s 945am, I don&#39;t want people to think I&#39;m an alcoholic.&#34; But then I was like &#34;I&#39;m at the airport; nobody&#39;s going to care,&#34; so I sat down in a delightfully comfortable chair and perused the list.

Because I am indecisive, I went with a flight containing a chardonnay, riesling, and a brut sparkling wine. The really friendly bartender gave me extremely generous pours of everything, saying I was lucky cuz all the bottles were nearly empty, so he just emptied them out. I loved all three of the wines. The riesling had a nice (but not overpowering) sweetness, and overall a very complex flavor. The chardonnay was rich and oaky, and the brut was just perfectly flavored. I sat there reading a book, sipping my wine, and really enjoying my layover. 

After I was done, the nice bartender guy came by to ask what I thought of the wines and we chatted about different flavors, like people do at 945am, like it was no big deal at all. I gave him an extra good tip. 

Check this place out if you&#39;re in DEN, even if it&#39;s at 945am."

Normally I would spend time between flights at the smoking lounge, but I quit smoking earlier this year.  Lounge 5280 isn&#39;t listed on the directory in Concourse B, so I found out about this place when another lounge closed at 10, and one of the employees there recommended it because they are open late.

I would have much preferred spending the entire evening here, rather than the first place and its $14 martinis and boring Chili&#39;s-like atmosphere.

Lounge 5280 is stylish, comfortable and staffed with friendly, attentive people.  Their drink menu offers some inventive specialty drinks (Colorado Corpse Reviver anyone?), but I didn&#39;t stray from my usual vodka martini ($11), with a Diet Coke inserted every once in a while to ensure that I remained vertical until my flight finally left at nearly 1:00 a.m.

Every cocktail here was well thought out and and made with really high quality ingredients. With that said though, each cocktail was only 90% great, which is still 30% better than anything else you can get here in the airport.

Disappointment was the only thing we got here.  

My wife decided to get a flight of wine.  The server forgot which glass was which upon delivery, being they were all whites... my wife had no idea which wine she was enjoying with each glass.  I opted for a bourbon on the rocks, that was after my server also couldn&#39;t tell me anything about the 4 cocktails off their list I had questions on.  I will admit it was a good local bourbon.

We opted not to get food after our server mentioned that it would be so fast because everything is microwaved quick... ewk. I know restaurants use microwaves but, I don&#39;t want to know my duck was zapped... no thanks!

I think I have my wife convinced to try a beer stop on the way back!"

They will also provide you with login credentials for their own WiFi which is quite fast and much better than the standard Boingo hotspot - you just have to ask.  Being early in the AM, I enjoyed smoked salmon with egg salad on a bagel and while not NYC quality, enjoyed it much more than your typical Egg McMuffin.  The coffee was rich and not watery which I appreciated since I drink it black.  Service was terrific - no hovering but never gone for long either.

Then we ordered from the tapas menu and it was wonderful. The foods were locally sourced and very fresh. Becca was very knowledgeable about the drinks and the food. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only real drawback to this place is that it is in Denver and not local to us. We would go every week.

My only gripe is some menu tweaks...I had the mozzarella with balsamic glaze the other night...

But here&#39;s the thing - you ARE in an airport. So given that, this place is great. They have high tables and low tables. Not sure that the high tables have outlets but all the low ones do, which I don&#39;t think should be overlooked. That plus the free wifi makes this place pretty darn handy. Not a beer person but the wine selection is quite nice. I had the duck salad, which was definitely good but the duck is served on the bone (leg), which I think is really not ideal for a salad in any case and definitely not when you are cutting it with plastic knives and forks. I highly recommend to them that they cut the duck and that they also add one more salad option, maybe with seafood or just totally vegetarian. If you need a place to charge and get online in DIA then I def recommend!"

Surprisingly sopshisticated cocktails and wine that you&#39;d expect to find at a trendy bar in a cosmopolitan city rather than the Denver airport.  I can vouch for the Bloody Mary, made with their homemade Bloody Mary mix and including a spear of asparagus and picked green bean along with the standard olive.

We had no idea what to expect in going and we were a bit surprised when we arrived that it wasn&#39;t too busy given its size, and the fact that the parking lot seemed pretty full. However, fear not, Senor Ric&#39;s is one of those underappreciated restaurants that, because of its lack of appreciation, is unpretentious while also having great food. Those are few and far between in the Denver metro these days. The food while being great, also comes out in generous portion sizes, which makes it a great value. The service is also spot on.

The interior hasn&#39;t been updated since MASH was playing in prime time, and the place is covered in grime from top to bottom.  I came here with my family for lunch last week and was blown away by the fact that this place is still in business.  It took our waiter thirty minutes just to take our drink order, then another twenty minutes to bring us our drinks, then another thirty minutes to take our order.  1.5 hours later, our food arrived.  

The food is on a completely different scale of unknown origins and disgust.  I ordered a smothered burrito with a beef taco and a chicken flauta. The only thing edible on the plate was the flauta.  I couldn&#39;t even get through two bites of the burrito and had to give that up because the taste was so awful, I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to eat it.  The taco was made up of mystery meat that did not taste like beef at all.  I have no idea what they used for refried beans, but they were not refried beans, more like strained bean mystery concoction.   

To top it off, me, my sister and my niece were sick not long after we ate the food.  My niece was nauseous all day, I had stomach cramps, and my sister had prescription-strength indigestion.  This seriously has to be the absolute WORST Mexican food I have ever had in Colorado!  I am from there, so I grew up eating some of the best Mexican food in the country, but Senor Ric&#39;s is not Mexican food at all!  Taco Bell has better food than Senor Ric&#39;s.  

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all cost.  It is overpriced, the service is terrible, and the food is disgusting.  Check out La Casa del Rey in Commerce City or Las Delicious in Denver....both have amazing food!"

The restaurant was clean.
The waitress however, didn&#39;t seem to be. She has food all over her shirt and smelled like smoke. Not the best way to represent the kitchen! We also had to wait literally about 20 minutes until anyone even noticed us. There seemed to be a ton of staff but, I think we were interrupting their conversations and texting.
The happy hour menu is a joke. There is ONE margarita available and it is buy one, get one free. We ordered them and GOT THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME! So, we tried to drink the first one as fast as we could.....who likes watered down tequila? I guess if your water glass didn&#39;t get filled as much as it didn&#39;t here...anything liquid would help.

It&#39;s so sad that every time I go in for take out over the last several months and I have to deal with the owner, Jeff I believe is his name, he is such a jerk! It&#39;s not necessary to be rude to people just because you feel like you can! I haven&#39;t had this kind of experience with the other people that have helped me, they are actually quite pleasant. He seems irritated to help and take my order (which by the way, is incredibly simple. Mixed mini chimichangas). Furthermore, he acts as though it&#39;s a problem that I know what I want when I come in. I thought the last couple of times, he may have just been having a bad day, and hey, I get it! Everyday is not your day. But after today, I am over it! I can certainly find somewhere else that I get great service from someone that can offer more than a scowl and an attitude, especially when I&#39;m spending my money.

However with all the widely available mexican food literally all over the place here, I don&#39;t see any reason to ever go here, except maybe to host a child&#39;s party or something. Go for the space, i guess, or to get drunk on tequila mixed drinks, do not come for the food."

They have two happy hours, which I&#39;ve been told are common in Denver but either way, awessssommeeee!! Had a 2 for 1 beer and is I ne of Ric&#39;s signature margaritas. With the combo of Ric&#39;s special and his margarita, I want to shake this mans hand. Not only was the food great but the building itself reminds me of hanging in Santa Fe, loving it. 

What they could do better: (1) the chips should never look or seem like they came from the bottom of the bag, ours did; (2) just bring me a beer. If I walk in, your slow, just grab me a beer right when I order it, just real fast, solves so many things you (server) might fail on.

The salsa tastes like jarred salsa. I was very unimpressed by this. It was free though so that&#39;s good.

Had the green pork  chili burrito and it was terrible. The pork is chopped up into tiny pieces, so I couldn&#39;t really even tell that there was any meat in my burrito. Then they smother it in the same green chili. (The smothering everything in pork green chili is a very new thing to me considering I live along the border of Mexico my whole life and they only do this in Colorado) My &#34;burrito&#34; was basically a rolled soggy flour tortilla in a bunch of bland sauce with little bits of meat. I highly recommend not getting it.

My friend got a combination of enchiladas and tacos. From the looks of it the enchiladas didn&#39;t look to appetizing. My friend said their margaritas were pretty good. The tacos come in taco bell shells.

I am not about to try to convince you that Se√±or Ric&#39;s is even remotely close to an authentic Mexican restaurant. 

What I *will* tell you, however, is that it nevertheless offers up some very tasty food within its pretty peach walls, with eager staff flitting this way and that, ready to please. 

The Pollo Magnifico takes tender chicken and encases it in a deep-fried (I can hear your lips watering from here!) shell, then tops the lot with cream and melted cheeses. Or how about those spinach enchiladas, dense with vegetal healthitude?

Wow, how did dessert time come around so fast? Well, of course the fried ice cream always has tongues wagging. And the decadent chocolate mousse pie will have you juicefasting until 2073. 

It is any surprise that this place is so popular?"

Um, no.  Chips and salsa were meh.  We got the chile rellenos and cheese enchiladas.  Chile rellenos were your standard (for the area) canned hatch chile and greeeeaaasy, cheese enchiladas were bland.  

The beans...let&#39;s talk about the beans...who puts bacon in their refried beans?!  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even had that anywhere and it was not a tasty combo.  I suppose if you&#39;re on the trendy bacon bandwagon that&#39;s running rampant at the moment you&#39;d like them...but all I could think was that it wasn&#39;t Mexican, it wasn&#39;t even Tex-Mex.  I don&#39;t know what it was.  

Interior of the place was out dated and looked like it hadn&#39;t seen an update since maybe the late 80s early 90s.  Service was just ok.  So very disappointed.

The happy hour is great with the free chips and salsa. The 2 for 1 drinks are awesome! The prices are very reasonable with good portions. The service in the bar is marginal but in the restaurant area is very good. The staff is well trained and very friendly.
I enjoy visiting due to this establishment is very predictable. I have never had a poor visit but above average to good."

The owners and the staff are all very friendly and very good at thier jobs. We are always greated and treated like family. The atmosphere is cozy and quite appropriate. Stucko walls, tropical plants, authentic music, what else could you ask for? The bar is very nice as well. TV&#39;s always tuned to local sporting events, great happy hours (2fers) endless chips, salsa, bean dip and queso. A great place to watch a game or gather for a work or family event.

The food is always spot on. The best description is Colorado Mexican. It&#39;s not authentic mexican by any means, but it doesnt claim to be either. And to call it Tex-Mex wouldnt be approprate either. They have a unique style of food and I really think that is what they are going for! Kudos!

The Green Chili is like none I&#39;ve ever had. I consider myself an authority on Green Chili. I make my own and have tasted just about every varity there is to try. SR&#39;s Chili is a pork chili, very thick and very tasty! I always begin my meals with a bowl and two tortillias. I only wish it was a little hotter as I like my chili very spicy! The Salsa is very good as well. Always fresh, chilled and plentyful. Again though, I wish it wee a bit spicier. The Guacamole is excellent as well. My wife and I really enjoy the Quacamole tostadas! Yum!

The drinks are always good and the variety of Margaritas is superb. IMO, The folks at Senor Ric&#39;s have hit a home run. and the best part is that it is always consistant. You canalways count on your favorite dish tasting just like you knew it would. 

For all you doubters and negative reviewers, lets face facts here, you dont stay in business for as long as Ric&#39;s has by serving bad food. The parking lot is always full for a reason. Do yourself afavor and go back with an open mind. Dont go there with a preconceived notion of what you want it to be, enjoy it for what it is, delicious!

I would say the service and atmosphere was average... Nothing special, but nothing bad either.
The food was what killed it. Salsa was a little on the Light side. Tortilla chips seemed like they were out of a bag. What really killed it for me were the entrees... They came out and looked very good. Every bite was bland and flavorless. What ever you do, do not order anything with shredded chicken... It reminded of cat food... looked like it was pureed in a blender... texture and flavor was horrible. Shredded beef was bland... Didn&#39;t even have quesadilla for kids menu. Instead, a cheese crisp or a  tortillla with cheese on top, = my 2 year old wouldn&#39;t eat it because it was dry and hard. 
Was sad and filled with regret we decided to eat here.."

The pollo magnifico is sooooo good but I usually won&#39;t order it myself as it&#39;s deep-fried, covered with crema and then cheese, but really is a delight for a splurge. Chips are good, both gringo and egg-battered rellenos are good, guac tostada good, hubby loves the green chili burrito. Not a fan of the spinach enchilada. 

I suggest going during happy hour, beers are 2-4-1. Sometimes they&#39;ll set out bean dip in the bar area (which is quite large by the way and not too &#34;bar-feeling&#34;).

It&#39;s not a 4 star restaurant, but it satisfies the need for greasy Mexican food."

I think I have gone there for over 10 years. Other Mexican restaurants have come and gone. These are the main reasons why Senor Ric&#39;s is the place for Tex-Mex cuisine.

1.You get bottomless chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. The chips are warm and you can tell the salsa is homemade. I like that the salsa is fairly mild to get you started on your meal.

2. Their mini chimichangas as appetizers are magnificent. They are like fried eggrolls of chicken or beef. It comes with a cream cheese that has a hint of jalapeno.

3. Their combos are great. They have become more expensive over the years, but I have yet to find a replacement. Their tacos, taquitos, enchiladas, and burritos are all tasty. The dish comes with refried beans or black beans and spanish rice.

I rarely have room for dessert. I&#39;m a little disappointed with the fried ice cream. It isn&#39;t fried, but has a corn flakes covering. The soapapillas are tasty but could be cheaper.

This restaurant is not the place for authentic Mexican food. Also a complaint I get from friends is the lack of spicyness. I actually like this aspect of their food.

I hope you give this place a try."

The food was bad enough that after about 3 bites, we left. The food is presented well, but it lacked flavor and the servings were not balanced.  For instance, the Spinach Enchilada had one leaf present inside a good sized tortilla and a very small amount of cheese. The Chile Relleno  consisted of the smallest Chile I have ever experienced used in the dish. It was less than 2&#34; in length and the cheese used was minimal. The Chimichanga we ordered had less than two oz. of chicken inside and it lacked flavor. It looked great smothered in chopped lettuce and tomato, but so does waxed fruit. I would not give them a second chance."

I mean, it&#39;s not a &#34;home-made tasting&#34; Mexican food restaurant which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but it IS tasty none the less. I love the mini-chimis and the prices are very reasonable. The decor is nice as well.

But one thing that really takes it over the top is the wait staff. I&#39;ve been going here for at least 4 years or so since it was close to work and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. Whether I sit in the bar area or the restaurant, everyone is always nice. 

So if you ever want a quick bite to eat with a Mexican food flavor, definitely stop by here."

If anyone remembers the restaurant chain called Chi Chi&#39;s, then you will be familiar with what this restaurant is like - faux stucco, paper parrots, mexican polka, dim lighting, white people everywhere.
On the back of the menu, there is a small section called &#34;gringo favorites&#34;, which includes a chicken breast sandwich and a hamburger (both served with fries, oh boy!). What&#39;s ironic is that almost everything on the menu was mexican food for gringos anyways. The salsa was funky, as it had huge chunks of green chile in it; the chile con queso tasted equally weird and like it had been reheated; and I can only presume that the lighting was so dim so that no one would notice things like how brown the guacamole was. 
At least my crispy rellenos were tasty, although I did have to put a lot of spicy salsa on it.

Bottom line:
Bad food, and bad service. I&#39;m as white as they come, and I make better mexican food at home. Yikes."

We have a favorite waiter Miguel he is always friendly and remembers what we like and is very attentive. Now for the not so good, the last couple of visits we went and Miguel was not in so we went in. There customer service was well below acceptable the male owner/manager walks around that place like his stuff doesn&#39;t stink. He can be very arrogant and stand offish. Even though we&#39;ve been regulars for 15 years he&#39;s always been to good to come and talk or acknowledge our loyalty he could learn a thing or two from Miguel. Like a previous reviewer stated the parking lot is always full but what goes up will eventually come down and I&#39;m not wishing bad on anyone but I think there needs to be some customer service training. If the owners read there reviews which I hope they do realize there are lots of good restaurants in the area that would love to acknowledge customer loyalty.

First of all, you can sit in the bar area. No big deal, right? Except you get all the self-serve chips and salsa you can eat. And I can eat a lot of salsa. Because of this laxity with the salsa, Mr. Mixer and I usually share a Ric&#39;s platter and a pitcher of margaritas for dinner. Bonus points for a cheap meal! 

The Ric&#39;s platter is good, though. Two mini tacos, two mini flautas, two mini beef chimichangas and three miniature pollo magnificos surround a little bowl of green chili. OMG-- EVERYTHING IS SO FREAKING TINY AND ADORABLE!!! Ok, now that&#39;s out of my system. Everything is pretty yummy, too. The chili is spicy and peppery. The chimis are topped with melty cream cheese. Guac on the flautas. We like it all. I haven&#39;t had anything else there in a very long time. 

One recommendation: get an upgrade on your margaritas. The house margaritas are just too full of sweet and sour; they make my tummy hurt. The Baja margs are good."

I got a beer from Avery Brewing, my wife got their house margarita. She said it was too strong, and I saw the bartender making it, she wasn&#39;t lying.

There is nothing special about the lunch and dinner fare.  It&#39;s kind of blah, but it fills me up when I get hangry.

But if you want a monster breakfast burrito or bowl, this is the spot to be.  I tend to go for the breakfast bowl with chips on the side.  Lots of scrambled eggs, potatoes, choice of chorizo or bacon (I go for the bacon), and load it up with salsas (corn and the extra hot are my go-tos), cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.  Dip my side of chips into that cheesy goodness and all my troubles are gone.  Work problems? Off my desk.  Hangover? Dissipating as we speak.  Relationship woes?  What relationship, because I am in love with this burrito bowl.

Load it up with some Cholula in the back (which every bottle always seems to be running low) and I am feeling fantastic.

The staff tends to be a little sassy and act as if some people are a nuisance (I tend to order my meals online, and I always tend to get some attitude).

That being said, I don&#39;t believe that Illegal Petes trumps Chipotle. The one Huge plus they have is that they have queso which is awesome. Other than that I would say the food is a bit of a step backwards from Chipotle.

The guacamole here is easily forgettable and I would not recommend getting it. They do have a lot more options here than Chipotle which is awesome, but the overall flavors in my opinion were not as good. Anyone in Denver, does need to check out Illegal Petes to make your own comparison

If you&#39;re in the mood for a breakfast burrito on your way to work / while traversing downtown in general, you should make a point to swing by this place. Suggest the chorizo and green chile salsa!!

Three things:
1. Food was fast. They&#39;ve got making a burrito down to a chipotle-like science - they asked me 4-5 questions about how I wanted to customize my burrito and prep was done in a minute or less.
2. It&#39;s cheap! I got a decently large burrito (not nearly chipotle sized) for less than $5 with tax
3. Decor is fun. If a dive bar and a fast/casual restaurant had a kid, this would be it.

The staff were also talking to one another about being enviro-friendly, so brownie points there :)

And that if you skip adding cheese and sour cream, you can get guacamole for no charge! The 16th street location is right around the corner from my office and union station, perfect for downtown!

I&#39;m not necessarily the biggest fan of fast casual restaurants. They usually seem cold and bare and not entirely welcoming, but Illegal Pete&#39;s has a comfortable &#34;come and stay&#34; sort of vibe that makes me feel at home. 

I love the loud music, the crazy stickers covering everything, and all the colors and warm lighting. Like chipotle, you approach the counter and ask for a burrito, bowl, tacos, or salad. I did the steak burrito bowl for $6.99 with cilantro rice, black beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and extra cilantro. I thought it was goooooooood. Plenty of food for the price and all the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. I also got plain corn tortillas on the side, which were nice and hot.

Having a full bar and actual bartenders is what makes Illegal Pete&#39;s pop. The bar was packed at 10:30 PM on a Monday night, so they&#39;re doing something right. It&#39;s definitely a really fun atmosphere that&#39;ll cheer you up (and fill you up) when needed, and they&#39;re open until midnight during the week. I&#39;m a night owl so I&#39;m always on the hunt for legit late night food options. :) Thanks, Pete!"

So I asked where&#39;s is the best place to get it he said Illegal Petes so here we are. I noticed it&#39;s a Colorado based company kinda like Chipotle just smaller and local. They do custom burritos but obviously better than chipotle. But compared to burrito joints in Texas there&#39;s not a whole lot of options. So I gave them 3 stars because it&#39;s good just not amazing. Staff is very friendly food looks fresh and clean. Just not a lot of flavor maybe if the salsa had more flavor it would be different.

Also, everything in there just seems so coool... the staff, patrons, atmosphere, even the copious amount of stickers everywhere scream &#34;this is chill place&#34;.

My only complaint is that IP&#39;s is so popular, the parking can be tight and the line to order can get long (especially at lunch and dinner times).  But luckily I&#39;ve never had to wait more than ~10 min to order.  And of course your food is prepped right as you go, so there&#39;s no wait after you pay.

I&#39;d read the great reviews for Illegal Pete&#39;s on Yelp and tucked them away as an idea for good food later.

The vibe definitely lived up to my expectation and the Pork Carnitas Nachos that I ordered exceeded them.  Ingredients were soo fresh, prepared right in front of me and they piled them high on top of the bed of chips before covering them with glorious queso.  

How often does it happen that you run out of chips before you run out of the &#34;good stuff&#34; while decimating an order of nachos late night?  It happened to me at Illegal Pete&#39;s!"

The staff at the downtown location is far less friendly, rude and to be honest violate a ton of health codes. The food is always great- if I was rating just based on the food it would be four stars. When ordering my burrito another guest came to the counter to ask for hotter salsa, the cashier began to talk over the guy making my burrito and myself to talk with this gal about salsa in an INCREDIBLY loud voice to the point that I had to repeat everything I was requesting. The fella making my burrito proceeded to tell him he was way too loud and I say yeah that was loud. He went on to talk about himself and his loud tendencies. Dude, if someone says you&#39;re loud maybe you should quiet down a bit. 
Then I asked for limes with my burrito...when asked how many I responded with &#34;like four.&#34; In my mind this meant if they are less juicy limes how bout six, if they&#39;re on the juicier side how bout three...the cashier decided to mock me and say &#34;here&#39;s your like four limes, if you need like six let me like know.&#34; Can you say condescending? His attitude ruined my entire experience. 
While eating my burrito I look to my right and see the cashier pulling the trash can out of the receptacle. I will say he does have gloves on. He starts pulling the &#34;slop&#34; out of said receptacle with his hands and throwing it into the bin. No broom? No dust bin? Hands?! What I see next made me want to purge my entire lunch...he wiped his wet trash covered hands up and down his apron multiple times. What&#39;s worse is he didn&#39;t take this apron off when he jumped back behind the counter. 

I will not be back."

Breakfast is served till 10:30 but I&#39;d recommend getting there a bit earlier so they aren&#39;t scraping the bottom of the barrel for eggs/potatoes.  Meat or veggies are extra but green chile (your choice of pork or veggie), cheese, sour cream, and salsa are all included.  If you need coffee, they have a carafe of Pablos.

The margarita and queso were the stars of the show, followed by the carnitas burrito which was loaded with carnitas and the pork was well rendered, not fatty at all.  The quesadilla was lackluster and lacking on chicken as was the chili verde which was flavorful but had very little pork.  Being from California, the guacamole was fine, neither great or bad.

I would frequent the location in Boulder when I was a student at the University of Colorado and more recently this past month when I was visiting Denver with friends. 

The set up of the restaurant is much like that of a Chipotle.  When you enter the restaurant you order then proceed down the line letting the employee which toppings, meats etc you would like on your meal.  Its very quick and easy.

All of the food is fresh.  My favorite things to order off the menu are the breakfast burrito, literally the best one you will ever eat and the burrito bowl.  I like to switch up between chicken and steak so I won&#39;t get bored of one or the other.  They have endless options and so many great meals!

I choose the shredded beef burrito with pretty much every veggie topping and salsa. They also gave me guacamole complementary since I asked to forgo the dairy condiments. 

The staff was friendly and knowledgable they even mix up the contents of your burrito cold stone style. This gave me the perfect flavor and consistency with every bite. The best part of all is that the tortilla was fresh and not soggy. This made the burritos contents shine and kept things from entering a mushy state. 

I will definitely be back to this location the next time I&#39;m in Denver! And I&#39;m eager to try other locations in hopes that they provide a similar experience!

Ps the happy hour deals are great!"

Vegetarian, Paleo, and GF options. All the veggies are super fresh and he meat is somewhat local and organic. Score!

I usually get the &#34;basic&#34; nachos with the red veggies as opposed to green. It&#39;s a HUGE portion. The corn chile salsa is extra delicious on top.

IP also has a full bar, and luckily for moi they serve a super strong marg. 

The only thing that bothers me is the service. It&#39;s a bunch of late 30 somethings that act like its their first job and its interrupting their personal conversations to serve you. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the people who put your food together are usually great and super attentive. It&#39;s the cashiers that can be a little lame."

I don&#39;t come here as near as much as I used to, but it is always a good experience. I love that they are open later than most places in Denver and they put on great shows. The only thing I ever watch out for when coming here is the crowd; there is limited table space and it&#39;s always a bummer to stand around trying to eat a massive burrito with one hand and drink a beer with the other while you are shoulder-to-shoulder with hipsters."

Or that they&#39;re copying Chipotle. They both opened in Coloradoin the mid 90s. Chiptole opened just 2 years ahead of the first Pete&#39;s in Boulder, but they&#39;re both based on Mission Style Burritos (Which are a California thing, so there you go). So of course they&#39;re going to share some similarities. Personally I prefer Pete&#39;s menu offerings, ambiance, character, and support of local and independent music through their Starving Artists program. Besides that:

1) Queso.
2) Full bar.
3) STILL locally owned and managed.
4) Treat their employees amazing.
5) Queso.
6) Did I mention the queso?

My favorite location is the South Broadway one, if only for the space and it&#39;s a little more comfortable, but I work downtown so having a spot to grab tacos for lunch is amazing. I walk by 2 Chiptoles to get here, so take that as you will."

This restaurant is the Denver&#39;s version of Chiptole, with a bar. The atmosphere coming in feels very urban and hip. There are TV&#39;s to watch sports events and the food is good. There is a lot of room to sit.

The setup is similar to chipotle. You enter and proceed down the line with meats, toppings etc. Very quick and efficiently. The food is fresh, and there is even queso!"

Met him at Union Station, then we walked right over to Illegal Pete&#39;s for a beer and a burrito. Behind the counter a young woman named Brittany was really helpful to my friend who was unaccustomed to the options of the restaurant. Brittany was patient and funny the whole time dealing with my novice friend. She suggested a green chili burrito with half chicken, half pork. It was delicious, we couldn&#39;t have asked for a better choice! Over at the bar, Coren was friendly and outgoing, offering my friend all kinds of ideas on what to do and where to go in Denver, and suggesting some fine beer options as well. I&#39;ve interacted with this young man on a few other occasions, and always goes above and beyond for customers; I&#39;m never let down any time I go to this place- always a fun time with a great staff, I was so happy my friend had such a wonderful first impression of Denver!

You order at the counter and take your food as you pay (similar to Chipotle).  They had a variety of options from nachos to tacos and burritos to salad.  I settled on some nachos.  Smothered with queso, salsa of my choice, beans, guacamole, olives, and whatever other toppings you choose.  My dining partner went with a chicken burrito and was very impressed by the flavors.  

They also have a fair selection of bottled drinks/beers as well as a fountain machine.  The restaurant also has a bar, which appears to have a nice local/regional selection of beers on draft.

They do everything assembly style and I do think the quality suffers from that.  Eggs obviously taste better when cooked to order rather than being scooped from a bulk bin.  They also seemed to go really light on all of the fixings.  I felt the burrito should have been much larger than it ended up.  I did appreciate that they had vegetarian green chile though, as that&#39;s pretty hard to come by.

This place looked pretty legit and had some good reviews, so we checked it out, but overall were pretty disappointed.

Fish Tacos - fish was good, but that was really it.  The sauce was too creamy, tortillas weren&#39;t fresh, limes were dried out - so you didn&#39;t even get any lime juice when you squeezed the lime.

Quesadillas -  this was literally the worst quesadilla i&#39;ve ever had.  there wasnt enough cheese, the meat was tough [beef] and flavorless, and the tortilla wasn&#39;t even crisp.

Hard Tacos - taco shells tasted like they were from Safeway.  got the shredded pork, which was better than the beef - but still not very good.  

There was a Salsa Bar - but you had to ask the person behind the counter to get it for you.  The Salsa and Guac was the only thing that made the food eatable, but it still wasn&#39;t very good.  

I would not recommend this place, and i would not come here again.

I am not a fan of Chipotle or Qdoba - but I think i would go there before eating here again.

Also, for Mexican food, these prices were pretty high."

They take the time to mix their ingredients together to make the taste experience more consistent. 

The location itself is pretty much what you&#39;d expect from fast, quick Mexican. Tons of local support and stickers decorate the walls. Loud music blares over the speakers.

My one complaint is that when we arrived, the line was out the door, but after tasting the food, the wait was well worth it."

Happy hour specials were good, but just don&#39;t ask too many questions to the black girl with dreads and piercings in her face (yeah pretty sure that&#39;s also a health code violation) because she was very rude (dare i say kind of a bitch) when asking if she was going to take my bf&#39;s order on my ticket or a separate one....if she would have ACTUALLY listened to the question instead of just rushing us through the line, this review would have been a bit different.

I went with the Green Chile Burrito and a 16oz PBR and can&#39;t complain about the price. The line was huge, but these pros relentlessly kicked out food to knock it down.

Best part: when the burrito fillings are all selected they take time to mix it all into a consistently tasty burrito before the final wrap. This is not a practice I&#39;m lucky enough to experience back home.

Overall a fun atmosphere and great food."

Here&#39;s my feedback

Food: Great food for the price! I go a steak bowl and izze all under $10. Portions solid, ingredients very fresh!

Atmosphere: It pretty much a punk rock version of any Mexican fast casual restaurant. Decently busy at 3pm on a Friday. Crowd is majority the &#34;punk, rock, emo&#34; type. Lots of hard rock music, everyone&#39;s wearing black. I feel a bit like an outcast were beigh pants and a blue shirt collared shirt. 

Cleaniless: could use some serious work. Stuff on the floor everywhere, sauce spilled all over. Gives you that slightly grimy &#34;I might find a roach&#34; feeling.

Staff: fits their theme, they don&#39;t smile. They are all &#34;low key, chill&#34; type. 

Overall decent a solid 4 stars!"

What I got instead was a chipotle themed attempt at a breakfast burrito. Chili wasn&#39;t hot or even remotley close to being a chili. More like tomatoes with some green sauce. Would you like any toppings? No it&#39;s a breakfast burrito. Potatoes, egg, chili and cheese. Everything with the way it was made was modeled after chipotle. It was even portioned as chipotle would. Little damn scoops in a big pinche tortilla. Breakfast burrito is basic, simple out the door. 

Pros: I ate this morning. 
Cons: need some chili, something hot, need to pack the damn thing with the food. 

Of course this is downtown and it would be hard to find a place with good chili. (Breakfast burrito)"

For instance, I got a bacon burrito and I guess I ordered right when they were making fresh scrambled eggs.. Anyways the lady asked me if it was &#34;ok&#34; if they mixed the old eggs with the new eggs.. Why on earth would I want old scrap eggs, when you&#39;re making new eggs? They ended up giving me only old scrap eggs and were barely present throughout my entire burrito. Then the best part -- it was significantly, SIGNIFICANTLY smaller and they ended up just loading the toppings in my burrito.. WHY would anyone eat a burrito of toppings?! My burrito had folds and folds of tortilla that literally made it a condiment burrito..

I&#39;ve been a die-hard fan of illegal pete&#39;s ever since I first tried it a few  years ago. The quality of their burritos and additional fixings make it some of the of the best TeX Mex in Colorado and their portions made it an awesome value. 

That being said, my burrito&#39;s have gotten progressively smaller over the last year while the price has stayed the same. I don&#39;t mind changes but over $10 for a burrito that doesn&#39;t even make me full when 1 burrito used to be a days worth of food is insulting. If it&#39;s your line cooks, tell em what&#39;s up. Until then I&#39;ll be getting full and satisfied for cheaper at Chipotle and tipping their staff generously.

Honestly, it was overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. It does have a much more fun atmosphere than Chipotle but I&#39;m more considered with the food I&#39;m about to eat. After getting through the line, I was asked about the food I wanted... Going through the line didn&#39;t really flow. I wouldn&#39;t have layered my food that way. I got a burrito but the guy putting together kind of slapped it together.

I wasn&#39;t impressed by their green salsa either. Maybe it&#39;s because I am from Texas and know tex-mex.

The owners are such a nice couple who really care about their food.  Everything is freshly cooked when it is ordered.  They always checked that you are happy with your meal.

OK. I guess I&#39;m spoiled on stronger flavors. The gyro meat was very good. The humus, rice, and chicken where pretty bland.

I have to say, I have not been to a strip mall in a while since living in the Bay Area, but they are pretty common in places on Hampden. 

Upon coming to Gyros King, our group of 7 people found ourselves wanting to eat some Mediterranean food. I have to say, the food was A-OK for me. 

FOOD: Falafel sandwich. I must say the falafel itself was pretty fresh. The owner did say he had to make a new batch for us since we ordered so much and there was not that much left! The falafel is not the same recipe I am used to eating here in California or what I have had in the Middle East, but it was a pretty damn tasty variety and had the right amount of crispiness to it and the right amount of chickpea taste to it. Besides that though, the rest of the sandwich was a bit bland. I wish the pita was warmed or toasted, but it came out pretty cold, which was a poor contrast against the warm falafel. The tzatziki sauce was a bit bland, which made me wonder if it was homemade or store bought. It was nothing to really rave about and the vegetables it were not proportional to the amount of falafel (too much vegetable to falafel). The sandwich as a whole was so-so, which has led me to my A-OK review. 

SERVICE: Over the top friendly! The couple who runs the place definitely takes pride in their restaurant and wants to make sure everybody has a happy experience. I must say, after living the big city lifestyle for so long, I am not used to this kind of service and can find it a bit overbearing. It is a nice refreshing change of pace though from the less friendly environment. 

Overall, come here to support the local economy and a local mom-and-pop shop instead of those chain Mediterranean restaurants in Colorado!"

My wife and I both got the gyro plate that come with fries. Everything was GREAT! Some of the better gyros I have tried in the area. The best part is how close it is to the brewery which means you can grab one or two and take it over and have a beer or five. Don&#39;t get it confused though, they were there long before the brewery came along. At least that&#39;s what the sweet older lady who owns the place told me. Any ways, a great place whether you are eating in, going to the brewery, or grabbing one to go."

I was a little hungry and am always looking for a good gyro restaurant so I came in. It&#39;s a very unassuming restaurant and I immediately noticed it was run (and probably owned) by a cute Greek couple that were probably in their early 70s. I ordered a gyro and baklava. It took about 10 minutes to make, which isn&#39;t bad seeing as I could watch him grill the meat and knew it was fresh. The gyro was great, and the baklava was pretty decent. They put something that almost tasted like doughnut glaze on the baklava though which was a little awkward as I&#39;m used to it with honey. Overall though it was a pretty good experience and meal."

Owner was very friendly and chatted with me as I ate lunch. Probably one of the more authentic Gyro places around. Wish they would grill the Pita though as just taking them out of the package and barely heating them results in a chewy Pita.

Served with classic crinkle cut fries and a can of soda. This place is one of a dying breed that is not chain-owned. If you want something different, stop on in.

Recommended. This place is a small mom-and-pop restaurant. It is not five-star full-service sit down greek dining and you have to adjust your expectations appropriately. For what it is, it is a solid 4*s. Clean, if small, dining room, and small kitchen along with a friendly husband and wife team operating the restaurant."

We stopped by here before grabbing a few beers at Dry Dock. This is definitely a place to grab and go with your food because the ambiance is lacking. We ordered, paid and waited for a few minutes then our food was ready. 

I don&#39;t know why but crinkle cut fries just seem to work with a gyro. The tsaziki sauce was a little too runny and bland for my taste but the gyro was packed with meat and the combo came at a reasonable price so I wasn&#39;t too concerned about hitting my wallet too hard. The pita bread was cold which was a huge letdown as well, really, what am I missing with this place?? Maybe I did it backwards and need to visit here AFTER a few beers?

If you&#39;re getting it to go, request extra ketchup packets as they are quite stingy."

We came here after getting recommended it for dinner while enjoying brews at Dry Dock. 

The owners are a kind elderly couple, who run the back and the front. 

The good?
1. Prices: 5.99 for a falafel, 6.99 for a gyro (the shaved meat).
2. Near the brewery
3. Nice people

The bad?
1. Food quality. My pita was cold and hard...they didn&#39;t even bother warming up the store bought pita.  Too much sauce, not enough toppings. The gyro was warmer and better flavor. 

Wouldn&#39;t return. Recommend bringing in food else where."

The falafel was the best I&#39;ve had. So good and soft inside. The baba ganoush was also amazing. There wasn&#39;t one thing on the plate that we didn&#39;t devour. 

The little restaurant is run by an older couple. For one person being in the kitchen cooking, the food came out super quick. The couple was so sweet. They came out to talk to us and the kids. They also went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. If you haven&#39;t been to this place, you HAVE to try it.

It is a small family owned restaurant and you can tell they prepare their food with love and passion. I ordered the combination plate with chicken and gyro meat (lamb). I would have thought the combination plate would be bigger than it was with a salad on the side, I guess that is neither here not there, just my personal preference. There was plenty of hummus on the plate, the falafel was DELICIOUS, probably the best I have ever had. The only thing that I was somewhat disappointed in, the combination plate didn&#39;t come with tzatziki sauce. I thought this was a Mediterranean staple! So, next time I go (yes, I will be back) I will be sure to ask for a side of tzatziki on the side. 

Overall, good experience, good food, and I would definitely be back if the opportunity presented itself."

I am a big fan of Mediterranean food. I love me some gyros and hummus, but I prefer fresh and homemade. Apart from the gyro meat that was warm and freshly sliced and the veggies, everything else we got came out of a grocery store bottle or bag. Our pita that came with the hummus was still in the darn bag from the manufacturer. And it wasn&#39;t even one of the really good brands. 

It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was in no way what I would have expected from a place with a nearly 5 star rating. Perhaps the abundance of options in my current hometown of Columbus, Ohio has me spoiled?"

The lady at the front counter was very nice and the customer service seems good, but the quality of the food was bad unfortunately.  Maybe I picked the wrong item to try.  I ordered a Chicken Shawama plate.  Hummus was very runny and almost looked like it was diluted with water.  I have never tasted such bad hummus.  Chicken was made fresh and the taste was okay.  The portion was rather small for the amount I paid.  I would rather want to stick to joints like Saj Grill or Garbanzo.  They have better quality food.

YES, this is DEFINITELY a Mom and Pop establishment.  YES, you ordered at the counter.  You are welcome to seat yourself where ever you want to.  From their simple menu, we decide to order these following items :

2 order of Gyros Meals that comes with Fries and Drink ($7.50) each hence it was $15.  Hubs also decide to order the Arabic Coffee which was $2.50.  Our Dinner was about $20 with tax.  We waited for abit for our food to be ready, coz before we were there, there are like 2 other patrons waiting to have their Order To Go.

The Meals which include Fries and Drinks starts from $6.50 if you were to order the Falafel.  Then the rest will be $7.50, choices of Gyros, Chicken OR Chicken Shawarma.  Salads are between $7.25 and $8.50.  Big Plates are from $9.75 and $12.99.

The Dining area can seat about 15 to 20 people at one time.

We decide to dine in.  4 stars for the service from the staffs.  They will send your food to where you are seating.

3.5 Stars for overall experience.

3 Stars At Best For Food.  The portion with price is reasonable, and doable.  I think when we received our food, due to the cold salad that they put in the Pita Bread, with the Gyro Meat, makes the rest of the Gyro, COLD.  *Sad Face*

It DOES NOT WOW us as much as I was hoping for.  Maybe next time, if we were to return, I would order the Gyro with Plate instead.  Perhaps from there, my review could differ.

Note to SELF : Oooh NOT forgetting, I think I should brush up my Arabic Speaking skills, though the staffs definitely can communicate in English finely.

They were very sweet, and you can tell they really care about the food and their customers. That being said, I eat Mediterranean food all over the US (I travel for work), and the food here is just not very good, in my opinion! The chicken SERIOUSLY lacked flavor. That baba ghannouj was decent, but the pita was as hard as a rock (I am 90% sure it was microwaved), and the &#34;salad&#34; was just ice berg lettuce and tomato. The falafels were not bad, but didn&#39;t do much for me.

So maybe I haven&#39;t scoured Denver on a quest for the ultimate gyro, but I wouldn&#39;t exactly call Denver gyro mecca, so I won&#39;t waste my time doing that. Chicago, however, has a large Greek population and it&#39;s a good place to go to get an idea of what an authentic gryo *should* taste like. Based on past Denver gyro experience, I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting much.  But, when I walked in and saw an older Greek couple manning the kitchen and counter, I thought hmmm, this could be good!  Plus, one of the tables had a Greek family waiting for their food. Another good sign! 

I ordered the gyro meal which came with a gyro sandwich, fries, and a drink for $7.50. The fries were very good - perfectly fried and great flavor. The gyro was huge!  No shortage of meat, sauce, and assorted toppings (see the picture I posted). And the gryo bread was great too. A lot of places have a regular bready pita, but Gyros King uses the real stuff, or at least it&#39;s what I call the &#34;real&#34; stuff.  It&#39;s hard to explain, but real gyro bread has kind of a rubbery texture and doesn&#39;t fall apart on you when you stretch it around all of that yummy goodness inside.

I sit here very full &amp; satisfied after having lunch from Gyros King.  Thank you very much!"

The two owners are a married Lebanese couple who couldn&#39;t be nicer. They treat every customer who walks in like family, and the small, one-grill restaurant has the atmosphere of a nice home cooked operation. 

The gyro sandwich meal deal is a pretty good value, and the owner cooks it up for you right on the spot. The gyro meat is served warm but the rest of the sandwich, pita included, is a cool mix of tzatziki sauce, onions, lettuce, and tomato. Overall it&#39;s more of cool, light, refreshing gyro sandwich than a lot of the grilled up piping hot (and often greasy) versions you can find elsewhere. The gyro king interpretation is a version I really enjoyed. 

I am anxious to come back and try some of the platters."

Best gyro, falafel, hummus and chicken!
I personally like the plates ( combination to sample it all)

Service with a smile. Broken English but the food speaks for itself. Small menu (very vintage sign). The chef/ owner and his wife work together and have served the community off and on again for decades. 

Love the hot tea and coffee. If you saved room have some baklava."

Homemade baklava, meat cooked to order, amazing flavor in the gyros, delicious hummus. I cannot say enough good things about this place! 

The chicken was a little dry but the lamb was superb. This is the best gyros place I&#39;ve found in the area.

It&#39;s not that they&#39;re bad, it&#39;s just that they&#39;re kind of bland and unimpressive.

It&#39;s a mom and pop organization, and the speed of service will confirm that.  For two gyros to go we waited 12 minutes and it was not busy.  We ate in the car on our way to a Rockies game, and that experiment didn&#39;t work very well.  The tzatziki sauce is runny and not very creamy, more of a vinegar based caesar as my friend put it.  Not expensive, but kind of overpriced for what I got.  Maybe I&#39;ll try them again sometime."

The food (Gyros) was served rather quickly and presented fairly well. The gyros were just so-so and so were the sides. The decor was pretty mundane, kind of like the attitude of everyone else in the establishment.

Where I can&#39;t say I won&#39;t be back I can say I probably won&#39;t go out of my way to return. Business owners should treat their patrons with respect and show a little enthusiasm that they are spending their hard earned money with them. This guy obviously doesn&#39;t see things that way."

I ordered take out and it was ready in about 10 minutes! I ordered the Falafel gyro meal ( a falafel gyro, with a side of fries and a drink). This meal was SO good to me, very filling, and the falafels were the perfect combination of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. The only minor issue I had was that there was a lot of sauce dripping out of the gyro, which caused a bit of mess, but a delicious mess! I&#39;m definitely hooked! (I&#39;ve even become invested in making falafels for myself!) Oh, btw, I paid about 7 dollars and 55 cents total. I would recommend trying it! It supports small local business!"

It came with hummus, a tomato, cucumber, onion salad, rice, gyro meat, tzaziki sauce and pita bread. The rice was pretty forgetable, but everything else was DELICIOUS! It really is quite a bit of food for what you pay for it. 

The lady who was there is, as others have described, a stern broad! She seemed irritated. She seemed to try to be talking me out of getting the &#34;plate&#34; and just getting the gyro sandwich with french fries. That was weird. Also, a downer for me is that they don&#39;t serve fresh iced tea. So a star off for that and for trying to down sell me."

This is probably the best wing place I have been to.

- Decent prices by pound
- Small location
- Varied beer offerings
- TONS of sauces
- Friendly staff

I doubt they have any responsibly sources, GMO free, farm raised chicken wings here so if that&#39;s your thing keep looking. By the size of the wings I ate, they probably came from some genetically modified ten winged chicken beast raised in a warehouse. You know what though? I am okay with that.

The wings tasted delicious and they offer a ton of sauces. I recommend the pesto parmesan medium heat like most people do, for layers of flavor. I ordered four pounds of wings for $30 and it was enough for three mildly hungry people. 

They also offer a nice fried desert and various beers. The apricot blonde helped wash the wings down without altering the flavor.

My new go-to wing place."

They have a full menu of sauces and dry runs to choose from so there is sure to be something to please everyone 

They also have a full Cajun menu for those that want something different. I always told myself that when I got tired of their sauces I would order Cajun, it hasn&#39;t happened yet but a buddy of mine got the gator stew one time and I tried it. Just as delicious as the wings, if not better

You tell me we are going out for wings, my mind will flash an image of some inferno ranch wings...and endless parade of them.  While this place has quite a large variety of wings, those inferno ranch just sing to me.  They hit the right notes and the wings are just dripping with that hot awesomeness.  I&#39;ve tried a few of their other &#34;hot&#34; flavors, and all pack a good punch without sacrificing flavor.  If you&#39;ve read my other wing reviews, you will know that that is a big thing for me.  You can make the hottest wing in the world and you&#39;ll get me attention but if it comes at the cost of flavor...no thanks.  It is possible to have both and I feel the inferno ranch, along with a few other of this places flavors, hit that mark.

  The location is spacious enough but be wary, this is a popular spot.  Hit it up at the peak time and good luck finding a seat.  In my visits, I&#39;ve either been in that predicament or walked into a mildly vacant area.  Either way, I got my wings and ate happy.  Plus...holy crap...funnel cake fries.  Kiss your diet goodbye, for the night, if you want that.  It&#39;s pure decadence and carnal bliss, that is then topped with chocolate and peanut butter.  A big ol plate of &#34;Screw it&#34;. 

  It&#39;s not hard to recommend this place to wing lovers.  They serve up meaty wings, dripping in their wide variety of sauces.  My heart lies with the inferno ranch, so give that flavor a dip.  You can buy the wings by the pound, so get a few pounds and have a mouth party...and maybe try their sandwiches and other offerings too.  Plus those deliciously sinful funnel cake fries.  Eat up, minions!"

Love their teriyaki wings and they have top notch curly fries! Everything is cooked to order so it&#39;s comes out nice and fresh! The wings tasted juicy and tender while still having a nice crunch to it! The teriyaki sauce was a bit salty, but it had a nice tartness to it. 

I really like the funnel cake fries! We tried the strawberry funnel cake fries were to die for! We waited to have them served after we ate our wings so it came out warm and crunchy and we were able to enjoy them before they got cold!

They have an ish ton of flavors and let you mix match to make your own concoction. My favorite is the basic buffalo hot wings, all flats. That is my order every time I go.  I tend to try different sides such as fried zucchini, curly fries, or jalapeno poppers. This particular time however, I tried a dessert. I don&#39;t normally get dessert but the lady serving the beer convinced us to try the funnel cakes fries. The selling point was when she said chocolate and peanut butter.  Two of my favorite things together on funnel cake fries? Yes please!!
They came out glowing. Words cannot describe how delightful this dessert was. They almost melted in your mouth with better flavor than a Reese&#39;s peanut butter cup. This is the best dessert I have ever had in my whole life. Even if you don&#39;t like hot wings, or you are a vegetarian, go to Wing Hut and get the funnel cake fries! NOW!"

Like so many things in Aurora this place is tucked into a strip at Hampden and Chambers, pretty close to Dry Dock. 
They have a crazy amount of sauces, far more than any other wing place I have ever been to. We&#39;ve tried 7 sauces now. So far my favorites are the spicy peanut, the pesto parmesan and the chili lime. On our first visit we tried the xxx-hot. It kinda melted face off but Jeff S., having burned off his taste buds long ago found the heat a wee bit lacking. I&#39;m looking forward to going back and trying some more. It will take several visits to make our way through all of them (seriously, there&#39;s a lot). The wings are also decent sized! No sad little skinny wings here!
They have a full cajun style menu besides the wings which I am itching to try. So if you&#39;re not in the mood for wings you can definitely still find something to nosh on. I&#39;ve got my on you jambalaya!
They have limited seating at the bar but we were lucky enough to find a couple of seats there during our second visit. The bartender was really friendly and new her stuff when it came to the tap beers. The beers rotate and have they have a good selection. I had a ginger lemon radler from Boulevard Brewing and a Mandarin Nectar from Alpine beer. Both were suggestions from the bartender and they did not disappoint! 
Throughout our two visits we have been impressed with the food and service. They also deliver to Dry Dock if your wetting your whistle and get a little hungry!"

It is small, but has a nice homey vibe and staff are super friendly.  They have a lot of choices for wing sauce and flavors as well as side dishes.  Our goal is to actually try all of the wing flavors.  So far I like the pesto-paramesan and the cajun dry rub.  I also enjoy their curly cajun fries and battered mushrooms.

It can get crowded fast, so stop by before or after lunch/dinner peak time. 

The wings come in 1/2 lbs or by how many wings. I recommend get at least 1 lbs (10 wings approx). You may mixed a couple different flavor, and talking about flavor, they have plenty!!

Some of our favorite are honey barbeque, pad thai, asian, and raging barbeque. 

It&#39;s more of a self service joint, so don&#39;t expect to be babysat. Drinks are limited to non brandname soda, tea etc. 

Great wing joint overall!"

Both were pretty good but I preferred the bee-sting. My wife got the lemon pepper and honey BBQ. Out of all 4 I liked the bee-sting the most and the lemon pepper the least. Also, I got the chipotle coleslaw which was some of the best slaw I have ever had. Their fries were pretty dang good too. One thing I loved was they had a bunch of local micro brews on tap and all their sodas were Jones, which if you are from the Midwest you will really appreciate it.

I happened to stumble upon on it one day while leaving Big Lots and have been a fan ever since. Wings come in half or full pound rather than wing count. Half pound sounds like a lot but it only ends up coming to 3 or 4 wings with a full pound about 8 or 9 wings. I feel like a big verbally saying a pound of wings but it&#39;s the perfect amount and you can split the order with a couple different flavors. They have a ton of flavors, sides and even salads if you&#39;re looking to counterbalance the effect of wings! They recently got a  Jones Soda fountain machine instead of Coca Cola which I think is awesome since they are supporting the little man! My only gripe is that it&#39;s freezing in there and not a lot of space. I hope one day they expand because it was standing room only the last time we went in."

I went here for lunch with my dad. He ordered the larger special, and got Bee Sting bone-in wings and Jerk dry-rub bone-in wings; I ordered Bee Sting and Chili Lime boneless wings. Dad got the potato salad with his order, which is apparently homemade and was fantastic (I finished his off once he was full). I asked if I could get half sweet-potato fries and half curly fries with my combo, and Ryan was very accommodating. Each combo included a pound of wings, a side, and drinks. Dad opted for their sweet tea, and I found myself drawn to the Jones Soda(!) fountain.

The food was top-notch, ready quickly, and freshly prepared. Both types of fries were great, the potato salad was killer, and the drinks were fantastic. The bleu cheese sauce is homemade and my dad said perhaps the best he&#39;s ever had; I prefer big chunks of bleu cheese, which this didn&#39;t have, but it still tasted great. The wings were out of this world on all accounts, though a bit more sauced than I personally prefer - more on that in a minute.

Customer service was extraordinary. We dealt mostly with Ryan during our trip, though we did get a chance to tell the cook how awesome he was too. As this was our first time here, Ryan helped us out with explanations of their specials and products, made suggestions, told us the most popular dishes, and just generally made sure we had a good experience. He brought us a sample of a couple of great beers from the tap (Dry Dock&#39;s Apricot Blonde, from the brewery across the street - fruity, malty, very nice, and Dry Dock&#39;s Aprihot w/ roasted Habanero peppers - like the Apricot Blonde but sneakily spicy).

When I asked if NEXT time I&#39;d be able to order my wings with less sauce on them, if that was something they&#39;d be able to do, Ryan brought me a new order (which I def. wasn&#39;t asking for, he just took it on himself to make sure I was happy). Let me make it clear, I was asking because it was my mistake, I forgot to ask for lightly sauced like I usually do, and they certainly didn&#39;t have to bring me new wings - because I was going to finish the ones I had. Also, the music was good stuff, and they now have trivia nights (Tuesdays IIRC).

In summary, everything about this place is great, and I&#39;ll definitely be going back."

We hit about $30 bucks. . . I would say about average for my family on a casual outing.

I was so freaking full from my 2pm lunch at Wing Hut (with only 6 wings) that I didn&#39;t really eat the rest of the day.  So it was 6 nice size wings.    My wife and I are already making plans to split a 6 wings and fries next time, and add on a rice and beans. . .

Atmosphere. . casual.  You go up and order and sit down, and they bring the food out to you (and beers).  Small place in a stripmall, but a nice looking patio with lights (it was raining so we stayed inside)

The beer selection was solid.  Really solid local beers, including a really great beer for spicy wings (Dry Dock Apricot blonde).  In fact dry dock (a great brewery) is just down the street. Assuming delivery. . the next time at Wing Hut I may be eating at Dry Dock.


This is my &#34;i&#39;m on the oppisite side of the suburbs&#34; place from our defacto standard &#34;Wingin it&#34;.  I think its also may encourage us to go to dry dock for lunch a little more often. . .as pickup wingin it would be perfect..

We love wings, you see, but our favorite spots are a bit of a jaunt.  We ordered takeout from here last week and last night we came in for dinner in-house.

The inside is pretty small, the bar only has four stools. They actually have a very nice patio for a strip mall site.  The menu has quite an array of sauces, listed from top to bottom as mild to hot.  Between our two trips we sampled eight on wings, plus last night they let me have a couple samples on my own that I knew Jess wouldn&#39;t like.  Of all of them I&#39;d say the most original and tastiest is the hot honey mustard.  Excellent flavor, although neither of us felt there was any &#34;hot&#34; to it at all.  In fact, all the sauces we&#39;ve tried that were on their hot scale seemed closer to medium.  That&#39;s when I was offered the way too hot habenero, which was more to my level of desired spice.  They also gave me a sample of the Diablo sauce that is being made for a challenge.  This one is not messing around.  Not for the faint of tongue, I can promise you.  Excellent flavor but it will begin to melt your face from the inside out after about ten seconds.

The tap handles boast great brews from local places like Grist, Epic, and Dry Dock, which I really appreciate.  They offer a good variety of sides, salads and sandwiches.  And both times we&#39;ve been here the people were very friendly. 

The wings are big, but the biggest downside is the sauces are very watery so the wings were drowning.  I feel that if they thickened the sauces up a little more then it would adhere to the wings better.  And if you&#39;re a capsaicin addict like me make straight for the bottom of the list.  

I will probably be checking them out a lot, especially knowing that they deliver to Dry Dock.  If you&#39;re a wing fan in Aurora, this is the place to be!"

Went for lunch today and by the outside it looks like more of an old-fashioned restaurant, but when you go in it is very modern with a cool vibe to it.  I got their boneless wing with the garlic-parmesan sauce (towards the top of the list - so less spicy), but the sauce definitely had a huge kick to it compared to that sauce at other wing places I&#39;ve been to.  I couldn&#39;t have gone hotter, but it was very tasty.  And 6 wings + fries were very filling.

My kids got the the corn dog meals (with curly fries) and enjoyed the food (nice that it came with a small treat of fruit snacks - my son&#39;s favorite).  And my husband enjoyed the mango sauce, and found it a bit spicy for his taste, but enjoyed his food.  Plus, Wing Hut has a good selection of Colorado craft beers, which always go good with wings. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34; because I have. And it used to be at this place. After a 4 minute hold on the phone I placed my order. Drove down after waiting 10 minutes expecting it to be ready but it wasn&#39;t. Wait wasn&#39;t long - maybe 5 minutes. I get home and this was the third time in a row there were items &amp; the extra ranch I paid for was missing in my to go order. You would think I&#39;d learn after a couple of times to check but nope. Inquired but the owner doesn&#39;t ever seem to be there anymore. (Where you at Jared? Your restaurant needs your attention!)

WHAT a lark!

You might know some other places that have &#34;good wings&#34; in addition to the rest of the items on their menu, but let&#39;s not forget that those same places still treat wings as a side. An appetizer. A warmup act. If they really cracked the code, wouldn&#39;t they want those wings front and center? 

Wing Hut is home to such code crackers, dishing out heaps of perfectly cooked and seasoned wings with a smorgasbord of flavors. Favorites include Bee Sting, Swinger, and All That, but you could do worse than explore the deep selection their menu offers. 

Don&#39;t hold back on the sides, either, as you&#39;ll want something to dip into the excess sauce at the bottom of each basket. Or you can just cup it with your hands like a fresh mountain spring and slurp away. I won&#39;t judge.

Just when you think it couldn&#39;t get any better, BAM: DESSERT. The Strawberry Shortcake Funnel Cake Fries are excellent and will leave you licking your fingers for the umpteenth time.

Final side note: If you order ranch or blue cheese dressing, there&#39;s a reason they charge extra for it. You will get more than enough for even the greediest of dippers, so start with one and figure it out from there."

Our food came out in 9 minutes, but it wasn&#39;t super busy. We ordered 1 lb of wings (7 wings), medium fries, 1 ranch, and 2 beers - our total was $26 (EXTREMELY expensive for a wing joint in my opinion). The wings were warm, which was a disappointment. The fries this time were not overly salty, which was a plus. If we went to Wing Stop, we could have gotten twice the amount of food and 2 beers for the same amount of money and I know that my food would be hot and fresh. Also, I could go to a pub and have table service, more food, and a similar environment. However, I will say that Wing Hut has a nice environment and friendly staff, which I think is why people come back. 

My overall opinion is that Wing Hut is overpriced, inconsistent, and just not for me. I think this time will be our last time there."

We had probably 50 people show up at some point and we filled up the whole restaurant and the outside seating so I felt bad for all the other customers that came afterwards. I didn&#39;t try the food so can&#39;t speak on that. They don&#39;t have hard liquor which is a bit weird for having a bar. They did have beer on tap and quite a bit of variety as well. The bartenders are very nice and charming. The outside seating is very nice especially during a summer night. There are lights strung across the trees and it&#39;s very quiet and definitely a cool place to hangout. I didn&#39;t like this place as much as buffalo wild wings which is much more spacious.

The buffalo wings taste like Franks Hot Sauce, and the BBQ tastes like generic KC Masterpiece or Lonestar. We got three different flavors of wings and a sack of fries and it cost me $30 bucks. 

I was led to wing hut by yelp reviews, but I think it&#39;s rated so high for service and location. The food is just fine! But I prefer the more exotic flavors offered at Wingin it, BWW, or Hooters."

I have really enjoyed Wing Hut but when I see black bones I know the wings have been frozen. That&#39;s disappointing because I&#39;m not seeing the discount at the register.

The most thing that disappointed me today is the size of the wings. I hope the picture I post will serve my point justice.

The beer selection is good and being a part of the mug club makes it a great place to eat wings and drink beer. 

The location is small and it&#39;s become pretty popular so it can be a challenge to get a table on busy nights. I wish they would consider taking over the space MVP&#39;s was in and becoming a full scale wing and sports bar place, they would do very well as a result."

Personally I don&#39;t like my wings soaking in sauce, I prefer to dip on the side and get more crunch but I did not relay that message to the cashier so my fault on that one. The sauce was really good though, I will definitely order here again to try another one of their specialty sauces (on the side this time). Staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."

I&#39;m not sure what has changed exactly, but the lemon pepper dry rub that I get is now complete garbage. My wings come barely seasoned, and essentially I am paying $30+ for plain fried chicken wings. This is the 2nd time in about 2 months that this has happened, and it is very upsetting to me. Also, my order tonight was for 2 flavors: hickory hog and lemon pepper. Both were barely seasoned, and I think someone mixed 3/4 hickory hog and 1/4 lemon pepper into the lemon pepper box. I could have called to have it changed, but delivery already takes over an hour and I didn&#39;t want to be inconvenienced again."

The sauces we tried (4 of them) were flavorful and well balanced. There are A LOT of sauces to try! 

Our single complaint was that the bone-in wings were small. They were good but we wished they had been meatier. 

I might suggest trying the boneless wings to get the most for your money as they sell everything by the pound and even though the bone-in was less expensive by a dollar or two, there just wasn&#39;t enough chicken on the bone to constitute a full meal at one pound."

Well that&#39;s not a concern at Wing Hut. My Bee Sting hot honey wings had plenty of delicious sweet and spicy sauce, while there was also plenty of dry spice for my Cajun wings. Wings were cooked perfectly and came out nice and hot. A total of a pound + a side of sweet potato fries was the perfect amount to fill me up. And those fries were also great.

Service was great, as the girl behind the order counter was super friendly and helpful in guiding me through the menu. Although I did not have a beer, they have a few on draft. I may also have to try some of their non-wing Cajun-themed items someday. In the meantime, I look forward to trying some more flavors.

I went with the pound of wings and curly fries on the side, with a drink.  A pound of wings may seem like a lot, but it is pretty easy to tear through that amount.  I know that many (if not most) wing places have moved to doing wings by the pound instead of a numerical amount.  This allows them greater consistency across skinny versus meaty wings.  And, with the wholesale price of wings exceeding that of breast meat, it makes economical sense.  But, that does not mean I have embraced the change.  My curly fries were rather good, and I am usually not impressed by these.  Wing Hut offers a hug array of sauce choices.  The guy working the counter even let me try his mango creation.

I love that it is a family run business as well, and it is such a sweet family that you can tell works very hard and wants to always please their customers. I went in with not high expectations. As a gal originally from the Buffalo NY area, I am pretty dang picky about my wings. I let them know where I was from and hoped to be impressed. I ordered the lunch special of wings and fries and a drink and I was definitely impressed. The wings were crispy as I requested, they were bigger in size than I am used to finding outside of NYS, and they were saucy with pretty close flavoring from back home. And everything came out nice and hot and fresh. I let Jared know he made my day and that I&#39;ll definitely be back. Two days later I walked back in the door with my hubby and kiddo, and was recognized and my name remembered. Great customer service!

The owners even sent out a free dessert for us which was funnel cake fries. Yummm. Thank you Jared for fantastic food and wonderful service. The only thing I knock a star off for is the pricing. Being from Buffalo, I am not used to the weird pricing for wings elsewhere in the states. I mean c&#39;mon, we have like $.25 wing nights. Getting 4-5 wings for the price you pay here is kind of crazy. They&#39;re still my favorite wing place based on flavor, atmosphere and staff though.. You know you will have some more regulars for sure!"

They are just too good. Not only is every flavor AH-mazing and they have local brews on tap, they also have fresh curly fries... yes, CURLY FRIES! If I didn&#39;t want my butt to get any bigger, my inner-heffer would make me eat here everyday... Don&#39;t tell her they deliver. So now I must ignore the constant cravings and wait for the weekends to get my wing fix from the best wing place in Aurora."

I walked in to place a take out order, and the guy behind the counter was really nice. The service inside the store was very prompt and I didn&#39;t have to wait very long for my food. When I asked for boneless wings with hot honey bbq sauce, he said that they didn&#39;t have a hot honey bbq (I guess I read the menu on Yelp incorrectly?); BUT, he would be happy to mix their regular honey bbq with some hot buffalo sauce! It ended up being really heavy on the buffalo sauce and I couldn&#39;t really taste the honey bbq, but they get props for offering a special solution for me.

We also had bone-in wings with fire ranch (which was too spicy for me but my husband really liked it). I thought the bone-in wings were tough and stringy; the boneless ones were much more succulent, so I&#39;m glad I chose them for myself. For sides, we shared a large garden salad that was plenty big enough for two (really fresh, too, with very crisp lettuce and cucumber), zucchini fries, and hush puppies. Yum! The zucchini fries and the hush puppies were hands-down my favorite part. They were golden and crispy with a very flavorful breading on the outside, and perfectly done in the center. I definitely give the overall quality of the food here high marks.

My only complaints are, firstly, that the ranch for dipping the zucchini fries and dressing the salad was extremely runny, which is a pet peeve of mine. It still had the right ranch-y spices and flavor, but it was way watered down. Secondly, they did not include any cutlery in my to-go bag, even though they did include plates and napkins. This was almost a disaster because we were eating at Dry Dock, but thankfully we were able to scrounge up some forks there. So, minus one star for those two things.

It seemed like we ordered a lot of food (1 pound bone-in wings, small boneless, large salad, zucchini fries, and hush puppies), but the portions were not overly large and we shared the sides. This lunch cost $13/person (so I believe Wing Hut should be classed in the $$ range) and we were comfortably full, but not stuffed."

My boyfriend and I love dry dock, since they don&#39;t serve food we decided to look for food around there. We found Wing Hut a couple weeks ago but finally made it there today. 
Immediately I was impressed by the friendly welcoming demeanor of a gentleman who I assumed was a server; he greeted us warmly and immediately took and filled our beer orders, he gave us the perfect amount of time to contemplate our wing order, and was attentive and helpful throughout the process.
Our wings were amazing, and I mean - food so good you chew extra slow to taste it better - then he insisted on bringing dessert (absolute magic) to our table on the house. At that time we discovered that this gracious , delightful gentleman is the wonder of this establishment. Cheers to Jared of Wing Hut! You are innovative, talented, and completely commited to the success of Wing Hut which I respect. Thank you for being awesome and enhancing a great night!
Cheers"

Me and my boyfriend drive 1.5 hours to get here about once a month!! ALWAYS quality food. Biggest, juiciest Wings I&#39;ve ever eaten :) not the cheap scrawny kind.  worth the drive every single time but I miss the one in Longmont that was 5 min away. 
:( unfortunately it closed down because the previous owner retired but it wasn&#39;t until we went to this location in Aurora and discovered their funnel cake fries and better sauces!! Their sauces are made fresh daily so sometimes they can taste a little different but still delicious every single time! They took away the golden honey bbq but fatshack in Boulder has this flavor. I&#39;ve never had any problems with the food here. The staff is even very nice and attentive and if anything is wrong they are always sure that they make it right. I just wish they were open later and had another location that would be a blessing! So thankful for this treat!!!"

And as far as food if you are ok with waiting 25 minutes for 5 chicken wings then you should stop by. As far as taste for the price you are better off spending your money at a B dubs. Again. Staff was fun but not a family place and not for hungry people who want the food at a fairly hasty rate.

Once again a fantastic, small, family owned business  makes the grade.  I love going here, not only for the great wings, the small but expertly chosen selection of beers on tap, but the people.  They are why I won&#39;t go anywhere else in town for wings.  I am recognized every time I go in and treated like family. From the first time I stepped into the door I felt welcome and knew I was going to love the place.  If you are a wing connoisseur you won&#39;t be disappointed.  They are cooked perfectly and the sauces are varied and always great.  I tend to lean toward the traditional &#34;buffalo&#34; flavor and theirs doesn&#39;t disappoint.

 Have eaten here twice now. Once for dinner and once today for lunch--both times were fantastic experiences.  

My first visit I had the mango madness. These babies were delicious and had a nice heat to them.  I from Southern louisiana so I really enjoy all things spicy...these were described as hot to very hot by the host.....   My partner had the bee sting which had a great flavor... but lacked the heat I like....saying great flavor is a gross understatement...the bee sting sauce at the bottom of his tray was like sweet nectar :) and I helped myself to it, incessantly! 

Today I had the dry rub, boneless Kung pao (spelling?)  Absolutely delicious but again lacked the heat I enjoy.  I was under the impression this rub had ghost pepper but I found these to be a 2 of 10 on heat. 

The funnel cake fries with strawberry shortcake topping were absolutely delectable. Perfectly fried with all the toppings on the side, per my request.  Mmmm Mmmm sooooo good!!

Will definitely be back!  Want to try the Fire Ranch, Raging BBQ and any recommendations the host suggests for extreme heat.

Oh and their ranch dressing seems homemade and is scrumptious!!"

In short, we pretty much live at dry dock. But in making it over there last night, it refreshed my memory on all the great things we miss when we don&#39;t visit their location. I am pretty critical about two things aside from the food--the vibe of the restaurant and SERVICE. We walked in to an always happy crew of staff, we&#39;re so warmly welcomed, awesome music on the speakers, yummy local pints of beer were in our hands very quickly. We always order at least the bee sting and inferno ranch- they are must tries. 
  I&#39;ve read that a couple people have some disappointments with to go times-keep in mind they are independent, small place AND they are feeding tons of beer drinkers at a near by brewery throughout every day.

There was a strong vinegar smell, but the taste was subtle and they were very lightly salted which was great. 

I had the combo which included a side and drink. I chose the pickle chips. They were perfectly crunchy and slightly spicy."

Several Korean families were visiting while I was there, so that&#39;s gotta say something about this restaurant. 

The banchan were very good and I saw several new items that I had not seen in other Korean restaurants before. They also brought us back more of them once we had eaten them. That was nice. :)

You know you are in an authentic place as well when most of the patrons are of Korean decent. Of course, the food is largely the reason you need to check this place out. I am a huge fan of the thin sliced beef and the short ribs cooked on the tabletop. You also get about 10-15 sides as well. Be adventurous, even if you skeptical. Two BBQ dishes are more than enough to feed 3 people so I would be cautious in ordering too much. The staff is very attentive and will continue to check on your meat as you are grilling them."

Before I start into their customer service, I&#39;ll review their food. There was 6 of us so we decided to get the combo for 5, which included 5 choices of meat, choice of soup, egg casserole, soju, and of course all the sides. 

The sides arrived first and you better believe we started digging in! I don&#39;t know the names of all the dishes but my favorite is the sweet yams. We finished several bowls by the time our meat arrived. We ordered the marinated meat combo. We grilled one set of meat at a time and had to change the grill top several times. Korean BBQ is one of my favorite kind of food and it was very appetizing and filling. I&#39;d recommend coming here for their food alone. 

However, if your thing is service which I&#39;m pretty big about, Seoul BBQ has one of the worst. We asked for water at the time we ordered but still didn&#39;t get it until after we cooked and ate half of our meat. We also asked for an extra bowl because they miscounted and we never got one. We also asked for more sides, but they ran out of the sweet yam dish...sad panda (that has nothing to do with their customer service but I was legit sad they ran out lol). 

The waiter was extremely rude! There were times we&#39;d ring the doorbell because we needed something like water and he&#39;d take 15 minutes plus to finally make it to our table. He also didn&#39;t turn on our vent so when we cooked our last set of meat, it smoked up the entire restaurant until another waiter came over to turn it on. Once receiving our bill, we waited for him to come back to check us out with the sweet rice drink. We rang the bell and had a friend stand up looking at them trying to catch a waiters attention but they just ignored her. When they finally walked over, she asked for the sweet rice drink but said they were out. So we were packing up getting ready to go then they roll over with the drinks. By the time they brought it though, we were already peeved. So a few of my friends didn&#39;t want it out of spite. 

Ok I&#39;m done ranting, but seriously this was one of the worst customer experience I&#39;ve had."

I used to come here with my family almost weekly back in the day (two years ago) and ordered off the menu (everything from appetizers to stews to BBQ to shabu shabu). From my memory, most of their items are tasty! The only thing is that their prices have shot up within the last two years. $13 for dol sot bibimbap now, say whaaaa?!

Anyway, the bbq combo option is always good if you have hungry people with you. We usually go with combo B (with bulgogi and pork bulgogi) when we have 4-5 people.

I recently got the dol sot bibimbap with no meat and asked for tofu instead, and they made it! It was awesome - enough for two people who aren&#39;t that hungry. 

Their side dishes are always yummy and they always refill whatever dish, if you ask! The sushi that came with it was questionable though... My stomach was okay after eating it though. I&#39;m alive.

I don&#39;t know why everyone has such a terrible experience with the service here... They&#39;ve been pretty spot on every time I&#39;ve been here... But that could be because my mom tips them well too... Either way, good service and good food means a good rating.

The only thing, as mentioned before, is that the price point is on the higher side. But, I guess we all have to make money...

Pro tip: you can get an additional stew, if you don&#39;t get any soju or sodas with your combo.

Also, no reservations unless you have 6+ in your party."

The thrill of cooking the meat table side and having countless little side dishes quite intrigued me. Maybe the excitement level was to much but I have not been so disappointed in awhile.  Overall for the amount of meat you get I think the price is high.  The meat was one of the more taster portions but when you get two different types and cannot tell the difference that isn&#39;t so good.  All the sides were cold and very unappetizing.  Plus there was no instruction whatsoever on what to do once the meat starts firing up at your table.  I decided to order a soup as well, using the servers recommendation, and yuck! I have not tasted something so bland in a very long time.

Overall none of the flavors I was anticipating."

It had other seafood in the soup, including mussels and baby clams.

The soup came with some sides and of course, a bowl of rice. The kimchi was not the best I&#39;ve had, so I would minus half a star for that if I could. It was bland and wasn&#39;t fermented enough. But the cucumber and soybean sprout side dishes were very good."

More banchan than one can count with novelties like octopus, kimchi okra and potato jello. Check.

Buckwheat noodles, cold noodles and sweet potato noodle dishes. Check.

Soon Tofu. Check. (warning, the preparation was a little odd with a sour cabbage in the broth)

In-table grills with giant overhead exhausts so your clothes don&#39;t smell too too BBQ-ey. Check.

Large form Hite bottles for under $7. Check.

Bottle of water and barley tea during the meal and sweet rice tea at the conclusion. Check."

Yes.  Everything comes with FOURTEEN (14) little side dishes of tasty bites including Kimchi and other marinated delectables. We remember: octopus bites, tasty mini salted fishes, cabbage, gelatin bites (eew), eggplant, cabbage, lettuce, raw garlic, jalepeno, macaroni salad, chives- so much goodness!

The main course we chose was the BULGOGI and GALBI, Korean dishes of thin beef slices and boneless short ribs marinated and grilled on a barbecue.  And you get to be the cook!   Fun times.

Me and the BF split a bottle of  Bokbunja, a blackberry wine native to Korea. The wine is the color of oxblood, and its sweet, berry flavor is reminiscent more of dessert wine and was sever with little shot glasses.  Nice!

Other reviewers have mentioned that it is slightly expensive due to the fact that they require each table to order two main courses at $25- $30 a pop.  There is enough food for four people, so try to come on a double date!

Nice find!"

This is the place to go for Korean BBQ. At dinner, you can count on a pretty long wait, but it is worth it.

The meat always tastes fresh and is well-seasoned. I love the sizzle of the bulgogi when it hits the table-top grill. And while the meat is cooking, you can enjoy any of the dozen side dishes that come with your meal.

Got the a combo w spicy pork galbi and something else... And dokbokki. We got so much food and there was so many different things to try. It&#39;s clear that they really put a lot of effort into presenting an authentic, high quality experience. I&#39;ve looked at some past reviews about poor service and poor quality, and don&#39;t really agree. I&#39;ve been to other kbbq places and though the service was pretty good. Our service lady greeted us and explained how the combo works and smiled and joked. The meat quality was very good. I don&#39;t think you can compare it to American standards because the end product is not supposed to be an 8 oz New York strip. I&#39;ve been to many korean restaurants and have noticed that Korean BBq is usually meat that is slim, tender, and slightly fatty, and is accentuated by the Korean marinade. The food they served was on par with the restaurants I&#39;ve visited in Los Angeles and I will definitely be back."

I had bookmarked this place long ago, but since it&#39;s SO. FAR. AWAY., I needed a good nudge to get here.

We arrived around 530/545pm and the place was already pretty full... and mostly of Asian folks. GOOD SIGN. Since it was my friend&#39;s first time eating Korean food, she had me take the reins. I ordered us a seafood pajeon (savory pancake) as an appetizer, dolsot bibimbap (beef), and seafood soondubu jigae. Yes, yes, too much food. About 5 minutes after we ordered, a cart rolled up to our table with all our ban chan. FOURTEEN of them. I can not even begin to tell you how good they all were...but my friend thought I had ordered us another appetizer. She was blown away that the ban chan were complimentary.

Then the pancake came out. And her eyes rolled to the back of her head. The bibimbap and soondubu jigae were complex, flavorful, and perfect. I see what I&#39;ve been missing out by not crossing to the other side of town for my fix of Korean food. 

$35 feeds four. Or, two people for two days. We were both very full, and had plenty of leftovers for each of us."

I love variety in my food so I love that every order, even the sushi orders, comes with the Korean side dishes.  I never finish any of the side dishes because there are so many, but if you do you can always ask for more.  When I come here with my friends we always do our own cooking because it is quite entertaining to cook your own food at a restaurant.  However, if I come here with my boyfriend we always have the kitchen cook it because we are a lazy couple.  We also always order the seafood soon-tofu soup and the daeji bulgogi.

That attitude sounded like I was trying to trick him for a free soup or something! Come on man! The stew I ordered was more expensive than the one he first served us. Ridiculous and rude!

I got spicy pork &amp; bulgogi when I came. Each meat order comes with 12 side dishes that include things like kim chi, savory jello, pickled cucumber, macaroni salad &amp; tofu. The meat costs around $20-$35 depending on the type that you get. Servers come and put the meat on for you &amp; then change out the center cooking grill when you&#39;re ready to put on the other meats. 

Some people might find the concept of cooking your own meat to be foreign &amp; unconventional because you might be thinking &#34;I came to a restaurant so I DON&#39;T have to cook.&#34; But think of it this way: you get super freshly cooked food &amp; a fun experience where you can control the well-doneness of your own meat! I personally love cooking on the grill in the center. 

Reason why I am giving this place a 3 stars is because of the quality of their meat. I found the meat, both times I came here, to be (not for all cuts but for 1/2 of the ones I ordered) fatty or chewy. The quality was subpar to Korean BBQ places I&#39;ve been to in the bay area &amp; was slightly more expensive too.

In terms of ambience, this place is very clean, open and great for parties. They have private rooms and tables without the grill if you plan on ordering sushi or other dishes that don&#39;t need BBQing."

Open space and clean: Check
Good banchan: 14 of them! Check
Friendly service: Check
Quick service: Check

Highlights: 
- I really enjoyed their Haemul pa-jeon (or otherwise seafood pancake). I&#39;ve had others in the past and I felt like this one had so many ingredients! Great mix of vegetables with seafood. Many times, they can be dominated by the batter, but this definitely felt more ingredient heavy, which is awesome. 
- The gamja jungol was great as well. It says for two, but really you can probably serve 3 WITH leftovers. A little on the spicy side, but that is kind of what you expect with Korean food!

Oh and they also serve iced sikhye, which was so good I was tempted to ask for more. Next time =)"

If you&#39;re not familiar with Korean food I would suggest doing some research or ask your server for suggestions. There was one dish that our neighbors ordered that smelled soooo good. 
Definitely want to come back and try the bbq at the table. We didnt  since it was just 2 of us and we felt that it was way too much food to order 2 bbq enters (have to order minimum of 2). 
We ended up getting a tofu soup in a clay pot and braised ribs, also in a soup, as well as 2 appertizers. Our food was good, but not worth the $70 we spent, I will be coming back with more questions and research next time."

We had the combo A bbq option and the food was really good. They had a very good variety of different banchans (side dishes) and a lot of appetizer type meal. 
The price was high (it suggests that it was for 3 people) and honestly I personally did not think it was worth the price but it was still pretty dang delicious. :)

As for service...it was ok. When the waiter first came to our table he was looking away as he was talking to us and we had to get his attention even while he was right there in front of us at our table, which is a bit rude. He didn&#39;t seem too friendly and he left before we were even done eating. We were handed off to someone else. Although the last person to take care of us didn&#39;t really serve us and only handed us our bill and dessert, I&#39;d have preferred her as our server because she was very sweet, friendly and attentive. :)"

At least that&#39;s what I have experienced at other Korean places.  No worries though, Chef Nyla took over and the galbi was just as good.  Seoul BBQ also provided Seoul many sides!  Other place I&#39;ve gone to give maybe 7 or so sides, but we got 14!  Since they didn&#39;t give us any sukjul namul, we asked for it and we received.

At the end of our meal the owner, I think, came by and asked us how the food was.  He also suggested and brought us a pickled square side... Can&#39;t remember what it was called, but he was very friendly and said if that the sides that are brought out are supposed to compliment what we order and if we wanted anything extra to just ask.

They also gave us this sweet rice slushy drink as dessert.  I&#39;ve never had it before but  perfect after the big dinner we just had."

my family of 4 came here and ordered the 3-person combo meal (came out to ~$29/person). this included a bunch of banchan, a green onion pancake, a california roll (which turned out to be a spicy tuna roll instead), a steamed egg dish, a seafood/tofu soup dish, and a sake/beer/wine, in addition to galbi + a choice of 2 other meats. we got the bulgogi and this other non-marinated meat. out of the meats, the galbi was awesome (and i usually don&#39;t even like it that much), the bulgogi (usually my favorite thing and my standard for rating korean places) was average to slightly below average, and i wasn&#39;t a fan of the other meat. overall, it was a crazy amount of food and we went home with leftovers. even though they say this is for 3 people, it could feed 5-6 hungry people, especially if you actually eat the banchan! the meal also ended with a chilled sweet rice drink-- a nice finishing touch to balance out all that meat! prices are on the high side, but given that the food was pretty good quality overall, i&#39;d be back!"

After exiting my car I immediately notice how wonderful it looks from the outside. They have hanging flower pots that are obviously well maintained. The flowers are bright pink and they are evenly spaced. The overall outside appearance makes the place very inviting. 

After entering the smells have already began to make my stomach growl and, even though no one is at the front, I am quickly greeted by a host that tells me there&#39;s a five minute wait ( this is lunch let&#39;s remember). Well, after just a minute or two my table is ready and I am served water immediately. I begin to look at the lunch menu and realize how much I love the prices. Specifically, I enjoy them because of what I&#39;ve herd about the multiple side dishes. My mouth is now watering and I can&#39;t contain myself! I really do want to order everything haha. 

My order was taken quickly- I decide to keep it simple and order some Bibim-bap and some Korean short ribs for an additional $6. The short ribs are limited to one order per person during lunch which raised my curiosity.

Well, the short ribs were incredible. I finished them off before I got back to my review . The rest of the meal taste great as well and the service hasn&#39;t suffered yet. The bibimbap car with the egg on top cooked perfectly. After breaking it and mixing the bowl the ingredients stick together perfectly nice big bites. The red pepper past they gave on the side is a nice touch as well as the onion beef broth. 

The only thing I&#39;d say is a little more meat wouldn&#39;t hurt... More meat never hurts though . 

Overall a great experience."

From the taro, to the fried sweet potatoes, to the cucumber, to the salad, everything was super delicious!

Bliss. My personal faves are the cucumber chili salad and the straight up cabbage kimchi but you can re-up on any sides you like free of charge. 

I don&#39;t know what we were thinking but what we were FEELING was mighty hungry so we ordered the combo for three. The two of us can rarely finish a normal meal between us so rest assured we took A LOT of stuff home (leftover dinner party tonight!!). This combo could easily feed four people. At least we got to sample a gamut of meals. 

Out of the ribs, the pork belly, and the beef bulgogi, the bulgogi was my favorite. So tender, marinated with sweet-sour-savory sauce. I also really liked the egg pancake. 

The tofu stew was good but not the best - nice and spicy but not as deep and meaty of a broth as I like. 

A head&#39;s up if your pocket is fairly shallow like mine - they require a minimum of two bbq orders per table - the minimum price for a bbq order is $19.99 so if there are two of you and you&#39;re not big eaters, you will end up getting way more food than you need and spending quite a bit. In the future, I&#39;ll make sure to go with at least two other people. Otherwise, I might come back here and just get a plate that doesn&#39;t require the table grill. 

Service was remarkably good considering there seemed to be ONE server assigned to at least 12 tables. He was very efficient with a phenomenal memory and a kind demeanor. They do get slammed on Saturday nights - we lucked out but everyone right after us had to wait 30-40 minutes.

As fun as this place would be for a &#39;date night,&#39; the price point and portions are better to be shared amongst a group. I have left-overs for the next three days but hey, I&#39;m not complaining!"

You basically walk through buffet style and select which meats you would like to grill at your table. The prices are listed on each individualized package of meat. Some of it is fairly pricey, but everything we got was good quality. The sushi was the only item there that I thought was over priced for what it was. 

My only complaints are that if you order a soup from the menu it takes a long time. The other complaint is that you have to purchase rice separately. Most Korean restaurants offer this with your meal."

Try the fried dumplings....also freshly made and a meal in an of itself. 
I&#39;m working my way through the hot soups and all have been great! 
The sushi used to be a lot better but, on the bright side, now I have no excuse not to focus on just the Korean food.
Just a recommendation....you can ask for the dinner size meal even during lunch. They moved to a more limited lunch menu which concerns me a bit; but the place is always packed so I won&#39;t read too much into that.

Immediately when we were sat down we had to wait for our waiter to even come and great us. We order our food and it can out relatively quickly and started cooking it at our table. When I took my first bite of my food I quickly realized there was a piece of metal in my food. We stopped eating and tried to let the waiter know what had happened but couldn&#39;t flag him down. Finally after he stopped by we told him what happened and he acted like is was nothing and told us to keep cooking the food and left. While I will say the food was good I am going to be real honest in saying the service was terrible and that finding a piece of metal in food should result in some sort of action to resolve that problem and not act like it is nothing. I will never come here again nor will I recommend it to anyone.

The BBQ is a wonderful way to get to know Korean cuisine. My two teens and I ordered the minimum order of two meats so that we could test our skills with the grill embedded in the table. Very soon a plate heaping with meat (in our case non marinated beef and pork) arrived and the fun began.
Since we had prepared beforehand by watching a few YouTube videos on how to eat Korean BBQ (which I highly recommend if you&#39;ve never eaten at a place like this before), we pretty much knew what to do with the 14 saucers of condiments and tasty sauces. We asked for a refill on a few things which the waiter brought in a snap. We spent about $65 on a meal that would have served five--we took home a large box of meat and rice.
As for the quality of the food, the cuts of meat were awesome and the sides were fresh, authentic and flavorful (I&#39;ve worked in restaurant management so I can spot good food.) I salted my own meat as it was grilling. The staff were friendly and attentive.
The only drawback for me was the environment which could have used some polishing and TLC. Overall it was clean and neat, but the condiment jars on the table were greasy and the waiting area was under par. I won&#39;t be too critical though, since we were there at a high volume time and splatter from grilling meat is unavoidable. We&#39;ll be back in the future."

While they kept bringing everything we asked for, they barely helped us with the menu or asked if we needed anything without us calling them over. Then I was won over by the lady at the front desk (maybe manager or owner) when she informed me that tip was added to our tab because we had more than 8 people and handed me back the check to correct it because I had left an additional 20% on a $200 check.

We chose this based on reviews. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night and waited for 45 minutes for a table for two. 

We enjoyed the complimentary barley tea and 14 small servings of appetizers. 

At first, we ordered the shabu-shabu but because they require a minumum of two orders of shabu-shabu and a bigger table which wasn&#39;t available, we ordered beef bulgogi and galbi jim instead. 

They serve the bulgogi with a side of lettuce leaves, spring onions, fresh garlic, jalape√±o and bean paste so you can create a lettuce wrap. The galbi jim was okay, too. Both were served with a cup of steamed white rice. Steamed brown rice is available for an additional $2. The complimentary cold dessert rice tea was good.

It was a pleasant dinner experience. Now we know why there was a long queue for a table."

They were very clean, but the service was awful. Food was good, but small portions for the price. They do bring lots of sides, but act as if you are inconveniencing them if you ask for refills. (Who in a Korean restaurant brings a table of five a small ramekin of kimchee and expects that to last?) AND even though the flavors may be &#34;authentic Korean&#34; the dining experience sure wasn&#39;t. We expected to all be sharing the entrees and sides with our own portions of rice. $30 for kalbi had us assuming it was a good amount. Not two ribs. And just one bowl of rice per entr√©e unless you wanted to pay $1 for $.10 worth of rice.

Our waiter was ambivalent at best, his Korean was poor and so was his English. 

Overall, I don&#39;t think I will be going back to dine in. I am capable of making my own korean BBQ that is tastier, cheaper, and friendlier. However, if you aren&#39;t able to do this, I guess this restaurant is a viable option for you.

Visiting Englewood &amp; looking for a good Korean restaurant. I tried couple of other places but I wasn&#39;t impress with the food. 
Me &amp; my friend tried for a lunch here but it was 10-15 mins waiting.  We tried a Chinese next door and it was just okay. 
I have been craving for Sam-Gae-Tang (corn chicken or a small chicken stuffed with sweet rice, ginseng, chestnut &amp; dates).  It was little after 3pm &amp; it was still busy. 
Their banchan was really good especially Kimchi. Not just 4-5 but many. 
Honestly I was little surprised by how good their banchan was.
Sam-Gae-Tang... I would say it was average. 
At the end, I was very satisfied with whole experience &amp; I thought they are good as Korean restaurants in Dallas, TX (Dal-dong Nae in Dallas, TX is still far best in my mind)
I saw many private rooms &amp; I thought it will be nice to have meetings or gatherings there. 
As soon as I came to work, I was telling everybody about this location &amp; trying to convince to have our dinner meeting at Seoul BBQ. 
One down part... I thought BBQ price is little too high for me. I saw the menu &amp; for 2 people, it was about $90.  So if group of 7-10, it will get pretty expensive.

I will definitely come back &amp; try different dish. Maybe this weekend!!  :P

It was already 8:30pm and not many places were still opened but this place was still bustling when we entered. There were 3 parties before us and we even had to wait for about 20 minutes, that&#39;s how busy they were. Seoul BBQ is definitely my go to place for Korean food in the Aurora area. The waiting room is spacious and has seating for us while we waited. The entire restaurant smelled so good when we walked in as well. Beware, your clothes will probably smell afterwards so be prepared to wash it. Even if you don&#39;t choose to eat the kbbq, the smell will still get all up in your space. 

We were seated on a big table which I appreciated because I hate it when restaurants seat two people on a tiny table, where do they expect us to put all the food?! There&#39;s a grill in the middle of the table but we didn&#39;t use it as we didn&#39;t order bbq. The service is very fast as they took our order within 5 minutes of sitting down and then the side dishes (banchan) came shortly after. I personally think the side dishes are the best part of this place because they give you a whooping 14 side dishes! And it&#39;s not a lame 14 different flavors of kimchi, it&#39;s a great variety and I can honestly say I was full from the side dishes. They are even refillable which I think is amazing. Even compared to the many korean restaurants I&#39;ve eaten in California, those side dishes pale in comparison to these. My personal favorite side dishes include this pickled cucumber which was absolutely delicious with my bibimbap and the spicy taste complemented so well with my rice. I also really liked the glazed sweet potato, seafood pancake, egg roll, potato salad, kimchi, and fish. Also they automatically give you this delicious hot tea which is perfect for a cold night out. 

For the entree, my bf got the soon tofu which is his favorite and it makes him very full. I usually get that as well but today I wanted to eat the bibimbap. It&#39;s a dish with rice in a HOT stone pot topped with fried egg, meat, and veggies. You mix it all up with hot sauce and it&#39;s so good and so filling. I only ate about half and even had another meal leftover. It&#39;s pretty cheap for the amount of food you get. AND on top of all this, you even get a dessert sweet drink which I don&#39;t really like but my bf loves it so he gets double. I definitely come here on a regular basis and bring my relatives and friends who visit and they all like it."

(Sometimes the wait staff are really friendly and attentive and at other times they don&#39;t seem to care and you have to wait forever for food or utensils to arrive).

I think the food here is pretty good. The Korean BBQ is decent, and they also have a really great selection of sushi and bibmbap rice bowls that I really like. My favorite thing on the menu were the pickled crabs, but sadly they only had them once and have never had them again since. I also love their large and tasty selection of Korean appetizers."

They serve 14 delicious side dishes which doesn&#39;t fill you up which is good because the moment you try their Galbi, then you&#39;re in for a treat.

We got the gamjatang and bulgogi soup. (Can&#39;t remember the exact name) The side dishes were amazing too. The employee was really nice when we asked for refills. The gamjatang was only 10.99 and it had SO MUCH meat and flavor. It was hot, had a ton of veggies and meat, and was a HUGE amount. I will definitely be ordering that again. The bulgogi soup had a lot of oil floating around but it was very delicious. The meat was really flavorful and soft. Amazing place as usual!"

I ordered maewoontang, a spicy fish stew, and it was so good that I ate the whole bowl, and that bowl is enough for two people. The only thing I was disappointed with was the grilled meats. All of it was good, but it might be because the meat in KC was exceptional, but something was lacking. I mean I would still order the meat again, but it definitely wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had. I highly recommend this place because I can&#39;t wait to go back to try more of their soups"

You can tell the authenticity of a korean restaurant from the quality of the side dishes. If you can happily polish off a bowl of rice from just the complementary food, you know you&#39;re in the right place. 

This rings true for this place; I hadn&#39;t expected to find a good korean restaurant in Denver, CO. We ordered ddukguk (rice cake soup), aalbap (fish roe rice), galbi jumuluk (marinated beef). All stellar. One note is that the aalbap does NOT come in a hot plate."

Sounded good to me, and I figured that the waitress could probably offer some guidance to a complete newcomer.

Not so much... we were thrown to the wolves and when we asked for suggestions she just pointed at the menu.  But winging it didn&#39;t turn out to be bad at all.  This is a good place for groups, if you want to to grill your own meat then there&#39;s a minimum order of two entrees, and that comes out to a lot of food (especially because the BBQ meats come with a table full of different side dishes which would be a satisfying meal unto themselves).

I&#39;ve been meaning to come in for awhile now, and was ecstatic to have the stars finally align.  On top of it being our first time, the hubs and I brought some friends along for the experience as well.  Mind you, the last time I had Korean BBQ was over 10 years ago in China, so all of us are very new to Korean cuisine.  

I was hoping to get a lot more information about what to do and what the dishes (especially the 14 sides that comes with a bbq order) are.  Our server was very nice and polite.  She gave us a few recommendations, but we were pretty much making it up as we went along.  We ordered the Daeji Bulgogi and Bulgogi to barbecue.  Both meats were excellent. We also ordered a few sushi rolls. The fish was fresh, and the rolls were delicious.  

In case you are new to this as well, we were told that one order of bbq was a single serving.  I think that it can easily be shared.  Keep that in mind if you&#39;re going with people, order fewer items than friends. 

The restaurant was clean, food was great, and wile I can respect they didn&#39;t want to insult my intelligence, it would have been helpful to have a bit more guidance.  That said, we will be back for sure and see if we can do a better job the second time around."

Nope. You get all of it.

I had no idea what 90% of the items were. But I tried them anyway. Learned a painful lesson as a kid.. I avoided sweet potatoes because I didn&#39;t think orange potatoes made sense so I didn&#39;t accept it. Fast forward ten years.. I eat them all the time. 

It might look weird but it might taste amazing. 

I&#39;m okay with all of the sides they provide except for one.. The squid. It doesn&#39;t really taste like anything but the texture makes me want to barf. Eating tentacles is not for me.

Time : 15:00hrs

Had a reservation to celebrate one of my friend&#39;s Birthday that evening.  Thankfully we managed to get 2 private rooms to accommodate 10 of us at a short notice, coz initially we wanted to have this celebration at another Korean establishment.

We were given the 2 rooms on the left wing of this establishment nearest to the Kitchen and the aisle to the washroom.  This time around, we opt to have everyone cooking.  It was indeed fun as usual.  We opt to have all cuts of BEEF, that evening.  The service was indeed prompt and efficient, and depends on who you get to assist you what nots...

There is the Gyeran jjim in a ttukbaegi (small earthen pot), aka the Korean Steamed Egg Cassarole for each table to share.  There is the Pajeon for each table to share too.  The BEEF Cuts or Beef Meat, with Kabli are over-following and NOT FORGETTING the Banchan that I wish I could have more and more in which, we did get MORE &amp; MORE, coz my friends like it alot too.  From the Spicy Mini Shrimp heads, Japchae, Oi sobagi, Sigeumchi namul, Various kind of Kimchi offerings to name a few.

Since we are so engrossed to cook and have all the food, I did not managed to get all the food cooking pictures.  *My Bad* 

We even brought a store-bought BIRTHDAY cake for our friend, and SEOUL Korean BBQ, allow us to &#34;refrigerate&#34; the cake till we need by end of the Dinner.  With all the Good Food, Good Service and AWESOME Company, each person paid like $22 with tips and tax.  This include like several Bottle of Soju for the rest of my friends who drank, and also have Soda Pop, Tea and Coffee as part of their beverages too.  My tummy belly was happy indeed!  *Insert Silently Polite Burp*

Left the establishment about 17:40hrs ish, coz I have some event to attend while my other friends left at 18:10hrs ish.

We told her the guy is getting them, so she starts to leave, and we reminded her that we would actually like to eat still, so she took our order.  Yet another person brought out our food.  We were left unattended for 15-20 min before finally getting a refill on our drinks. That was actually done by a FOURTH person.

I ordered a French Dip w/ cole slaw.  The sandwich was fine, but asking for a side of mayo was apparently a no-no.  Asking for a second side of mayo later caused my son to whisper &#34;I wonder if she knows she has to WORK for a tip?&#34;  But the mayo finally made its appearance.  The au jus was tasty but very salty.  The cole slaw was way too creamy, but good.  Better if less &#34;cream&#34;.  My son ordered chicken fried steak scramble with hash browns.  He liked his scramble, but thought the hash browns sucked.  His words, not mine.  They were barely cooked - as usual.  Look, I know, well fried hash browns are not good for you, but when you only have them about 4 times a year, a good fry on them is to die for.  Let me determine what&#39;s good for me, not you.

All in all, pretty much what I expected.  Barely cooked hash browns, overly salted food, service with an attitude.  But acceptable low prices.  Ya know...ya get what you pay for!!!  This place is really good for a 2am bar closed munchies stop.  At that point you don&#39;t care about service, food quality, etc.  Just get some carbs in your system...excellent for this."

The place wasn&#39;t even at 20% capacity and they had so many people waiting for seats. The GM and the assistant GM were working the front and didn&#39;t even say sorry about the wait or nothing. Then finally we sat down and waited 2 min the server came over said oops I was supposed to wipe the table so he reached his arm in front of me and his ARM PITS STUNK!!! They were right in my face. Then he walks away and starts cleaning more tables. Doesn&#39;t say welcome or I&#39;ll brb to take your drink order. We waited 10 more min and they still didn&#39;t come get our drink order so we ended up walking out! And told everyone waiting they should leave to and the people walking in.

I&#39;m used to the pho joints down on Federal. They&#39;re my haunt. It&#39;s where I&#39;m used to. But now that I live in the foothills, a jaunt to Federal is kind of a long way away. For this reason, I couldn&#39;t be happier to have Applewood Vietnamese (sort of) near me!

Honestly, their broth is so flavorful, it rivals the Federal shops. They also load it up with meat, and their veggies are super fresh. I like that their pho menu has about 6 items on it and one size only. Keeps it real.

If I could take a quarter star away, I&#39;d probably do that for the spring roll. Not super awesome. I&#39;ve gotten them twice now, and I just can&#39;t care about them. But I&#39;m here for the pho, not the roll. 

Service is always stunningly friendly and efficient, and whenever I go to pickup my order, the place is packed. That&#39;s a good sign. 

I&#39;ll be back once we get a cold night and I get my pho craving going."

It came with a plate of bean sprouts, fresh  basil, and lime wedges. Others in our party had the bun dac biet, recommended by the server (owner?)  which had huge shrimp, somewhat rubbery thin-sliced beef, and rubbery processed-tasting chicken.

It might be a small serving area but it gives off a cozy vibe and I&#39;m excited to take more pictures of the rice and noodle bowls.

They offer only one size for $7.95 and its big, we couldn&#39;t finish either of ours.  They also serve steamed edamame as a free appetizer to enjoy while you wait for your meal, but it wasn&#39;t long, our 2 orders of Pho came out fast.

You don&#39;t get a &#39;set&#39; waiter for your section you&#39;re sitting in. Looks like whoever is there just shares the waiting responsibilities of the whole restaurant. First time I went there was last week with a friend. Food was good  for a Pho place and what I thought wasn&#39;t our waitress &#39;became&#39; our waitress. She was great. Attentive, filled waters, asked us how every dish we got was good or not (appetizers, entrees and such.) Actually surprised me because that doesn&#39;t happen as often as it should these days. [I&#39;ve worked in fine dining so I know what quality service is.] Yesterday was a different story. Went back and that waitress wasn&#39;t there. Just two lazy &#39;other&#39; waitresses that I noticed from my first visit. The good waitress took over from those two on my first visit. Unfortunately she wasn&#39;t there last night. 

Here&#39;s what happened last night. Food was good and came quick. So quick I got my Pho before my plate of veggies and had to wait on that. Ordered a Thai tea too. Didn&#39;t want those Boba drinks so got the tea. It came with whipped cream and Boba balls in it. I wiped the cream off into a bowl and threw a crumbled napkin in it. Didn&#39;t even take a sip and pushed it to the edge of the table in effort to send it back and get it without all the fufu stuff. I was out of water before I was 1/4 through my soup. Not one refill. Not a single stop to ask if things were okay. When I was finished I just sat there and finally one of the lazy waitresses came and &#39;dropped&#39; the check off. Literally dropped it off without asking how my meal was or if she could refill that empty water glass or ask me why that completely full, $3 Thai tea was sitting at the edge of the table. When went to pay, I complained about the service. One waitress tried to BS me and say she was &#39;so busy&#39;. That&#39;s when I turned and counted the tables that were full in the restaurant in front of her...FIVE tables with people including myself and that&#39;s it. Five tables split between two servers is slow as sh*t. That&#39;s not busy I told her. Five per one server is the standard for &#39;normal&#39; business. 7-10 tables per server is busy. I&#39;ve done it. It&#39;s called caring and multitasking. Lazy service is normal these days and it sucks. I told them they need to take lessons from that other girl that knows how to wait tables. At least the meal was taken care of. 

Bottom line: pretty good Pho, but if you want good service don&#39;t expect it here unless you get the good waitress (pretty, long fake eyelashes and big boobs that she uses to help her tips...no joke.) The other two are completely terrible. Hopefully they up their service game. First visit deserves five stars for a Pho place based on service...four for food. Second visit was one star based on service. I&#39;ll round down to two because the chances of getting the good waitress are slim."

The food is fantastic. The spring rolls are amazing. The sauce to dip them in is HEAVEN. I had the combination rice noodle bowl which includes all the proteins (shrimp, chicken, pork and beef) and eggrolls. The portion is very generous and the flavors are amazing.

Located near Yolandas tacos and a coffee shop this is some delicious food. 

I should have come here ages ago as my office is just a few miles down on Arapahoe. I tried their lunch special, which is $7.99 for a drum &amp; thigh, rice &amp; beans, plantains and drink. If you have not had this roasted chicken (other options available)  get your behind over here. It&#39;s like Boston market but 100 times better. 

The employees (I believe one gentleman is the owner) were so friendly and helpful. I took my lunch to go but did sample some of the sauce options &amp; pickled onions they have in a sauce bar to the left of the counter. The spicy cilantro has a good kick to it but not overly hot. The curry was delicious and tempered a bit of the heat of the cilantro sauce. 

Can&#39;t wait to come bock (haha) and have some more chicken."

The good, the chicken has good flavor, the rocoto sauce is good. The anticucho was also flavorful, although it was a very small portion.

The bad,  My wife got sick because the chicken was a couple of days old. You could see the bones having dark spots, pretty much a sign that the chicken has being stored after cooked. I understand that you don&#39;t sell all your chicken every day, but this chicken was definitely a couple days old.

The service was mediocre, the guy behind the counter was not very helpful. I asked for some of the Rocoto hot sauce and the he told me, &#34;We only serve rocoto with anticuchos&#34; he refused to give me a small container of rocoto at the end even though I bought 2 1/2 chickens. I know it comes with rocoto because my cousin ordered some chicken to go and she got plenty of it.

Overall the chicken is good as long you don&#39;t get old chicken."

Peruvian roasted chicken is a lot like rotisserie chickens you&#39;ve had before, but with a lot more flavor. Tender, moist meat, with a layer of crispy and flavorful skin. If you&#39;ve ever been to the likes of Pio Pio in NYC, this is a solid way to get your fix in Denver. 

I really liked my half chicken, and think it&#39;s one of the best ways to go. The skinless chicken breast in the &#34;Lima Chops&#34; is tasty--it doesn&#39;t benefit from the tastiness of the skin, but the saut√©ed peppers and onion were delicious in their own right (with a little spicy kick). The sauces were a great accompaniment; one that I tried was a great curry kick, the other like a spicy thin nacho cheese. 

The plantains were amazing in taste and texture, the yucca a good example of good preparation, somewhat resembling a more flavorful potato. 

The tres leches is great, with a fluffy consistency and moistness that separates it from heavier preparations. Big fan.

The flan struck me as not as tasty as the tres leches, despite a very special preparation with a piece of fried plantain and a powder sugar dusting. The smoothness was great, but the density and sweetness were a little high for me, personally. I think this is more of a function of having eaten it after the tres leches. 

I&#39;ll be back."

Didn&#39;t seem very freshly cooked either. The yucca was ok, but I wish they  served the real yucca, instead of processed yucca that was smashed, re-formed and fried. The plantains were very good. The flan needs some work, as it was a bit rubbery in texture. 

They were out of the aji sauce, which is what Peruvians  eat with pollo a la brasa, and it can really make or break the chicken. I did like the onion mixtures they had.

The whole room got smokey during our visit, which didn&#39;t help.

We&#39;ll go back in a while, to see if things improve, but otherwise we&#39;ll stick with the pollo from La Polleria...."

I decided to try Pollo Lima today because I had noticed them moving in over the past couple months and had looked forward to trying someplace new to grab lunch. Three things stand out about this new spot - excellent food, very friendly service and a clean restaurant. They specialize in wood-fire roasted chicken and it was really good! I got a half chicken with garlic potatoes and yellow rice; total came to just shy of $12. The value was perfect because the food was great. Although they offer a few sauces that give the chicken a more &#34;Mexican&#34; flavor (in my opinion), I preferred to eat this rotisserie masterpiece plain. The marinade they use is phenomenal. We need more spots that serve home-cooked delicacies like this. Five stars!"

They have an amazing beer list (40 beers on tap with the majority being local/Colorado beers). I love their rooftop! This is a place I always bring out of town friends to give them a taste of colorado beer and Denver rooftop/patio life on a nice day. I have tried most, if not all, of their happy hour appetizers. They are all pretty solid. Nothing stands out but it&#39;s typical bar food...good with a drink if you&#39;re hungry. 

They have lunch and dinner food and daily specials. The hamburgers are solid and the smothered fries are delicious to share. I think the country gravy fries are the best. It&#39;s the kind of thing that my body can handle maybe once a year bc it&#39;s fries covered in sausage gravy and melted cheddar...but I enjoy the splurge when I do it.

I do not recommend the mac and cheese if you&#39;re actually wanting mac and cheese. It&#39;s more like plain pasta in a liquidy, buttery cheese-like sauce. And they say that it&#39;s bacon mac and cheese but there was not one spec of bacon in it. It still tasted okay but was not mac and cheese and in my opinion certainly was not worth the $3 extra you pay to get that as the side with your burger. 

I like that they feature a new brewery each month. They also have trivia on Monday nights and happy hour all day on Monday."

Well, I ate an early dinner here with some friends, the food was okay, the service was great, our waiter was super helpful and nice. Unfortunately 2 out of 3 of us ended up with food poisoning later that night. We were able to figure out through the process of elimination (pun intended) that the extra side of ranch we ordered was the culprit. Apparently they make their ranch in-house, perhaps we were served an old batch? Both my friend and I were up all night with the hallmarks of food poisoning, and neither of us made it to work the next day. So yeah, that sucked.

Their management leaves a lot to be desired, really rude and unprofessional. They gave my friend and I the run around (not returning calls, or calling back when they said they would). Both the asst manager Troy and the head manager Kevin initially offered to refund our money and give us gift certificates worth 20 bucks (apparently that&#39;s the going rate for making someone disgustingly ill these days). However, neither ever followed through with their promises to refund us. Finally, more than a week and a half later Troy got back to me and very rudely informed me they would not be refunding the money we paid for the meal that made us sick, but would deign to offer us a 20 gift card. Because yeah, I&#39;m just chomping at the bit to have another round of food poisoning - thanks, but no thanks. I never write yelp reviews, but this experience was so astronomically bad and ridiculously handled, that I couldn&#39;t keep quiet."

And Nice! Our waitress was exceptional!"

The Historians Ale House is your normal bar, with good food and good service.
The interior is large, with a tall ceiling, dark colors, and wood floors. There are approximately 6 booths , two large (but narrow) community tables, and a large bar that has to seat at least 20 people. This is only the first floor! There is a roof top patio, which overlooks Broadway, a nice view. There are tables and a smaller bar up on top. According to the &#34;maximum capacity&#34; signs that are required in all restaurants, the rooftop area can hold 43 people, and the main floor area can hold 128 people, very nice. Granted, we were there at lunch, but I have the feeling that if the place were full (like in the evenings), I don&#39;t think it would feel crowded. 

The Happy Hour (and please check their website or their menu) has a bunch of good items. I had the cheeseburger and fries, which was only $5.95. 4 of the 5 of us had the cheeseburger, and everyone agreed that it was a good hamburger. Oh, the hamburgers are brought to you wrapped in brown paper and tied with strings. What you ordered is written on the wrapper. When you open up the package the hamburger and fries are inside. Nice touch, no overhead of washing those dishes either. Cool! 

Service was very good. The waitress took our order, without writing anything down, and she never missed a beat. When we were presented with our individual checks, those were correct too.  

Parking - on the street at metered parking. 

The beer offerings is quite large, actually very large. The listing is the size of a regular menu, with the listing on both sides. The beers are broken up into sections, like IPA, Stouts, etc. By each name of the beer, there is also the beer&#39;s business logo. The Historians Ale House pays attention to details. Nice touch. 

I will go back with my husband, and we are looking forward to it.

Enjoy! 
See you there!"

We decided to go all the way upstairs to the outdoor patio, but I have to first say that I was greeted when I entered and felt very welcome despite it being pretty empty. A+! 

Upstairs we were promptly greeted and taken care of by our awesome bartender/server who quickly got some bottomless mimosas to the table! He was very very helpful in decision making and was generally an awesome server. I ordered their breakfast burrito (made veggie), Kim did a BYO burger and my cousin got the Spanish hangover, upon the servers suggestion. 

Forewarning, these are HUGE servings! My burrito was literally like 2 pounds. You should have leftovers or plan to split. Anyway, everything tastes wonderful and my cousin especially enjoyed the Spanish hangover. We will definitely be returning for brunch here.

If so do you actually care that SO many people consistently complain about the poor service at your establishment? 

I agree completely agree with reviewer Lauren D.  Rachel who works the upper deck is so rude and inattentive. If I have her as a server next time I&#39;m back I will literally turn around and walk out the door! The 1st time I thought it was just me. I tried being super nice hoping she&#39;d loosen up. Not!  By the 3rd time experiencing little Miss Sour Puss, I realized it&#39;s not me...it&#39;s definitely her. And it&#39;s not just her. The service overall is totally spotty. 

And what&#39;s up with nickel and diming customers over lettuce, tomato or a tiny side of Bbq sauce?? Wow. 

4 stars for Happy hour, lunch special and burger/fries.

When we first brought the &#34;mistake&#34; to his attention, he got extremely aggressive and practically shouted &#34;what do you want me to do about it?&#34; I replied &#34;fix it&#34;.

I&#39;ve been here like 5 times. Finally tried their breakfast today and I was quite pleased. We got the $4 bloody mary bar and it was really good! $10 mimosas were also excellent. Both were mixed very well. For the bloody mary bar they give u a glass of vodka and u have a choice of spicy or regular along with tons of additions like pickles, the classic celery, garlic, lemons, lime, Tabasco, worcherschire, etc. Two thumbs up!

Besides those minor discrepancies. 

It&#39;s a super well put together little bar/restaurant. Inside is rustic but with a new touch and solid lighting. It&#39;s not too bright during the day but the mood is set at night. 

The lunch special was killer a burger and a brew for around $10 if I remember correctly. It was delicious and the burger comes out cooked as you ordered it. The beers on tap are good and the selection is broad. So no complaints there."

Bacon...2 slices...nothing special...sausage patties..I&#39;m sorry but both of them together didn&#39;t even cover English muffin.  Hashbrowns... when did cut up french fries become hashbrowns?????

This place is indeed, as the rating states, as good as it gets.  I have been here for drinks, afternoon and evening meals, and most commonly these days, brunch.

So let&#39;s talk about that for a quick moment, shall we?  Bottomless mimosas.  And they do NOT mess around here.  The staff walks around with a pitcher of champagne with roughly 2 tablespoons of OJ in it.  That&#39;s my kind of action.  The food is delicious, the prime rib hash is a must!  Jess is huge fan of the Spanish Hangover, but you really cannot go wrong with anything.  If you come outside of breakfast hours the sandwiches here are phenomenal as are the accompanying house made fries.  

Beer list.  Yes.  Absolutely fantasticly humongously wonderfully awesome.  So do that.  Whatever your taste buds are they will be satisfied.

Service.  Never short of impeccable.

Sat on the rooftop and enjoyed the views while munching away on some happy hour goodies, mainly queso with chips, and some green chili cheese fries. Yes, I ate junk and I loved it.

Why not 5 stars? The tables are small and really, really close together AND there are thin standing-room-only bars crammed down the center aisle (in between the dining tables and the actual bar) so walking through the restaurant is impossible. Also, you have no privacy. So, if you love eavesdropping, this place is for you. If you hate loud talkers, it is not. Since it has been raining for weeks here (!!!) we could not check out the rooftop patio. I am assuming that area is less claustrophobic, but can&#39;t verify.

Saw that they have a brunch menu as well so I would love to come try their brunch sometime soon."

Colleen was a delight. She immediately greeted us and was cheery and encouraging about the beers. The beer list is lengthy, and we told her we just wanted something light. Without asking she brought us over a sample of the pumpkin beer, and the ales they offered. Good service is hard to come by these days, so Colleen here&#39;s to you girl!

I would come back if I was on broadway just drinking. I glanced at the menu and it didn&#39;t really see anything appetizing, classic pub food. Not to say if I was hungry I wouldn&#39;t eat here, but I don&#39;t think this place advertises having amazing food by any means. They have a hundred beers to choose from!"

Your rooftop patio is amazing. Your old school feel on the main level is beautiful. Your rooftop bar is so convenient during a Sunday brunch.

But your food... Work on it. 
When Someone orders a brisket sandwich, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re expecting to have to swim through a gallon of bbq sauce to find the meat, bread, and French fries. I can honestly say I threw 100% of that to-go order away last night. So gross."

I believe there is an extra charge for tomatoes, but I prefer no tomatoes, so I am good. 

But, my favorite thing here is the cheese curds. They are incredible. I actually took a supplier here, who was born in Wisconsin. I wanted him to tell me if these things were authentic. He said they were the real deal. So, if you are a fried cheese fan, you must try them here. I dont understand how they are not on the list for Denver&#39;s best cheese curds.

It is a decent size and there is a bar up there. It could be a great bar. That said, this place wants to be cool. But the staff just isn&#39;t cool. They aren&#39;t even good at their jobs. The bartenders lack personal skills and have trouble keeping up with even the smallest crowds. They also seem to have issues making decent cocktails. Margarita, jack and coke, greyhound....they were all terrible. Now I know what you are thinking....this place is an &#34;ale house&#34; you can&#39;t judge them on a cocktail. Fair enough. They do have a decent beer list but it will probably take you a while to get one from this slow staff. In par for the course fashion the bouncers are pretty rude and act more like this place is located in LoDo on a busy night rather than South Broadway on a Saturday afternoon. Managers sit back and watch it all while doing nothing to correct the situation. 

2 stars. One for the beer list. One for the rooftop deck. Minus 3 stars for managers, bartenders/drinks, and bouncers. No opinions about the food."

The upstairs patio is great to sit out on a nice, sunny day, but don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re pressed for time.  This place is also pricey for what you actually get.  We ordered the jalapeno basket for $8.95.  That was a total ripoff.  We received a really small basket of sliced, deep-fried jalapenos and onion strings.  If you put all the jalapeno strips together, it would come out to about three medium sized jalapenos.  Not worth $8.95!  

Most of our party opted for their happy hour cheeseburger special for $5.95.  It comes with a beer of choice or a soda.  That would be a great deal, but the fries that came with it were soggy and gross.  If you wanted a piece of lettuce and tomato, it would be $1.50 extra.  I also got charged for a side of ranch that never came.  The burger itself was average for store-bought, pre-formed patties.  The Pepsi I got with the meal tasted weird like they haven&#39;t cleaned the bar guns in a long time.  The only positive in this experience was the mimosas for $6 a piece. 

Overall, a very underwhelming experience."

It is against the law to discriminate against or treat someone unfairly on the basis of prejudice. Disrespected, disgusted &amp; DISAPPOINTED. 1 star for our exp on 04.09.16 evening. 4stars for venue, ambiance, rooftop, selection of beers on tap &amp; late night HH specials. We began the evening celebrating a bday@PBS w/ a lrg Grp of 30. Then we decided to venture w/ a Smler Grp of 8 to historians for drinks, rooftop views &amp;some bar food. The disrespect, disgust &amp;disappointment began @the door even before we entered. The bouncer named Marcin, rudely made a disgusted face&amp; deflated hot air of annoyance as he opened the door to me. Let me preface this review by stating that I am recovering from a foot surgery so I was in a knee scooter. I was offended but didn&#39;t want to make assumptions about why he had reacted that way to my presence. I didn&#39;t know if it was because of my race, me being in a scooter/handicapped or the grp of people@the door. My gf noticed his face of disgust &amp; shaking his head. It was awkward to say the least. She jokingly called him out on it. His annoyance &amp; RUDENESS with me being handicapped was f***ed up. I was def in SHOCK/surprised to be treated like that at the door. At 1st I brushed it off...didn&#39;t want to be the reason why our Grp couldn&#39;t have fun@ this bar. Typically...I would have called him out on his shit as soon as we walked in &amp; walk right out. There are tons of other bars on Broadway that deserve our business but decided it WASN&#39;T worth causing a scene in my scooter. Ugh! It&#39;s already humiliating enough being in a knee scooter. But then he made a scene, causing most of the noisy bar to STARE at me, told me he would not allow my scooter in &amp; I had to leave it at the door with him, &amp; then said Inappropriate things. WHAT AN ASS! My thoughts were &#34;Are you serious? Does he really have the nerve to tell a handicapped person to leave? &amp; discourage them from staying? &amp; tell them to leave their only mode of transportation/mobility@ the door?&#34; Is it their policy to shoo away someone in a wheelchair too? Other establishments at least TRY to accommodate someone who is disabled or OFFER OPTIONS. He could have offered the OPEN Booths next to the front door instead of dismissing me because of my scooter. Not welcoming a disabled person was offensive. I did not need to climb stairs if he offered that space. What a douche. After that first impression...I decided it wasn&#39;t worth battling an idiot. Luckily I am recovering from a surgery &amp; can actually walk... But doctors advised me to stay off my foot&amp; use a scooter this weekend. So I told the bouncer that it&#39;s OK I can walk up the stairs. To avoid any more of a scene I told him I don&#39;t mind leaving my scooter here &amp; headed for the stairs. I was embarrassed...w/all eyes on me &amp;the awkward situation. I was ready to dismiss the humiliation &amp; have a good time @this bar. But the bouncer wouldn&#39;t let it go&amp; caused a bigger scene. Of course having great friends...They called the bouncer out on his inappropriate behavior, rudeness&amp;discrimination on disabilities. It definitely escalated &amp; the bouncer was in my friends&#39; face. I was so embarrassed that my friend had to defend me&amp; sadly the bouncer had no clue how inappropriate he was. I get that his job is supposed to help avoid of any liability issue But that is definitely not a way to greet patrons &amp; treat people with so much disrespect. He definitely needs more training on customer service or ADA compliant laws/discrimination. After getting upstairs of course our grp of friends were so UPSET&amp; distraught it RUINED our evening. We tried to brush it off so a few grabbed some drinks, the rest of the group just couldn&#39;t get over how incredibly rude that man was. I spoke to one of the security guys named Sky &amp;shared our frustration/disrespectful exp. He apologized &amp;said that they have issues with Marcin &amp; I should mention it to a manager. I respect&amp; appreciate that the other security staff checked in on us, notified the manager, offered me chairs &amp; to carry my scooter up the stairs SO THAT I WOULD NOT have to stand on 1 foot. I appreciated the manager Paul Potts coming over to apologize &amp; offering our grp complimentary drinks for the bouncers bad behavior. I understand the situation w/the scooter, the space in the bar or liability. However it definitely could have been handled differently &amp; communicated without discriminating against someone who has a disability. The manager made a comment about him not being from around here...Poland. I am not the person who would want someone to get fired over discrimination but WOW he was very offensive &amp; I was humiliated. Marcin def could be a reason for a LAWSUIT. He is the ambassador or 1st impression of the bar. Discrimination is a serious offense. One day that FOOL may have a disability&amp; would not want to be mistreated."

I got the eggs Benedict for my meal. The eggs were perfect but the English muffin was a little hard and the ham tasted like it was from a frozen meal. I was disappointed in the food!

My Bloody Mary was good, friends enjoyed their beers, but our food was more miss than hit.

Their happy hour is great! They have various beer sizes so you can order a bunch of smaller ones rather than a full pint.

The crowd is an odd mix, but is typical for Broadway. It&#39;s definitely a casual place and most people will be in jeans and flannels. Though there are always girls in heels and bodycon dresses...on Broadway..."

They are open early enough for brunch goers craving food and mimosas and above all they have a very nice outdoor rooftop patio (also heated) with a nice view of Denver. Did I mention they do free beer college nights every first Monday of the month? They invite a featured brewery to teach about their beers. That remain on tap for the month. There&#39;s free beer tastings and the Brewers often bring free swag to give away. I highly recommend Historians Ale House!"

They have one of the best selections of beer, and they&#39;re all on tap. I absolutely love coming here in the summertime to enjoy the upstairs patio.

When it gets super hot in the summer, they even have misters they turn on for the hardcore lunch-break sun enthusiast. It&#39;s an awesome lunch experience for sure.

I love the patio.
I hate the indoor part.  Bad use of space, bad acoustics, not good for groups.

I like the food.
They do it &#34;Pittsburgh&#34; style sandwiches and don&#39;t give you plates because they&#39;re wrapped it up in paper and just plop it on your table.  I guess this is fine, but when you&#39;ve ordered a fried egg in your burger it&#39;s pretty messy-something I don&#39;t need help with as I&#39;m clumsy by myself, thank you!

The waitstaff is usually awful.
The beer selection is better (way better) than the nearly identical establishment Irish Rover down the street.  

The menu selection is pretty big.
They add some random things in the food that don&#39;t need to be added.

Vegetarian options.
Sometimes they give everything on one plate, like street tacos, which mortified my vegetarian friends who were dining with my carnivore friends.  Plus, both parties had food allergies so they rightfully had to request a redo.

I&#39;m torn.  My friends are torn.  We can&#39;t decide if we like this place or if we&#39;re going to divorce it, a la like we did with Punch Bowl Social.

Also, not having umbrellas on each table for a roof top patio place is an interesting choice.  (At least as of May they did not have them...).  Being annoyed at wanting the table wiped down is also a weird policy.  As is serving your food, in said paper wrapping, while being huddled up and standing at the bar because it&#39;s raining.

At best, Historian&#39;s Ale House still has some may-jah kinks to work out.  At worst it&#39;s not as great as I want it to be."

Pros:
*Very cool rooftop with fireplaces and heating lamps.
*It wasn&#39;t crowded so we were able to be right in front of the TV to watch the game.
*The food: We all shared pork sliders, chips &amp; salsa, fish &amp; chips, &amp; street tacos, delicious!
*The prices, standard for the area, meals around $11, draft beers $4.50-$6
*The atmosphere of the interior, beautiful wood. Very well designed.
*Decent crowd

Cons:
*ALL ASPECTS OF THE SERVICE!

When we sat down, we waited a considerable amount of time before our brunette waitress who takes risks with eye shadow colors and wears leggings to work comes and plops our menus down (not enough menus might I add) and then runs away as if we have the ebola virus without saying so much as a word to us.

We wait another considerable amount of time. I go up to what looks like the manager and kindly mention we are ready to order drinks. To my dismay, a couple minutes later, the same girl comes up with the fakest smile &amp; tone imaginable and takes our order. We were all  nice to her, assuming she had a rough day. I was a server for 6 years. I understand.

She barley returns to get our food order after dropping off drinks. When she does, she is walking away while we are still ordering. Turning around to barely catch what we want, her back literally faced to us as if trying to run away. It was extremely awkward and bizarre.

Our food took much longer than it should have, probably over 20 minutes. It&#39;s a good thing we were occupied watching the game &amp; didn&#39;t just come here for dinner or we would have cancelled it and left. When it did arrive, some girl dropped it off and also ran away before I could ask for silveware and an extra plate, so I had to get up once again and find it myself.

No one came to ask how the food was. Our waters remained empty most of the night, dirty plates sitting in front of us, and constantly wanting to order more beers as we saw the bottom of our glasses all too often. 

Eventually some other girl started serving us and crazy eye shadow was no where to be seen. The next server was attentive, although she seemed very exhausted and not very lively or personable.

I won&#39;t be returning, a huge part of why people go out instead of staying in is because they are greeted and waited on in a friendly manner. If the service is this bad, it really ruins your time, no matter how good the food or atmosphere is. There is too much good competition nearby, don&#39;t waste your time checking out Histrorians."

My husband had the blackened salmon Asian salad which visually was not appealing, but said it was decent and filling. I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich and got a side salad instead of fries. Could tell the lettuce wasn&#39;t super fresh but it was okay. The sandwich came in a big brown bag, which was awkward to open and eat in a restaurant. They ended up giving me fries as well, which I didn&#39;t want, but they ended up being luke warm so didn&#39;t end up eating many anyway. Great ambiance just not good execution on the food."

We keep coming back and always make a beeline straight upstairs to the patio. In warm weather there is plentiful outdoor space with an upper and lower seating area as well as an upstairs bar. There is table service which is especially nice, but you also still have the bar as an option. In colder weather the bar is in a nice covered area with a few tables, and there is a fireplace and numerous heat lamps scattered across the deck making it just as pleasant.

The beer list here is expansive, with many local rotating taps, they tend to feature a local brewery for a few weeks to a month at a time, the last time we went Denver Beer Co was featured, but I&#39;ve also seen Dry Dock, Lonetree, and Caution brewing all featured before. The beer menu is separated out nicely into beer categories making it easy to find just what you are looking for. The food here is also quite good, certainly above average for bar food. From the appetizers (such as cheese curds, fried pickles, and a neat brat/pretzel dish) to the burgers (of which there are several interesting preparations) all the food exceeds the bar food standard heartily, while not quite making it to gourmet status.

Historians to me is a perfect place to catch a happy hour or early evening drink, with the food as a good option for either a snack or a quick dinner. The prices are reasonable, the service quite good, and until they get crowded at night, it&#39;s easy to hold conversation and enjoy the amazing views from the rooftop."

We stopped in earlier this week and absolutely loved it. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with recommendations, which we appreciated, considering how many beers they have on tap. 

We were here for several hours, and over the course of the afternoon we split the fried cheese curds (some of the best I&#39;ve had in Denver), the hummus plate (but yum - red pepper hummus), and the burger special. The burger special really is a great deal... for $4.95 you get a cheeseburger, fries, and a beer. We upgraded to the veggie patty, and even I loved it - and I&#39;m a carnivore. It was the best veggie burger I&#39;ve had in a long time, and even my sister (an actual vegetarian) was very impressed. I see there are some complaints about how they serve their burgers and sandwiches - wrapped in butcher paper and tied with string - but I loved it. It was like getting my meal as a little gift. :)

We arrived pretty much right when they opened. They were able to seat our rather large group right away. The servers and bartenders were friendly and attentive. And when I say attentive I mean I never saw the bottom of my bottomless mimosa, mad props!
I had the Spanish Hangover for breakfast and it was pretty good. I think the spicy hollandaise was my favorite part. It was spicy but not too spicy that it overpowered everything else on the plate. Jeff S. had the prime rib hash. I figure as the girlfriend it&#39;s kinda my right to try out his breakfast too. It was amazing!  When we go back that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be ordering.

We enjoyed various draft beers as well as the Double Layered Prime Rib Nachos, which were very tasty. The draft beer selection was quite impressive and decently priced.

Still not sure I&#39;d give it the extra star, but after coming back here three or four times since my first review, i have not been dissappointed - which seems a bit surprising given many other reviews say it&#39;s hit or miss. 

The waitress (i think Jonni) said she was new, but was great. Little things that made her newness come through were more than made up for by her personability and excellent service.

Side note: they still seem to be figuring out their pricing on some things, but they&#39;ve done away with the $25 pint of Matilda. Good move there. Go with the brewery of the month at $2.50  for 10 oz and you can usually have some pretty darn good beer at a reasonable price."

I quickly snagged two seats at the bar as other patrons eyed them. However, I quickly realized that these seats were open because the TV directly in front was out of service. We ended up turning to our right to watch the TV over the doorway instead. 

I ordered a local Scotch Ale and the fish and chips. They paired well, the dark and smooth beer along with the fried but moist fish. The chips were a little dry, but I happily doused them with malt vinegar. 

Our friend joined us about halfway through the game, famished from her morning exercising. Unfortunately, the kitchen was backed up and they would not put in her food order. They offered a free beer, but she needed something in her stomach first. With an unestimated wait time, she snacked on the remainder of my fries, lacking the much-needed protein. About 20 minutes later she departed for the grocery store and they started taking orders shortly thereafter.

Applebee&#39;s new menu is terrible! The meal I ordered was inedible as was the replacement meal I took &#34;to go&#34;. Even the green beans were a problem as the stems were still on the beans!. Herbs are a wonderful gift unless not properly used. management  needs to convey this problem to the corporation  who manages these restaurants and correct these ASAP.

When we visited again, we were very pleased when ordering our usual bowls of french onion soup.  They were perfect and have been on every visit since.

Well that&#39;s about to change a little.  Needed a place for a quick lunch on the way to the airport this afternoon so decided what the heck.    We were quickly greeted and seated.  

It&#39;s been well over a year since I have visited this or any location so everything on the menu had changed.  Decisions decisions.   I went with the pick 2 lunch Tomato Basil soup and 4 cheese mac with Honey Glazed Chicken Tenders. 

I was beyond happy with my selections.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I was actually floored over the Mac and Cheese.  This was certainly not something that was boil noodles and squeeze a sauce over it.  There was roasted jalapeno bits through out the cheese sauce and covered in very large pieces of REAL BACON.    

I was in a Mac and Cheese mood and this certainly hit the mark for me today.   Oh yes.. the soup.  This was a nice little cup of creamy Tomato Basil goodness. 

Their happy hour starts at 3 so this also fits into my day nicely.  

I will reurn!"

I ordered the butchers meat and potatoes which was as visually unappealing as it was unappetizing. Looked like Fancy Feast tasted like cheap frozen tv diner. My wifes salmon was passable but she thought 15 dollars as a crime for the size and flavor. Her grilled veggies were raw and the so called bed of spinach was a pathetic smear of wet mush. The kitchen was slow to get food out but our server was nice and did a good job taking care of our needs. The server picked up on our displeasure and informed the manager who seemed uncertain in his responsibilities.

I opted for the &#34;Sizzling Double Barrel Whisky Sirloins&#34; with garlic mashed taters my Mrs. had a side salad (huge, an I helped!) and French Onion soup and considering how fast she wolfed it down it must have been good!
My steak was a perfect &#34;rare&#34; and the sauteed peppers and onions fantastic! The potatoes were good also.
I took 1/2 of my steak with me and &#34;nuked it&#34; in the am and ate it with the &#34;free&#34; breakfast the hotel offers the next day!

Steven was our server and I&#39;m not even joking or exaggerating when I say he is the best server I&#39;ve ever had. Having been a server myself, I know having just two people sit at your booth at 9:45pm is not the best case scenario. However, Steven was overly attentive and catered to our every need before we even knew we needed it! He was spot on and a rock star even helping out the host and cleaning tables, even when he had an entire section full at a late hour.

The moment we walked in we were so called greeted by a hostess who offered us seating in the &#34;bar area&#34;   We declined the offer and  told the hostess we prefer not to be seated in the bar area. The hostess immediately had a attitude for some unknown reason, gave us the worst look, rolled her eyes and didn&#39;t say anything to us about finding us a table. Finally after 10 minutes she found us a table. 

We didn&#39;t have any issues with anything else, but if you decide to come to this specific location, prepare your self for a hostess with attitude. The first thing you want in any restaurant is to feel welcome and greeted with kindness. Not in this case.

We walked in and were not greeted by anyone but noted a half full restaurant. We stood at the front of the restaurant awkwardly for a few minutes before we were seated. Since no one came out to greet or said much of anything when we walked in, that&#39;s what it was. Awkward. Do we seat ourselves? There was no signage. 

Anyway, I also noticed after sitting in the booth for a bit that other people just came in and sat down on their own. Is this just something that&#39;s unspoken? This doesn&#39;t work for a restaurant...we need signage! 

We had waited a good 10 minutes before someone came out and was clearing a table behind us. I finally had enough and had to ask for menus. What also peeved me was that people who came in AFTER us seemed to get served BEFORE us. Major peeve and major thumbs down. Menus, condiments, utensils you name it. We got it last after a good other few groups sat down. 

Ordered chicken pho which was pretty decent. Overall, flavors were good but the amounts of food that are typically given at other establishments were much less. Same price, less food. You may or may not be ok with that. My friend got a grilled shrimp bun dish and he got jipped on the shrimp. 

So to sum it up, I would definitely not choose to return based on this experience. Service was completely lacking, food portions not as good as compared to other restaurants. Hence the reason I will not rave. 

The optimist in me wants to say maybe this was just a bad night and maybe they were short staffed?"

Their pho is definitely better than a lot of places though. I usually go to the one off of havana (pho 95 I think), but now that I found a pho place that&#39;s close to my house and it is good, I do not need to go so far! 

We ordered their shrimp and beef salad, it was $9.95 and it is not worth it. If you&#39;ve had the traditional Vietnamese shrimp salads then you would understand. It was bland and there were not a lot of ingredients mixed in.... and what I thought weird was that they added lettuce in so it looks fuller on the plate.

It was ready quickly, and the place appears clean which is always good. 
 Got home and the waiter and I apparently miscommunicated or there was a mistake because I got the shrimp spring rolls instead- but oh my gosh, one taste of that peanut sauce and I didn&#39;t even care anymore! Yum. 
 The broth was a little lighter on flavors such as star anise, but overall good and WOW! They gave big portions of meat, noodles and weren&#39;t cheap on the basil like other places.

Stopped in for a later dinner and thought we&#39;d try a new spot. We were seated promptly as there were only 3 other occupied tables. The waiter was very nice and we immediately had water and menus. It seemed to take forever to get our Vietnamese egg rolls and when they came out it looked like we only got a half order at a full order price. They were hot out of the fryer and the veggies were very fresh but definitely not proportionate to what a normal order looks like at any  other Vietnamese restaurant or to the amount of veggies left uneaten on the plate. Disappointing. Took forever for the pho to came which was surprising considering how quickly it is served everywhere else.  The Pho was good but on the pricier side for pho. Really hot and flavorful broth with a ton of green onion. Basic veggies accompanying the soup but missing culantro. Long story short is that we will continue to go to Pho 888 on Sable for Pho in Aurora.

Pho broth is flavorful, fried rice is good, eggrolls are yummy and made from real rice paper (bothers me when restaurants try to pass off things in Lumpia wrappers as Vietnamese eggrolls -- big taste difference!) 

Crab cheese wontons here are the BEST! Huge, stuffed to the brim with filling, and baked til they&#39;re nice and golden brown on top... you can tell they&#39;re homemade vs the frozen things you get everywhere else!

Staff is efficient and friendly.

Parking lot can be kind of treacherous in the winter as I swear the entire thing turns to a sheet of ice, but that&#39;s not their fault.

Our go-to place for a Vietnamese fix... when we don&#39;t feel like driving all the way across town to Federal! We introduce this place to all our friends, and every one ends up changing their go-to place to here! 

Only other downside (again, not their fault!) is the crappy neighbor of the Cajun place. Sometimes blasting their loud music so the bass is thumping through the walls, sometimes smoking out the entire shopping plaza with their grill... annoying!!!"

Portion sizes were decent and food tasted OK, but nothing to rave about. Our table felt sticky, as did the floor, so that kind of took away from our enjoyment of the meal. Not to mention that for some reason, it took a long time for them to get the food out to our party of 7. Lots of tables that were seated after us received their food way earlier. I didn&#39;t think we ordered anything that should have taken a long time to prepare (pho, standard rice and vermicelli dishes) so maybe the long wait was so we could all get our food around the same time...except the food came out staggered so who knows. Given the plethora of other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, I would probably try others before considering returning to this one again."

I love their combo rice noodle bowl #16 and my husband enjoys the rice combonation plate #15.  It is great to have a place close to home I can get my noodle bowl craving from (since my absolute favorite place Saigon Bowl with a huge menu is on the way other side of town - HUGE menu).  I need to really try Pho someday but can&#39;t get past the rice noodle bowl....LOL!

I knew there had been a Pho restaurant here before, but I had never been to it.  I saw the &#34;Grand Opening&#34; banner hanging above the entrance, and made a mental note to check this place out.  I am very glad that I came back a couple days later to give them a try.

I ordered my standard Pho (Rare Steak, usually a #2) with a side of meatball.  Since I wanted to check out my other favorite items, I also ordered the Vietnamese spring roll (with shrimp).  The spring rolls came out quickly, and they were quite large.  Indeed, this would have been an appetizer better suited to two people.  The lettuce was nice and crisp.  The rice noodles inside were in the proper ratio.  And the shrimp was artfully visible through the wrapper.  The peanut sauce was flavorful, and had the slowly building medium heat that I enjoy.  So far, so good.

I was by myself and I had only ordered a small, so I was a bit surprised at the large plate of Pho veggies they brought out.  These veggies were cold, crisp, fresh, and abundant.  Along with the expected bean sprouts, thai basil, lime wedges, and jalapeno slices, they also provided ngo gai (aka culantro, Mexican coriander, or long coriander).  I was glad to see this, as many of the Pho places I have been to in the suburbs do not bother including this particular green.  Or else they substitute cilantro, which is just not quite the same.  When my small bowl of Pho arrived, I gave it the once over.  The amount of rare steak was appropriate (neither stingy, nor generous).  There were more green onions floating in the bowl than I normally see, but that was fine with me.  The broth was very good, and nicely flavorful.  For those who enjoy Pho, the broth really makes or breaks the whole shebang.  Everything came together well.  My side of meatball was a reasonable serving, and tasted just fine.

My only very minor complaint would be that the noodle to broth ratio was off a bit.  There were actually too many noodles in the bowl (I know, what a thing to whine about).  This made for a very hearty serving for a small, but I was wishing for more of the tasty broth.  Service was good, and the servers were friendly.  This is now my neighborhood Pho place, and I know I will be back again."

Located at Parker and Quincy, it is somewhat obscured by a liquor store, but if drive around the back, past the 7-11 and over the hellish pot-holes of Mordor, you will see this place in the corner.

The portions are huge, and the broth is excellent! A small is generally too much to eat as they fill it with noodles and meat, and it is just filling! The Crab Cheese Wontons are not to be missed either!

A group of us went there for dinner, and while we were served OK, this feels more like a lunch place or a take-out place. It just doesn&#39;t have that dinner atmosphere, but the food... good golly miss molly, is very good!"

They charge more for their appetizers and bowls of pho than other places and seem a little stingy with the portions as well. Both times we&#39;ve gone we got the Vietnamese eggrolls with only four little pieces (as opposed to eight at other establishments I&#39;ve been to) and the rare steak pho. We&#39;ve had the same server both times who is on the lackadaisical side and seems to be the only server there. The first time we went he brought out all of our food at once and the second time we had to ask him to get the appetizer first and then after waiting 15 minutes after we were done, flag him down to get our bill. Is the pho good? Heck yeah. The broth is legit and that&#39;s what makes the famous bowl but there&#39;s nothing really special about this place to keep me coming back for more."

When we entered, a man across the room simply pointed at a table with a menu on it and gestured for us to sit down before leaving to do other things.  He quickly brought water. Then much later a woman came up and asked us to order. I got Chicken Pho and my husband got chicken and rice. He asked for them to hold the pickled carrot as he doesn&#39;t like them. The waitress laughed and ridiculed him for not liking carrots, which was weird. When the food came, my soup was lukewarm. The chicken was extremely dry and over cooked and chewy. The amount of noodles was plentiful, which was the one redeeming factor. My husband asked for a fork since he has problems with fine motor things like using chopsticks. They never brought alone so he used my pho spoon. Not once did anyone come by to ask how our meals were or to refill water. When we finished we waited about 1/2 hour for the check. There were only about 6 other parties in the restaurant and was by no means busy. We didn&#39;t get to even see the bill before paying.

Now for the Pho - some of the best of I have had! Broth is delicious and perfectly seasoned - add a little siracha and oyster sauce and we are in business. Noodles were perfectly al dente, all white meat chick shredded. Onions and some jalapeno just made it! It also came with a big place of mint, bean shoots and more jalapeno. It was great - hot and a little spicy (or maybe that was the siracha). But perfectly satisfying and the medium was huge! We also ordered the Vermicelli noodle bowl with chicken.

Onto the food.....meat is tender and broth is super hot and not greasy.  They have the typical pho side addons that are hoisin sauce sriacha and vinegar and chili paste.

I told the waiter and he told the manager. The waiter apologized but nothing from the manager. So needless to say we will not be back ever!

Not once were we told why our two hamburger meals were taking so long and we were sitting there listening to other guests tell the waiter their food order was wrong. Wasted almost an hour here with empty stomachs and a grouchy kiddo who is sad he didn&#39;t get his lunch he ordered. Called GM and he wasn&#39;t helpful either.

Our waiter, Michael, was incredibly sensitive to our dietary restrictions and kept going back and forth to inform us of foods that we ordered that had the ingredients we couldn&#39;t eat. He was one of the better waiters I&#39;ve ever had and he made our experience very enjoyable. On to the food. I had the 8 oz sirloin steak with sweet potato fries and steamed broccoli. The steak was dry, but I wanted it well done so that may have contributed to the dry factor. The broccoli was good but could have had a bit more flavor to it. The sweet potato fries were my favorite. They were fried to perfection and they had a salty taste to them that was perfect for my taste buds. For drinks, I had the strawberry lemon quencher and that was easily my favorite part. It was so sweet and you could really taste the strawberry in it. I would definitely recommend that as a drink to get. Overall a great experience with reasonable prices but the steak could have been a bit juicier."

I gave this place two chances. First time they completely forgot a half rack of ribs. No problem.  Called to see what could be done. They said it would be refunded. OK, awesome. It never made it back to the credit card. OK whatever, the food is really good. Ordered again tonight and the salad was literally lettuce and cheese. No bacon,  cucumbers, nothing. Also,  my girlfriend and I&#39;s favorite dessert of all time,  the Blondie,  did not come with the special sauce. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE BLONDIE!!!! come on guys.

Went there recently, and noticed that the serving size of the food was dramatically reduced, my piece of Salmon was very small, but still tasty.  I ordered a half slab of ribs to take home (as I usually do) I was dissapointed when I warmed them up, for $13.99 I had the smallest half slab of ribs I ever seen, I only had 4 bones, this must have been from a Pygmy Pig!  Not worth the cost, I felt ripped off and wished I would have looked at this before I left the restaurant, but I trusted that they would be honest with their portions instead of giving me a fourth of a portion instead of half.  You lost another regular customer."

Sunday afternoon, 3pm, 9 months pregnant and all I want is soup and salad. I chose two items from the menu and was told I couldn&#39;t have a soup and salad combo bc it was the weekend. After confirming with her manager, I ended up purchasing the two items separately and ultimately not getting the salad I wanted bc they don&#39;t offer the combo or half sized salads. My husband asked for a strawberry limeade and received a strawberry lemonade. When he got his refill she said they made it wrong the first time and proceeded to give him a cherry limeade. This may not seem like a big deal but lemonade with fruit vs sprite with grenadine is a big difference. She didn&#39;t even ask him which he&#39;d prefer. He would&#39;ve liked to have had the same beverage for the whole meal and not have it changed hallway thru. The store manager was clearly seen asking all the other tables around us how their meal was and making small talk but he completely avoided our table. Knowing that we had a issue with the menu to begin with I would&#39;ve expected him to at least stop by and see how we were doing but he didn&#39;t. He avoided us like the plague. Our booth had greasy finger prints all over the walls and our hostess was neither in a rush to seat us or thank us for dining when we left. Apparently her conversation with another employee was too important to be disrupted with a simple, hello or thank you and good bye. We will not return to say the least."

It has been ages since we last step in any Applebee&#39;s...  Man they really &#34;revamped&#34; their interior looks what nots...

We went here for Dinner after work since we don&#39;t feel like travelling across town etc just to have Dinner.  Time was about 19:00hrs.  We came in, greeted by the one of the staffs, and ushered to one of the Booth Seating in the &#34;Military Room&#34;...  Err, this room is filled with pictures of Military Personnel, Jet Fighters what nots..

From the extensive menu they offer, we opt to order the following items :

*  Ultimate Trio ($12.99)
*  Mushroom Swiss Burger ($10.99)
*  Fish &amp; Chips ($12.99)

Hubs opt to have Coffee ($2.49) while I opt to have Fountain Root Beer ($2.49).  

Our lovely server who is originally from Korea, her name is Kyong J.  She is indeed attentive, answers our questions and so cheerful!  

Our food came out periodically.  From what I could recall, the items we choose for the Ultimate Trio are Classic Wings with Asian Dressing, Cheeseburger Sliders and Grilled Chicken Wonton Tacos.  There is 2 Sliders each, hence Hubs can have 1 and I can have 1.  Both Hubs and I like those Ultimate Trio that we choose.  Hubs likes his Main Entr√©e of Fish &amp; Chips, and so do I, for my Main Entr√©e of Mushroom Swiss Burger.  Portion are decent and we are indeed stuffed after that  Dinner evening.

YES, this establishment is large enough to have or bring a PARTY!  A lot more patrons with their families and kids came in, while we were there.  The area where we were seated its more &#34;quieter&#34; compared to the Main Bar area, where ALOT of TV Screens are showing the latest game in town etc.

All in all Decent Dining experience here and may return when needed.  Left this establishment about 20:00hrs ish.

The opening hours for this Applebee&#39;s Aurora Location is as following :
*  Monday - Thursday : 11:00 AM to 12:00 AM
*  Friday - Saturday : 11:00 AM to 1:00 AM
*  Sunday :   11:00 AM to 12:00 AM

Call them in advance to verify their operation hours in case, they might change it.

Extremely poor service as s single diner.  One night it was the 20 minute wait to have anyone ask for a drink order (while I saw multiple other tables get seated, drink orders taken, and their drinks delivered).  Two different nights I was brought the wrong food.  And another I practically had to tackle a waitperson to get my bill.  All seemed very strange given this is a restaurant surrounded by hotels with single dining business types. 

I observed a manager only once in the four visits.  The wait staff all seemed inexperienced.  And they didn&#39;t help or cover for each other.  I saw one poor gal working madly, while a couple others stood around chatting with each other for lack of anything to do. 

Mostly mediocre bar food. Heavy fried foods, greasy burgers and such.  Weak attempt at regular entrees - very low quality steak, barely cooked veggies, heavy sauces and cold hot food.  Only reason this place gets two stars instead of one is the wings.  I&#39;m a fan of the double crunch bone in wings with spicy Asian chili seasoning.  They are excellent. Not excellent enough to make up for the other problems, but dang, I like those wings!

So, bottom line think of this place as a bar and it makes more sense.  If you&#39;re looking for a beer and some bar food, this place is okay.  If you&#39;re looking for a meal at a restaurant that happens to have bar service, it&#39;s a disappointment.  I&#39;ll only be back if I&#39;m going to the bar for a beer."

Tried to have a drink and watch a couple football games, we were unable to.  A very loud, intoxicated and foul-mouthed individual sitting on the other side of the bar made it impossible.  The manager, instead of approaching the person, just talked about him with the wait staff standing at the bar front.  Instead of enjoying a couple of drinks, and ordering dinner, we were so disgusted that we had to order dinner to go, finish the one drink we purchased and left.  Shame on the manager for not stepping in and asking the individual to quiet down, even though the bartender had asked him 3 times in the 45 minutes we were there.  He (manager) lost some money on this one.  The poor gentlemen next to us were leaving as well.  So, if this is your type of scene, check this place out and listen for Marcus from San Antonio who is a dental technician that is here framing houses in Castle Rock and has two BMWs (a 98 and 01).  Yes, I learned this from across the bar.  Will not visit this establishment again.  Next time we go to Ted&#39;s next door."

I ordered curbside to go because in this part of town there&#39;s not much for healthy food and I need something easy fast. So i ordered a curbside to go and they left off the shrimp on my spinach shrimp salad. So I call back to redeem let them redeem themselves they did the next day gave me my lunch for free and that was nice. The shrimp salad wasn&#39;t that bad but the sweet potatoes that they had were actually stopped because there was no vent holes and they just ended up being like steam sweet potatoes. So today today i was ready for a better customer service experience. I  ordered curbside service again to see if I could get a good meal quick and easy to go. I order online and showed up exactly when they said that order will be ready I had to wait 15 minutes and then go in to see if the item was ready and it still wasn&#39;t ready. Not to mention my turkey sandwich was cold not hot.  Applebee&#39;s although I&#39;ve never really been a huge fan I was disappointed in your lack of customer service considering you&#39;re such a corporate agency. Won&#39;t be wasting my time trying to get curbside service during lunch time when I need a quick easy fix for lunch. Wish you had your stuff together at this location.

This is a semi-industrial area and there&#39;s 3 restaurants just a block from the hotel, Montana Grill, Uno Pizza &amp; Applebee&#39;s... After spending the whole afternoon skiing, then stuck in the traffic for nearly 3.5 hrs and missing our flight back to Houston, we thought, why not go crazy and eat something fattening and unhealthy...  So, Applebee&#39;s that is!

We ordered the following:

The Ultimate Trio $11.49: Choose any 3 items from about 12 choices and I picked the [1] Quesadilla tower with chunks of steak, bell peppers, onions &amp; lots of cheese, very flavorful and taste better when you dipped into the salsa that comes with it, the best item [2] Boneless hot wing with ranch dip, get about 8 crispy chicken nuggets dipped in some sort of tabasco mixes [3] Cheese slider, you get 2 of this slightly bigger than usual slider with a generous patty. I didnt touch the 2nd one and not even finish the first. Its just OK but its sure better than the slider from Little Big!

Burger $9.99: My partner went for this huge helping of burger with fries. It came open-face with a big patty &amp; equally sized slice of cheese and 2 slices of bacons, i didnt taste it but it does look OK!

Perfect Ritas: They uses the premium spirit and served straight up in a salt-rimmed Martini glass. Yes, this was a PERFECT rita, love it! 

Peach Sangria: Quite refreshing but lack the &#34;fruitiness&#34;. They uses Sutter Home White Zin, so, nothing to rave about...

Overall, we had quite a satisfying meal considering the day we had. We just want to eat something and go back to our room, rest and fly back to Houston the next day. I have been to Applebee&#39;s once before about 4 years ago and the most memorable thing i had was their riblets, i&#39;m glad they still serve that but this time, i wanted something different and i have to say, they are better than TGIF!"

I would not recommend this place. I&#39;m trying to continue writing my complaint about them, but their contact us page is down. Unlike my other reviews, I am not going to write a lot here, except to say that the service was horrible, the server was aggressive in her approach to us with taking our orders, and a manager who only cares about a table that he can hit on with the mom and her two young kids."

I visited a place next door to this restaurant and didn&#39;t like the clientele and staff as much as here at Applebee&#39;s. They would bring the receipt after ordering each drink which I liked to keep track of time. I&#39;d recommend comparing it to the other 3 or 4 restaurants in that vicinity but this one might be the best one for a visit with refreshments and food. Main reason is the people working there that I appreciated.

It had the same amount of cheese as the other person that ordered the normal house salad. Then we both had the 7oz sirloin off of the 2 for $20 menu they came out cooked correctly but tasted like they come to the restaurant frozen with the grill marks and they just warm them up in a broth of some sort."

This restaurant is very conveniently located to four enormous hotels all sharing the same parking lot essentially.  It can get busy the later you wait to go.  I suggest having dinner right at 5pm or so.

I am not picky and don&#39;t like to complain!  it&#39;s embarrassing as well as risky.  But I had to send my super sugary drink back because I just couldn&#39;t drink it.  Then I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was just a big boiled mess of ick.  my son ordered the mac n cheese and also didn&#39;t like it because it seemed about a day old.  Dark orange.  Dry and gritty.  When I sent back the scampi I apologized profusely.   But upon the waitresses return she didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted anything else she just handed me check and walked away.  Then the table next to me asked about the scampi because they noticed me send mine back.  The waitress said,  &#34; No.  It&#39;s good.  She just didn&#39;t like anything.&#34;  I&#39;ve waited tables.  And i have bartender so I am sympathetic to their situation but I in this situation it is on applebees this time.

Service was horrible. Our waitress must&#39;ve had a job at McDonalds last, where she thinks it&#39;s appropriate to bring the check  and ask if you want dessert after only 15% of your meal gone, then comes back and acts appalled that we haven&#39;t paid yet. Not to mention, she took a beer that still was about 10 percent full! Didn&#39;t ask if we were done or anything. She didn&#39;t know what was in one of their signature drinks that was on the front of the menu and didn&#39;t know what beers they had on tap? Then we called down a manager, which NEVER happens with us, we&#39;re pretty laid back. But I was so upset because she came back TWICE to see if we had paid yet when we&#39;re still eating. She wanted to take my salad while I WAS STILL eating it. AWFUL. I explained all this to the manager, or assistant manager, who made it obvious he could care less. His main concern was, was our food good? Yeah, BUT even if the food is bad, you could make a customers experience better just based on service and willingness to fix it. Service is more important than food in my opinion! It was insane to me. The manager fixed NOTHING, didn&#39;t even replace the beer that was taken while 10 percent full. I would think AT least that would be taken care of. Usually, when we go to applebees about once a week, we sit at the bar, I&#39;VE NEVER had any issues, but since this was the NEW applebees we decided to dine in.... won&#39;t be doing that. Stick with bar service. It&#39;s better. Just dumbfounded how little the manager cared. I regretfully, still tipped the waitress 10 percent of the check, just because she at least came and apologized... it just seemed her AND the manager just thought we were being &#34;difficult&#34; which is definitely not the case. We&#39;re very laid back. But I&#39;VE NEVER had my check brought to me after one bite into the meal, and asked if I wanted dessert when I haven&#39;t even finished a meal."

I drink beer but I am not an expert so thus was a welcome environment where it&#39;s self pour as much as you&#39;d like with over 20 options. How it works:
1. Present your ID and credit card for one of their cards.
2. Grab a glass (note there are wine and beer glasses) and browse the selection (sours, lights, IPAs, stouts, cider, wine) from all over the country
3. Tap your card and pour as much as you would like. I got pretty good at 2 oz tasters by doing a full open and immediate close
4. Order food by going to the back, requesting a dish and tapping your card
5. Close out your tab when you&#39;re done.

Theres plenty of seating indoors and outdoors and it&#39;s great for large groups. The food was tasty (see cheese spaetzle and grilled shishito peppers). I sampled at least five different beers with no pressure to commit."

The place is set up to make everything convenient for the customer. You give your credit card and ID, order food, then proceed to pour your own glass of beer.

Beers like Sip of Sunshine, RR&#39;s Temptation, Field to Ferment, Funkwerks Saison, Jolly Pumpkin, etc have been on draft here.

Wanted a place to go and try a bunch of different beers and this is it. As you walk up there&#39;s lot&#39;s of seating, inside, outside or up in this balcony section. I wanted to sit right inside by the 40 taps of beer lining the wall so beautifully!

All you do is go up to the register get your beer glass and a checkout card.. this is how you activate each beer tap and pour just what you want. Since you pay per ounce this is perfect for trying many many different beers. All the beers have a great  description card above them, very helpful with so many options. Love that there were so many IPA&#39;s on draft and ciders for the fall.

Bathrooms are available, but they are located out the side door and down the hallway...think they are shared with some offices in the building.

 Overall such a great concept:

-serving yourself
-you pay by the ounce
-so many options
-sampling at it&#39;s best"

When visitors come to Denver, chances are they want to try a lot of beer. First Draft is a great place to start that journey. You&#39;re given a card that you can then touch to different taps, pour as much of it as you want, drink, and repeat. The cards keep track of how much you drink and when you&#39;re ready to cash out, your total is determined based on the type of beer and quantity you consumed.

I probably tried about six different types of beer (equally around 18 oz) and was so surprised when my bill was only $10. It was also an educational experience, as all the different panels let you know information on the taste of the beer, where it&#39;s from, ABV, etc., so that you can really delve into what you may like, if you&#39;re not quite sure. Oh yeah, if you have wine, cocktail, or even kombucha lovers in your party, there&#39;s a tap for that!

I was also impressed by how tame and open it was on a Saturday night. I can only assume that&#39;s because there are SO many places to get your beer on in Denver, that not everyone is tempted to head to the same place. Sadly, I think if this concept was repeated in a place like Miami, it would be swarmed. But ya know, I&#39;m willing to give it a try!"

I love their concept and I wish there was one in LA. So basically, once you go you check in with the wait staff and they will check your ID and grab you card. You card is then paired with their high tech card that you will use to order food and drinks.

They have about 40 beers on tap and its pour your own! Its about $0.50 per ounce and their glass is about 12 ounces so about $6 a glass which is pretty standard. The cool part is that because its pour your own, you can just pour and bit and taste until you get the beer you like. You just tap the card on the beer of your choice and pour. It keeps tracks of how many ounces you&#39;ve poured and whatnot. When you order food, you also use the same card so that gets rid of splitting the tab!

My only complaint is that there was only 1 person in the front of the house and she was doing everything - Greeting people, setting up the cards, cleaning tables, serving food and processing the payments. She did a great job but because she was the only one it took a bit of time to get food and checks.

Genius! Please open one in LA! Sign me up!"

You get a swipe card tied to a credit/debit card with a limit of 32 oz per person. They have 40 taps of all different kinds of beer and a couple of wines and even a kombucha when we were there. 

To pour, just tap your card on the lower right corner of the sign above the tap and start pouring. The screen will show you how many ounces you poured and how many ounces you have left. It also tells you how much each pour is per ounce. When you&#39;re done you cash out at the register and you can pay with the credit/debit card they have on file.

Pouring your own beer is really fun! I liked being able to try just a little bit of several different beers. There is plenty of outdoor seating; my friends and I sat outside and played Yahtzee that we brought with us. They have a full kitchen and happy hour deals on food.

They have a few ciders too.  Once you tap the card on the screen, it lights up green and you&#39;re ready to pour however much you want.  When you&#39;re ready to try something else, you can invert your glass and rinse it out.

They also have a food menu and we ordered poutine fries, wings, a burger, and bone marrow.  Food was good to munch on with the different beers on tap.

If we have serve yourself fro-yo, why can&#39;t we have serve yourself beer? And surprisingly, beer is not the only thing they have on tap! 

Right when you walk in, you&#39;ll see a bunch of tables/seats where you just seat yourself. When you&#39;re ready, you can walk up to the counter and grab yourself a glass and a checkout card. Your checkout card measures which drink you try and how much you get of it. So, you can totally go at your own pace and drink what you feel like you can handle. 

Their beer options are fairly unique and quite crafty (in my opinion). But, what really draws me in is the kombucha, wine, and cider. Unfortunately, their kombucha tap was down when I went. So, I didn&#39;t get to sample this. But, I will be back for sure to taste it. 

Not only do they have drinks here, they have some pretty bomb food. My inner child loves french fries, and they do it so well here. Believe me when I say they do it well! These are not your standard fast-food french fry from McDonald&#39;s. They have substance and flavor to them. But, all of their dining options are perfect for your drinking munchies. 

Like I&#39;ve said, I love the concept of serving yourself quality beer (wine, cider, and kombucha). I would definitely recommend taking CO visitors here.

A very innovative idea. You see a server, they hook you up with a glass and a card. The wall is full of different beers that get dispensed out like fountain soda. You put the card up to the beer you want, it unlocks it, you pour out how much you want and it lets you know how much you poured. You pay per ounce and the price is right there. 

My favorite beer is Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA. Hands down. For this one, it was 50 cents an ounce, higher than some of the others, but still pretty reasonable for me. It IS my favorite beer after all. I saw some others something like 20 cents an ounce. It was definitely reasonable. 

First floor can be a little packed. Thankfully, the second floor provides relief. There were some games and stuff up there. I opted to look over the balcony and people watch.

You really can&#39;t beat the selection and price. I rather pay to drink good beer on draft than crappy beer just cause."

The taproom itself is open and airy.  During the warm days they roll up the garage doors and you can walk directly to the respectable size patio.  It&#39;s an awesome concept to pay by the ounce.  It&#39;s like choose your own adventure, adult style.  Just watch the price of some beers, they can creep to upwards of $1 per ounce."

Well, since I only get to tast beer these days, I was pretty pumped to see every style under the sun available for sampling, from serious sours and stouts to incredibly hoppy IPAs, and even a few dedicated to vino and kombucha! You could literally spend all night standing in front of this wall!

But the food. Oh yes. The food was the perfect foil to all the liquid goodness flowing through this place.

First the pretzels. The pretzels. The pretzels! I was going to be good and only &#34;taste&#34; a half of one and by the end of the meal I had devoured two of these! I&#39;m not sure if it was the salty, crusty exterior, the soft sweet doughy inside, saison cheese sauce or the fantastic whole grain mustard that made them go down so easily, but sweet baby jebus these things were fantastic! 

Then the burger. HUGE BURGER. A massive mound of colorado meat on a pillowy soft bun topped with fresh fixins, all added up to a magnificent mouthful! 

Side note: French fries were fabulous. Brussel sprouts perfectly prepared. Merguez sausage a bit of a let down (kinda bland). 

But the piece de resistance had to be dessert! Fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, warm from the oven, served alongside a tulip filled with chocolate stout infused milk. Ooey, gooey, soft and chewy, cookies, perfect for picking apart (not so much for dunking) closed out the meal in a most magical fashion.

Beer drinker or not, First Draft is fun for all. If you happen to come on trivia night, you&#39;re in for a hilarious addition to your evening. Make First Draft a first round pick for a night out in Denver!"

I think an alternative name for the bar would be &#34;Bartender for a Night!&#34; Who doesn&#39;t love pouring their own beer? And with so many to choose from it can take a while...

What I love is that you can try a bunch of different beers to see which you&#39;d like a full (or half) glass of. It&#39;s a shame they don&#39;t do a free 1/2oz/1oz taster like a lot of places will do, but the glamour of pouring your own beer ensured I didn&#39;t feel too sad about that!

We had a feast of epic proportions - I wish I&#39;d been able to finish the loaded table of treats. My spaetzle mac and cheese was great - and apparently only a half portion! Holy moly, I don&#39;t want to know what the full looks like!! I didn&#39;t really get where the spaetzle came in - it seemed like regular macaroni to me, but it was delicious. The pretzels were another highlight for sure - hot and steaming with great dips!

A super fun spot I&#39;d definitely return to."

My family really enjoyed this place! You leave a credit card on file and then they load a card for you. You scan the card at the tap you want and then dispense yourself. There is a limit- but once you hit the limit- you just find another employee to load more for you. They just want to make sure you&#39;re OK to continue.

They have tables inside, upstairs, outside tables, and outside stands. We went on a friday night around 8pm- we were able to snag a table. Soon after, it got suuuper crowded!

This place is located in an up and coming neighborhood. There are SUPER nice brand new apartments and restaurants- and at the same time there are really run down buildings with graffiti and homeless people hanging out on the sidewalks.

After the beer, we walked to the next street which had a nice selection of restaurants. I would definitely bring my friends here again! =)"

This is a must-try in Denver (shoutout to my yelp friend Eric J. for giving me the suggestion)!! First Draft is a unique concept, in which they give you a card that allows you to access the beers, wines, and ciders on tap (against the wall) with a simple wave of your hand. 

Everything is priced per ounce, which means you can try as much (or little) of a beverage you want, without being stuck with a full glass. Once you find a favorite, fill up that glass and enjoy. I personally tried a bit of everything. In the end, I found one sour beer that I drank half a glass of.

In addition, we came during happy hour, and had the fries. Pretty good snack for beer. They had other yummy looking options like wings, etc but we were saving our appetite for dinner later that night.

I love that there&#39;s tons of self-serve drinks on tap (beer, wine, cider, coffee, kombucha). They give you a plastic card to tap at each tablet and you are charged for every ounce that you pour into your glass. Most drinks were about 50 cents an ounce. It&#39;s really neat that you can try so many different types of beer. Be careful though since your bill can add up quickly this way.

The food was equally amazing too. I got the brisket grilled cheese ($14) which came with a small arugula salad. The sandwich was amazing! It&#39;s definitely heavy but extremely flavorful and the meat was very tender.

The pros: they have 40 different beers on tap, and they&#39;re all self-serve. Unique and interesting concept! Also, the cashier/hostess was extremely friendly, patient, and knowledgeable. She walked me through the entire process step by step.

Now, for the cons: there was limited food. Not much actually looked too appetizing to me, but I went with the roasted peppers they have, and wasn&#39;t too interested in finishing them. Just kind of bland and harsh on the stomach. It didn&#39;t really pair well with beer, in my opinion. And, of course, they don&#39;t serve cocktails (which is to be expected). They could also use more diversity in the beer choices they offer. There were entirely too many pale ales &amp; IPA&#39;s in comparison to any other kind. And, for the price, they should offer a lot more choices and a lot more food. A little pricey for what they did have. Overall, I&#39;d maybe give this place 3 1/2 stars out of 5."

We had a group of seven and found the entire vibe to be casual and inviting, not to mention affordable. We spent a few hours trying and rating all of the different varieties.

I love it because you can pour as much or as little as you&#39;d like.
I love it because you can try so many different kinds of beer.
I love it because each tap has a little info screen so you know more about what you might drink.
I love it because even though they are a beer place they have two wines, one cocktail, and a kombucha on draft too in case anyone in your crew isn&#39;t a beer person.
I love it because there are all different shapes and sizes of glassware.
I particularly love all the different sour beers I&#39;ve been able to try here.
And I love it because they have a pretty decent food selection to accompany the beer.

I have been several times now, both in really large groups and in small sets, and have always had a good time. I have eaten grilled shishitos, pretzels, Brussels sprouts, chickpea fritters, the burger, the brisket grilled cheese, the mac &amp; cheese, and the beet salad, which is basically the entire menu. My favorite has been, by far, the grilled cheese, but it was all enjoyable. And the milk and cookies with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies &amp; malted stout milk is a great way to end a meal, if you have room. I definitely love this spot!"

Although previously I had heard that one could get a band and have AYCD from these fantastic flowing taps, this is no longer the case. Instead, there is a card that you tap (see what I did there) on the respective beer you want, and that records how much to charge per how many ounces you pour.

I like the freedom of choosing how much I want to try for different beers, and the ability to just take from one if I really enjoy it. My favorite is the Pineapple Express, but there are all kinds of other drinks, including wines and mixed drink that you can pour.

The garlic fries were a great pairing to the beer, and the sliders are cute and delicious. Definitely take advantage of the happy hour food. Would come again to try even more beers - but a really cool experience!"

They have a unique food menu to complement the beer.

The system cuts you off after drinking a certain amount.  Love that concept because it leaves accountability so people aren&#39;t getting irresponsibly drunk.

Freshcraft is a pay-by-the-ounce tap house. They offer a vast selection of beers and even a few ciders. Agreeing with some of the other reviewers, the accuracy of the measurement system is lacking.

I LOVED the concept of the 40+ taps, self serve style. It gives the adventurous soul the opportunity to try tons of different brews without having to fully commit to a pint of just one. There&#39;s endless selection, everyone as good as the last.  They have a cool concept of giving you a card that you swipe at each tap, and every ounce poured is between 35-60 cents give or take, and you pay your tab at the end of the night at the front counter. The card is sort of a running tab that gives you access to the taps!

Although there may be standing room only, it has an awesome urban and modern feel, and the place is normally always booming. That&#39;s a good sign by the way! Great place to hang out and unwind from a long week with some friends

TIP: Keep track of the amount you get over the course of the evening. Not just so you don&#39;t leave wasted like a 16 year old at their junior prom, but the pours add up $$$!!!

Also, ATTENTION GARLIC LOVERS. They have some amazing garlic fries that pack a punch. Hot, crisp, garlicy, and simply amazing. This isn&#39;t just a great place for beer, but they have some great selections for bar food as well!

And what better place to talk about than First Draft. One of the coolest craft beer locations that have opened up in Denver recently. I don&#39;t even like beer all that much but I am a huge fan of this place!!

Self serve alcohol how amazing is that?! When you step in, you first present your ID and credit card and open up a tab. Then you receive a wristband that has a white circle on it. The wrist band is actually quite chic looking and it&#39;s comfortable to wear since its elastic. Nice design! They have so many varieties of beer to choose from. Some of the ones I tried are ginger beer which is delicious, chocolate stout basically like drinking dark chocolate. You scan your wrist band and then the panel will light up green and then you get however much you want. It then records how much you got and at the end you pay. I got two beers and the total was only 8 dollars what a deal!!! And because it&#39;s self serve, you don&#39;t technically have to tip. 

Plenty of seating both outside, inside, and upstairs. It&#39;s definitely an awesome hangout spot for people in their 20s/30s it seemed to be the crowd there. A very good time to be had by all! Definitely coming back!"

The CONCEPT: come in, register your ID and credit card, grab an ID bracelet, choose a beer or wine(yep, they had 3 to choose from), scan your bracelet and start pouring! Your bracelet keeps track of how much beer you pour and you pay the final amount at the end, it&#39;s as simple as that!  There are around 40 different beers on tap to choose from and each has an electronic screen that gives you a full description of that beer/wine so you can know what to expect before you pour : ) So No waiting in line for a bartender or bugging them to ask &#34;what kind of beer is that.&#34;  Yah.....they may charge anywhere from $0.40 - $2.00 per ounce poured, which can sound a little pricey, but when you think about it, this gives you a chance to sample as many different beers as you like and pour as little OR as much as your little heart desires. 

Along with the great beer selection, First Draft offers a a very open concept with plenty of seating as well as a wonderful patio out front.....and we all know how I LOVE a good patio ; ) 

We only tried their plate of pretzels because I was craving some horseradish mustard dipping sauce : p  Three come to an order and those were the 3 most buttery and moist pretzels EVER!! If we wouldn&#39;t have been stuffed from just coming from brunch, I would have tried more off their menu.

I love half pours or even smaller, especially because my beer often gets warm if I have a full pint, and to be able to taste to my heart&#39;s content here made me a happy girl. They no longer use bracelets, now you get a plastic credit card type thingy to hold in front of the 40 (!) taps to be able to pour your beer (we had no issues, worked great). In addition to beer, they had a couple varieties of cider, tap wine and even a kombucha. On a Thursday night, it was busy but not overly crowded. A friend tried their brisket grilled cheese which was served with a massive platter of perfect looking french fries, which I was too full to even sneak a bite of, so I&#39;ll definitely be back to try their small menu of small snacks, charcuterie and cheese boards, large plates, salads, sandwiches and desserts. 

I was in a dark beer mood as usual and loved my salted caramel stout (collab with Salt &amp; Straw ice cream in Portland, yum) and a robust porter from a brewery in SF. Speaking of ice cream, you can add scoops of Little Man ice cream to your beer for just $2 to make a float, something I love to do at home. There was a creme brulee stout I tried that would have made a super tasty beer float. More casual inside than I expected but really nice industrial interior. I saw prices from .50-.70 per ounce.

They even go out of their way to cater to the Belgian lovers and provide enough options to overwhelm. I can tap a card for food too?!?! Come on... I know I must sound like an old lady and maybe I kind of am but come on- the burger was cooked perfectly with a gentle char and summoning season.... I don&#39;t really understand it. The seasoned fries too-  order them right now. The artwork and atmosphere of this place is inviting, relaxed, and overall so happy. It was so very difficult to leave... and I honestly can&#39;t wait to return when it&#39;s snowing and see them close up the wind-able windows- they really excited me.

and also, how did I only spend $6 bucks on 12 beers?!!! 

Such a magical place"

We came here to come for some dinner before we had to catch our flight back home. This place was recommended by some locals. We were so excited that there was such a huge selection of beers on draft that you can fill your own glass by the ounce which was really neat. The food was delicious and we had a good time here! Would definitely visit again!

My husband planned my surprise 30th birthday here 3 months in advance. 4 days before the party they called and said they had double booked. So my husband was left scrambling to find a place for 40+ people on very short notice. Instead of taking responsibility like they should have, they turned around and blamed it on my husband--the manager tried to say my husband didn&#39;t communicate well enough even though he had been there to meet in person with them and had several emails with plenty of communication. 

We were reluctant to give this place a try but went ahead and went with some friends last night. Same issues. The staff and managers were extremely rude to multiple people in our party. And my husband had 3 beers, myself 2 TINY glasses of wine, and somehow got charged $45!?! Would NEVER go back."

The set up is simple, as others have mentions- walk in, get your card, and start the pours! This place gets packed sometimes so keep that in mind if you&#39;re venturing out on a weekend.

The food: we sampled the Brussel sprouts, wings, and the pretzels. The sprouts? SO GOOD!! I don&#39;t really remember the wings (which says something).

All in al, the place can get a little pricey if you aren&#39;t watching the pours (or your hubs like to go all in &amp; only do full pours....)"

I found two beers, the Plum Sour Stout and the Funky Gold Simcoe, two sours that they had in their selection.  After tasting them briefly with a small pour, I filled up my glasses halfway with each one and I got to decide how much to fill my glass.  Kind of a cool feeling because I like trying different beers but don&#39;t want to pay for an entire glass.  

They also have a full kitchen and menu here but since I had just already ate, I wasn&#39;t able to try the food.  The menu does look very appealing and has the typical gastropub selections of appetizers, mains, sandwiches, and sides.

For newbies, make sure to check in with the hostess/cashier person to get yourself set up and instructed on how to use their pay by the ounce system."

I came here expecting just a normal bar/beer garden, but got so much more. To witness this technology in action is just fantastic. Basically, you go to the cashier and charge your credit card, attaching your bar tab to an RFID card or bracelet. Once you have this card/bracelet, you can go to any of the 40+ taps in the opposite side and pour your own beer, which is priced by the ounce. Each tap is equipped equipped with an LED screen telling you the name of the beer, type of beer, alcoholic content, and price per oz. You wave your RFID gadget in front of the reader, and then pour to your heart&#39;s content. After you finish pouring, the screen will read how many ounces you&#39;ve poured, so you can figure out how much you&#39;ve drank. Dangerous if you like to keep score with your buddies, ha. They also have ciders and even wine on tap, so if you don&#39;t drink beer, there are definitely options for you.

The space itself is pretty big, although I would personally avoid bringing massive groups here, as there are only a few communal tables, whereas the upstairs seems more suitable for small groups or couples. The front door opens like a garage during the summer, so there&#39;s even more space outside during the warm weather months. Obviously, we came during the winter, so everything was closed, but again, there actually was a considerable amount of space for our larger 10+ person party.

We ordered a few of the small plates including Brussels sprouts, Chili wings, burgers, brisket grilled cheese, shishito peppers, and fries. My favorites were the Brussels sprouts, as they had a distinct garlic butter flavor, and the brisket grilled cheese was also outrageously good with its buttered sourdough too. Ridiculous. My only qualm with the place was how salty some of the food was. As I mentioned before, the quality of the food was good, just definitely over-seasoned. In my opinion, I can actually take on more salt than most people, but the cajun fries, shishito peppers, and burger were just way over-salted. I can understand why, given that they want you to drink more beer, but it was just too much. Pretty much the only reason I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating instead of 5. Really, I guess it should be 4.5 stars.

Food service was really quick. They use the numbering system where you place your food order (also using your RFID card/bracelet) and then you get a number to post at your table. Pricing is pretty fair, with most beers at $0.50 an ounce, and most dishes at around $8-10. Once we were done with our tabs, we submitted our RFID cards/bracelets back to the cashier, and then all we had to do was sign the receipt and we were done. Really quick, and beats having to wait for a bartender to do all that stuff for you, while also needing to tend the bar.

Despite the salty food, I would easily recommend First Draft, and I will definitely be back the next time I&#39;m in Denver.  Will need to try the new rotating beers, as well as the outdoor space when it&#39;s warmer weather."

Plenty of craft beers to choose from and wines and ciders! Each beer has a price per oz (.60,.55,.49,etc) and the taps go by ounces poured when you activate it. So your tab just accrues on to your bracelet. When you&#39;re ready to checkout you just scan it at the register and pay up. 

The food was enjoyable as well, we ordered the pretzel, deviled eggs, and poblano peppers. The pretzel comes with a horseradish sauce as well as a cheddar cheese dipping sauce, both were pleasing. I would definitely recommend all three. 
They had a full menu of burgers and sandwiches that looked great but we didn&#39;t try them on this day. We&#39;ll definitely have to make arrangements for lunch in the future. 

Open seating upstairs as well as downstairs and outside. Staff was friendly and helpful when deciding which beer was a good starter."

It&#39;s a much-needed tap house in the heart of RiNo. The patio is spacious and the indoor area is community seating with picnic tables.

Excellent selection of craft beers plus a few ciders and wine on the mix. You can pour as much or as little as you want. Thanks to the helpful staff I tried several that I loved that I would not have been drawn to otherwise. The Vanilla Java Porter was my favorite this visit. They do change them up often so we plan to come back for more.

We also decided to each lunch here... Yummo. I have the grilled cheese and brisket sandwich,side of local greens and the grilled peppers (shishitos) as an app. For the two of us our tab came to around $75 for lunch which I thought was very reasonably considering how much we &#34;sampled&#34;.

Unfortunately, I must not be skilled enough to do self serve tap beer. When I pulled the tap, the tap came gushing out and filled my glass wish foam.

When the foam did settle, I was left with about 2oz of beer. When I talked to the staff he again, he just said &#34;sorry&#34;. So, I only had my 2oz of beer although I was charged the full $10 for 6oz.

I like that the staff come over to help if you&#39;re a newbie but maybe I should have asked before I tried of pour a Nitro that was all head! Trust me, you have to commit to the tap!

It&#39;s a good system to pour your own beers, they check your ID &amp; a copy of your credit card when you enter, then it&#39;s just swipe and pull. There&#39;s information above each of the taps telling you what they&#39;re like and you can pour as much or as little as you like (within reason). We were mixing #25 with the cider and it was delicious!!

It works out to be a little expensive at $0.50 or $0.60 an ounce but it&#39;s fun and totally worth it.

Normally when I go out for drinks with my fiance and her friends, breweries are NOT an option. This place solves that problem! They had beer, coffee, &amp; wine to choose from.  I was happy, and so were the women!  Everyone wins.

This place loses a star due to beer selection. As I visited in October, they had pumpkin beer.  A LOT of pumpkin beer.  Too much pumpkin beer.  I don&#39;t like pumpkin beer :(   Fortunately though, they rotate the taps, so I&#39;m eager to go back &amp; see what new they have now!

We ordered some food, &amp; it was overall pretty good.  Outdoor seating is recommended, as the inside of First Draft smelled weird."

Oh you don&#39;t trust me? Well you must not if you&#39;re still reading. Fiiiine....I&#39;ll tell you more :P

Okay so this place is a new concept for me. It&#39;s like one of those froyo places with the flavors in the wall that you fill your cup with. EXCEPT - It&#39;s refillable, you can try them all, there&#39;s like 30 different kinds, oh and the best part it&#39;s not froyo IT&#39;S BEER! Not a beer fan? Gosh, why are you reading this? Why don&#39;t like you like beer?! I don&#39;t like to jump to assumptions, maybe you are planning on taking a new friend or group here and you don&#39;t know their preferences  - No worries, I saw wine and kombucha on tap too.

Located in a great area and a pretty cool atmosphere. When you walk in the amazing people at the counter give you a magic wizard bracelet that unleashes the almighty flood of beer. You grab a seat and grab your glass off the wall. I loved that they had the different styles of glasses depending on which beer you are drinking. Or you can do what I did and grab the coolest looking glass and watch the other more experienced beer wizards cringe as you fill your goblet up with a pilsner and obliviously cheers it with your other magical friends.

But not just any mortal can walk up and get beer! I will let you in on the real secrets. After getting your introductory wizard bracelet, make sure to use your hand as a wand and wave it around on the sign above the tap you want. Preferably between the S and T. Feel free to come up with your own spell name and confidently shout it in your best wizard voice. If you have successfully completed the spell you will be rewarded with beer! I was unaware of this on my first drink so I dumbly tried like 3 taps thinking they were out of all the beer before someone told me to use the bracelet - haha, rookie move! 

I spoke to one of the workers and they mentioned they frequently rotate taps so every visit will be a new page of adventure on your quest!

Last tip for you, you only get 30 ounces so make sure you don&#39;t use up 10 ounces on your first pour.....unlike someone I know....which totally isn&#39;t me.....

My only negative feedback is that seating is pretty limited and can be difficult to find on a busy night. The crowd does rotate regularly so you only have to wait probably 10 minutes before finding something that opens up.

Although I did not eat any of the food - It all looked amazing. I was mesmerized and seriously debated stealing a bite of a sandwich from our table. But then came to my senses and realized it was a lady with a different group of people we were sharing the table with and she might not appreciate it as much as I would! Next time we come back I will be bringing my appetite!"

All four people in my party felt the beer was watered down. We each maxed our cards out for pours and didn&#39;t get a good buzz with a tab of $40!!! Tap beers from brewery&#39;s that just had no flavor. They didn&#39;t have one Oktoberfest or Pumpkin beer either. For it being 10/14 I feel they should have one. Several kegs tapped out while we were there. Interesting concept but the beer was definitely watered down.

Customer service here will never fail due to you getting your own booze but in my book that&#39;s smart. Gone are the days of waiting around for someone to take your drink order, go get the drink and bring it back 15 minutes later. You drink what you want at your own pace. 

The price is somewhat steep at .38-.60 an ounce (may not seem like much but multiple that by 16 and its pricy). 

With all this being said 5 stars and I have already made plans to come back."

The concept is simple. Drinks are self served. You get a bracelet which lets you turn on whichever tap you want and it measures how much oz you got and your total as well. I fell in love with the pear cider while i was there.

TIP: place your bracelet censor between the the letters &#39;ST&#39; of the FIRST Draft sign of each tap and wait for the green light on top. 

As for the food. We came during HH and ordered the shishito pepper&#39;s, pretzels, and deviled eggs. They did not skimp on flavor and everything was delicious. Loved the shishito peppers and the added bacon on top of the eggs was also a nice touch.

Everyone was friendly and glad to help customers on how to work the bracelets. Great space, outdoors and indoors (that have a second floor as well woot!)

You check in and get a card that will track the ounces you pour yourself of around 30 different draft beer/cider/wine options. Very interactive, which is always something I like. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful and the layout was wide open and had a social vibe to it. Long picnic style tables filled the building, which felt like it was built to be a garage. This place would be great for groups. There was an upstairs area that I&#39;m sure would give a great view when the business picks up, but let&#39;s face it, why would you want to put yourself so far away from the taps?

We didn&#39;t order food, but everything coming out of the kitchen (openly visible from the tasting/dining room) smelled and looked AWESOME.  We noticed that they had a happy hour and a brunch menu as well, certainly worth a visit.  I hope to eat next time. 

Ultimately, this is a great spot to taste and try several different beers that you otherwise might not take a leap of faith on. Costs seemed to round out to roughly $5-6 per full beer, which is about what you can expect for craft brews. 5-stars because I really can&#39;t come up with a single complaint."

I assume they would have basic micro-brews available anywhere with the selling point you were able to pour your own beer in any volume you chose allowing for multiple tastings.  

I was thoroughly impressed with the wide range of micro-brews from all over the US.  I have even been able to have a few beers from New Holland out of my home state of MI and from Sun King in Indianapolis.  My most recent visit was during the pumpkin beer tap takeover.  This was what really impressed me with the wide variety and the many different types of pumpkin beers they had!

After my first visit, I was unaware First Draft had prepared hot food on the menu.  Naturally, when I returned my friends and I had to sample some of the small plate offerings.  I had a few of the sliders and they were amazing!  I will most certainly return to First Draft for more food and drink at a later date!"

The beer is set up like how froyo is set up, all lined up across the wall.. and you can click your bracelet on the sign so you can try the beer and pour as much as you&#39;d like. I tried 5 different kinds of beer and a whole pint for maybe $7!!!! 

I mean, it&#39;s kind of very easy to go crazy here and start just pouring one after another.. so be careful. I only resisted b/c I was DD at the end of the night. But I can imagine not having to drive... I would want a pint of all the delicious beer!!! Their sour beer was really good. Hopefully they have that again when I go back. 

I heard the food here is really good as well.. and you can pair your food with beer by trying all the different ones. :)

For starters, the food was great. I recommend the pretzels and deviled eggs for your appetizer. They have other items that sound great, but I went with the aforementioned combo and was incredibly satisfied. I got the brisket grilled cheese sandwich for dinner. It was delicious. It came with an arugula salad + citrus vinaigrette that was surprisingly delightful. My girlfriend got the pork shoulder sandwich and garlic fries which were a-1. 

The best part about this place, however, is their modern approach to a bar. Basically: they have a wall of different beers and you pour your own / serve yourself. You get a wristband with some kind of magnet detector device (?), you place the magnet up to the beer selection you want, and voila. You get charged by the ounce so it works out pretty nice, and you can try a variety of beers without running up a large tab. They have a ton of good beers to choose from as well. 

You really can&#39;t go wrong with this place. It essentially uses the idea of modern self-serve froyo places and applies it to beer. Pretty fly. Highly recommend it. Rdouble."

On top of that, if you&#39;re hungry you can just go order some yummy pub food. You have everything you need for the makings of a great night. But, based on my experience here I don&#39;t think it&#39;s executed as well as it could be. Perhaps my experience wasn&#39;t as great because it was a busy Saturday night? But it should be great not matter what night you go, right? 

You need to check in with the front counter and provide them ID and a card for your tab and then get a bracelet. You use the bracelet to release the taps of whatever you want to pour, so you pay for what you drink. Some girl behind me had to show me that it must be placed between the &#34;S&#34; and the &#34;T&#34; on the sign. WTH? How about a little light or something on there to make that a little more noticeable. 

I won&#39;t get into all the types of beers they have, because there are so many. None are their own, but from many local breweries. It gets very crowded by the beer taps, and can be hard to try to browse what you want. It would have been nice if it was spaced out a little more to allow us some breathing room...again it was Saturday night, so it was pretty poppin&#39;. 

When i saw buttermilk fried chicken, it seemed to be calling my name so I decided that was it! Well, the chicken and fried green tomato were delicious, as was the shishito pepper chutney. The biscuit it was served on though, was disappointing. To be frank, it was too crispy and more like toast than a biscuit. Yeah..don&#39;t make biscuits anymore, guys. Every entree comes with a side of greens unless you ask for fries. I just got the greens, which was basically an arugula salad. Boy, that was awful. It was DOUSED in salt and maybe a bit of oil. Tasted like they poured an entire salt shaker worth onto my salad; yuck. Inedible. 

My love ordered the burger and fries, and mistakenly chose the &#34;old bay&#34;seasoning for them. Again, salt galore. They were WAY over seasoned. It was nearly inedible. Another from our party made the same mistake and she didn&#39;t touch hers. The burger though, was the saving grace. The meat was fresh and delicious, seemed like they grind it in house. 

I&#39;m curious what it&#39;s like on a less busy night. I probably won&#39;t be ordering food from here again, would just go for drinks if at all."

They have tons of taps that they regularly change for seasonal reasons. It&#39;s great to be able to try as many beers as you want and pour your own. 

The food is also delicious, try the shishito peppers or their maple fries (seriously delicious). You can get a snack while you drink or order a full meal. They have a fairly large outdoor area with tons of open seating. A definite must try to any beer, cider, or wine drinker (yes, they have wine and cider on tap)."

They have a great drink selection which you can have small tastes of using their cool card tap technology. When you first walk in you head to the side counter, show your ID, and grab a glass from the shelf. Then, you use your card to allow the taps to pour!

I am allergic to beer, but they have a couple wines and ciders on the far right end. I don&#39;t like the Moscow Mule concoction they have, but the Ocktopus cider and the Ros√© are great! 

I also recommend their fried chicken sandwich and garlic fries. The brussel sprouts are okay, definitely not my favorite but still pretty good."

It&#39;s like an arcade for adults and it&#39;s a bonanza of beer choices and wines! In addition to that the staff are friendly especially being my first time and first stop in Colorado! 

The food looks very delicious but I settled with the pretzels only which I can say it&#39;s on point! Very comparable to TAPS brewing in socal and it&#39;s a must!

The beer choices are meh to my liking, but hey you can&#39;t please everyone but you can entertain everyone! I just hope there were more Ales and Lagers when I visited. (Only missing star)

In short, get a card, drink a lot, and eat pretzels so you can drink some more! It&#39;s affordable as long as you drink what your pour and if you&#39;re tasting be gentle on the tap or it&#39;ll cost you! They measure it by oz&#39;s you pour in case you don&#39;t know. 

My bill was a little pricey because i got carried away on a stout that was stupid pricey and I think there was also a first time card fee, just be aware because I was too buzzed at the end to care haha.

Oh and ask the staff for suggestions, they seem very optimistic with their stuff and I didn&#39;t go wrong asking them. 

Cheers! *clink*"

But it&#39;s a trick to get your fancy bracelet to match up correctly to unlock the tap.
I&#39;m not positive about it not counting foam in the pour. Pretty sure, i&#39;ve paid for some foam. Obviously i need to learn to pour beer better!

The food is just ok to me. It&#39;s froo froo food. Nothing super amazing, or just pub like to eat with your beer. Hubby thinks it&#39;s fab and it&#39;s close to home, so we&#39;ll be back but it wont be a destination that i choose!

The idea of having a ton of beers to choose from is good, but they no longer provide a list, so to pick one you have to stand there looking waaay above the tap to read about it on the electronic board."

I love the concept First Draft has set up. You walk into a tasting room of sorts, you get a wrist band that keeps track of how many ounces you are drinking (I know, so futuristic!), and you can taste or guzzle a little or a lot, from as many as twenty different beers.

The building is simple, with pour spouts and picnic tables. Friends and I had a wonderful time sampling different beers and hanging out. While the beer selection was good, none of them blew me away, so I do hope that they keep a good rotation going."

That said, First Draft misses the mark.

The technology is iffy, with bracelets that have to perfectly line up in order to work, and beer that is often foamy.  I don&#39;t like paying for foam, come on.

Overpriced for what you get.  You could go anywhere else and pay 30-50% less on a good chunk of their selection.  You&#39;re basically just paying for the privilege of pouring your own beer.

And the staff sucks.  Just plain sucks.  When we walked in, it was loud and crowded, a typical weekend night downtown.  The sole cashier/hostess looked seriously peeved just being there, and talked in a low voice, low enough were we had to keep leaning in to hear what she was saying.  I couldn&#39;t catch anything (luckily my sister could), except &#34;I know it&#39;s loud but I don&#39;t feel like speaking up&#34;.  Oh dangggggggggg, do your job?  Do...your...job?  Bummer.

The dude by the beer taps looked grumpy, unsmiling, and perturbed.  I think he was annoyed by how hard it is to use the bracelets, and how many dozens of hundreds of times each shift he must have to demonstrate how to use them.  I&#39;d be annoyed too bro.

In the end, I really liked the idea.  I think it could work.  But get staff that doesn&#39;t suck, don&#39;t overcharge me for foamy beer, and stop reserving large blocks of seating for people that aren&#39;t even there on a Saturday night at 10pm."

I think this place is really cool and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. When you go in you give your ID and credit card to the ladies at the front and they give you a little bracelet thing which you use to activate the taps and keep track of what you drink. I felt like the selection was thoughtful and relatively diverse. (Just FYI the wines they had on tap while I was there were TERRIBLE.) 

The food is absolutely DELICIOUS! It far surpassed my expectations for what appeared to be a tap house that happens to have food. I would say it was much more equal parts tap house and restaurant. My group ordered a wide variety of items and each and every one was truly fabulous. 

Overall, it was a lot of fun and we would certainly go back."

They had a good selection of beers from sours to stouts and you can read all the details about each beer on the screens.  The seating is family style picnic benches with some inside and outside.  We also ate there, the burger was great, I also tried the Korean Pork sandwich which wasn&#39;t all that great, the meat was greasy and it wasn&#39;t that spicey.

Though I couldn&#39;t indulge in one of the main attractions - the 40+ taps of self-serve beer and cider - I did really enjoy their food. The delicious maple fries, shishito peppers, and brisket sliders for a shared plate menu are a testament to this place&#39;s success and could stand alone as a full-service restaurant, but fortunately compliment the awesome tap list that truly sets First Draft apart from the surrounding hip RiNo spots.

Likewise to the tap list, the food menu is always changing - making this spot a constant fun surprise with each visit. The space is perfect for a get-together any kind with an expansive patio in the heart of the vibrant RiNo district. Plus, paying for each ounce you drink is such a refreshing way to imbibe. Certainly a sophisticated way to truly evaluate each beverage instead of filling forced to chug a crummy beer you don&#39;t like, because you paid the full price of a pint. Such a clever concept that is only found at First Draft."

That being said, if you want to pay $6 for a foamy Dixie cup of beer, then this place should be right up your ally!  When the cheapest beer ends up being $8/pint plus tax, you&#39;re being had.  

Lastly, if you are even slightly near-sighted, make sure to bring your glasses (unless you want to look like a mouth breathing fool as I myself looked) because the beer screens are very small and are placed at a very strange height (unless you&#39;re Dikembe Mutombo, in which case they are at a perfect height)."

The biggest disappointment that I suffered was the $26 (excluding tip) that I paid for two (2) beers.  When I questioned the cashier, I was told that they &#34;must&#39;ve been really big pours&#34;.  Considering the sarcastic response, I responded in kind questioning how a glass can fit more fluid than what they were intended for.

The beers were okay - nothing to write home about (more about those on Untappd).

There&#39;s a couple of bars that have tap tables but First Draft has the whole lineup as a self serve.  You open a tab, get a wrist band, and pour whatever you like from a massive selection of beers from across the country.  You are charged by the ounce, and each tap has a screen the describes the beer and the cost.  After 34-36 oz you are cut off, presumably so you can check in with the staff to make sure you aren&#39;t over the top.  This is a great idea too.

Although we didn&#39;t indulge, they also boast a kitchen that boasts some food that would appeal to the foodie crowd like myself.  I never got the name of the gal who was working Sunday but she was very friendly.

This is a refreshing change of pace, I&#39;m happy to come back here.

I like that you can control your portions, even if the wall of taps is essentially a beer buffet. [Those who know me know that I normally hate buffets of any type.] The food is elevated pub grub, which I like. Atmosphere is casual &amp; friendly.

The bracelets can seem tricky at first, but staff are willing to help you get the hang of it. There is kombucha and water if you&#39;re the DD. Staff can answer questions about teh beers and guide you to one that you&#39;ll enjoy.

But let&#39;s get back to the food. Oh. Em. Gee. The spaetzle mac and cheese made my husband so happy that I got one bite before it was all gone. When we was done, he wished he could order two. The brisket grilled cheese rivals the brisket at Masterpiece. Yeah, I said it. First Draft brisket grilled cheese is pretty darn good. It came with an arugula salad that was great--especially when added to my sandwich.

I&#39;ve visited for small plates, and those are good too. Deviled eggs, pickles, and more. Hearty snacks if you&#39;re sampling a lot of beer. The pretzels are VERY hearty--almost like brioche pretzels, if you can imagine. They&#39;re a little sweet, but they still have a chewy pretzel texture.

I also recommend dessert. Milk and cookies is sooo good. The cookies are warm and gooey and chewy and hearty. The malted stout milk is super-thick and delicious. A very adult milk and cookies but not terribly boozy.

This place is exceeded my expectations on all levels."

People who have issues with this place seem to have problems with the transparency and cost of the beer. I think the cost of the beer is pretty reasonable: you pay a small premium for being able to pour as much/little as you like, and if you think you may hate a beer don&#39;t pour yourself 16 ounces of it. It says right what you should be charged per ounce on the tap and how much of it you&#39;ve poured. Anyone who paid $26 for two beers was either pouring very small-batch or premium beers, or not paying close enough attention. Still, they could improve on the transparency front. It would have been good to have my costs itemized or offered to me, since they just threw a number at me that seemed kinda reasonable but that left me with a lingering &#39;Hmmm...&#39; that shouldn&#39;t have been necessary. 
For the record, I did not tip: perhaps because I felt I paid slightly more than I should have due to lack of detail. Also, because I poured my own beer. This probably raises the question of &#39;what should I tip folks in a place like this&#39;: surely not zero, but also surely not nearly the normal tipping threshold since I ordered no food and poured my own beer."

I am learning, and prefer tasting to wasting, meaning not having to force my way through a glass of beer that I &#34;thought&#34; looked good on the menu.  

Similar to wine tasting venues this places offers a wristband that tallies your drinks at the end as you roam and sample from multiple taps.  

The atmosphere is very open and just like a warehouse brewery.

I love the concept here - serve yourself and only pay for what you pour - and the food is good. Most of the beers I tried weren&#39;t to my liking, so I never opted for a full glass, but it is still fun to taste. They also have a couple of wines on tap and even kombucha. I mostly drank wine when I was there.

The cheese board is nice. I thought the deviled eggs had too much vinegar &amp; salt. Three of us didn&#39;t finish 6 deviled eggs. The pork sandwich was really tasty - I would order this again.

But the reason for five stars? The food. So delicious. We got the brisket grilled cheese and I almost just ordered another one to go... It was that good. With a side of fries... We were licking our fingers. 

I will also note that we went with a big group that included a friend and her ten month old - it was an easy place to have a baby and super friendly. It does get packed later and there was a line to close out, but it&#39;s still well worth a visit!"

Pizzas here only take about 8-10 minutes so this is still a destination even if you&#39;re in a rush. I was in and out within 30 minutes and I was taking my time. The pizza crust is very crispy and chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. I bet they use 00 flour. The sausage and marinara were all tasty. My favorite part was the pancetta though.

Little did I know that the Cherry Creek location had moved here. I came with a large party of co-workers for lunch. The staff were very friendly, and the food came out quickly.

I was excited to see the pick 2 lunch deal. I had half of an insalata della casa and half a tacchino sandwich (turkey pesto panini). The salad had a perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors. The panini was crisp and had just the right amount of filling. I very much appreciated that it wasn&#39;t super soggy. I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for more food in the future.

I love their spaghetti and meatball and the bread it is served with is rustic and flavorful.  The sauce is excellent and the headband are tender and flavorful.

Their pizzas are founded on a thin crust with high qualify meats and cheeses on top.  

The mini cannolis are the best I&#39;ve ever had.  They are filled to order.  

Everything here tastes home made with fresh ingredients.  I love this place."

Neither meal was particularly outstanding.  

Pizza Margherita looks really great when it is cooked with fresh mozzarella, the mixture of sauce and mozzarella can complement each other well and looks cool on the pie.  If done right it doesn&#39;t need any other flavorings.  Thing is, a basic, savory red sauce isn&#39;t difficult to make.  Mici&#39;s red sauce did not have a nice tomato/savory flavor and the result was that the pizza wasn&#39;t a particularly noteworthy version of a Margherita.  I saved a little for lunch leftovers the next day.  It did not improve overnight.  

They gave me dried Parmesan and crushed red pepper with the pizza???  C&#39;mon, they don&#39;t do that in Naples.  That&#39;s a Domino&#39;s move.  Try harder.

I also had pasta Alfredo which was really kind of bland.  White/cream sauces can wash out other flavor, that&#39;s the risk of using a cream/butter and cheese as a sauce base.  However, Mici&#39;s Alfredo didn&#39;t even have much flavor in that context.  It was almost like I was eating a roux over pasta. I saved a little for left-overs; it had even less flavor the next day.

The interior of the restaurant is crisp and clean but seemed like an echo chamber.  There were a couple groups with kids in there when I stopped by.  It sounded like I was sitting inside a tin can after a while.

To that point, it does advertise as a kid-friendly place, and that&#39;s cool.

I&#39;m actually a little bummed out about writing a negative review.  I was hoping something good would stick at this particular location along Colorado Blvd.  It&#39;s been a revolving door of establishments.  There&#39;s really no such thing as a convenient location along Colorado Blvd any more unless you like sitting in traffic.  And yes, in 2016, one does need to consider the ease of access of a place in Denver.  This isn&#39;t a great location unless you are walking or taking the bus.  

And while I have no ill regard toward Mici&#39;s or its employees (they were nice and polite,) I won&#39;t be going back, nor will I be recommending Mici&#39;s to anyone else."

It was not that I didn&#39;t have good expectations but it really was just so good that I told my friends it should become our regular spot for Sunday dinners!

For food - the lasagna!!! I seriously think it is some of the best lasagna I have had - and considering the number of places I have been here, that says a LOT. It was just amazing! I paired it with the small side Caesar and believe me, there was nothing small about that salad! My friends had the Piatti Antipasti (which was huge and also really good) and the Tortellini Alla Miceli which was incredibly rich but also sooo good! Oh! And we decided to start with the Bruschetta Bianca which was just ridiculously good! An interesting combo with the honey and gorgonzola - but it works so definitely recommend! And to round out our already incredibly filling meal, we of course had to get Gelato because why wouldn&#39;t you?!?! I am sure the flavors rotate but if they have the Salted Caramel Oreo and Birthday Cake flavors - GET THEM! 

Overall - just a great experience! The service was awesome - they checked on us regularly and were incredibly friendly. I look forward to going back here soon and have raved about it since!"

Breakfast pizza!

So I&#39;ve never been to Mici&#39;s before my visit this past weekend but somehow heard about them and signed up for their email list and have been getting offers for them. I got a BOGO breakfast entr√©e coupon and decided that we should be put that bad boy to use and pop my Mici&#39;s cherry. We went in around noon on Saturday and there was one other table seated and by the time we left, there were about four more dining as well so I like to think we started the lunch rush. The employees were outstanding---so friendly, inviting, smiling and asking us if we had ever been in there. You walk up, order then they bring the food out to you so it&#39;s a fast casual concept but they didn&#39;t miss a beat on the service. While we were waiting for our pizzas they gave us samples of their gelato (not made in house, but made in Boulder so close enough), the Andes Mint and Blood Orange Creamsicle had my heart but I stopped myself before filling out for the main course. I ordered the Ortolana  breakfast pizza which is a semi vegetarian option) with the egg cooked in, topped with red peppers, zucchini and cheese and it was fantastic. Tip-get a side of marinara sauce to dip it in and it will take you to a whole new level! I grabbed a slice to go, had it the next morning and topped with a fried egg and I was in heaven. Join their email club and you will get sent special offers like I did plus a free pizza on your birthday! Other places really need to take tips in service and hospitality from Mici&#39;s!"

Their bread is similar to a sour dough, a little firm.

The pasta dishes (From what I&#39;ve had) are fine...pesto cream bow tie, alfredo, red sauce.  The house has grapes and cheese, I think gorgonzola.  But the one I had needed more fixins.

I appreciate the price point of the house wine but am especially grateful for the Monday nights  when free entrees are available to the kids.

All in all a good week night option."

The calzones were enormous! They didn&#39;t skimp on cheese, meats, or veggies. Cheese was clearly very fresh and gooey. The dipping marinara was cold but I can let that slide. The pasta was a liiiiiittle disappointing. It was a bit dry but I think that&#39;s just what happens with pasta that you take to-go. The one truly unforgivable issue was that they had run out of lasagna. On a Monday. At 7pm. That is a big no-no for any Italian joint.

I was forced to clean the table myself (with many tables non-bussed). The help brings the spaghetti 45 seconds after delivering the salad. The salad is unremarkable, consisting of lettuce with lettuce and what appears as store bought dressing. Bread is ordinary. I know we are short on ecviting Italian venues (aside from Piatti and Barolo grill), but after spending over $16, I&#39;m frustrated at myself for committing this.

My problem with most delivery pizza (and most pizza in general) is that it has too much cheese (I&#39;m probably the only person on the planet who would complain about too much cheese on a pizza...).  I guess I&#39;m not a fan of the traditional &#39;American-style&#39; pizza, but prefer something with lighter ingredients and a good crust.  After reading reviews for Mici&#39;s (and noticing that they&#39;re close to my house), I decided to check them out.  After going to their web site, I noticed they have a loyalty program and signed up for that.  I think you get more from that program if you actually go into the restaurant, but they give you a code you can use indefinitely to get 10% off your online orders.  And speaking of online orders, I LOVE ordering online.  I like being able to order and customize my food without someone mis-hearing what I said, and I really like being able to pay with my card online.  I have found their online ordering system to be easy to use, and both times I&#39;ve ordered the food has arrived sooner than the system quoted (I think both times it quoted 45 minutes, but the food arrived in about 30).  So far so good.

As to the food, both me and The Hubs liked it.  While it&#39;s not THE BEST pizza I&#39;ve ever had in my life, it&#39;s pretty darn good (unless you like pizza with five pounds of cheese on it, and if you do I think their online system lets you add extra anyway).  The crust was crispy and tasty, and the toppings were fresh.  I like that they have more vegetables  and more &#39;gourmet&#39; toppings than the average place.  We&#39;ve also ordered salads both times and have found the ingredients in them to be fresh, as well.  My only critique/complaint about the ingredients was when I added something extra to a salad.  I was charged 50 cents or a dollar (I forget which) to add onion to one of the salads.  I don&#39;t mind the extra charge, but I did mind the fact that there were only four or five very thin slivers of onion added to a large salad.  Really?!  I took a star away for that.

All things considered, the food is good and the service is good.  And my tired self didn&#39;t have to leave the house.  Life is good (despite the lack of onion)..."

Sarah, the manager, was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. The entire staff goes above and beyond... I&#39;m so thankful that Mici opened up shop in this neighborhood. I have been in the food and beverage industry for over 10 years and it takes a lot to really WOW but this place does it!

On our first visit, my partner got a three protein hibachi dinner (I think it was chicken, shrimp, and NY strip) and I ordered sushi since I wasn&#39;t all that hungry.  We were amused to discover that the same chef who worked at the former iteration of the restaurant had been rehired. The food was good and I was very happy with the sushi, which was a bit of surprise given that most places that don&#39;t specialize in sushi don&#39;t always do it well.  We also thought the hibachi soup and salad was a big improvement over the former establishment&#39;s offerings. 

Unfortunately, our server (who I think was also a manager or owner) nickel-and-dimed us on the Groupon, refusing to take it on what I would consider a technicality: It says &#34;Good for $35 worth of hibachi dinner&#34; and since I&#39;d ordered sushi, she wouldn&#39;t accept it.  Not a great idea to upset new customers when you&#39;re first opening.  We paid our suddenly and unexpectedly large bill and left in a bit of a huff.

I considered getting our Groupon refunded after that initial experience, but we decided to give them another shot.  This time I made sure to check with the waiter IN ADVANCE to make sure our Groupon would be accepted.  We both ordered two protein hibachi dinners. His was steak and chicken, mine was scallops and calamari.  Our chef was a different guy this time and he had some pretty cool tricks that we hadn&#39;t seen before.  I was a big fan of my calamari steak and the scallops were pretty good too, through the portion was a little small for the price.

Overall, I think this place is a definite improvement over the last hibachi place and we&#39;ll likely go again sometime, but our experience on the first visit definitely tainted what would otherwise have been a solid four star dining experience."

This last time we had a really mediocre experience. The Ny Strip and Calamari was cooked to perfection, but almost everything else was bad. The fried rice was so overcooked and under seasoned that is was barely edible. The Noodles lacked any kind of flavor and were very sticky and cold. The Las Vegas sushi roll was poorly put together and was disproportionate with ingredients . We love Hibachi but will most likely have to stick with Benihana."

We arrived around 5pm and only one other family was there, the restaurant began to fill up closer to 6pm. Monkey Brain was a great appetizer and our hibachi steaks were cooked great. The fried rice was one of the best, my scallops didn&#39;t taste very fresh but with everything being so good it doesn&#39;t change my opinion much. Service was good, but of course it wasn&#39;t busy yet when we arrived. Will definitely try again as we were all happy with our meals."

While we waited for the rest of the party to get there, we sat at the bar and ordered drinks.

After we put I  our order, 2 cooks came out at the same time, which was perfect because we all for to eat at the same time. I ordered the Hibachi Tuna, it&#39;s was so delicious (seared) minus the teriyaki. I  also had the caterpillar roll and mochi dessert.

Tell your friends about this place, they&#39;ll rave about your knowledge of hidden gems. Thanks to our dear friend and fellow foodie for filling us in, we are simply wowed by the experience. Forget that we never wandered down the stairs or peeked past the rather unassuming signage-we&#39;re now in on the secret and this place is the real deal.

Flavorful food perfectly cooked and seasoned? Yes. Portion size on the mark? Yes. Reasonable pricing? Yep. Efficient, friendly service? Double check-EVERYONE exuded a welcoming presence. 

Two of us sharing, we finished one item and couldn&#39;t wait to move on to the next. Our meal consisted of a shumai appetizer (pork dumplings-oh.my.gawd), and a bento box (tempura, gyoza, teriyaki chicken, edamame, fried rice, salad, and miso soup). If these items are any indication, their sushi, shabu shabu, ramen, sukiyaki, and okonumiyaki must be out of this world!

The food alone is reason to frequent, but tatami rooms? Yup, four of them. Private event room? That too. Delivery? C&#39;mon, you&#39;ve got to be kidding yes to that, and catering too. Unreal? Unbelievable? This sort of simple, delightful, reverent experience at incredibly reasonable prices is, in my experience, rare. Exactly the reason I wrote this review. Setting amongst the big named restaurants that anchor the area, this downstairs establishment will earn your respect. 

Kudos! We can&#39;t wait to go back."

I had a great experience, where the owner, Kimi, personally greeted me and my party.  We were sat promptly in one of the tatami rooms.  After removing my shoes and getting situated, I was given a warm moist towel for my hands.  Attention to detail really impressed me.  
Shabu-Shabu.  that is all I can say.  What a fun way to enjoy a great meal at your table. Did i mention you get to cook it at your table?  I could go on and on.  
Skip the trendy Cherry Creek restaurants and hit this place.  Perfect date night or small gathering.  It was a true treat to find a place that still cares about customer service and that has the talent in the kitchen and sushi bar to back it up.  
Cheers to this place."

It&#39;s great for a nice quiet dinner or even for a group of friends since she they offer traditional tea rooms - nice and intimate.

I&#39;m addicted to the California roll here but she has a lot more to offer than just sushi. Very traditional Japanese cuisine.

Well you know what..? Sushi. That&#39;s a good excuse as any, right?! Here&#39;s my break down:

+ The prices are super reasonable for what you get. They have a few different options for lunch specials. I chose the Deluxe Bento Box ($16 featuring Teriyaki Chicken, Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Gyoza, Rice, Salad, and Miso) it was more than enough tasty food for me.
+ My server was very friendly and attentive.  
+ The Spicy California Roll was spot on! I&#39;ll be back to sample some of their other sushi offerings.
+ The restaurant was a little dark, but the decor was nice and modern. Totally what I expected for a Japanese restaurant. They even have smaller &#34;private&#34; rooms off the main dinning area that you could reserve for larger groups. Nice for when you want to get a group together.

Definitely going to be back when my next sushi craving strikes!"

For a $5 fee you can sit in one of the tea rooms on the floor, which was totally worth it. The sushi was all amazing, and the specialty drinks were really good. 

Service was friendly and pretty quick. And the prices weren&#39;t crazy. For as much sushi as we had, I would have expected to pay a lot more."

After hearing about this restaurant from some friends, I decided to make a reservation for it. After all, finding good shabu shabu in Colorado is next to impossible. Well, behold yelpers! This restaurant has brought successful shabu shabu to our beloved mile high!

When you first walk in you feel as though they brought a little of Japan to this place! The decorations, the ambiance, and the use of space all resembled a traditional Japanese restaurant. As we were being seated, I asked for something I saw in their photos, a tatami room! It&#39;s a small enclosed room where you sit down crisscross on the floor! Traditional indeed! This really brought some authenticity to the restaurant.

The shabu shabu and sukiyaki with wagyu beef was on point! Gotta know what you&#39;re doing as you boil your stuff so make sure you ask your server if you don&#39;t know how! It just melts in your mouth guys!

So where are we?
1 out of 1 star for ambience.
1 out of 1 star for cleanliness.
1 out of 1 star for customer service.
2 out of 2 stars for food.

It was bizarrely empty on a Saturday night and the service seemed rush. The gyoza was overly lemony and salty, and the spicy rolls were too spicy for this spicy lover. The rest of our sushi was bland and generic. The only great thing was the miso soup. You&#39;d be better off going to Hapa for a lively atmosphere and decent sushi selection.

That being said, I&#39;m not sure it does much justice to Japanese cuisine- especially having returned from Japan a month ago and missing the cuisine. Sukiyaki was the best of the dishes we had- definitely enough for two people and the quality of the meat was good (the non-&#34;kobe&#34; meat). Also tried the sushi which.. I hate to be so harsh.. was pretty awful. The majority of it was left on the plate- very fishy. Go to Sushi SaSa or Cherry Hills Sushi instead if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. 

Also the tatami rooms are fake! You don&#39;t get to suffer like in the normal rite of passage traditional seating, they have cut outs for your feet under the table! Silly i know, but just made it seem a little too Americanized for my taste."

They moved from Lakewood to cherry creek with a following. People are driving all they way over to eat here. And we are lucky enough to have them in our neighborhood. 

Food, conversation, staff and experience were all amazing! 

Since we were the only ones at the bar we just asked for whatever they wanted to make. And it was really good, and unique.

Our food was delicious and the atmosphere is great BUT they kind of screwed us on the prices. We were sitting in a booth but saw that they had cool tea rooms available-we asked if we could sit in one instead and the waitress was happy to move us-what she didn&#39;t tell us was that it was a $5 charge per person to sit there. We ordered a bottle of wine for $20 off of their drink menu the waitress came back a minute later and said they were out of that particular wine and that we had an outdated menu. She gave us a new drink menu where every single item was the same...but $6-8 more expensive. We ordered a house wine for $25--when the check came they charged us for a $29 bottle of wine. 

TLDR: good food, nice place, be wary of them having their hands in your pockets from the get go."

My wife got a fairly traditional bento box and enjoyed all of if. But the real star was the Sukiyaki (Japanese hot pot) that I got with thin-sliced Kobe beef. They bring out a fondue-style stove, a ton of vegetables, and the raw beef. You add in the veggies, let them cook a minute, and then start cooking the beef. It&#39;s so thin you just take a piece of raw beef, swish it around in the boiling water for a few seconds, and then eat it with some veggies. It was amazingly delicious and the serving size was very generous. My wife and I probably could have just shared it and an appetizer instead of getting two entrees.

We also bought a very nice bottle mild sake and enjoyed it."

If you are going for the first time, I highly suggest sitting in one of the Tatami rooms (take your shoes off).

A friendly tip: if you have trouble finding parking on the street, there is a parking lot right around the back of the restaurant where you can park for free :)

My wife and I started going there at their old (Lakewood) location. Once they moved, we continued to go, despite the longer commute. Their cuisine is some of the best in town, and it was well worth the drive.

The thing that continually astounded me was just how fresh their fish was, considering they&#39;re in a middle-of-the-country, landlocked location. Kimie (the owner) is from Japan, and so when they boast authentic cuisine, they mean it. Keep in mind, their cuisine isn&#39;t from the typical region we normally see here, so some flavors and dishes will be different than your typical Japanese restaurant. However, I found this to be incredibly enjoyable.

The menu has an incredible amount of variety. For lunch, I&#39;d frequently get their bento boxes, which are just divine. For dinner, we would mix it up from time to time, but our favorite (and our main draw) were their miso soup, the to-die-for gyoza, and of course their incredible sushi rolls. They have a lot of the classic rolls, but they have their own creations too (the Kobe An roll and the Ninja roll are both amazing, if you like spicy flavors).

My wife and I already miss Kobe An so much, now that we live in a different state. We frequently say that we should visit Denver just for this restaurant, and we&#39;re only half-joking. That&#39;s how good it is. Give it a shot; you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I had the shrimp tempura and it was fantastic. This is the best tempura I have ever had; perfectly cooked and hot from the fryer. The tempura comes with tempura vegetables too, so there is an ample amount of food. Even a vegetable hater will love the tempura vegetables. The miso soup is delightful and the salad with miso dressing was delicious.

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated; even the restrooms a worth a visit. The owner is a beautiful and gracious woman. She has had restaurants in Boulder and Lakewood. This Cherry Creek location is her most recent venture and it is worth a visit again and again."

He really liked the sauce that Kimmie recommended and helped him put together. Their gyoza was perfection! I got the yakisoba and it honestly was the best I have ever had.

I happened to walk past Kobe An with a sign for a $10 lunch special that included veggie tempura, miso soup, white or friend rice, california roll pieces, and some sushi.  That sounded like a deal so I went in!

I am allergic to shellfish and I noticed that one of the sushi pieces came with shrimp (the others were tuna and salmon).  I asked the water if I could exchange it for something else (assuming that they did not do substitutions or would charge me extras).  They happily obliged for another piece of fish at NO CHARGE!
